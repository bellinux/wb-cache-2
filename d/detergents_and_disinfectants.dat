Microbiological test (Delvotest SP - NT) and three rapid tests (Charm 3 MRL BL / TET 2, Charm ROSA MRL BL / TET and Penzym) were used in the study. Three concentrations (recommended by the manufacturer, 10 times lower and twice higher) of 36 <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> in raw milk were investigated. All methods did not detect concentrations of <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> of alkaline and acid origin 10 times lower than recommended by the manufacturer. 39 % of the investigated substances of alkaline origin were detected by Delvotest SP - NT and Penzym; Charm tests showed non-typical results only. Delvotest SP-NT did not detect substances of acid origin; Penzym detected 50 % of these substances, Charm tests showed only non-typical results. Delvotest SP - NT and Penzym appeared to be more sensitive to the substances used for teat hygiene and disinfection. The scope of rapid tests (receptor or enzymatic) does not cover the detection of detergent and disinfectant re- sidues in milk. However, according to the non-typical results of the test, it is possible to suspect the presence of these substances in milk.

After each cleaning stage, samples were taken from different materials and enumerated for total aerobic count (TAC) and Enterobacteriaceae (ENT). Soaking with detergent (Blast-Off, Biolink) caused significantly greater reductions of TAC and ENT on metal, and TAC on concrete, compared with control. Disinfection effect (Virkon S, DuPont) was not significantly associated with prior detergent treatment. Disinfection significantly reduced TAC and ENT on concrete and stock board but not on metal. Twenty-four hours after disinfection TAC and ENT on metal and stock board were significantly reduced, but no significant reductions occurred in the subsequent 96  hours.

40|$|Background: Patient {{soil and}} {{bacterial}} biofilm in patient-ready endoscope channels can adversely impact {{the efficacy of}} <b>detergent</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectant,</b> thereby increasing the risk of nosocomial infection. Biofilm bacteria are firmly attached {{to one another and}} to the substrate by exopolysaccharide, making them difficult to remove. We analyzed the effect of 20 wash/contamination cycles on biofilm formation. Materials: Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-covered endoscope tubing was soaked in water (control), an enzymatic cleaner, or a nonenzymatic cleaner (Matrix) for 10 minutes and decontaminated in a washer-disinfector machine. Media containing P aeruginosa was then recycled to simulate contamination in clinical practice. Results: SEM analysis showed that loosely attached biofilm was removed under the high flow rates in the washer-disinfector. The control tubing remained 100 % covered with biofilm, which became thicker with increased recontamination cycles. Washing in the enzymatic detergent retarded the redevelopment of biofilm. The nonenzymatic cleaner (Matrix) continued to remove more biofilm with an increasing number of wash/contamination cycles. At the 20 th cycle, 90 % of the tubing was biofilm-free. Conclusion: Washing endoscopes under high flow rates with some detergents removes established biofilm and retards biofilm generation, emphasizing the importance of cleaning before disinfection. Continued research into the physicochemical mechanisms of biofilm adherence and removal is needed to optimize detergents. 6 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Porcine circovirus type 2, {{a member}} of the Circoviridae family, is a small, icosahedral, non-enveloped, {{single-stranded}} circovirus DNA virus (size ~ 17  nm) (Tischer et al. 1982). The PCV 2 genome is dominated by two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 encodes the viral replication (Rep) protein, and ORF 2 codes the 233 - or 234 -amino acid capsid (Cap) protein. The Cap protein is a major immunogen of PCV 2. PCV 2 is the primary causative agent of a group of diseases called porcine circovirus disease (PCVD) in swine. The most relevant diseases of PCVD are post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), and reproductive failure. Of these, PMWS has a serious economic impact on the world swine industry (Harding et al. 1998; Chae 2005; Segalés et al. 2005). PMWS often occurs in 5 – 12  weeks weaned piglets. Symptoms include wasting, dyspnea, visibly enlarged lymph nodes, and jaundice (Ellis et al. 1998; Harding 1996). PCV 2 is a stable virus and has a strong tolerance for common <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants,</b> making environments contaminated with PCV 2 difficult to clean.|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{of resistance to}} Hg 2 + in 1980 to 1981 collections from Barnes Hospital, St. Louis, Mo., was only 2 % for Staphylococcus aureus and 9 % for Escherichia coli. The {{frequency of}} Hg 2 + resistance in E. coli isolates from Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, was 57 % during 1972 to 1977 and decreased to 29 % in 1979 to 1982; for S. aureus the frequency of Hg 2 + resistance dropped from 36 % in 1972 to 1977 to 10 % in 1979 to 1982. Frequencies of resistances to cadmium (S. aureus) and arsenic (S. aureus and E. coli) remained approximately constant during this time. The decrease in frequency of mercurial resistance is attributed to the termination {{of the use of}} organomercurials (largely phenylmercury and thimerosal) in hospital liquid <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants.</b> It is proposed that selection for mercurial resistance occurred within the hospital setting when there was widespread use of mercurials.

40|$|Background Despite recent {{attention}} to surface cleaning and hand hygiene programmes, multiresistant organisms (MROs) {{continue to be}} isolated from the hospital environment. Biofilms, consisting of bacteria embedded in exopolymeric substances (EPS) are difficult to remove due to their increased resistance to <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants,</b> and periodically release free-swimming planktonic bacteria back into the environment which may may act as an infection source. Aim To establish whether reservoirs of MROs exist in the environment as biofilms. Methods Following terminal cleaning, equipment and furnishings were removed aseptically from an intensive care unit (ICU) and subjected to culture and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were placed in 5 mL of tryptone soya broth, sonicated for 5 min before plate culture on horse blood agar, Brillance MRSA and Brilliance VRE agar plates. Samples for SEM were fixed in 3 % glutaraldehyde and hexamethyldisilizane (HMDS) prior to sputter-coating with gold and examination in an electron microscope. Findings Biofilm was demonstrated visually on the sterile supply bucket, the opaque plastic door, the venetian blind cord, and the sink rubber, whereas EPS alone was seen on the curtain. Viable bacteria were grown from three samples, including MRSA from the venetian blind cord and the curtain. Conclusion Biofilm containing MROs persist on clinical surfaces from an ICU despite terminal cleaning, suggesting that current cleaning practices are inadequate to control biofilm development. The presence of MROs being protected within these biofilms may be the mechanism by which MROs persist within the hospital environment. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{unwanted}} {{occurrence of}} biofilms in various industries requires critical remedial action {{in order to}} prevent their detrimental effects which potentially result in huge economic losses. Adequate monitoring of biofilms is a powerful tool to aid their thorough understanding and ultimate control. The Rotoscope is an instrument based on the principle of light absorption and reflection that was used in this study to monitor and study biofilms. Biofilm development of cocci and bacilli species was monitored using the Rotoscope and microscopy. Light reflectance decreased over time as the biofilm developed. Information on the different stages of biofilm development could also be deduced from light reflectance assays of the Rotoscope. Microscopy validated results which were obtained from light reflectance assays. Information on the morphology of the bacteria, depth of the biofilm as well as the different stages of biofilm development was deduced from EM and CLSM images. The Rotoscope was an easy, effective, on-line monitoring device for the development of biofilms. It was a lso showed to be useful in coll ecting informati on to help characterize bacteria species present within a biofilm The Rotoscope was integrated into a simulated soft drink (SO) production line to monitor biofouling and the efficacy of a clean-in-place (CIP) regime using electrochemically acti vated (ECA) water. During CIF the Catholyte and Anolyte (components of ECA) were effective as <b>detergent</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectant</b> respecti vely. This was indi cated by results obtained from microbial analysis of removable slides from the MPD, microscopic analysis, as well as pH, ORP and EC analysis. The absence of microbial growth and soil on microscope slides from the Rotoscope were a good indication of the high efficacy of Catholyte and Anolyte (components of ECA) as <b>detergent</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectant</b> respectively in a crp system. In addition, the re latively constant values reported for pH, ORP and EC before and aft er CIP suggests that the Catholyte and Anolyte were effective during CIF. The effect of Anolyte on trihalomethane (THM) formation was observed {{because of the presence of}} chl orine compounds. Low levels of THMs were obtained from CIP effluent which provided a good indicati on that Anolyte is an environmentally friendly alternative disinfectant compared to conventional disinfectants currently used in CIP. Increased pH and the presence of bromide resulted in an overall increase of THMs in systems using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) models (Glucose, maltose and phenol). There was however variation in the amount of THM produced using the three DOC models. The differences were attributed to the composition of organic matter in particular the aromacity and the nature and position of the functional groups of the model DOCs.

In Escherichia coli, the transcription of acrAB is upregulated under global stress conditions by proteins such as MarA, SoxS, and Rob. In the present study, two clinical isolates of E. cloacae, EcDC 64 (a multidrug-resistant strain overexpressing the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump) and Jc 194 (a strain with a basal AcrAB-TolC expression level), were used to determine whether similar global stress responses operate in E. cloacae and also to establish the molecular mechanisms underlying this response. A decrease in susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracy-cline, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol was observed in clinical isolate Jc 194 and, to a lesser extent in EcDC 64, in the presence of salicylate, decanoate, tetracycline, and paraquat. Increased expression of the acrAB promoter in the presence of the above-described conditions was observed by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-PCR, by using a reporter fusion protein (green fluorescent protein).

40|$|Microbes tend {{to attach}} to {{available}} surfaces and form biofilms readily, which is problematic in healthcare settings. Biofilms are traditionally associated with wet or damp surfaces such as indwelling medical devices and tubing on medical equipment. However, microbes can survive {{for extended periods}} in a desiccated state on dry hospital surfaces, and biofilms have recently been discovered on dry hospital surfaces. Microbes attached to surfaces and in biofilms are less susceptible to biocides, antibiotics and physical stress. Thus, surface attachment and/or biofilm formation may explain how vegetative bacteria can survive on surfaces for weeks to months (or more), interfere with attempts to recover microbes through environmental sampling, and provide a mixed bacterial population for the horizontal transfer of resistance genes.

Zygosaccharomyces bailii formed biofilm only in wine and Pichia guilliermondii and Lactobacillus hilgardii formed biofilms only in synthetic medium. In wine, D. bruxellensis presented the same biofilm population when grown in pure culture or in mixed culture with acetic acid bacteria. There was a 3 -log increase in biofilm formed by A. aceti in mixed culture with L. hilgardii. Alkaline chlorine-based disinfectant was the most effective in decontaminating spoilage yeast and bacteria both in planktonic and biofilm tests.

40|$|Hygiene {{standards}} in food processing Cue: Farmers are frequently told that {{to earn more}} money from their crops they must add value to them. So for farmers producing fruit or vegetable crops, what options are there for adding value? Some methods, such as grading the produce, require little or no equipment. Processing the crop, for example into a jam, juice or chutney, requires more investment, but can be an excellent business, particularly for women?s groups. However, a successful food processing operation needs to have very strict standards of hygiene and quality {{in order to make}} a consistently good product. These standards must apply not only to the quality of the fruit and vegetables themselves, but also the cleanliness of the building, equipment and staff who work there. In May 2005 a new food processing plant opened in Banjulunding, a small town close to the Gambian capital Banjul. The plant, which produces a wide range of products including watermelon and mango juices, and orange and lemon squash, is staffed by women from the town and the surrounding villages. The women are not only staff, but also trainees, and are taught the skills needed for the various food processing operations. To find out more about how high standards are maintained, Ismaila Senghore visited the plant and spoke to Mr Sidi Fofana, co-ordinator and trainer of the food processing operation. IN:		?Whatever you process if ?? OUT:		??food security is very very important. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sidi Fofana of the horticultural processing plant in Banjulunding, The Gambia. Transcript Fofana	Whatever you process if you do not put food hygiene and sanitation as your priority number one, your end product will be poor. So when we want to produce or process any raw material, we have to look at the quality first. The maturity, the ripeness and it is free of chemicals also and also damage. So that is why when we received our raw material we have to check the quality first, to check whether it meets our standard. Then we wash the fruits or vegetables thoroughly with clean water so that we minimise the chemical residue on the produce, at the same time to reduce the microbial load. Studio	But for a food processing operation to produce a safe, clean product, free from harmful bacteria or microbes, it is important not only to select and wash the raw materials. The building and equipment must be clean, and staff must also maintain high levels of hygiene. Fofana	Every day when the trainees come they start cleaning first before processing. So we try to clean all the places, our windows even the store floors, everywhere. So we have to make sure that we put the hygiene in a place number one before we start any processing. That is why you see our floor is very clean even you cannot see any dust here on the floor. And also our utensils, we wash them thoroughly because we use the <b>detergent</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectant</b> here. Then we have the machines here which we wash them; every day prior to processing we have to clean them, wash them thoroughly using the <b>detergent</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectant.</b> <b>And</b> also all the trainees also are supplied with gloves, uniform and mask also during the processing. Before they start processing they have to wash their hands thoroughly with clean water and soap. Senghore	In other words you ensure there is bodily hygiene because if you are handling food you have to be clean yourself as well as the utensils and the environment. Fofana	Yes because that is personal hygiene. Even if anybody gets an injury so she will not be allowed to participate in processing on that day until she recovers, because we do not want cross-contamination from the food handler to our product. Studio	Another important rule is that any water used in the processing ? for example in the making of juice ? should be boiled first to kill harmful bacteria, also known as pathogenic micro-organisms. Fofana	We have a water supply here but the water we use in food processing also here we boil it thoroughly to destroy pathogenic micro-organisms there because we do not use cold water or we do not use that water directly to our processing plant. We just have to make sure to boil them above even 100 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes to destroy pathogenic micro-organisms. And also pasteurisation: during the processing we pasteurise our juice so that they will be at least free of pathogenic micro-organisms. Senghore	Yes and your bottles are also kept clean I am sure. As I see you have them here nicely labeled with different names and pictures of the contents. Fofana	Yes because the packaging material also we normally wash them thoroughly. We have a bottle washing machine over there, whereby we wash our bottles thoroughly and after washing them we put them in the oven, we leave them for almost half an hour or even more then that, just to heat them a little bit so that is to minimise microbial load there before we fill them with any products. But the lids, we check them thoroughly, to make sure that the lids are not dirty. So we have to make sure. And even the glass bottles you have to check that they are free of cracks or other things, because glass bottles normally they are recycled you can use them at anytime. But the lids you have to look at them critically. This is very very important for us. We do put emphasis on that. Senghore	Now what is the feedback that you get from them and yourself I am sure you must have tasted some of your juice? Fofana	Yes they are very very delicious. I feel before you leave you will taste some of the product here because they are very delicious. So people are very very interested because this is a model in the country. This type of plant will minimise the post-harvest losses in our country. Right now when you go out you see the watermelon abundant and the same thing likewise during the mango season, peak season you see the fruits wasting in the street, and even the producers when they go to the market they sell them at the lowest, at the cheapest price. But when we have this type of plant at least it will minimise post-harvest losses. So producers will bring their raw material here and we buy it from them, we process into different products and then at the end when they are not available then people consume them. Because food security is very very important. End of track.

40|$|Abstract: The {{environment}} {{has been shown}} to be a source of pathogens causing infections in hospitalised patients. Incorporation of pathogens into biofilms, contaminating dry hospital surfaces, prolongs their survival and renders them tolerant to normal hospital cleaning and disinfection procedures. Currently there is no standard method for testing efficacy of <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> against biofilm formed on dry surfaces. Aim: The aim of this study was to develop a reproducible method of producing Staphylococcus aureus biofilm with properties similar to those of biofilm obtained from dry hospital clinical surfaces, for use in efficacy testing of decontamination products. The properties (composition, architecture) of model biofilm and biofilm obtained from clinical dry surfaces within an intensive care unit were compared. Methods: The CDC Biofilm Reactor was adapted to create a dry surface biofilm model. S. aureus ATCC 25923 was grown on polycarbonate coupons. Alternating cycles of dehydration and hydration in tryptone soy broth (TSB) were performed over 12 days. Number of biofilm bacteria attached to individual coupons was determined by plate culture and the coefficient of variation (CV%) calculated. The DNA, glycoconjugates and protein content of the biofilm were determined by analysing biofilm stained with SYTO 60, Alexa- 488 -labelled Aleuria aurantia lectin and SyproOrange respectively using Image J and Imaris software. Biofilm architecture was analysed using live/dead staining and confocal microscopy (CM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Model biofilm was compared to naturally formed biofilm containing S. aureus on dry clinical surfaces. Results: The CDC Biofilm reactor reproducibly formed a multi-layered, biofilm containing about 10 ⁷ CFU/coupon embedded in thick extracellular polymeric substances. Within run CV was 9. 5 % and the between run CV was 10. 1 %. Protein was the principal component of both the in vitro model biofilm and the biofilms found on clinical surfaces. Continued dehydration and ageing of the model biofilm for 30 days increased the % of protein, marginally decreased gylcoconjugate % but reduced extracellular DNA by 2 / 3. The surface of both model and clinical biofilms was rough reflecting the heterogeneous nature of biofilm formation. The average maximum thickness was 30. 74 ± 2. 1 μm for the in vitro biofilm model and between 24 and 47 μm for the clinical biofilms examined. Conclusion: The laboratory developed biofilm was similar to clinical biofilms in architecture and composition. We propose that this method is suitable for evaluating the efficacy of surface cleaners and disinfectants in removing biofilm formed on dry clinical surfaces as both within run and between run variation was low, and the required equipment is easy to use, cheap and readily available. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{membrane}} permeability {{is a key}} step {{in regulating}} the intracellular concentration of antibiotics. Efflux pumps confer innate resistance {{to a wide range}} of toxic compounds such as antibiotics, dyes, <b>detergents,</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> in members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is involved in multidrug resistance in Enterobacter cloacae. However, the underlying mechanism that regulates the system in this microorganism remains unknown. In Escherichia coli, the transcription of acrAB is upregulated under global stress conditions by proteins such as MarA, SoxS, and Rob. In the present study, two clinical isolates of E. cloacae, EcDC 64 (a multidrug-resistant strain overexpressing the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump) and Jc 194 (a strain with a basal AcrAB-TolC expression level), were used to determine whether similar global stress responses operate in E. cloacae and also to establish the molecular mechanisms underlying this response. A decrease in susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol was observed in clinical isolate Jc 194 and, to a lesser extent in EcDC 64, in the presence of salicylate, decanoate, tetracycline, and paraquat. Increased expression of the acrAB promoter in the presence of the above-described conditions was observed by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-PCR, by using a reporter fusion protein (green fluorescent protein). The expression level of the AcrAB promoter decreased in E. cloacae EcDC 64 derivates deficient in SoxS, RobA, and RamA. Accordingly, the expression level of the AcrAB promoter was higher in E. cloacae Jc 194 strains overproducing SoxS, RobA, and RamA. Overall, the data showed that SoxS, RobA, and RamA regulators were associated with the upregulation of acrAB, thus conferring antimicrobial resistance as well as a stress response in E. cloacae. In summary, the regulatory proteins SoxS, RobA, and RamA were cloned and sequenced for the first time in this species. The involvement of these proteins in conferring antimicrobial resistance through upregulation of acrAB was demonstrated in E. cloacae. Copyright Â© 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

40|$|Increasing water {{shortage}} hast to be anticipated worldwide. Therefore since {{many years now}} so called "Alternative Sanitation Systems", which bases on {{the aims of the}} recycling management, are examined. Main features of these approaches are the separation of domestic waste water flows according to their characteristics into the grey water, the brown water or the yellow water fraction. Thus, the partial flows can be treated appropriately and the reuse of nutrients contained in the partial flows (e. g. nitrogen, phosphors or potassium) and the water itself is possible. In consideration with these aspects, within the research project KOMPLETT (2005 - 2009) purification schemes for separated grey and black water (brown and yellow water) were carried out and tested at different scales. Besides biological treatment using membrane bioreactor technology (MBR) the developed process comprises components for physical-chemical degradation and removal of organic compounds, disinfection and elimination of trace elements. The results of the investigations show, that the developed process scheme produces very high effluent qualities for purified grey and black water. In particular for grey water the produced water quality meets highest requirements for utilization, e. g. drinking water standards. Within the blackwater process the purified water can be reused for toilet flushing without any restriction. Relevant hygienic-microbiological organisms, as well as organic compounds were eliminated certainly in the black water treatment process. E. g. E. coli and faecal streptococcus were not detectable in 100 mL after the MBR. Hence, with the selected process technology domestic water cycle for separated grey and blackwater can be closed. The KOMPLETT water recycling technology is designed as a decentralized system. Therefore stable system operation is of highest importance. In particular as the purification scheme bases on biological treatment process. Therefore a special feature of the project was the development and integration of new and innovative sanitary products, involving antimicrobial surfaces and water saving flushing toilets (3. 5 L per flush) in order to reduce impacts of <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> on the biological treatment. Within the project antimicrobial surfaces based on silver ions as well as self-purifying surfaces using the photo-catalytic effect of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) were developed and tested in laboratory {{as well as in the}} final pilot phase. There the treatment technology and sanitary products were coupled and water cycles were closed. Furthermore in this part of the project the consumers' acceptance among the new sanitary products using nanotechnology was ascertained. It could be shown, that the examined sliver-doped and photo-catalytic surfaces can inhibit or rather minimize microbiological growth. In comparison to the undoped surfaces a reduction of > 1 to 3 log 10 levels according to the selected test organisms E. coli and S. aureus were detected. Accordingly, contaminations of black water by microorganisms could be reduced significantly at source. As a consequence the application of disinfectant and detergents could be minimized. Therefore, influences on biological treatment process through detergents used for toilet cleaning are reduced to a necessary minimum and no operational problems encountered throughout the study...|$|E

Es por ello que se realizó un estudio in vitro de la actividad germicida de un producto compuesto por cloruro de alquildimetil benzilamonio, glutaraldehído, glioxal, formaldehído, isopropanol y excipientes, a distintas concentraciones y tiempos, incluidos los recomendados por el fabricante. Se determinó la cinética de muerte de los microorganismos, calculando el % de eficiencia del desinfectante, la velocidad específica de muerte, el tiempo de reducción decimal y el coeficiente de dilución. Las pruebas se realizaron frente a: Escherichia coli salvaje, Staphylococcus aureus salvaje, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 y Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. La eficiencia germicida in vitro del desinfectante en el tiempo (5 minutos) y rango de concentración recomendado por el fabricante (0, 25 % – 0, 5 %) fue para Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 del 99, 999 % a la concentración de 0, 25 %, mientras que para Escherichia coli salvaje, Staphylococcus aureus salvaje y Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 se logró la misma eficiencia a la concentración de 0, 5 %, por lo que, según los resultados obtenidos cumple el Test de Chambers en cuanto a la eficiencia esperada para un buen desinfectante, pero no cumple con los 30 segundos propuestos, ya que se obtiene en tiempos mayores de acción. Los valores de k (velocidad específica de muerte), permiten concluir que Staphylococcus aureus salvaje resultó ser más resistente que el resto de los microorganismos, luego sigue Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli salvaje y finalmente Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, quien resultó tener menor resistencia a la acción germicida del desinfectanteThere {{is a great}} offer of <b>detergent</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectant</b> products, that applied under appropriate sanitization programs, would help to prevent and reduce the microbiological contamination from the food industry. However, in the most of cases an experimental and appropriate validation {{of the effect of}} the product, has not been carried out. The present in vitro study was developed {{in order to determine the}} germicidal activity of a disinfectant containing alquildimetyl benzylamonium chloride, glutaraldehyde, glioxal, formaldehyde, isopropanol and exicipients, assayed at different concentrations and times, included those recommended by the manufacturer. The kinetics of death of the microorganisms, the % of efficiency of the disinfectant, the specific death rate, the time of decimal reduction and the dilution coefficient were determined. The tests were carried out against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus wild strains, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213. The germicidal efficiency in vitro of the disinfectant at the time (5 minutes) and concentration range recommended by manufacturer (0, 25 % - 0, 5 %) was 99, 999 % for Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, specifically at a concentration of 0, 25 %. For Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus wild strains and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 the same 99, 999 % of efficiency was achieved when using the product at 0, 5 %. According to the obtained results, the Chambers test is fulfilled from point of view of the obtained destruction %. Nevertheless, it does not fulfill the 30 seconds proposed, since the efficacy is obtained at other times beyond the 30 seconds. The values of k (specific death rate), allow to conclude that the wild strain of Staphylococcus aureus was more resistant than the other microorganisms. In decreasing order, the resistance of the other microorganisms to the studied disinfectant was Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli wild type and finally Escherichia coli ATCC 2592...|$|R

40|$|Goat milk is {{primarily}} {{destined for the}} production of fermented products, in particular cheese. Therefore, the control of antibiotic residues in milk is of great importance, since these could have negative repercussions on technological properties of the milk {{as well as on the}} health of consumers. In milk quality control programs, microbial inhibitor tests are widely applied to detect antibiotics during the screening stage. However, tests are non-specific and may be affected by substances other than antimicrobials which could inhibit the growth of the test micro-organism, causing false positive results. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the interference, related to the presence of different contaminants in goat milk, on the response of microbial inhibitor tests commonly used in Spain to detect antibiotics (BRT MRL, Delvotest SP-NT MCS and Eclipse 100 tests). The influence of the physicochemical characteristics of goat milk on the false positive outcomes in microbial screening tests was also investigated. The suitability of microbial inhibitor tests for screening antibiotics in colostrum secretions was studied by analysing antibiotic-free colostrum and milk samples from forty-three Murciano-Granadina goats, collected every 12 hours during the first week post-partum. Microbial inhibitor tests were not suitable for the analysis of goat colostrum because they presented a high percentage of doubtful and positive results (up 37. 2 % in the 36 hours after partum). To evaluate the effect of caprine colostrum on the microbial test response, antimicrobial-free goat milk spiked with different concentrations of colostrum was analysed to calculate the inhibitory concentrations producing 5 % of positive results. The highest interferences were obtained for the addition of colostrum from 12 to 24 hours post-partum and the colostrum concentrations producing 5 % positive results were between 5. 1 and 34. 6 %. The BRT MRL was the test the most affected. In another study, the interference of <b>detergents</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> used for the cleaning of milking equipment and milk storage tanks of dairy farms was investigated. Antimicrobial-free goat milk was spiked with eight concentrations of different cleaning products (5 acid, 5 alkaline, 5 domestic washing-up liquids, and 1 disinfectant) and analysed using microbial screening tests. The presence of acid detergent and disinfectant based on sodium hypochlorite in goat milk did not affect the microbial test response. However, alkaline detergents at concentrations ≥ 1 ml/l could lead to false positive results in microbial inhibitor tests (up to 16. 7 %) and from 4 ml/l on 100 % positive results were obtained. Regarding the products used for home use, and those used on farms and small size dairies, washing-up liquid containing sodium laureth sulphate and ethanol had the greatest effects on microbial inhibitor tests, even starting from a relatively low concentration (1 ml/l). On the other hand, the presence of a relatively low concentration of detergents in goat milk (0. 5 ml/l) slightly modified the detection capability of the microbial inhibitor tests for amoxicillin, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, and cloxacillin, although the detection of these drugs at MRL (safe level) was not compromised. Antiparasitic agent residues in goat milk could be another possible cause of false positive results in microbial screening tests. An in vitro study to evaluate the effect of seven parasiticides commonly used in dairy goats was carried out. Further two studies, where albendazole and ivermectin were applied to two groups of dairy goats in lactation were performed. It should be noted that the parasiticide ivermectin is banned for the treatment of animals producing milk for human consumption, although its inclusion in this study was considered interesting to understand the potential effect of their residues in milk, in the event the practice was performed illegally. In the in vitro study, raw antibiotic-free milk from goats was spiked individually with eight different concentrations of albendazole, closantel, diclazuril, febendazole, levamisole, diazinon, and ivermectin. The microbial inhibitor test results showed a great variability according to the test and the drug under study. Of the tests considered, the BRT MRL test was the most sensitive to antiparasitic agents, with the lowest concentrations of antiparasitic agent causing 5, 10, and 50 % of positive results. Generally, closantel and diazinon were the antiparasitic agents that produced higher interferences in all tests, since low concentrations already resulted in positive results, while only higher concentrations of diclazuril and ivermectin showed an inhibitory effect. To evaluate the effect of albendazole residues on the microbial inhibitor test response, eighteen healthy Murciano-Granadina goats in mid-lactation were treated with a single oral administration of the commercially available albendazole registered for dairy sheep (7. 5 mg/kg b. w. of active compound) with a withdrawal period of 4 days for milk production in ovine. Albendazole and its metabolite residues in goat milk after under cascade treatment were not detected above MRL from the third day post-administration. However, a high occurrence of non-compliant results was obtained for the BRT MRL test during the first six days after treatment, suggesting that factors related to the albendazole application other than the drug concentration are able to affect the microbial inhibitor test response in some cases. Regarding the ivermectin study, twenty-eight Murciano-Granadina goats infested with Sarcoptes scabiei var. caprae were treated with a subcutaneous injection of ivermectin (200 μg/kg b. w.), with a second dose applied seven days after the first treatment. Drug residues in goat milk were recorded during the first fifteen days of the experiment with concentrations ranging from 8. 13 to 24. 25 ng/ml. In addition, all the microbial screening tests seem to be affected by the ivermectin treatment, with BRT MRL the most affected (20 %) compared with Delvotest SP-NT MCS and Eclipse 100 (6. 6 and 5. 7 %, respectively). These positive results cannot be associated with the ivermectin concentration in goat milk, as the concentrations measured were lower than the inhibitory concentrations as reported in a previous in vitro study for these microbial tests. Thus, as suggested by some authors, interferences could be related to changes or alterations caused by the application of the parasiticide agent or by the parasitic disease itself, which could affect the immune response of the animals favouring the presence of inhibitory substances in milk. The study of the effect of the goat milk composition on the specificity (rate of false positive results) of microbial inhibitor tests for screening antibiotics was also considered. Thus, individual goat milk samples (n= 200) were analysed by microbial inhibitor tests using both visual and instrumental classification of the test results. The highest specificity values were obtained for the instrumental interpretation of the test results (94 - 99 % vs 90 - 96 %) due to the occurrence of samples with intermediate colorations (green-yellow, yellow-blue) making the visual classification more difficult and subjective. A relation was found between positive results in BRT MRL and Eclipse 100 tests and an elevated fat content in the goat milk. Positive outcomes in Eclipse 100 were associated with the butyric acid concentration in the milk. Further, the Delvotest SP-NT MCS test response was affected by elevated pH values, high lactoferrrin and myristoleic acid concentrations in the goat milk. This percentage of positive results could be minimized by a pre-treatment prior to microbial inhibitor test analysis, such as fat removal by centrifugation (3, 100 g for 10 min at 4 ºC) and/or heating (80 ºC for 10 min). Undoubtedly, improvements on the specificity of the microbial inhibitor tests for screening antibiotics in goat milk are desirable to avoid the destruction of milk compliant for human due to the occurrence of false positive results. The related financial losses affect farmers and dairies. However, it should be noted that the presence of contaminants in goat milk could be avoided by applying good farming practices designed to ensure that milk is obtained from healthy animals under proper hygienic conditions so ensuring the food safety of goat milk and related dairy products.
