50|$|In May 2002, Mast began feeling ill suddenly. He {{had lost}} weight {{and was forced}} to miss races to take medical tests {{to find out what was}} wrong. It turned out that he had {{suffered}} carbon monoxide poisoning and Mast was forced to retire. He officially retired on January 22, 2003 at age 45. After his retirement, he spoke with NASCAR president Mike Helton about having teams redesign their air intake systems to get less exhaust fumes into drivers' helmets. When NASCAR completely redesigned its race vehicle with the Car of Tomorrow, it changed the <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit</b> location to be away from the driver and it cited carbon monoxide poisoning cases like Mast's as a reason for the change.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} a {{reliable}} and standard PM (Particulate Matter) measurement method for aircraft engines. Due to safety and practicability of such measurements, a distance is required for the transportation of the exhaust samples from the aircraft engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit</b> to particle measurement instruments. The particle line loss during the transportation is therefore a critical issue for the accurate and reliable determination of particle emissions from aircraft engines. The work in this paper investigated the particle penetration/loss along a 25 meters ARP proposed particle sample transfer line by measuring the particle emissions from an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU) at idle and full power. Two SMPS instruments were used to simultaneously measure exhaust particle size distributions at the entrance and exit of the 25 m transfer line. A catalytic stripper was used to remove volatile particles so that non-volatile particles can be measured. The particle penetration factors for the 25 m transfer line were found to be 0. 6 âˆ¼ 0. 7 in general, excluding particles smaller than 10 nm. For the particles smaller than 10 nm, particle penetrations were very poor and about 70 â€“ 100 % of parcel losses were observed. The volatile factions were roughly 20 âˆ¼ 30 % of the total concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Methods are {{presented}} for the identification, viz., relative magnitude and spatial origin, of broadband and tonal noise sources within aeroengines. The methods require dynamic pressure measurements from sensors {{located within the}} engine. These techniques {{can be used to}} assess the contribution of internal noise sources to sound radiated from an aeroengine exhaust, for example, to the far field. Three coherence based techniques are evaluated: the coherent output power, the signal enhancement technique and a five sensor partial coherence method. The techniques are applied to data generated by a small scale experimental rig within an EU FP 7 programme ? TEENI. The experimental test rig design simulates the most relevant acoustic features of the downstream part of a turbo-shaft engine, i. e. the combustion noise source, the turbine stages and the relevant propagation processes to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit.</b> The application of these techniques to turbo-shaft engines is of particular interest where corenoise is a far more significant contributor to far field sound than jet noise. Results show how broadband noise from a rotor/stator stage, broadband noise from a single loudspeaker (simulating the combustor) and a tone from the rotor/stator stage can all be decomposed from measurements and how these contributions can be localised. In addition, the five sensor method is significantly enhanced to include acoustic modal decomposition. This allows the contribution of sources to individual radial modes to be measured and the source location identified. Specific radial modes were generated and measured with upstream loudspeaker and downstream microphone arrays respectively...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{shielding}} benefits {{associated with}} an advanced unconventional subsonic transport concept, the Blended-Wing-Body, were studied using a 4 - percent scale, 3 -engine nacelle model. The {{study was conducted in}} the Anechoic Noise Research Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. A high- frequency, wideband point source was placed inside the nacelles of the center engine and one of the side engines in order to simulate broadband engine noise. The sound field of the model was measured with a rotating microphone array that was moved to various stations along the model axis and with a fixed array of microphones that was erected behind the model. Ten rotating microphones were traversed a total of 22 degrees in 2 -degree increments. Seven fixed microphones covered an arc that extended from a point in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit</b> plane of the center engine (and directly below its centerline) to a point 30 degrees above the jet centerline. While no attempt was made to simulate the noise emission characteristics of an aircraft engine, the model source was intended to radiate sound in a frequency range encompassing 1, 2, and 3 times the blade passage of a typical full-scale engine. In this study, the Blended-Wing-Body model was found to provide significant shielding of inlet noise. In particular, noise radiated downward into the forward sector was reduced by 20 to 25 dB overall in the full-scale frequencies from 2000 to 4000 Hz, decreasing to 10 dB or less at the lower frequencies. Also, it was observed that noise associated with the exhaust radiates into the sector directly below the model downstream to reduce shielding efficiency...|$|E

50|$|Several {{versions}} of the design exist, differentiated by their shapes. In the toroidal aerospike the spike is bowl-shaped with the <b>exhaust</b> <b>exiting</b> in a ring around the outer rim.

40|$|Assessment of the {{environmental}} impact of aircraft emissions is required by planners and policy makers. Seveal areas of concern are: 1. exposure of airport workers and urban residents to toxic chemicals emitted when the engines operate at low power (idle and taxi) on the ground; 2. contributions to urban photochemical air pollution of aircraft volatile organic and nitrogen oxides emissions from operations around airports; and 3. emissions of nitrogen oxides and particles during high-altitude operation. The environmental impact of chemicals emitted from jet aircraft turbine engines has not been firmly established due to lack of data regarding emission rates and identities of the compounds emitted. This paper describes an experimental study of two different aircraft turbine engines designed to determine detailed organic emissions, as well as emissions of inorganic gases. Emissions were measured at several engine power settings. Measurements were made of detailed organic composition from C 1 through C 17, CO, CO 2, NO, NO x, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Measurements were made using a multi-port sampling pro be positioned directly behind the engine in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit</b> plane. The emission measurements have been used to determine the organic distribution by carbon number and the distribution by compound class at each engine power level. The sum of the organic species was compared with an independent measurement of total organic carbon to assess the carbon mass balance. A portion of the exhaust was captured and irradiated in outdoor smog chambers to assess the photochemical reactivity of the emissions with respect to ozone formation. The reactivity of emissions from the two engines was apportioned by chemical compound class...|$|E
40|$|The {{pollutant}} dispersion behavior from the vehicular exhaust plume {{has a direct}} impact on human health, particularly to the drivers, bicyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians, people working nearby and vehicle passengers. A two-dimensional {{pollutant dispersion}} numerical model was developed based on the joint-scalar probability density function (PDF) approach coupled with a k-Îµ turbulence model to simulate the initial dispersion process of nitrogen oxides, temperature and flow velocity distributions from a vehicular exhaust plume. A Monte Carlo algorithm was used to solve the PDF transport equations in order to obtain the dispersion distribution of nitrogen oxides concentration. The model was then validated by a series of sensitivity experimental studies in order to assess the effects of vehicular exhaust tailpipe velocities, wind speeds and chemistry on the initial dispersion of NO and NO 2 mass concentrations from the vehicular exhaust plume. The results show that the mass concentrations of nitrogen oxides decrease along the centerline of the vehicular exhaust plume in the downstream distance. The dispersion process can be enhanced when the vehicular exhaust tailpipe velocity is much larger than the wind speed. The oxidation reaction of NO plays an important role when the wind speed is large and the vehicular <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit</b> velocity is small, which leads to chemical reduction of NO, and the formation and accumulation of NO 2 in the exhaust plume. It is also found that the effect of vehicular exhaust-induced turbulence {{in the vicinity of the}} exhaust tailpipe exit is more dominant than the effect of wind turbulence, while the wind turbulence gradually shows a significant role for the dispersion of nitrogen oxides along with the development of exhaust plume. The range of dispersion of nitrogen oxides in the radial direction is increased along with the development of vehicular exhaust plume.

40|$|The {{pollutant}} dispersion process from the vehicular exhaust plume {{has a direct}} impact on human health, particularly on vehicle drivers and passengers, bicyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians and people working nearby. A three-dimensional vehicular {{pollutant dispersion}} numerical model was developed based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a k-Îµ turbulence model to simulate the initial pollutant dispersion process of carbon monoxide, CO, from a vehicular exhaust plume in the real atmospheric environment. Since the ambient wind direction and velocity are stochastic and uncontrollable in the real atmospheric environment, a wind-direction-frequency- weighted (WDFW) approach was used to obtain the real pollutant concentration dispersion along with the development of the vehicular exhaust plume. Within the specified sampling period, the ambient windflow conditions are transformed into the corresponding frequencies of wind directions and averaged magnitudes of wind velocities from directions N, E, S or W. Good agreement between the calculated and measured data for two diesel-fuelled vehicles indicates that with the WDFW approach the initial dispersion of pollutant concentration from a vehicular exhaust plume in the real atmospheric environment can be truly reflected. The present study shows that the dispersion process in the near region for the relative concentration of CO, from RC= 0. 1 (or 10 %) to 1 (or 100 %), is less influenced by the ambient wind velocity than by the vehicular exhaust velocity, but it is vice versa in the far region from RC= 0 (or 0 %) to 0. 1 (or 10 %). It implies that the effect of vehicular <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit</b> velocity on the dispersion process is more pronounced than that of ambient wind velocity at the vicinity of the exhaust tailpipe exit, while the effect of ambient wind velocity gradually shows a significant role for the dispersion process along with the development of a vehicular exhaust plume.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{model of}} an exhaust plume was {{developed}} and programmed on a digital computer. The purpose of the model was to predict the concentration and size distribution of ice particles produced from automobile exhaust during arctic conditions. The model accounted for the nucleation, growth, and freezing of the condensed water droplets within the exhaust plume. Modes of nucleation included 1) self nucleation, 2) nucleation by soluble particles, and 3) nucleation by insoluble particles. Conditions defining the base case typified a late model automobile, burning leaded gasoline, which was moving slowly or idling during an ice fog episode in an arctic city. Computed ice particle size distributions and ice particle concentrations agreed with measurements obtained by various researchers during ice fog episodes in the urban areas of Fairbanks, Alaska. Other cases were computed where {{one or more of}} the parameters effecting the exhaust plume were varied from their base case values. The results of these computations were then compared with the results from the base case. From these comparisons, conclusions were reached as to how one might vary the parameters effecting the exhaust plume in order to reduce the number and/or increase the size of the ice particles produced. The directions in which to vary the parameters from their base case values, in order to reduce the number and/or increase the size of the ice particles, are noted below. I) Increase the <b>exhaust</b> <b>exit</b> temperature 2) Increase the ambient air temperature 3) Decrease the water vapor content of the exhaust gas 4) Decrease the exit velocity of the exhaust gas 5) Increase the diameter of the exhaust pipe outlet 6) Decrease the concentration of soluble and insoluble particles in the exhaust gas. It was noted that, due to its generality, the model which was developed in this thesis may be used to predict the droplet and/or particle size distribution and concentration in a wide variety of plumes. It was also determined that the condensing vapor in the plume of concern need not be aqueous...|$|E

The side of a passenger car on which the <b>exhaust</b> <b>exits</b> beneath the rear bumper usually indicates the market for which the vehicle was designed, i.e. Japanese (and some older British) vehicles have exhausts on the right so they are furthest from the curb in countries which drive on the left, while European vehicles have exhausts on the left.|$|R
