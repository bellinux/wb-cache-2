Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter's refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled. On 15 January 1941, Gandhi had stated: Some say Pandit Nehru and I were estranged. It will require much more than {{difference}} of opinion to estrange us. We had differences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal will be my successor.Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had {{no alternative but to}} join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from this—his ninth and last detention—only on 15 June 1945.|$|E

Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step.

Moreover, the working set node number of IGA-BACA is smaller than that of GA in the same evolution generation condition. We also can see that along with the evolution generation increase, the network coverage rate is gradually approaching the optimal solution; moreover, the working set sensor node number is gradually reduced, this will reduce energy loss of a wireless sensor network and prolong <b>the</b> network lifetime. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> CPU <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> can see <b>the</b> IGA-BACA algorithm to optimize the speed faster than the GA algorithm.|$|R

40|$|Field Emission Microscopy (FEM) {{has been}} proven to be an {{efficient}} technique to observe catalytic reactions at the nanoscale. The surface dynamics can be monitored in real <b>time,</b> via <b>the</b> brightness signal which reflects the local surface composition. Using this technique, the catalyticreduction of NO 2 is investigated on a single platinum catalytic grain conditioned as a tip. Selfsustained periodic oscillations of water production are observed and characterized by means of correlation analyses [3] and attractor reconstruction <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> series. A transition to more complex oscillations is observed and characterized by the recurrence of a double peak in the brightness signal. Analyzing the reconstructed attractor, and extracting Poincaré and next maximum maps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> series, <b>we</b> show that the emergence of this second peak {{is due to a}} transition ofthe system from mono to bimodal periodic oscillations. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
