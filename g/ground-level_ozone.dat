Sustainable forest management in Bavaria aims to significantly increase the proportion of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) because of its broad ecological amplitude.

25|$|One {{possible}} {{environmental factor}} in the food price crisis is rising background levels of <b>ground-level</b> tropospheric <b>ozone</b> in the atmosphere. Plants {{have been shown to}} have a high sensitivity to ozone levels, and lower yields of important food crops, such as wheat and soybeans, may have been a result of elevated ozone levels. Ozone levels in the Yangtze Delta were studied for their effect on oilseed rape, a member of the cabbage family that produces one-third of the vegetable oil used in China. Plants grown in chambers that controlled ozone levels exhibited a 10–20 percent reduction in size and weight (biomass) when exposed to elevated ozone levels. Production of seeds and oil was also reduced. The Chinese authors of this study also reported that rice grown in chambers that controlled ozone levels exhibited a 14 to 20 percent reduction in biomass yield when exposed to ozone levels over 25 times higher than was normal for the region.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and modeling study {{was carried out}} to assess the <b>ground-level</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> impacts of representative pesticide-related VOCs. Environmental chamber experiments were carried out to develop and evaluate mechanisms for methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), S-ethyl N,N-di-npropyl thiocarbamate (EPTC), 1 - 3 -dichloropropenes, kerosene, and carbon disulfide. The first four are important compounds in the California pesticide emissions inventory where ozone impact data are not available, and carbon disulfide is a known pesticide degradation product. In addition, results of previous experiments on the pesticide chloropicrin were used to evaluate an updated mechanism for this compound. Chamber data were also used to derive rate constants for the reactions of OH radials with the MITC and EPTC, with the results indicating rate constants of 1. 72 x 10 - 12 and 2. 21 x 10 - 11 cm 3 molec- 1 s- 1, respectively, which are both somewhat different from previously measured values. The UCR EPA environmental chamber was employed, and most experiments were “incremental reactivity ” experiments to determine effects of adding the test compounds to experiments simulating representative ambient chemical conditions.

40|$|<b>Ground-level</b> Arctic <b>ozone</b> {{depletion}} {{events have}} been studied since the mid-eighties. This process is generally attributed to heterogeneous reactions on saline ice surfaces under stable meteorological conditions. Bromine monoxide (a product of ozone depletion chemistry) has been routinely measured throughout the Arctic via satellite since the late 1990 ’s. It has been observed that high levels of BrO (believed {{to be in the}} troposphere) correspond well with first-year sea-ice, leading to the hypothesis that first-year sea-ice provides the heterogeneous surface upon which these depletion events can occur. However, there have been, to date, few ground-level measurements of BrO over the sea-ice, and certainly none for extended periods of time. Having continuous ground-level BrO/ozone measurements would prove useful in deciphering/verifying the satellite data. Further, the conditions required for depletion chemistry to occur are not known, thereby limiting our understanding of the chemical mechanism at play. ^ Herein is presented research and instrumental/analysis developments to improve our collective understanding of the chemistry involved in these events. This involved studying the ice surface of snow crystals formed in a chamber in the lab to better understand the effects of impurities on the its surface structure, and its self-assembly mechanism. Second, a buoy-based instrument platform was developed to make autonomous measurements of ozone depletion related chemicals where the chemistry is believed to be occurring: on the sea-ice. As iodine potentially plays a role in depletion chemistry an ion chromatography method was developed to measure iodide levels in snow samples from the Arctic. Finally, to better define the meteorological conditions required for depletion chemistry to occur a comparison between satellite BrO column data and twenty meteorological variables was performed. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and modeling {{study was conducted}} to assess the <b>ground-level</b> atmospheric <b>ozone</b> impacts of several types of consumer product compounds Environmental chamber experiments were carried out for the representative amines 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP), ethanolamine, isopropyl amine and t-butyl amine and also for d-limonene. AMP and t-butyl amine were found to inhibit ozone formation, but the others enhanced ozone, and most were found to significantly enhance formation of secondary particle matter (PM). Methods to estimate mechanisms for amines that were qualitatively consistent with the chamber data were developed. However, the amine chamber data were not useful for quantitative valuation because the amount of amine available for gas-phase reaction could not be measured, and appeared to be significantly less than the amount injected. Estimates of atmospheric ozone impacts for the amines are also very uncertain because the amount of amines removed by reaction with HNO 3 in the atmosphere cannot be predicted. The chamber data obtained for d-limonene were well simulated by the existing d-limonene mechanism. Representations of the atmospheric reactions of for 15 amines and 30 other types of consumer product VOCs were added to the SAPRC- 07 mechanism and its MIR and other reactivity scale tabulations, which are included with this report. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND DISCLAIMERS This work was funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) through contract number 06 - 408.

Objectives: We estimated the global burden of mortality due to O 3 and PM 2. 5 from anthropogenic emissions using global atmospheric chemical transport model simulations of preindustrial and present-day (2000) concentrations to derive exposure estimates. Met h o d s: Attributable mortalities were estimated using health impact functions based on longterm relative risk estimates for O 3 and PM 2. 5 from the epidemiology literature. Using simulated concentrations rather than previous methods based on measurements allows the inclusion of rural areas where measurements are often unavailable and avoids making assumptions for background air pollution. Res u l t s: Anthropogenic O 3 was associated with an estimated 0. 7 ± 0. 3 million respiratory mortalities (6. 3 ± 3. 0 million years of life lost) annually. Anthropogenic PM 2. 5 was associated with 3. 5 ± 0. 9 million cardiopulmonary and 220, 000 ± 80, 000 lung cancer mortalities (30 ± 7. 6 million years of life lost) annually.

40|$|<b>Ground-level</b> {{concentrations}} of <b>ozone</b> have rapidly risen {{over the past}} century: present-day {{concentrations of}} ozone commonly exceed the accepted threshold of 40 ppb and the gas is now recognized {{to be the most}} damaging air pollutant to which vegetation is exposed in many parts of Central/Southern Europe, North/South America and Asia. Plant subjected to elevated concentrations of ozone undergo several biochemical changes, that are the direct result of a qualitative and quantitative modification of gene expression. With the aim to identify differentially expressed genes after the exposition to an acute ozone dose a suppression subtractive hybridisation technique was used in two poplar species characterised by a different sensibility to this kind of pollutant (sensitive and tolerant to ozone). By using SSH, cDNA subtracted libraries were obtained both for ozone-treated sensitive clone and for ozone-treated treated clone and after a primary screening we have isolated several ozone differentially regulated cDNA clones. Sequence analysis showed that selected cDNAs include those with a putative role in the antioxidative response, the hypersensitive response, signal transduction, and some genes with unknow function. The isolated cDNAs include e. g. a sequence containig leucine-rich repeat (LPR) (sensitive clone) that have been predicted to be present in proteins that mediated intercellular or intracellular signalling and a cDNA sequence (tolerant clone) that presents a conserved domain typical of transcription factors belonging to the WRKY superfamily that include members involved in the regulation of various physiological program.

40|$|Meteorological {{impacts on}} air {{pollutant}} transport in highly urbanized region were investigated using the mesoscale meteorological models and air quality model. Two meteorological impacts {{were examined in}} this thesis. One was the impact of layer collapsing on O 3 transport during strong lanf sea breeze circulation (LSBC), {{the other was the}} mechanical impact of building availability on PM 10 transport. In order to alleviate the computational cost of air quality modeling for chemical process calculation associated with a large number of vertical layers, the vertical layer collapsing technique is widely used to reduce the height number of vertical layers. A relatively fine resolution in the troposphere is preserved as in the meteorological model and a coarser resolution above 2. 0 km results from layer collapsing. In general, this action is thought to have an insignificant impact on <b>ozone</b> <b>ground-level</b> concentration. However, through the off-line coupling of the Fifth-Generational National Center of Atmospheric Research/Pennsylvania State University (NCAR/PSU) Mesoscale Model (MM 5) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system, it was demonstrated {{in the first part of}} my thesis research that the vertical resolution of model grid affected the ozone vertical profile, and the difference of hourly average ozone concentration could be up to 46 %. And the detailed processes were also studied by integrated process rate (IPR) analysis method. With the development of economics urbanization, the building availability plays an important role in air pollution transport. The mechanical impact of building availability on wind speed reduction was investigated by mesoscale meteorological model (WRF) with Building Environment Parameterization (BEP) module. Further, its downstream impact on PM 10 transport was studied by CMAQ. The wind speed reduction associated with building availability could be up to 80 %. And this wind speed reduction could lead to increase of PM 10 15 % in day time while 50 % in night time...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{synoptic}} patterns {{conducive to the}} occurrence of O- 3 episodes in Hong Kong are categorized by an inspection of the weather charts over the period of 1999 - 2003. The synoptic patterns associated with tropical cyclones originating in the North Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea {{are found to be}} the most optimal weather conditions for the occurrence of ozone episodes in Hong Kong. A high-resolution version of the regional, three-dimensional, multiscale photochemical air quality model (Pollutants in the Atmosphere and Their Transport in Hong Kong (PATH)), developed by the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department in 2000, has been employed to investigate the evolution of one type of ozone episode related to tropical cyclones. A nonhydrostatic meteorological model (MM 5) was applied with four-dimensional data assimilation to provide necessary meteorological fields to the air quality model. The performances of both the meteorological and chemical models are evaluated by comparing the simulated results with the available observed data. An integrated process rate analysis is used to examine the relative contributions of individual physical and chemical processes in the formation of ozone episodes for obtaining {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of photochemical smog events in Hong Kong. Results show that about 30 % of the total ozone production is due to local chemical production in the lower atmosphere boundary layer, and about 70 % is contributed by interregional transport from southern China into Hong Kong. In addition, four main processes, including horizontal advection, vertical transport, photochemical reactions, and deposition are found to have a significant influence on the <b>ground-level</b> concentration of <b>ozone.</b> The sensitivity experiments indicate that the chemical regime for ozone formation in Hong Kong seems to be limited by volatile organic compounds...|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{results from}} the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model version 4. 7. 1 over the Conterminous United States (CONUS) for August 2009 are {{analyzed}} to evaluate how satellite-derived O 3 sensitivity regimes capture weekly cycles of the U. S. EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) observed <b>ground-level</b> concentrations of <b>ozone</b> (O 3). AQS stations are classified according to a geographically-based land use designation or an O 3 -NO x -VOC chemical sensitivity regime. Land use designations are derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) global land cover characteristic data representing three features: urban regions, forest regions, and other regions. The O 3 chemical regimes (NO x -saturated, mixed, and NO x -sensitive) are inferred from low to high values of photochemical indicators based on {{the ratio of the}} HCHO to NO 2 column density from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME- 2) and CMAQ. Both AQS-observed weekly cycles of NO x at measurement sites over AVHRR geographical regions and GOME- 2 sensitivity regimes show high NO x on weekdays and low NO x on weekends. However, the AQS-observed O 3 weekly cycle at sites over the GOME- 2 NO x -saturated regime is noticeably different from that over the AVHRR urban region. Whereas the high weekend O 3 anomaly is clearly shown at sites over the GOME- 2 NO x -saturated regime in both AQS and CMAQ, the weekend effect is not captured at other sites over the AVHRR urban region. In addition, the weekend effect from AQS is more clearly discernible at sites above the GOME- 2 NO x -saturated regime than at other sites above the CMAQ NO x -saturated regime. This study suggests that chemical classifications of GOME- 2 chemical regime stations produces better results for weekly O 3 cycles than either the CMAQ chemical or AVHRR geographical classifications...|$|R

The move proved controversial, since the Agency's own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol.

40|$|The photochemically-induced {{destruction}} of <b>ground-level</b> Arctic <b>ozone</b> in the Arctic {{occurs at the}} onset of spring, in concert with polar sunrise. Solar radiation is believed to stimulate a series of reactions that cause the production and release of molecular halogens from frozen, salty surfaces, though this mechanism is not yet well understood. The subsequent photolysis of molecular halogens produces reactive halogen atoms that remove ozone from the atmosphere in these so-called “Ozone Depletion Events” (ODEs). Given that much of the Arctic region is sunlit, meteorologically stable, and covered by saline ice and snow, it is expected that ODEs could be a phenomenon that occurs across the entire Arctic region. Indeed, an ever-growing body of evidence from coastal sites indicates that Arctic air masses devoid of O 3 most often pass over sea ice-covered regions before arriving at an observation site, suggesting ODE chemistry occurs upwind over the frozen Arctic Ocean. However, outside of coastal observations, there exist very few long-term observations from the Arctic Ocean from which quantitative assessments of basic ODE characteristics can be made. ^ This work presents the interpretation of ODEs through unique chemical and meteorological observations from several ice-tethered buoys deployed around the Arctic Ocean. These observations include detection of ozone, bromine monoxide, and measurements of temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and wind direction. To assess whether the O-Buoys were observing locally based depletion chemistry or the transport of ozone-poor air masses, periods of ozone decay were interpreted based on current understanding of ozone depletion kinetics, which are believed to follow a pseudo-first order rate law. In addition, the spatial extents of ODEs were estimated using air mass trajectory modeling to assess whether they are a localized or synoptic phenomenon. Results indicate that current understanding of the responsible chemical mechanisms are lacking, ODEs are observed primarily due to air mass transport (even in the Arctic Ocean), or some combination of both. Air mass trajectory modeling was also used in tandem with remote sensing observations of sea ice to determine the types of surfaces air masses were exposed to before arriving at O-Buoys. The impact of surface exposure was subsequently compared with local meteorology to assess which variables had the most effect on O 3 variability. For two observation sites, the impact of local meteorology was significantly stronger than air mass history, while a third was inconclusive. ^ Finally, this work tests the viability of the hypothesis that initial production of molecular halogens from frozen saline surfaces results from photolytic production of the hydroxyl radical, and could be enhanced in the presence of O 3. This investigation was enabled by a custom frozen-walled flow reactor coupled with chemical ionization spectrometry. It was found that hydroxyl radical could indeed promote the production and release of iodine, bromine, and chlorine, and that this production could be enhanced in the presence of ozone. ...|$|R
