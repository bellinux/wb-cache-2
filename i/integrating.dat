The process of <b>integrating</b> is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the least likely to accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established.

40|$|Abstract: The IIRC {{states as}} its long term vision {{a world in}} which <b>integrated</b> {{thinking}} is embedded within mainstream business practice and therefore sees <b>integrated</b> thinking as key in fostering <b>integrated</b> reporting. This study seeks to establish how embedded <b>integrated</b> thinking is in the <b>integrated</b> reporting processes of a sample of JSE Listed entities as they produce <b>integrated</b> reports. The objective of this research is therefore to assess whether <b>integrated</b> reporting is achieving <b>integrated</b> thinking and to what extent business processes has been impacted by producing <b>integrated</b> reports by these entities. Assessing the nature of <b>integrated</b> thinking was based on a qualitative interpretative methodology using the research instrument of semi-structured interviews. Twelve nonexecutive, executive and senior management were interviewed and the interviews were analysed using a thematic approach. The research found that there were different levels of maturity in the adoption of <b>integrated</b> reporting and <b>integrated</b> thinking. The focus was generally more on producing the <b>integrated</b> report than developing <b>integrated</b> thinking. Overall, the research found that <b>integrated</b> reporting has not achieved the level of <b>integrated</b> thinking that would result in changing or significant influence {{in the way in which}} business is conducted. The research findings mean that further development needs to be done to ensure that <b>integrated</b> thinking is fully embedded in business practices. As the interviewees came from a spectrum of JSE Listed entities and from various levels of senior and non-executive management, the results provide an indication of the level of embeddedness of <b>integrated</b> thinking in the entities and how <b>integrated</b> reporting has impacted business practices.

50|$|<b>Integrated</b> {{assessment}} modelling (IAM) or <b>integrated</b> modelling (IM) {{is a type}} of scientific modelling often used by the environmental sciences and environmental policy analysis.

40|$|The thesis adresses the {{phenomenon}} of <b>integrated</b> care. The implementation of <b>integrated</b> care for patients with a stroke or dementia is studied. Because a generic quality management model for <b>integrated</b> care is lacking, the study works towards building a development model for <b>integrated</b> care. Based on a systematic approach in which a literature study, a delphi study, a concept mapping study and questionnaire research are combined, a development model for <b>integrated</b> care is created. The model exists of 89 elements of <b>integrated</b> care, which are clustered in nine themes. Also the model describes four phases of development which <b>integrated</b> care services can experience. The model is succesfully empirically validated in 84 <b>integrated</b> care services for stroke, acute myocardial infarct or dementia patients. The model {{has the potential to}} serve as a generic quality management model for <b>integrated</b> care services and can be used for monitoring, self evaluation or benchmarking of <b>integrated</b> care services. Also insurers or policy makers could use the model to stimulate <b>integrated</b> care services to further improve and develop their <b>integrated</b> care...|$|R
