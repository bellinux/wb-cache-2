In this syndrome, a stroke causes a loss of pain-temperature sensation from one side of the face and the other side of the body.|$|E

The hashes and the node IDs must be of the same length. It then searches for several nodes whose ID is close to the hash, and has its own IP address stored at those nodes. i.e. it publishes itself as a source for this file. A searching client will use Kademlia to search the network for the node whose ID has the smallest distance to the file hash, then will retrieve the sources list that is stored in that node.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rudiments of}} a {{biological}} {{basis for the}} mind's eye {{is found in the}} deeper portions of the brain below the neocortex, or where the center of perception exists. [...] The thalamus {{has been found to be}} discrete to other components in that <b>it</b> <b>processes</b> all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain. [...] Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the cerebral cortex, the brain adapts to neuroplasticity to amend any occlusions for perception. [...] It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex. [...] This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate - essentially seeing something that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).|$|E
