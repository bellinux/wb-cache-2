25|$|According to the 2000 Census, {{the state}} of Hawaii had a Filipino {{population}} of over 275,000, with over 191,000 living {{on the island of}} Oahu; of those 102,000 were immigrants. Furthermore, Filipinos make up the third largest ethnicity among Asian Pacific Americans, while making up the majorities of the populations of Kauai and Maui counties. In June 2002, representatives from the Arroyo Administration and local leaders presided over the grand opening and dedication of the Filipino Community Center in Waipahu, Hawaii. In the 2010 census, Filipino Americans became the largest Asian ethnicity in Hawaii, partially due to the falling population of Japanese Americans in the state. In 2011, four percent of all Filipino <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States resided in the Honolulu metro area, and were 43 percent of all immigrants in the Honolulu metro area as well; this population make up the majority of Filipino immigrants in Hawaii, who are 6 percent of all Filipino <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{immigration}} to the United States peaked in the period 1880–1924, with the immigrants arriving from Russia and countries in Eastern Europe; this was also a period of nativism (hostility to <b>immigrants)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Opponents of immigration often questioned whether immigrants from southern and eastern Europe could be assimilated into American society. Reports of Tay–Sachs disease contributed to a perception among nativists that Jews were an inferior race.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} few decades of its existence, the Josephinum focused its efforts on educating priests {{to work with the}} large {{population}} of German <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.

25|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{diversity}} in terms of ethnicities and races within the second immigrant generation population. This diversity among immigrants can be seen in language use, as the majority of second-generation immigrants are bilingual, with 2/3 speaking a language other than English in their homes. In addition, differing ethnicity and racial groups have experiences that are unique to their group. Hispanics, Asian Americans, and African Americans are three of the major groups that make up the population of second-generation <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

These higher rates of racial intermarriage leads to an increase in the birthrates of interracial children, aiding in the elimination of disparities in the U.S. that exist along ethnic lines.|$|E

25|$|Parents {{may feel}} that their {{authority}} over their children is weakened because there are greater resources available in the United States and children are thus less dependent upon their parents for financial support. Some parents believe that children's greater independence also makes them less likely to heed parent's teachings and advice. In particular, children in immigrant families may have greater access to education and work opportunities. These, in turn, can help facilitate social mobility, raising the socioeconomic status of subsequent generations of immigrants relative to first generation immigrants (see Second generation <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States).|$|E

25|$|The DREAM Act (acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors) was an American {{legislative}} {{proposal for a}} multi-phase process for illegal <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States that would first grant conditional residency and upon meeting further qualifications, permanent residency. The bill was first introduced in the Senate on August 1, 2001 and has since been reintroduced several times but did not pass. It was intended to stop the deportation {{of people who had}} arrived as children and had grown up in the U.S. The Act would give lawful permanent residency under certain conditions which include: good moral character, enrollment in a secondary or post-secondary education program, and having lived in the United States at least 5 years.

25|$|Currently, Mexican Americans {{constitute}} {{the largest percentage}} of second-generation <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Among male high school graduates, the employment rates are comparable to those experienced by native born whites. When location is controlled for, the employment rate of Mexican American second-generation immigrants surpasses that of native born, non-Hispanic whites. Among male Mexican American second-generation immigrants who have less than a high school diploma, employment rates are also higher than those of native born, non-Hispanic whites. Mexican second generation women experience an employment rate slightly below that of native whites. This gap in labor participation increases for those with less than a high school diploma. Similar levels of labor force participation does not necessarily mean similar earnings, as part-time is considered employment and Mexican Americans are more likely to take on jobs with lower pay.|$|E
25|$|Although Americans may favor one {{immigration}} policy over another, perceptions {{of government and}} officials' ability to implement these policies is consistently negative. In November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a set of executive actions which could extend at least temporary legal status to {{nearly half of the}} illegal <b>immigrants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The Republican majority in the new Congress as 2015 is challenging these actions. Although some Republican senators did vote for the reform bill of 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, Obama's executive steps are not in accord with the overall stated policy position of the Republican Party. On February 16, 2015, a federal district court judge issued a temporary injunction against the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability program (one of the November 20, 2014 deferred action measures). The Justice Department has appealed the injunction.|$|E
