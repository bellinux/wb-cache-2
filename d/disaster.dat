Applicants, including units of local government, in 19counties became eligible for Public Assistance funds for emergency services and debris removal and to help restore or rebuild essential public facilities. On July 10, President Bush ordered the release of federal <b>disaster</b> funds and emergency resources for Florida to aid people effected by Dennis. One day after the storm made landfall, four <b>disaster</b> recovery centers were opened by <b>disaster</b> officials, two in Escambia County, and two in Santa Rosa County. Supplies of food, water and ice were supplied from staging areas to distribution centers throughout the Florida Panhandle.

The declaration allowed {{for the use of}} federal <b>disaster</b> funds and emergency resources to help families and businesses recover from the effects of Hurricane Isabel.

One week after the <b>disaster</b> declaration, residents began receiving checks for those who applied for aid. By about two months after the passage of Hurricane Isabel, 659 residents applied for assistance, with slightly over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD) being distributed to the victims. 141 loan applications were received, as well. FEMA distributed about $2.5million ($ USD) in Small Business Administration loans, and also received 183 public assistance loans for repair or replacement of public facilities.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six <b>disaster</b> {{recovery}} centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for <b>disaster</b> assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. The National <b>Disaster</b> Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500people. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses. After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem.
