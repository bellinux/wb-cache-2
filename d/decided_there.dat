5|$|After Quatermass and the Pit Kneale {{felt that}} it was time to rest the character. By the early 1970s he had <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. The BBC did not proceed with the project, and Kneale's scripts were {{produced}} in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television titled Quatermass.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing about}} the game's success, Bushnell <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> would be more profit for Atari to {{manufacture}} the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform {{each of the two}} groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell's comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for Pong; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a line of credit from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line. The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972. Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{encounters}} {{took place}} as the Battle of Hannut was being fought in Belgium. The results were much the same. On the southern face of Bulson, General Friedrich Kirchner, commander of the 1st Panzer Division, suffered several tactical reverses and saw the 37mm shells from his 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank guns and Panzer IIIs bounce off the more heavily armoured French tanks. A number of the German tanks were knocked out in rapid succession. The Germans had to hold the French at the ridge. Kirchner was forced to send in his tanks in dribs and drabs, tactics which Guderian hated, but which he himself <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was no other recourse. It was once again the German tanks' radio equipment that enabled them to move around quickly and communicate with one another, to change the point of defence or attack quickly. The speed of the German tanks also enabled them to offset their inferiority in combat power to the French tanks. Often, the Panzer III and IVs could speed into the rear of French formations, closing quickly and knocking out the French armour from the rear. The Germans noted the particular weakness between the chassis and turret of the French tanks, which were vulnerable to their fire.|$|E

25|$|While Eden was {{on holiday}} in Jamaica, {{other members of}} the {{government}} discussed on 20 November how to counter charges that the UK and France had worked in collusion with Israel to seize the Canal, but <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was very little evidence in the public domain.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the prototype began in March 1940, but work was cancelled again after the Battle of Dunkirk, when Lord Beaverbrook, as Minister of Aircraft Production, <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was no production capacity for aircraft like the DH.98, which was {{not expected to be}} in service until early 1942.|$|E
25|$|Shoaib Akhtar {{was in the}} {{spotlight}} after television cameras caught him working on the ball. The pictures appeared to show Akhtar flicking his thumb at the ball.

25|$|April 1988 saw Skywalker end its {{operations}} at the airport. The airline attributed it to a drop in demand for the service. Connecting flights in Buffalo and Rochester had ceased to operate, giving consumers less opportunity to save on fares by using American carriers offering discount travel. Skywalker reduced flights but ultimately <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was not enough demand. City Express started a Toronto-Rochester daily service that same month.|$|E
25|$|There were {{plans for}} the site of Kai Tak {{to be used for}} housing development, which was once {{projected}} to house around 240,000–340,000 residents.

After Forgy decided not to make the race for governor, Baker began to consider his own gubernatorial bid, but ultimately, he <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was not enough time to mount a credible campaign and declined to run for any office in 1987.|$|E

25|$|That night, the Spanish generals held {{a council}} of war. De la Union's {{chief of staff}} Tomàs Morla saw through Augereau's actions and {{proposed}} that Navarro's division attack on the right while de Vives and de las Amarilas joined forces and attacked the French centre near Le Boulou. The council voted to adopt this action, which would secure the supply road from Le Boulou to Bellegarde. As a precaution, the council decided to withdraw the army's trains by the road to Bellegarde. However, they <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was {{plenty of time to}} issue orders the next morning, rather than that evening.|$|E
25|$|Psychosurgery and the {{surgical}} implantation of hormones to reduce male sexual drive {{were classified as}} irreversible treatments {{that could only be}} carried out on consenting patients (section 57 of part IV of the Act); ECT was classified as a slightly less serious treatment that could be given to non-consenting patients if certain procedures were followed (section 58). The patient had to be detained (if they were not already detained), then a psychiatrist from the Mental Health Act Commission had to authorise treatment. If the treating psychiatrist <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> was an urgent need for ECT it could go ahead without authorisation from a Mental Health Act Commission psychiatrist (section 62).|$|E
25|$|After the war, in 1905, {{the then}} Secretary of State for War, Richard Haldane started a {{reorganisation}} {{of the army}} and reserves. The Haldane Reforms and the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 gave the British Army the capability of forming an expeditionary force. The act also incorporated regular payment for Territorial Force soldiers and training, which included an annual two-week training camp. As a result, when the Territorial Force was formed it was <b>decided</b> <b>there</b> would be fourteen mounted brigades. Each of these brigades consisted of three yeomanry regiments, one artillery battery from the Royal Horse Artillery or the Honourable Artillery Company, an ammunition column, a transport and supply column and a field ambulance.|$|E
50|$|Royal Cinque Ports {{had been}} planned as the {{location}} for the Open Championship in 1915, but in early in that year it was <b>decided</b> that <b>there</b> would be no championships during the remainder of World War I; the next Open Championship after the war would be held at Royal Cinque Ports. Although {{the war was over}} in November 1918, it was <b>decided</b> that <b>there</b> would be no championship in 1919. During the war, six of the greens were involved in a scheme to build a rifle range. This raised fears {{about the state of the}} course, but in late 1919 it was <b>decided</b> that <b>there</b> would be no difficulty in getting the course ready for the 1920 championship.|$|R
50|$|In 1878 the Stamford Town Committee {{decided to}} create a high school for the growing {{community}} after <b>deciding</b> <b>there</b> {{was the lack of}} sufficient secondary education.

Drawing, Latin, Greek, physical geography, and geometry were added to the curriculum in 1876.|$|R
