40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} an aerosol <b>infection</b> <b>method</b> with Histophilus somni that closely resembles the natural way of infection of calves. Another aim was to compare the virulence of two H. somni strains by collecting clinical and postmortem data of experimentally infected and control animals. Seventeen conventionally reared 3 -month-old calves were divided into three groups. Two groups of six animals each were exposed to suspensions containing H. somni on three consecutive days using a vaporiser mask. The third group of five animals was used as control. The data of individual clinical examination were recorded daily. All animals were exterminated, and gross pathology of all lungs was evaluated on the 15 th day after the first infection. Both H. somni strains caused an increase of rectal temperature, respiratory signs, decrease of weight gain, and severe catarrhal bronchopneumonia in both infected groups. Although some chronic lesions were detected in the lungs of the control animals as well, the histopathological findings in the infected and control groups were different. H. somni was recultured from all lungs in the challenged groups but it could not be reisolated or detected by PCR examination in the control group. This is the first paper on aerosol challenge of calves with H. somni using repeated infection and verified by detailed pathological, bacteriological and histopathological examination.

40|$|Aquilaria malaccensis Lam, {{commonly}} known as Agarwood, is a highly valuable species used in production of agar oil from its infected wood, which is utilized in pharmaceutical and perfumery industry. Agar oil formation in agarwood takes years through the natural process which is induced by natural or artificial injury or microbial infection. The role of soil fungi and bacteria in artificial induction is still an unexplored area. In the present study, we isolated the fungal and bacterial community residing inside the stem of A. malaccensis tree and circumventing soil, samples collected from 21 different sites of the north-eastern state Assam of India and explored their potential in induction of Agarospirol (2 -(6, 10 -Dimethylspiro[4, 5]dec- 6 -en- 2 -yl) - 2 -propanol) production by artificially infecting the trees with these microorganisms. A total 340 fungi and 131 bacteria were isolated from 50 stem samples, and 188 fungi and 148 bacteria were isolated from 50 soil samples. Highest Shannon (H′ = 2. 43) and Fisher (α = 5. 57) diversity index was observed in the stem isolates. The dominant fungal genus was Trichoderma in stem with Pi value of 0. 18; while in soil, Aspergillus showed dominance with Pi value 0. 73. In bacteria, Bacillus genera showed dominance in both stem and soil samples with Pi = 0. 62 and 0. 51, respectively. Forty fungal and bacterial isolates {{were used to assess}} their potential to induce formation of agarwood in A. malaccensis by artificial <b>infection</b> <b>method.</b> Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis confirmed development of Agarwood by the presence of Agarospirol compound in samples collected after 3 months of the artificial infection.

30|$|The {{soil samples}} from four {{experimental}} sites were aseptically collected to enumerate the rhizobia population that nodulated common bean {{by using the}} plant <b>infection</b> <b>method.</b> The result of this experiment revealed that the rhizobia of common bean varied from < 10 to 105  g− 1 of soil. Based on this rhizobial population, the experimental sites were grouped into three soil types. Accordingly, Babillae soil had < 100 rhizobia of common bean g− 1 soil. Rhizobia population > 1000  g− 1 of soil was found in Haramaya and Hirna soils. While the rhizobial population in Fedis soil was between 100 and 1000  g− 1 soil. Therefore, Babillae, Fedis, and Haramaya and Hirna soils were categorized into low, medium and high rhizobia containing soil types, {{as it has been}} previously described by Howieson and Ballard [30]. None of common bean cultivating history in Babillae and Fedis sites could be attributed to lower rhizobial population nodulating common bean [31].

The partners showed antagonistic perceptions: tranquility-betrayal, fear of death, of incurability and the diagnosis, especially of HIV. The reasons for coming to a healthcare center were: fear of being sick, attenuation of guilt of infection transmission, need for diagnosis, early start of treatment.
