30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several exemptions and <b>derogations</b> <b>for</b> the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption [2]. Pseudonymisation is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre <b>for</b> national regulations (<b>derogations</b> defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that exemptions and <b>derogations</b> <b>for</b> research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|R

Resale right was introduced into the UK in 2006 when Directive 2001 / 84 /EC was implemented.

The UK currently uses a derogation in the Directive so the right only applies in the UK to works by living artists.

30|$|Paradoxically, in the guidelines, the <b>derogation</b> <b>for</b> {{the joint}} selling of produce by cooperatives {{does not appear}} clearly. The CMO Regulation forbids the {{charging}} of identical prices; joint selling {{may be seen as}} equating to charging identical prices. Thus, operations by cooperatives could be exempted only under the general competition rules, if the conditions, i.e. creation of efficiencies, benefits for consumers, no disproportionate restriction of competition, are fulfilled. The exemptions available under general competition rules offer only limited protection for the joint sale of products at a common price, arguably the main purpose of a great number of agricultural cooperatives. It is to note that national competition authorities have not challenged the typical commercial practices of cooperatives as potentially anti-competitive horizontal cooperation among individual producers.|$|R

30|$|The {{question}} of whether state parties may derogate from economic, social and cultural rights in times of public emergency has {{been a matter of}} much debate. Derogating from a right essentially allows states to put their obligations on hold for a specified period of time. As derogating is a somewhat extreme measure, whether or not a particular right may be derogated from, and under which circumstances, is usually laid down in the text of a human rights treaty. However, {{this is not the case}} for the ICESCR, which neither contains a <b>derogation</b> clause allowing <b>for</b> <b>derogations,</b> nor a provision prohibiting derogations. This is unlike the ICCPR, Article 4 of which specifies the conditions <b>for</b> <b>derogations</b> from its provisions, and prohibits derogations from several rights (Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2, respectively). Nonetheless, the fact that there is no derogation clause in ICESCR does not necessarily mean that states would be precluded from derogating from them.|$|R

Although the immensely wealthy Lothar had been ennobled in 1861 and made Baron von Faber in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1881, in the German Empire a mediatised nobleman's marriage to his daughter would have been deemed morganatic, and the Count's trafficking in commerce considered an act of social <b>derogation</b> <b>for</b> {{a member of the}} Hochadel, so Alexander renounced his birth rank prior to the marriage. He was granted the new hereditary title of Count von Faber-Castell by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria for the descendants of his marriage to the Faber heiress. Although Alexander and Ottilie divorced in 1918, the Faber business trust had conferred headship of the company on Alexander, who even kept the Fabers' renovated palace at Stein (which would be commandeered to billet journalists during the Nuremberg trials, including Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck).|$|R
