40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{view of the}} Bronze Age {{of southeast}} Spain {{is one of a}} highly stratified society that some believe to be a state. The Albacete Survey Project used settlement pattern analysis on 267 Bronze Age sites in a 10, 000 km 2 survey area in eastern La Mancha (Spain) to test for the presence of social hierarchies. The results show a relatively egalitarian society at the begi 1 ming of stratification with indications of cluonic warfare. This paper uses the study of <b>intervisibilities</b> to test for the presence of warfare. The results show that in pat 1 s of the survey area, sites form clusters that can be interpreted as defensive alliances of various sizes tlu???oughout the survey area, with empty areas between the alliances ("no-man' s-lands") defining their boundaries. The presence of these defensive alliances of fortified sites indicates a society of competing polities with, at most, a two-tier hierarchy. A state would not have a segmented settlement pattern of groups engaged in warfare within its boundaries...|$|R

5000|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for deposition within the tomb-shrines, {{largely due to the}} damage that they have sustained. Human bone has been found in the Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Coffin Stone, burned bone from Chestnuts Long Barrow, and pot sherds from Chestnuts, Addington, and Kit's Coty. They have thus usually been interpreted as collective tombs for the interment of the physical remains of the dead. Ashbee believed that the area surrounding the megaliths might have been a [...] "ritual landscape" [...] that was believed to possess [...] "especial qualities", thus explaining why Early Neolithic people decided to construct the monuments at this location. Killick suggested that the area was chosen because of the visually imposing nature of the local landscape, also suggesting that it might have been chosen because it allowed for <b>intervisibility</b> between the different monuments. Inspired by ideas pioneered elsewhere by the archaeologist Chris Tilley, Killick suggested that the Medway Megaliths were oriented to point at either the Downs or the River, noting that five of the monuments point toward {{at least one of these}} two geographical features. The views visible from the monuments are not however uniform; had the vicinity been deforested, then Kit's Coty, Little Kit's Coty and Coldrum would have had 360° panoramic views of the landscape, whereas only a third of the local landscape is visible from Addington and Chestnuts Long Barrows. Killick also thought it probably that <b>intervisibility</b> was a factor in locating the monuments, noting that Kit's Coty House, Little Kit's Coty and the Coffin Stone were probably intervisible in the Early Neolithic, as were Addington and Chestnuts Long Barrow, and the White Horse Stones and Smythe's Megalith.|$|E

50|$|Alasdair’s work on spatial {{analysis}} constitutes {{the foundation of}} the agent model and supports research in space syntax theory. The theory was initially established by Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson in their book The Social Logic of Space. Space syntax theory was based on a graph-based representation of the spatial network in buildings and cities and what this implies in terms of the social logic of movement and occupation. The nodes in the graph representation are namely the axial lines and convex spaces. Together with Alan Penn, David O'Sullivan and Maria Doxa, Alasdair has introduced to visibility graph analysis (VGA). A VGA is another representation of space that reflects on <b>intervisibility</b> relationships in a layout. In a VGA model, nodes are considered to be points in a grid that covers all spaces in a layout. Alasdair has also contributed to the development of space syntax methods. Together with Alan Penn and Bill Hillier, he has written an algorithm to generate axial maps automatically. He has also contributed to the introduction of segment graph measures and the development of geometric configurations. Segment analysis was seen by Bill Hillier and Shinichi Iida to have some explanatory power by considering angular and metric graph properties of street networks and their psychological effects. The method was mainly applied to studies on urban systems. Alasdair has written the UCL Depthmap software in which he implemented space syntax methods as well as the agent model.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} {{we focus on}} information limits in the remote sensing and target tracking field. Three topics are studied: a dynamic Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking in clutter, target <b>intervisibility,</b> and monopulse radar detection and localization of multiple unresolved targets via joint bin processing. ^ We develop a Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for target tracking, that is, for the state estimates of dynamic systems {{in the presence of}} false alarms and missed detections. We show that the CRLB obeys a Riccati-like equation, with the exception that the measurement-noise covariance term is multiplied by an information reduction factor (IRF). The calculation of the IRF and the existence of efficient estimators are also addressed. ^ In the second topic we study <b>intervisibility</b> [...] -the existence of an unobstructed line of sight (LOS) between two points [...] -accounting for the vertical and horizontal errors in the estimated locations of both points as well as elevation errors in the database of the terrain that could obstruct the LOS between these points. This is a significant factor in limiting information gathering in real systems. The errors will first be simply treated as a 2 ̆ 2 white 2 ̆ 2 noise sequence: we assume no correlation between the <b>intervisibility</b> at two different times, and the probability of an instantaneous <b>intervisibility</b> event will be in this case developed. Consequently, we will present a second treatment in which the errors are stochastic processes of a certain bandwidth, and both the probability density function of an <b>intervisibility</b> interval and the average number of <b>intervisibility</b> intervals over a certain time period will be developed. ^ In a monopulse radar system, if several closely-spaced targets fall within the same radar beam and between two adjacent matched filter samples in range, the monopulse information from both of these samples can and should be used for estimation, both of angle and of range (i. e., estimation of the range to sub-bin accuracy). In our research, a model of closely spaced targets that fall between adjacent matched filter samples is established and a maximum likelihood (ML) extractor will be developed. The limits on the number of targets that can be estimated are given. A minimum description length (MDL) criterion is used to decide on the number of targets between the matched filter samples. ...|$|E

40|$|Visibility {{analysis}} {{is now a}} key function of many geographical information systems. It {{is also one of}} the most contentious tools, as it is notoriously prone to error. The paper will demonstrate the versatility of the Multiscale Implicit Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) for the application of <b>intervisibility</b> analysis at multiple resolutions. This approach allows for the integration of three-dimensional (3 D) topographic features with the terrain surface. The multiscale TINs are derived from generalising digital contours at a variety of lateral tolerances. The models' performances are evaluated from an extensive field study undertaken in the South Wales valleys. Results suggest that the accuracy of <b>intervisibility</b> {{analysis is}} very dependent upon the availability of good quality 3 D topographic data. In our study, such data were shown to improve visibility performance by more than 44 % over its bare-earth TIN equivalent. Interestingly, generalisation of the TINs had very little effect on visibility performance. In addition, a Monte Carlo approach to sensitivity analysis was found to be detrimental to the accuracy of visibility prediction in the full terrain and topographic models. However, this probable approach can improve <b>intervisibility</b> performance by up to 18 % on a bare-earth TIN.

40|$|International audienceArchaeologists {{have long}} {{considered}} <b>intervisibility</b> essential to understanding settlement patterns and landscape structure. The idea of <b>intervisibility</b> {{as a driver}} stems from the premise that, across epochs and cultures, (in) visibility is manipulated for communication, control and sometimes defense. For these reasons a broad suite of viewshed analyses were explored by archaeologists, primarily using GIS, from the 1980 s. Many of these studies suggest that vegetation {{plays an important role}} in blocking, altering, and framing sightlines, but these suggestions remain relatively unexplored. The increasing availability of airborne laser scanning (ALS) datasets invites us to revisit these propositions. ALS data allows us to consider -with relative ease- multiple vegetation scenarios in which we vary spatial distributions and canopy structure to understand potential impacts on specific visual networks. The approach illustrated in this paper employs ‘rapid initial visual assessment’ of the elements of <b>intervisibility</b> analyses. Multiple 3 D scenes are built using sightline vectors, DTMs, and vegetation models. These scenes allow us to immediately understand the impact of terrain and different vegetation states. This rapid exploratory protocol lets us establish a generalized chronology of the changes in extents of woodlands based on presumed or known visual networks. Because calculations are not computationally expensive, quickly modeling many scenarios is practical- opening the possibility of new approaches to visual networks. In this paper our approach is demonstrated use the ‘ceinture de fortifications’ constructed around Besançon in 19 th century. Because the state of forest at the time of construction, and the intentions of the architects to create a visual network are well documented, the ceinture provides an ideal case study. We then consider the visual dynamics of two castles and a citadel, constructed and active in the Medieval and Early Modern periods, with reference to historical evidence for competition and cooperation between their respective communities...|$|E

40|$|Digital Terrain Model (DTM) {{nowadays}} is invaluable aid for {{the engineering}} community. Nevertheless, the time and cost associated with DTM data acquisition have often been prohibitive. This {{is due to the}} process of data collection, which is costly and time consuming. DTM is based on topographical information which is commonly obtained by photogrammetry, remote sensing, laser scanning, radar interferometry, and other classical terrestrial or Global Positioning System (GPS) survey. Photogrammetry, remote sensing and radar interferometry are commonly applied on the generation of medium to low-resolution DTM covering large area. Meanwhile, laser scanning, classical terrestrial survey and GPS are employed for high-resolution DTM generation. Most of civil engineering projects are in large scale applications which need high-resolution DTM. Laser scanning furnishes latest technology for medium to high resolution DTM generation but it is still relatively expensive.

40|$|In {{seeking new}} {{approaches}} to <b>intervisibility</b> analyses a Complete <b>Intervisibility</b> Database is generated: visible regions of the DEM, for each post of a Digital Elevation Model, are derived and held. Issues of computation time, data volume and methods for building applications to exploit the CID are addressed in this paper. High-throughput computing makes tractable the computation times, by allowing many related tasks to be invoked and run without synchronisation on multiple networked processors. The Condor middleware was used to harvest otherwise wasted processing time on machines in a computing laboratory, so enabling concurrent use of up to 37 processors running Windows. In an initial run these methods reduced the elapsed time for the CID generation, processing that requires 60 CPU hours for a trial DEM dataset of 336 columns and 466 rows, to 3 hours 26 minutes. By holding 16 visibility analyses in one Band Interleaved by Line file, compressed using zip, the resulting database was ~ 3 % of the uncompressed size (2. 9 Gb). Java applications were developed to interrogate and process the CID. These generate descriptive surface metrics and interactive tactical decision aids. Results were visualized by extending the ESRI ArcMap application. These approaches illustrate the general point that the increasing availability of high performance computation opens opportunities for new analyses, including some that were previously considered impractical. 1...|$|E

In this work, the study is focused on offshore aeolic parks. The term “offshore aeolic” indicates wind turbines installed {{a few miles from the}} coasts of seas or lakes, exploiting the exposure of strong currents. The offshore aeolic farms have some disadvantages including the impact of these generators on the landscape, but they produce a minimum visual disturbance compared to onshore aeolic farms. Environmental Impact Assessment (known as the EIA), introduced in Europe by the 377 / 85 /EEC Directive and amended three times, in 1997 (Directive 97 / 11 /EC), in 2003 (Directive 2003 / 35 /EC) and in 2009 (Directive 009 / 31 /EC), ensures that natural resources, usability and identity of landscapes are not compromised by engineering operations. Planning applications must be accompanied by an Environmental Statement (ES), with the purpose of giving an idea about the effect that the operations will have on the local environment. One of the main aims of the ES is the understanding of the likely visual intrusion of he proposed wind farm, which necessitates the use of visual techniques. A visual technique commonly used is the <b>intervisibility</b> map, normally represented by a two-dimensional map, centered on the location of the wind farm. Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are used to achieve Thematic Maps obtained with GIS software. In this paper, GIS tools are used to identify the effects of wind farms on the landscape; in particular, attention is focused on Map Algebra functions and the study of the analysis of the <b>intervisibility</b> of an offshore aeolic farm is tested in a zone in Italy, localized in the Adriatic sea, along the coast of the Apulia and Molise Regions...|$|E
