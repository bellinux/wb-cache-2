40|$|We {{consider}} a linear single-track {{model of a}} truck-dolly-semitrailer by deriving Lagrange's equations with the quasi-coordinates chosen as the body fixed longitudinal and lateral velocity of the <b>truck,</b> vx 1 <b>and</b> vy 1, respectively, the yaw angle of the <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> the articulation angles of the <b>dolly</b> <b>and</b> the semi-trailer. The linear analysis and simulations are carried out with a constant longitudinal velocity of 80 Kph for the passive vehicle, i. e. no steering on the dolly or semitrailer. The analysis shows an increase in yaw rate gain for the <b>dolly</b> <b>and</b> semitrailer, compared to the truck, for frequencies around 0. 4 Hz on the truck steering angle. That is, we have a yaw rate RWA higher than 1 when for frequencies around 0. 4 Hz. We also observe a lateral acceleration gain, between 0. 1 and 1 Hz, for the <b>dolly</b> <b>and</b> semitrailer. Moreover, the phase angle has a higher frequency dependence for the <b>dolly</b> <b>and</b> semitrailer both for yaw rate and lateral acceleration. Time simulations shows that the <b>dolly</b> <b>and</b> semitrailer experience a time delay and an overshoot when the vehicle combination is subjected to various steering angle maneuvers. This indicates that the vehicle combination is not as stable as the truck alone...|$|R

The twist in the story comes when Kiran tells Raj that {{she is going to}} Puna to meet her mom, when she's {{actually}} making a plan with the detective to catch <b>Dolly</b> <b>and</b> Raj red-handed. As soon as Kiran leaves, Raj calls and books the presidential suite at a hotel for <b>Dolly</b> <b>and</b> him, just like Kiran expected. While <b>Dolly</b> <b>and</b> Raj are enjoying themselves, Kiran's detective starts his job. But he gets crushed by the window as he is trying to climb into Raj <b>and</b> <b>Dolly's</b> room.
