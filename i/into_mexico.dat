5|$|On 12 March 1916, Dodd was {{appointed}} {{as a pilot}} to the 1st Aero Squadron, under General John Pershing's 8th Brigade, which was positioned on the Mexican border. As the pilot of Airplane #44, he and his observer, Captain Benjamin Foulois, made the first reconnaissance flight <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> on 15 March 1916. Throughout the rest of March and early April they would fly deep <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> to observe troop movements and fly dispatches to other bases. Upon the completion of his work in Mexico he remained with the 1st Aero Squadron and was promoted to major in May 1917.|$|E
5|$|After serving 40 years, Red is paroled. He {{struggles to}} adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache {{containing}} money, and a letter asking {{him to come to}} Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border <b>into</b> <b>Mexico,</b> admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.|$|E
5|$|Davis, an {{advocate}} of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker's unauthorized expedition <b>into</b> <b>Mexico,</b> and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts. Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15million to $10million. Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen, Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse {{the final version of the}} treaty, which was ratified nonetheless. The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E
5|$|In April 1914 {{the waiting}} for the {{military}} units ended, and American troops {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Frederick Funston were sent <b>into</b> <b>Mexico.</b> The Navy had taken the port city of Veracruz and the 7th Regiment was ordered {{to take part in the}} occupation of the city. Middleton's landing party went in unopposed and settled into occupation duty without a shot being fired. Middleton spent a total of seven months in Mexico and returned home to Galveston in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|In February 1916, Wilson enlisted as {{a private}} in the Maryland National Guard and was posted to Company H, 5th Maryland Infantry. This unit was called to active duty at Laurel, Maryland in June 1916 for service on the Mexican border. It was based at Eagle Pass, Texas, and, like most National Guard units, {{supported}} but did not directly participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition, although it did occasionally cross the border <b>into</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Wilson was soon promoted to corporal, and later sergeant. The 5th Maryland Regiment returned to Maryland in February 1917.|$|E

5|$|In Florida, {{moisture}} tracing behind Arlene produced showers, alleviating ongoing extreme drought {{conditions in}} the state. The National Weather Service warned for the potential of flooding rains in the drought-stricken region of southern Texas. Officials in Cameron County ordered the preparation of sandbags, {{as well as the}} inspection of water pumps and vehicles to deal with floodwaters. In Hidalgo County, the storm spawned a weak tornado that damaged roofs, toppled vehicles, and injured one person prior to moving <b>into</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is found}} mainly in areas east of the Mississippi River, but similar {{mushrooms}} also occur in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas. Its range also stretches south <b>into</b> <b>Mexico.</b> They are ecologically mycorrhizal, and habitats include hardwood forests and coniferous forests. The mushroom grows alone, scattered, or in groups during summer and autumn. It is primarily eastern in distribution but also reported in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas (with an apparent association with pecan trees).|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is known}} from eastern Canada, south to Florida and west to Minnesota in the United States, and <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> and Central America. Its European {{distribution}} is widespread; it is relatively common in many regions, but rare or almost absent in others. In Asia, it has been recorded from the vicinity of Dashkin in the Astore District of northern Pakistan, and as far east as China, {{where it has been}} recorded from Hebei, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, and Korea.|$|E

During the Punitive Expedition <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> in 1916, he was for a time depot manager at Columbus, New Mexico, the main logistical base of the expedition. Later, he joined the expedition in Mexico, working on roads and as a supply officer.|$|E
5|$|Orozco {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} political positions he was offered in the Madero government. He became even more angry when Madero asked him to fight Zapata in central Mexico. As a result, in March 1912--less {{than a year after}} the battle of Ciudad Juárez--Orozco formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero. He subsequently supported Victoriano Huerta in his coup d'état against Madero. After Huerta's fall Orozco went into exile in the US and was eventually killed by Texas Rangers while trying to make his way back <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> to start another revolt.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican Revolutionary General Pancho Villa, who had at {{one time}} been {{supported}} by the United States, felt betrayed when the Americans backed Carranza. In January 1916, Villa's followers, known as Villistas, attacked a train and killed 16 American businessmen who were aboard. Two months later Villa's men crossed the border into the United States and attacked the town of Columbus, New Mexico, killing an additional 19 Americans. Following these attacks, General Pershing took his forces <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> to pursue Pancho Villa.|$|E

5|$|A specimen-collecting {{expedition}} {{along the}} Pacific Coast and down <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> {{provided them with}} a chance to relax, and, for Steinbeck, a chance for a brief escape from the controversy mounting around The Grapes of Wrath. Ricketts, suffering {{as a result of the}} breakup of his long-term relationship with a married woman in Monterey, was glad to get away too. They planned to collect specimens from the rock and tide pools and the shore line uncovered between tides which would allow them build up a picture of the macro level ecosystem in the Gulf. The preserved specimens of the fauna they collected could be identified and catalogued or sold on their return.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{developed}} the Southwest, the Colorado River {{was seen as}} a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped <b>into</b> <b>Mexico</b> before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley. Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea, the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.|$|E
5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and {{elevator}}; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables {{of the elevator}} he is in and it crashes {{to the bottom of}} the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue <b>into</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} in the world of European colonies, the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, {{led to the development of}} Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and <b>into</b> <b>Mexico.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1916 Mexican forces {{loyal to}} Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The {{violence}} in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition <b>into</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Chagrined {{to discover that}} his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E

Three—the Milk and Saint Lawrence rivers and the Red River of the North—begin in the United States and flow into Canada. Of these, only the Milk River crosses the international border twice, leaving and then re-entering the United States. Two rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, begin in the United States and flow into or form a border with Mexico.
