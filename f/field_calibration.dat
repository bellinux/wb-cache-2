The bound receiving phase also ensures that the active sampling area of the device remains constant during laboratory or <b>field</b> <b>calibration</b> uptake experiments and in field deployments. By altering the combination of receiving phase and diffusion-limiting membrane (low-density polyethylene, polyethersulphone or cellulose acetate), you can monitor potable, surface , coastal and marine environment. The sampler can be deployed {{in the field for}} extended periods of time ranging from days to weeks. The specific pollutants of interest are sequestered by the samplers and these are retained on the receiving phase disk. After retrieval from the environment the pollutants are eluted from the disk and analysed in the laboratory using conventional instrumental methods. In order to obtain TWA concentrations the sampler must first be calibrated in the laboratory so as to ascertain the uptake rate (usually measured as the volume of water cleared per unit time i.e. L/h for the analyte) of the pollutant of interest. The Chemcatcher® has been used in a range of aquatic environments; however, most work to date has been in monitoring the TWA concentrations of priority and emerging pollutants surface waters.|$|E

Respondents to the survey were 418 ASHA certified audiologists, who answered questions on demographic variables, sound field testing conditions, and sound <b>field</b> <b>calibration</b> procedures. Eighty-one percent of the respondents use sound field audiometry as part of their audiological practice. Demographic characteristics of the respondents indicate that they were representative of the population of ASHA certified audiologists.

The aim of the calibration is to investigate the behavior of the internal digital camera whether all the digital camera parameters such as focal length, principal point and other parameters remain the same or vice-versa. In the laboratory, a scale bar is placed in the test field for scaling the image and approximate coordinates were used for calibration process.

The lab calibration process was completely automatic using a calibration grid. The focal length was fixed at widest angle and the network included a total of twelve images with± 90 º roll angles. In order to develop the <b>field</b> <b>calibration,</b> a flight plan was programmed including a total of twelve images.
