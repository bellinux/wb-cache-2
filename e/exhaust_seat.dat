5000|$|The seat mating {{angle of}} an intake seat will {{typically}} be one-half {{the width of}} the valve face (on a stock engine). High performance applications will often have a very thin intake mating seat of approximately [...]025" [...] to [...]030". <b>Exhaust</b> <b>seats</b> should be about [...]060" [...] less than the valve face, with the mating surface of the seat being [...]030" [...] from both top and bottom of the valve face (putting the mating of the two {{in the middle of the}} valve face).|$|R
50|$|Bikes can {{be ordered}} from the factory with various options, and {{upgraded}} over time. Options include front and rear suspension, handlebars, bodywork, fuel tank size, <b>exhaust,</b> wheels, <b>seat,</b> footrests, colors and finishes.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{three models}} were {{available}} {{before and after}} the 2005 facelift: the 1.6S, 2.0SE and V6. The 1.6S had a single <b>exhaust</b> and leather <b>seats</b> were optional, although following the 2005 facelift half-leather seats were standard. Both other models have twin <b>exhausts</b> and leather <b>seats</b> as standard. The six-speed gearbox was also standard on the V6 model.|$|R
50|$|They {{were called}} Polyspheric or Poly engines, because they {{featured}} polyspherical-shaped (meaning “more than one sphere”) combustion chambers. These combustion chambers were {{formed by the}} two shallow concave domes where the intake and <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>seats</b> were.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1956 and 1960, the British Bullet was {{released}} in several models, including a 350 cc Trials [...] "works replica" [...] version, a 350 cc [...] "Clipper" [...] model and in 1958 the Airflow version. This model had full weather protection from a large fibreglass fairing and included panniers for touring. The design was developed in partnership with British Plastics and featured as a series in The Motor Cycle magazine. The engines were the same and the only differences were in <b>exhaust,</b> <b>seating,</b> instrumentation, handlebars and fuel tank. Numerous technical improvements were also made, including moving to alternator charging (1956) and coil ignition (1960). The 350 cc model continued in production, but the 500 cc model was discontinued in 1961. In 1962, the UK company was sold and the Bullet discontinued and in 1967, the Redditch factory closed. Finally, in 1970, Royal Enfield closed down completely.|$|R

40|$|The {{tests were}} carried out with the spark timing {{adjusted}} to the maximum brake torque timing in various equivalence ratios and engine speeds for gasoline and natural gas operations. In this work, the lower heating value of gasoline is about 13. 6 % {{higher than that of}} natural gas. Based on the experimental results, the natural gas operation causes an increase of about 6. 2 % brake special fuel consumption, 22 % water temperature difference between outlet and inlet engine, 3 % <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>seat</b> temperature, 2. 3 % brake thermal efficiency and a decrease of around 20. 1 % maximum brake torque, 6. 8 % exhaust gas temperature and 19 % lubricating oil temperature when compared to gasoline operation. The results also revealed that, over the entire range of engine speed and equivalence ratios, the exhaust gas temperature and the lubricating oil temperature for gasoline operation is higher than that of natural gas operation while the <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>seat</b> temperature for natural gas operation is higher...|$|R

25|$|Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) was {{developed}} for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with unleaded. Rather than tetraethyl lead it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft <b>exhaust</b> valves and <b>seats</b> {{so that they do}} not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel.|$|R
50|$|External {{differences}} from the Majestic included a D motif {{on top of}} the bonnet, cast-in V symbols on the ventilation air intakes, six inches added to the length of the car which gave it a longer boot and longer bumper returns, and twin <b>exhaust</b> pipes.

5000|$|The Q-code [...] "351 Cobra Jet" [...] {{version was}} {{produced}} from May 1971 through the 1974 model year. It was a lower-compression design that included open-chamber 4V heads. [...] The open-chamber heads exhibited superior emissions characteristics and {{were required to}} meet the more stringent emissions standards for 1972 and beyond. [...] The [...] "351 Cobra Jet" [...] high-performance engine that included a different intake manifold, high-lift, long-duration camshaft with hydraulic valve lifters, different valve springs and dampers, a 750-CFM spread-bore 4300-D Motorcraft carburetor, dual-point distributor (with four-speed manual transmissions only), and four-bolt main bearing caps. These engines also featured induction-hardened <b>exhaust</b> <b>seats</b> for use with low-lead and unleaded gasoline. This engine {{was different from the}} 1970-71 M-code 351C having a more aggressive camshaft, a spread-bore carburetor, a four-bolt block and the lower compression allowed regular fuel to be used. It was rated at [...] for all 1971 applications. For the 1972 model year, the only change to the engine was a retarding the camshaft events by 4°. [...] The engine was rated at [...] (SAE net) for 1972 when installed in the Mustang, and [...] in the Torino and Montego. An increase in the combustion chamber size and the use of smaller valves occurred in 1973, which reduced horsepower to [...] for the four-barrel for the intermediate Fords, though it still retained the higher [...] rating in the Mustang. The 351 CJ (now referred to as the [...] "351 4V") was rated at [...] in 1974 and was only installed in the Ford Ranchero, Ford Torino, Mercury Montego, and Mercury Cougar.|$|R
50|$|Like most pre-1989 Austin Rover cars, 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre Maestros cannot run on {{unleaded}} petrol without the cylinder head being converted (re-machining of the cylinder head), {{or the use}} of fuel additives. FBHVC (Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs) tested and approved lead replacement fuel additives, work out at only a couple of pence a litre. The 1994 cc O-series engine in the MG EFi, 2.0i and Turbo has sufficiently hard <b>exhaust</b> valves and <b>seats.</b>|$|R
50|$|When used {{in highly}} {{supercharged}} diesel engines with the corresponding low compression ratio of about only 14:1 or below, JP-8 causes troubles during cold start and idling due to low compression temperatures and subsequent ignition delay because the cetane index is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G to 40 or higher. Because lubricity to the BOCLE method is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G, modern common-rail diesel engines can experience wear problems in high-pressure fuel pumps and injectors. Another problem in diesel engines {{can be increased}} wear to <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>seats</b> in the cylinder heads, because a minimum content of sulfur is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G. Sulfur in fuel normally contributes to a build-up of soot layers on these valve seats. According to the notes in this standard, {{it is intended to}} include a cetane index value in one of the next releases.|$|R
50|$|With {{the coming}} of Realism, artists turned to {{depicting}} the fable in terms of contemporary conditions. Among them was Jean-François Millet, whose treatment of the subject, now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, was refused by the Salon in 1859. Léon Lhermitte also painted a realistic version in 1893, while the treatment by Joseph Paul Louis Bergès (1878-1956) in 1905 is more in the Symbolist style. Another Realist, Alphonse Legros, made woodcuts and etchings of the fable, but his most celebrated etching was of the dramatic plaster sculpture he made in 1882. In this the woodman is sprawled across a rock and looks up fearfully at the cowled figure of death curving above him. A later sculpture by André Augustin Sallé, dating from 1924, depicts the <b>exhausted</b> peasant <b>seated</b> on his sticks and leaning back on his pack for support.|$|R
50|$|The G suffix {{after the}} model number {{indicates}} the model uses a shaft drive {{instead of the}} chain drive system. The G models included the GS650G and GL, GS750G and GL, GS850G and GL, GS1000G and GL, and GS1100G, GK, and GL. The G models were standard bikes with flat seats. The GL models were cruiser-style bikes with chrome fenders, smaller gas tanks, pull back handlebars, shorter <b>exhausts,</b> and stepped <b>seats.</b> The GS1100GK was a full-dress bike with factory fairing, trunk, and hard bags.|$|R
50|$|The Magna 750 was {{launched}} in 1993 as an early release 1994 model. Honda sought to capture the market for powerful cruisers by lifting the engine from the VFR750 and slotting it in a cruiser chassis. The engine itself was beautified {{by the addition of}} chrome and some extra fins, and by the chromed 4 into 4 <b>exhaust.</b> The <b>seat</b> was kept very low, at 28 inches, with the passenger seat being detachable. The all new frame was complemented by 41 mm forks, dual shocks, and a single disc on the front. A drum brake was used on the rear. A few internal changes were made to the VFR engine for use in the Magna, including a different crankshaft, a 5-speed transmission and chain driven cams. Smaller carbs were also utilized. The changes resulted in a stronger mid-range pull, and a very broad band of power.|$|R
40|$|Heat flux and {{temperature}} distribution {{were carried out}} in the combustion chamber of a pre-combustion chamber diesel engine running on dual fuel of diesel and natural gas. The test rig consists of a pre-combustion chamber single cylinder diesel engine fully equipped for temperature measurements across different points in the cylinder head, cylinder liner and other critical areas of the combustion chamber. Four traversing thermocouples were installed across the cylinder head and five were fitted along the cylinder liner. Fixed thermocouples were fitted in the pre-combustion chamber tip, fuel injector nozzle tip, <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>seat</b> and <b>exhaust</b> port. The effect of engine load on the heat flux {{and temperature}} level in the different places of the combustion chamber of the engine is presented for both diesel engine and dual fuel engine. The use of natural gas in the dual fuel engine considerably affected the temperature level and heat flux in the combustion chamber of such engine...|$|R
50|$|In 1990 Sloane was the Democratic {{nominee for}} the United States Senate against {{incumbent}} Mitch McConnell. Governor Wallace G. Wilkinson, angry that Sloane had not supported {{him in the}} 1987 gubernatorial primary, had John Brock, the state superintendent of public instruction, run against Sloane in the Democratic primary for the Senate <b>seat,</b> <b>exhausting</b> some of Sloane's resources. Wilkinson refused to assist Sloane {{in the general election}} and the state Democratic party leadership, following the governor's lead, did little to assist Sloane. Despite these obstacles Sloane held McConnell to 52% of the vote but McConnell was reelected.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{designed}} and built to run on leaded fuel may require modification to run on unleaded gasoline or autogas. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed {{to compensate for the}} relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of hardened <b>exhaust</b> valves and <b>seats.</b> Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder head gaskets and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons. The availability of high-octane unleaded gasoline (or LPG) has reduced or eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.|$|R
