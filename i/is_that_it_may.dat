25|$|Today, {{the main}} users of Kunrei-shiki are native {{speakers}} of Japanese, especially within Japan, and linguists studying Japanese. The main advantage of Kunrei-shiki {{is that it}} is better able to illustrate Japanese grammar, as Hepburn preserves the irregularity of certain conjugations (see table, right). The most serious problem of Hepburn in this context <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> change the stem of a verb, which is not reflected in the underlying morphology of the language. One notable introductory textbook for English-speakers, Eleanor Jorden's , uses her JSL romanization, a system strongly influenced by Kunrei-shiki in its adherence to Japanese phonology, but it is adapted to teaching proper pronunciation of Japanese phonemes.|$|E
25|$|Although Kabbalah propounds the Unity of God, one of {{the most}} serious and {{sustained}} criticisms <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> lead away from monotheism, and instead promote dualism, the belief that there is a supernatural counterpart to God. The dualistic system holds that there is a good power versus an evil power. There are two primary models of Gnostic-dualistic cosmology: the first, which goes back to Zoroastrianism, believes creation is ontologically divided between good and evil forces; the second, found largely in Greco-Roman metaphysics like Neo-Platonism, argues that the universe knew a primordial harmony, but that a cosmic disruption yielded a second, evil, dimension to reality. This second model influenced the cosmology of the Kabbalah.|$|E

25|$|Some drives use special {{techniques}}, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, {{to write}} more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently {{deviations from the}} Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group {{and will not be}} archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2GiB with GigaRec or 1.8GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a proprietary data storage format, assuming that it works reliably as designed, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware used to read the media if it fails, is damaged, or is lost after its original vendor discontinues it.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} of drag in road vehicles {{has led to}} increases in the top {{speed of the vehicle}} and the vehicle's fuel efficiency, as well as many other performance characteristics, such as handling and acceleration. The two main factors that impact drag are the frontal area of the vehicle and the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is a unit-less value that denotes how much an object resists movement through a fluid such as water or air. A potential complication of altering a vehicle's aerodynamics <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> cause the vehicle to get too much lift. Lift is an aerodynamic force that flows perpendicular to the airflow around the body of the vehicle. Too much lift can cause the vehicle to lose road traction which can be very unsafe. Lowering the drag coefficient comes from streamlining the exterior body of the vehicle. Streamlining the body requires assumptions about the surrounding airspeed and characteristic use of the vehicle.|$|E
500|$|National parliamentarians also {{generally}} have staff and money, which could ease the funding {{issues associated with}} forming a new world parliamentary assembly. Delegates to a directly elected UNPA, on the other hand, would {{have more time to}} devote to the global assembly, since its members would not be occupied with duties relating to their membership in their national legislature. Heinrich points out strategic advantages of an indirectly elected UNPA: [...] "Another advantage to basing representation in a UN Parliamentary Assembly on national parliaments <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> engage parliamentarians as allies in the cause of getting the assembly established, and, later, helping to build the political will for its evolution. The experience of being a UN parliamentarian will galvanize many of these politicians into going home as advocates for the UN, including the need for strengthening and democratizing the UN Parliamentary Assembly itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{lost much}} of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia, looking to defend {{recently}} acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke. According to John Davies, this endeavour may have been with the agreement of Powys king Elisedd ap Gwylog, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave Oswestry to Powys. Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter. King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this consultative initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke (...) [...] Davies wrote of Cyril Fox's study of Offa's Dyke: [...] "In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes {{in the hands of the}} Welsh; near Rhiwabon, it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden." [...] And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built [...] "on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent." [...] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. Offa's Dyke largely remained the frontier between the Welsh and English, though the Welsh would recover by the 12th century the area between the Dee (...) and the Conwy, known then as Y Berfeddwlad. By the 8th century, the eastern borders with the Anglo-Saxons had broadly been set.|$|E

Subnational governments newly endowed with both financial resources and the freedom to spend them will, some have said, tend to spend too much, tax too little, borrow excessively, and generally to behave in a fiscally irresponsible fashion (Prud'homme, 1995, Tanzi, 1996).

2500|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this design <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> require the more intense {{use of a}} toilet brush to remove bits of feces that may have left marks on the shelf.

2500|$|The main {{objection}} to directed panspermia <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> interfere with local {{life at the}} targets.

[...] However, this probability can be minimized by targeting newly forming planetary systems, accretion discs and star-forming clouds, where local life, and especially advanced life, could not have emerged yet. If there is local life that is fundamentally different, the colonizing [...] microorganisms may not harm it. If there is local organic gene/protein life, it may exchange genes with the colonizing microorganisms, increasing galactic biodiversity.|$|E

[...] In particular, parents of Angelman children {{have been known to}} take such additional measures as cutting the feet off the sleeper and putting it on backwards, and/or covering the zipper with duct tape. [...] Some specialty locking clothing and other adaptive clothing purveyors offer blanket sleepers, with or without feet, for adults with dementia or other disabilities, for similar reasons.|$|E

2500|$|In fact, one of {{the most}} {{imperative}} critiques of OFT <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not be truly testable, at all. [...] This issue arises whenever there is a discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual observations. [...] It is difficult to tell whether model is fundamentally wrong or whether a specific variable has been inaccurately identified or left out. [...] Because it is possible to add on endless plausible modifications to the model, the model of optimality may never be rejected. This creates the problem of researchers shaping their model to fit their observations, rather than rigorously testing their hypotheses about the animal's foraging behavior.|$|E
