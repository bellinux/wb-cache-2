5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E
5|$|East of San Diego, US 80 {{followed}} {{the path of}} El Cajon Boulevard through La Mesa and then onto Main Street near downtown El Cajon before heading towards the Mountain Springs grade. The route was realigned from Arnold Way onto Alpine Boulevard as it passed through Alpine and the Viejas Indian Reservation, before entering the Laguna Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest on the alignment used by I-8. At Laguna Junction, a cafe for travelers existed from 1916 until when the building was taken down to provide land for the interchange with I-8. A section of old US 80 — with the first few miles signed as SR 79 — continues to serve as access to the communities of Descanso, Guatay and Pine Valley; SR 79 intersected US 80 east of Descanso. At the time, the Ellis Wayside Rest provided a rest area for travelers; later, the state recognized it as a historic site. Exiting the national forest, US 80 continued in a southeasterly direction towards Live Oak Springs and Boulevard, intersecting with the eastern terminus of SR 94. US 80 then came close to the Mexican border as it curved around the Jacumba Mountains and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> spring town of Jacumba. East of there, US 80 passed by the Desert View Tower.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} step, the molded {{component}} and core are both demolded and the core is melted-out from the molding. This {{is done in}} a hot bath, via induction heating, or {{through a combination of}} the two. Hot baths usually use a tub filled with glycol or Lutron, which is a phenol-based liquid. The bath temperature is slightly higher than that of the core alloy’s melting point, but not so high that it damages the molding. In typical commercial applications the parts are dipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> bath via an overhead conveyor. The advantage to using a hot bath is that it is simpler than induction heating and it helps cure thermoset moldings. The disadvantage is that it is uneconomically slow at a cycle time of 60 to 90 minutes and it poses environmental cleanup issues. Typically the hot bath solution needs cleaning or replacement every year or every half year when used in combination with induction heating.|$|E
25|$|This is {{so because}} the energy {{released}} in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, {{is proportional to}} the area of the fault that ruptures and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> mantle, are the only parts of our planet which can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 degrees Celsius flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes. The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1000nbsp&km. Examples are the earthquakes in Chile, 1960; Alaska, 1957; Sumatra, 2004, all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939) and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.|$|E

500|$|Kings Bowl Lava Field erupted {{during a}} single fissure {{eruption}} {{on the southern}} part of the Great Rift about 2,250 years ago. This eruption probably lasted only a few hours to a few days. The field preserves explosion pits, lava lakes, squeeze-ups, basalt mounds, and an ash blanket. The Wapi Lava Field probably formed from a fissure eruption at the same time as the Kings Bowl eruption. More prolonged activity over a period of months to a few years led to the formation of low shield volcanos in the Wapi field. The Bear Trap lava tube, between the Craters of the Moon and the Wapi lava fields, is a cave system more than [...] long. The lava tube is remarkable for its length and for the number of well-preserved lava cave features, such as lava stalactites and curbs, the latter marking high stands of the flowing lava frozen on the lava tube walls. The lava tubes and pit craters of the monument are known for their unusual preservation of winter ice and snow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> summer months, due to shielding from the sun and the insulating properties of basalt.|$|E

500|$|Just {{outside the}} walls of the city, on the {{floodplain}} of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it. From the cold room one moved to a vestibule {{at the corner of the}} building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters [...]|$|E
