5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents in the subway.|$|E

He <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown {{even though there was}} no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E

New Directions glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) are now sharing an apartment and a bed. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad, is running for Congress but doing badly in the polls. Glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) is now a senior, while fellow members Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) are juniors.

25|$|In the 1950s, Roger Sperry {{developed}} split-brain preparations in non-human primates {{that emphasized}} the importance of information transfer that occurred in these neocortical connections. For example, learning on simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and motor output to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with epilepsy who had undergone split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer {{from one side of the}} brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for lateralization of function in the human brain.|$|E
25|$|The third tale, Guardian of the Solar System, {{finds the}} house and Sara finally separating. She trades places with a man named Robert, to whom she had told stories and granted wishes for many years. The trade, Robert's final wish, gives him {{the ability to do}} almost anything, {{although}} it necessitates sacrificing his body. Sara is suddenly reborn in a new version of her original body, albeit slightly older and with a thousand years of memories. However, she <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> happened to the real Sara after she left the house. This new Sara feels lost in this new world, so Robert grants her final wish. The TARDIS materializes in front of her; inside it, the Doctor (implied to be an incarnation other than the first) wonders what force dragged it down to Earth.|$|E

Twilight undergoes a transformation and returns to Ponyville as a winged unicorn known as an alicorn. Her friends are amazed and happily welcome her change, while Celestia announces that Twilight is no longer her student, but a princess who has demonstrated leadership and other positive attributes from her friends during her stay in Ponyville. Twilight becomes concerned that she <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> to do now as {{she is no longer}} Celestia's student, but Celestia promises that they will all help each other to learn what may come in the future. Twilight is officially crowned in a grand celebration in Canterlot, and she thanks her friends for being there to help her.|$|E
25|$|On another {{modeling}} shoot, Erica has {{an accident}} and suffers injuries to her back. With the help of Dr. Jonathan Kinder, she becomes addicted to the medication she takes for her injury. Dimitri tries to warn her about Jonathan, but she will not listen, thus putting a strain on their marriage again. While {{under the influence of}} the increasingly higher doses of drugs Jonathan gives her, Erica has sex with him. Her dependence on her supplier grows until she finally has to admit she has an addiction and checks herself into the Betty Ford Center. Once she is out, Erica and Dimitri start finding their way back to each other. This does not sit well with Jonathan. The doctor drugs Erica and tricks Dimitri into thinking they are still sleeping together. After seeing his wife in bed with another man, Dimitri files for divorce and finds comfort with an equally as devastated Maria Santos Grey. Erica <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> Jonathan did or why Dimitri is angry with her. Dimitri shuts her out and refuses to explain why he divorced her. Erica does not find out what happened until she and her new friends Janet Green and Skye Chandler (each of whom was wronged by Kinder) corner Jonathan and he confesses. He gets the upper hand on the women and is about to assault Erica when Dimitri comes to her rescue. Jonathan is sent to prison.|$|E

By the end of the night, Dwight has put exorbitant amounts on the items and ends up accidentally donating over $34,000. He flees when he discovers his mistake. Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) tries to talk with Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) by complaining about the food. She suggests they get a taco at her expense, offering thirty dollars to Darryl {{to go out and buy}} some.

[...] Farrell {{explained}} the motivation he gave to the character, stating [...] "This guy thinks he's God's gift to women, God's gift to intellect, to humor, to the club scene, to everything. It's all part of his grandiose sense of self-esteem, which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt, {{and all kinds of}} other things. With Pellit, Seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible." [...] Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot-belly and an affinity for Chinese dragons.|$|E

Q provided a two-out-of-five-stars rating and commented that [...] "Sadly, bra-burning rhetoric and gospel warbling make poor substitutes for addictive songs". AllMusic's editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also wrote {{a negative}} review, commenting that the album is [...] "the sound of an artist who was given too much freedom too early and <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> to do with it". Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles also provided a negative review, commenting that Stripped [...] "is a blast of excess that risks alienating Ms. Aguilera's old fans without luring new ones, and it's bursting with misguided energy".|$|E

In a later episode, Ebert ranked A Simple Plan at number four on his list of the [...] "Best Films of 1998". Online film critic James Berardinelli praised Billy Bob Thornton's performance as being [...] "the most striking that A Simple Plan has to offer." [...] He also praised the other performers, writing [...] "Paxton's part is deceptively complex {{in the way he}} shows how paranoia, greed, and deception can erode the conscience of even the best-intentioned of men. Brent Briscoe plays Lou as the most untrustworthy and avaricious of souls. And Bridget Fonda offers solid support as a woman who stands by her man – when she's not taking control of his life, that is." [...] After Paxton's death in February 2017, Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com cited his performance as Hank Mitchell to be Paxton's career best, stating that [...] "The film might constitute Paxton’s most sorrowful performance as well as his most frightening... an outwardly ordinary man who <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> kind of evil he’s capable of".|$|E

2500|$|Brief vignettes {{featuring}} McKinney and McCulloch {{as a pair}} of Toronto {{city police}} officers, usually standing beside their squad car, making banal small-talk while rarely doing actual police work.

The characters originated in the full-length sketch [...] "On the Run", in which the two cops try to pursue a group of escaped convicts without looking conspicuous. According to DVD commentary, McKinney and McCulloch, during a break in shooting that particular sketch, began to improvise several short scenes revolving around those two characters for fun; some of their improvisations were incorporated into the show, and proved so popular they became a fixture. The duo have the distinction of being the show's most frequently used recurring characters; they were also carried over into Brain Candy and Death Comes to Town.|$|E
