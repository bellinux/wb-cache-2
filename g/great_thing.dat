He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E

Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to put on television", as, while audiences have seen gay characters isolated and attacked, they have rarely seen them ultimately winning and triumphing. He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline".

[...] She said of its role in illustrating feminist issues, [...] "I mean, if Nannygate hadn't existed, what a <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to make up as a way of talking about it."
