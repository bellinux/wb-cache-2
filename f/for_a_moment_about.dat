6000|$|Dick {{drew a deep}} breath, {{and even}} after Belding had {{departed}} he forgot <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the letter in his hand. Then he unfolded the paper and read: ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> {{introducing}} {{this remarkable}} ambassador into Lucilla's bedroom. One {{look at him}} decided me. After all, he was a doctor,--and such an ugly one! I took his arm.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{could answer}} she stood upon the threshold, I saw the {{delightful}} little smile fade {{from her lips}} as she looked in. She hesitated, and seemed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> to retreat.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bounderby knew it {{was somewhere}} down town, but knew no more {{respecting}} it. So they stopped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> looking <b>about.</b>|$|R
60|$|The visitor chatted {{carelessly}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>about</b> {{the gossip}} {{of the city}} and the university, and then took up another topic.|$|R
60|$|Carrie {{was silent}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{thinking}} <b>about</b> Evelyn. The girl had, so to speak, dazzled Jim. Carrie did not approve, {{but could not}} meddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "A thought {{has just}} struck me," [...] said Mrs. Gallilee. [...] "Please {{shut the door}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>About</b> that meeting between you and my niece? Perhaps, I am taking a morbid view?" ...|$|E
60|$|He beckoned to the maître d'hôtel {{and talked}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the luncheon. Then {{he ordered a}} table for the next day, and {{slipping}} a louis into the man's hand, leaned over and whispered in his ear.|$|E
6000|$|Christina {{rose and}} moved <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the room. Then turning suddenly, [...] "You don't believe in me!" [...] she cried; [...] "not a grain! I don't know what I {{would not give}} to force you to believe in me!" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the mention}} of her name the girl blushed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and seemed <b>about</b> to say something, but stopped.|$|R
60|$|The harsh {{tone of his}} reproof and the scowl {{upon his}} haughty face, gave her pause <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> He turned <b>about.</b>|$|R
60|$|The prince hesitated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> as if <b>about</b> to speak, {{but with}} an effort {{controlled}} himself, and bowing deeply to his mother, left the room.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How can you {{hesitate}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> this girl?' said Dare, {{pointing to}} the bent figure of the old man. 'Think of the satisfaction {{it would be to}} him to see his son within the family walls again. It should be a religion with you to compass such a legitimate end as this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Annerly, [...] "every day. For {{some time}} before his {{marriage}} I saw but little of him. But two weeks before that event was due to happen, I passed Q {{one day in the}} street. He seemed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> to stop, then he raised his hat, smiled and passed on." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dalrymple thought <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> {{his picture}} and about Mrs. Van Siever. What had he better do? He wanted to behave well, {{and he felt}} that the old woman had {{something}} of justice on her side. [...] "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "I will not sell this picture; but it shall be destroyed, if you wish it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is enough," [...] said Mr. Lind, gravely, beginning, to busy {{himself with}} the writing materials. Marian <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> seemed <b>about</b> to protest against this dismissal. Then she checked herself and {{went out of the}} room, closing the door quite quietly behind her, thereby unconsciously terrifying her father, who had {{calculated}} on a slam.|$|R
6000|$|The party paused <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and were}} <b>about</b> to pass on, their faces showing how deep was their horror at the scene, {{when one of}} them exclaimed: ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Cadurcis made no reply, though <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{he seemed}} <b>about</b> to speak; he bowed, and, as Venetia {{approached}} her aunt, {{he turned his}} steps in a different direction.|$|R
60|$|Lois {{opened the}} gate and stole into the lane with {{the air of a}} guilty child. She gave a little gasp as she {{came face to face with}} Saton, and picking up her skirts, seemed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> to fly. He stood quite still--his face was sad--almost reproachful. She dropped her skirt and came slowly, doubtfully towards him.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} lamp {{from the table}} and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the door a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face and lingered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> his lips. Yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked in}} silence {{along the narrow}} path. Soon they reached {{the edge of the}} river. A few steps further on was a seat, of which they took possession. In the {{distance}} the gondola, on fire now with lamps, was playing a waltz. A bat flew <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> their heads. Somewhere in the woods a long way down the river a nightingale was singing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see it daily," [...] said Colonel Keith; and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{he seemed}} <b>about</b> to add something, but checked himself, and took {{advantage}} of an interruption to change the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|He glanced towards Mary Scott, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> seemed <b>about</b> {{to include}} her in some {{forthcoming}} remark. But whatever {{it might have}} been--it was never made. She kept her eyes averted, and though her self-possession was absolutely unruffled she hastened her departure. [...] "I am not hurrying you, Mr. Brooks?" [...] she asked. [...] "Not in the least," [...] he assured her.|$|R
60|$|The man's {{red skin}} faded to a yellow-gray--the {{color of his}} beard. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he seemed <b>about</b> to fall, then the blood came surging back; his cheeks grew purple with its weight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but I did {{not believe}} them, Chebron. Of course I did not for a moment--at least not <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> you. But when I thought of those bad men at the gate, and the crash we heard, and {{the noise of the}} people rushing in shouting, I thought--I was afraid--that perhaps it might be true about our father. But, oh, Chebron, surely it is not so?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pike strode up {{and down}} the poop, rubbing his hands, which he was too disdainfully happy to mitten, chuckling and {{grinning}} to himself, glancing at the draw of every sail, stealing adoring looks astern into the gray of snow out of which blew the favouring wind. He even paused beside me to gossip <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the French restaurants of San Francisco and how, therein, the delectable California fashion of cooking wild duck obtained.|$|E
6000|$|He seized her hand. She {{struggled}} not {{to disengage}} herself; her head sank upon her arm, which rested upon his shoulder. Overpowered, she sobbed convulsively. He endeavoured to calm her, but her agitation increased; and minutes elapsed ere {{she seemed to}} be even sensible of his presence. At length she became more calm, and apparently making a struggle to compose herself, she raised her head and said, [...] "This is very weak let us walk <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the room!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> I hesitated <b>about</b> {{opening the}} letters. Then I {{reflected}} {{that both of}} the men were plotting against my welfare, and I opened one of the epistles without any further compunction.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed her}} desk and he stood {{watching}} her. She was wearing an extraordinarily masculine garb--a covert-coating riding costume, with breeches and riding boots concealed under a long coat--but she contrived, somehow, to remain altogether feminine. She stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> looking <b>about</b> her, as though wondering whether there were anything else to be done, a capable figure, attractive because of her earnest self-possession.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{she seemed}} <b>about</b> to refuse. Then she flung herself into his easy-chair, took a cigarette, and, holding it between her lips, almost scarlet against the pallor of her cheeks, {{stretched}} upwards towards the match {{which he was}} holding.|$|R
6000|$|It {{may be that}} Ovid now {{and then}} comes near to writing vers de societe, only he never {{troubles}} himself <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "decorum of the boudoir." [...] Do you remember the lines on the ring which he gave his lady? They are the origin and pattern of all the verses written by lovers on that pretty metempsychosis which shall make them slippers, or fans, or girdles, like Waller's, and like that which bound [...] "the dainty, dainty waist" [...] of the Miller's Daughter.|$|E
60|$|She {{rang the}} bell and ordered tea. Tallente glanced <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the room. The four walls were lined with well-filled bookcases, but the mural decorations consisted--except for one {{wonderful}} nude figure, copy of a well-known Rodin--of statistical charts and shaded maps. There were only two signs of feminine occupation: an immense bowl of red roses, rising with strange effect from the sea of manuscript, pamphlets, and volumes of reference, and a wide, luxurious couch, drawn up to the window, through which the tops of a little clump of lime trees were just visible. As {{she turned back to}} him, he noticed with more complete appreciation the lines of her ample but graceful figure, the more remarkable because she was neither tall nor slim.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Inspector Jacks, however, had {{apparently}} no further use, {{for the present}} at any rate, for his medical friend. On the other hand, Dr. Spencer Whiles was not left wholly to himself. On the fourth day after his visit to London a motor car drew up outside his modest surgery door, and with an excitement which he found {{it almost impossible to}} conceal, he saw a plainly dressed young man, evidently a foreigner and, he believed, a Japanese, descend and ring the patients' bell. The doctor had dismissed his boy a week ago, from sheer inability to pay his modest wages, and he did not hesitate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> opening the door himself. The man outside raised his hat and made him a sweeping bow.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was rather}} a {{difficult}} question to answer; and Frank was not very quick in attempting it. [...] "I know you will not forgive me," [...] he said at last; [...] "and, indeed, I do not see how you can. I don't know how it came about; but this is certain, Miss Dunstable; I have never <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> thought <b>about</b> your fortune; that is, thought {{about it in the}} way of coveting it." ...|$|R
60|$|Crawshay {{walked slowly}} along the deck until he found a {{completely}} sheltered spot. Then he summoned the deck steward and superintended the arrangement of his deck chair, which was almost hidden under a heap of rugs. He had just adjusted a pair of spectacles and was preparing to settle down when Katharine, in her nurse's uniform, issued from the companionway and stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> looking <b>about</b> her. Crawshay at once raised his cap.|$|R
60|$|The tarag stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> looking <b>about</b> him--first up at {{the vast}} {{audience}} and then about the arena. He {{did not seem to}} see me at all, but his eyes fell presently upon the girl. A hideous roar broke from his titanic lungs--a roar which ended in a long-drawn scream that is more human than the death-cry of a tortured woman--more human but more awesome. I could scarce restrain a shudder.|$|R
