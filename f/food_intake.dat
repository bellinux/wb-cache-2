40|$|Aim. - Studies {{in vitro}} have {{highlighted}} the potential involvement of neuregulin 1 (NRG 1) {{in the regulation}} of energy metabolism. This effect has also been suggested in vivo, as intracerebroventricular injection of NRG 1 reduces <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> and weight gain in rodents. Thus, it was hypothesised that NRG 1 might affect serum leptin levels in mice. Methods. - Weight, <b>food</b> <b>intakes,</b> energy expenditure, spontaneous physical activity and serum leptin levels were evaluated in normal-weight C 57 BL/ 6 JRJ mice following intraperitoneal administration of NRG 1 (50 mu g/kg, three times/week) or saline for 8 weeks. Based {{on the results of}} this first experiment, leptin-resistant obese db/db mice were then given NRG 1 for 8 weeks. Results. - Leptin serum concentrations were six times higher in C 57 BL/ 6 JRJ mice treated with NRG 1 than in the animals given saline. NRG 1 treatment also reduced weight gain by 10 % and <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> by 15 % compared with saline treatment, while energy expenditure remained unchanged. In db/db mice, serum leptin concentrations, weight gain, <b>food</b> <b>intakes,</b> energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity were not altered by NRG 1 treatment. Conclusion. - The decrease in <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> and weight gain associated with NRG 1 treatment in C 57 BL/ 6 JRJ mice may be partly explained by increased leptin levels, whereas db/db mice were not affected by the treatment, suggesting resistance to NRG 1 in this pathological state...|$|R
40|$|Elaidic acid is {{the main}} unnatural trans fatty acid isomer {{occurring}} during partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils used as ingredients for the formulation of processed foods. The main objective is to assess associations between processed <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> and plasma phospholipid elaidic acid concentrations within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. A cross-sectional study {{was used to determine}} fatty acid profiles in 3, 003 subjects from 16 centers. Single 24 -h dietary recalls (24 -HDR) were collected using a standardized computerized interview program. <b>Food</b> <b>intakes</b> were computed according to their degree of processing (moderately/nonprocessed foods, processed staple foods, highly processed foods). Adjusted ecological and individual correlations were calculated between processed <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> and plasma elaidic acid levels. At the population level, mean intakes of highly processed foods were strongly correlated with mean levels of plasma elaidic acid in men (P = 0. 0016) and in women (P = 0. 0012). At the individual level, these associations remained but at a much lower level in men (r = 0. 08, P = 0. 006) and in women (r = 0. 09, P = 0. 0001). The use of an averaged 24 -HDR measure of highly processed <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> is adequate for predicting mean levels of plasma elaidic acid among European populations...|$|R

Fruit intake, especially apples and pears, were negatively associated with the relative abundance of bacteria related to Ruminococcus gnavus.

40|$|Ghrelin {{increases}} <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> {{and body}} weight. Bombesin decreases <b>food</b> <b>intakes</b> and inhibits the stimulatory effect of Ghrelin on <b>food</b> <b>intakes.</b> Thyroid hormones have {{a crucial role}} in the regulation of body weight and yet the effect of bombesin on thyroid axis activity is not fully clear. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of different doses of Ghrelin or bombesin on mean plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), Triiodothyronine (T 3) and Thyroxin (T 4) concentration and also, the effect of interaction between Ghrelin and bombesin on thyroid axis activity. Forty-nine rats in seven groups received saline or different doses of Ghrelin (4, 10 or 15 nmol) and bombesin (2. 5, 5 or 10 nmol) and forty-two rats in six groups received simultaneous injection of Ghrelin (10 or 15 nmol) and different doses of bombesin (2. 5, 5 or 10 nmol) via lateral cerebral ventricle. Blood samples were collected via decapitation 20 min after the injection and plasma was assayed for plasma TSH, T 3 and T 4 concentration by Radioimmunoassay (RIA). Ghrelin significantly decreased the concentration of mean plasma thyroid hormones compared to saline. Bombesin did not significantly increase thyroid hormones concentration compared to saline but bombesin blocked the inhibitory effect of Ghrelin on thyroid axis activity.

5|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} contains orexinergic neurons {{that control}} appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system.

The hypothalamus also {{plays a role in}} thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever. The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys – when blood pressure falls, the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink.

5|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} pathophysiological mechanisms {{involved in the}} development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. While leptin and ghrelin are produced peripherally, they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Walruses live {{to about}} 20–30 {{years old in}} the wild. The males reach sexual {{maturity}} as early as seven years, but do not typically mate until fully developed at around 15 years of age.

The females are polyestrous, coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are fertile only around February; the potential fertility of this second period is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March, peaking in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays.

5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower <b>food</b> <b>intake</b> than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
