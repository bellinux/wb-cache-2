However, the more the surface roughness becomes smooth, the more the grinding marks become remarkable. The <b>grinding</b> <b>mark</b> deteriorates the uniformity of ground surface.

40|$|The {{light weight}} {{property}} {{as well as}} high corrosion resistance of aluminium alloy has increased their demand especially in automobile industries. Aluminium alloy {{as a matter of}} fact has a low melting point and high ductility that severely adhere to the cutting tool surface and cause deterioration of chip evacuation. This problem often resulting in tools breakage. In this paper, in order to impart functions of anti-adhesion, we propose a technique by controlling the grinding marks micro texture on the tool surface by using the blast polishing treatment without any coating technologies. The results show that the tool which underwent polishing treatment reduces the cutting force as well as the aluminium adherence during the initial cutting process, and become worst as the process cutting continues. These results indicate that <b>grinding</b> <b>mark</b> texture improves the anti-adhesion by reducing the contact area during cutting and provide storage for the lubricant. In addition, too much polishing on the tool surface may remove these textures and resultantly worsen the tool performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{unidirectional}} grinding marks were created {{on a set}} of steel plates. Sliding experiments were then conducted with the prepared steel plates using Al-Mg alloy pins and an inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester. The goals of the experiments were to ascertain the influence of inclination angle and <b>grinding</b> <b>mark</b> direction on friction and transfer layer formation during sliding contact. The inclination angle of the plate was held at 0. 2 deg, 0. 6 deg, 1 deg, 1. 4 deg, 1. 8 deg, 2. 2 deg, and 2. 6 deg in the tests. The pins were slid both perpendicular and parallel to the grinding marks direction. The experiments were conducted under both dry and lubricated conditions on each plate in an ambient environment. Results showed that the coefficient of friction and the formation of transfer layer depend on the grinding marks direction and inclination angle of the hard surfaces. For a given inclination angle, under both dry and lubricated conditions, the coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation were found to be greater when the pins slid perpendicular to the unidirectional grinding marks than when the pins slid parallel to the grinding marks. In addition, a stick-slip phenomenon was observed under lubricated conditions at the highest inclination angle for sliding perpendicular to the grinding marks direction. This phenomenon could be attributed to the extent of plane strain conditions taking place at the asperity level during sliding. DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4002604...|$|E

The numerical research work of this thesis is done by conducting a three dimensional (3 -D) finite element analysis (FEA) of UVAG process. A 3 -D FEA model is developed to study the edge chipping commonly observed in UVAG of ceramics. Edge chippings not only compromises geometric accuracy but also possibly causes an increase in machining cost. A solution to reduce the edge chipping is proposed based upon the FEA simulations and validated by pilot experiments. Several experimental studies are conducted to provide new knowledge for the UVAG process. Firstly, a novel coolant delivery system is explored for UVAG machine system.

A toothed wheel has a simple geometry with a peripheral surface similar to a saw. The teeth disturb the generation of the coolant flux layer and noticeably decrease the hydrodynamic force. Furthermore, the toothed wheel increases the net grinding force due to the tangential cutting edge. This study simulated the hydrodynamic pressure in the grinding process and validated the flat surface grinding results by varying the tooth geometry.

In the present study, unidirectional and random surface finishes were produced on hardened steel plate surfaces.

Recently, Cubic-Boron-Nitride (CBN) has received a considerable attention as a material for cutting tools and has already established itself in many areas of machining. However, the performance of CBN tools is still insufficient in practical use, especially in the high speed machining of Inconel 718. To overcome this problem, we first conducted orthogonal cutting experiments on Inconel 718 in a wide range of cutting speeds (20 m/min - 300 m/min) in order to clarify the wear mechanisms of the CBN tool in high speed machining. As a result, it was found that the micro tool surface topography, such as <b>grinding</b> <b>marks</b> on the tool rake face, has a significant impact on the progression of the crater wear of the CBN tool when the cutting speed was increased to over 100 m/min.

The condition categorized as {open_quotes}low strength{close_quote} grinding used a coarse 80 grit wheel and produced low flexure strength due to machining-induced flaws in the surface. The other condition, regarded as {open_quotes}high strength grinding,{close_quotes} utilized a 320 grit wheel and produced a flexural strength nearly 70 % greater. Grinding wheel surface speeds were 35 and 47 m/s. Reciprocating sliding tests were conducted following the procedure described in a newly-published ASTM standard (G- 133) for linearly-reciprocating wear. Tests were performed in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the <b>grinding</b> <b>marks</b> (lay) using a 25 N load, 5 Hz reciprocating frequency, 10 mm stroke length, and 100 m of sliding at room temperature. The effects of sliding direction relative to the lay were more pronounced for stainless steel than for silicon nitride sliders. The wear of stainless steel was less than the wear of the silicon nitride slider materials because of the formation of transfer particles which covered the sharp edges of the silicon nitride grinding grooves and reduced abrasive contact.

In the fracture tests the influences of the backside grinding and the stress relief processes were investigated. The test dies were fabricated using the Dicing-before-Grinding (DBG) process with different mesh sizes of the grinding wheel. Additionally dry polishing and plasma etching were applied as stress relief processes. Bending tests are commonly used for the strength characterization of brittle materials like ceramics and silicon. The ball-ring-test was conducted to exclude edge effects on the strength, which are still under investigation in an additional part of the study. It was found that the determined fracture stresses follow a three-parametric Weibull distribution. The surface topography and roughness, respectively, was measured via LSM. TEM was applied to determine the structure of the surface-near damage-layer. In addition to the experimental investigations numerical calculations by means of Finite Element Simulations were performed in order to calculate critical fracture stresses from testing including anisotropic and geometric nonlinear effects. Furthermore, a submodeling-technique was applied to understand the effects of experimentally observed surface states on the critical stress, i. e. roughness, <b>grinding</b> <b>marks,</b> flaws, and poly Si-layers. Detailed modeling included local modeling of surface roughness on the critical strength...|$|R
5000|$|... "Monkey Business" [...] {{is a song}} by Skid Row. It was {{the first}} single from their second album, Slave to the <b>Grind</b> and <b>marked</b> their change from hard-hitting glam metal to overall heavy metal. The song {{is one of their}} best known songs. The single was {{released}} in 1991 and was written by bandmates Rachel Bolan and Dave [...] "the Snake" [...] Sabo. The song was the biggest hit on Slave to the Grind and although the song didn't make the top 40 it reached #13 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and still gets heavy airplay on rock radio stations. The video got heavy rotation on MTV and catapulted the album to double-platinum status. Along with [...] "Youth Gone Wild" [...] from their first album, it is considered their signature song.|$|R
