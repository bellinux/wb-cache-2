5000|$|Another {{reason for}} the recent attacks by JFS were airstrikes {{conducted}} by the United States Air Force earlier in January, which killed more than 100 Jihadists belonging to the group. <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> accused rival opposition groups of providing targeting information to the United States. In a statement released by <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> the group claimed its attacks were to [...] "prevent conspiracies" [...] against them.|$|R

5000|$|Al-Nusra Front or Jabhat al-Nusra ( [...] جبهة النصرة), {{known as}} the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (جبهة فتح الشام, transliteration: <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fataḥ</b> al-Šām) after July 2016, and also {{described}} as al-Qaeda in Syria or al-Qaeda in the Levant, is a Salafist jihadist terrorist organization fighting against Syrian government forces in the Syrian Civil War, {{with the aim of}} establishing an Islamic state in the country.

50|$|In July <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> kidnapped the American {{journalist}} Lindsey Snell {{in northern}} Syria. She escaped to Turkey's Hatay Province in August and was subsequently arrested by Turkish authorities {{for being in}} a military exclusion zone and imprisoned.|$|E
50|$|Jaish al-Fatah {{declared}} its formation on 24 March 2015. On the same day, a pro-opposition source claimed that about fifty Syrian government soldiers defected {{to the new}} group. As columnist David Ignatius reported, Qatar, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia were the primary sponsors of the new coalition that was led by al-Nusra. Since the very beginning, the three states allegedly provided conspicuous material support to the group, mostly consisting of weapons and military equipment. In 2016, shortly after al-Nusra changed its name in <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> Financial Times reporter Erica Solomon quoted rebels and activists claiming that Qatar and Saudi Arabia were consistently ferrying in cash and supplies to support a military offensive in Aleppo directed by <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham.</b>|$|E
50|$|On January 2, 2017, {{rebel groups}} {{said that they}} would {{disengage}} from planned talks after alleged ceasefire violations by Government forces in the Wadi Barada valley near Damascus. The government says the region is excluded from the ceasefire {{because of the presence of}} <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> but some local activists deny that they have a presence there. At the end of January, government forces managed to capture Wadi Barada and the water supply of Damascus was restored.|$|R
50|$|The next day, the Army made {{advances}} in the Mayssar district, after capturing the al-Helwaniyah and al-Jazmati roundabouts. At this point, two kilometers were separating the advancing Army units from the government-held Citadel of Aleppo. Later in the day, government troops captured Mayssar, {{as well as the}} Dahret Awwad district. The Army then continued to converge on Aleppo's Old City, securing the al-Qaterrji and al-Tahhan districts, and advancing into Qadi Askar. They also captured the Eye Hospital and came within 500-1,000 meters of the Citadel and isolating the remaining districts northeast of it. Government troops also advanced at the al-Sha'ar district, with some rebels already withdrawing in anticipation of its fall. Subsequently, that night, the Army made more {{advances in}} Sha'ar. Meanwhile, <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> fighters along with their allies raided a warehouse containing weapons, food, and gas. The warehouse was guarded by Jaysh al-Islam and the guards, including a commander, were detained. This caused dissatisfaction among the civilian population in rebel-held areas amid poor living conditions and a lack of food and supplies. The <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> fighters also reportedly arrested 150 Jaysh al-Islam fighters under the charges they were going to surrender to the advancing government forces.|$|R
5000|$|Allegations of NATO {{involvement}} have circulated among {{government officials}} and commentators, as well as involvement by the jihadist movements of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> (formerly known as Al-Nusra Front/al-Qaeda in Syria) - two groups which Turkey {{has been accused of}} supporting in the past - have been made. Turkish authorities are reportedly investigating Aydintas' links to the Gülen movement; in a speech, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan claimed that the perpetrator was a member of [...] "FETÖ". The attack was praised by ISIL and al-Qaeda affiliated accounts on social media. The words spoken by the assassin are similar to the unofficial anthem of <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham.</b>|$|E
50|$|While ISIL has not claimed {{responsibility}} for the assassination, it has been celebrated by its supporters.

50|$|A day later, the Army took {{full control}} of Wadi Barada. Maintenance workers were sent by the {{government}} to fix the Al-Fijeh Springs thus restoring the water supply to 5 million people who reside in Greater Damascus. Later on, the first buses carrying rebels left for Idlib, while al-Masdar News reported that some <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> fighters attacked other opposition groups in Kafr az Zayt due to disagreements over the ceasefire.|$|E
50|$|On 29 December, Syrian {{government}} and opposition delegations agreed on talks {{to achieve a}} ceasefire at Wadi Barada. Rebels from both the FSA and <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> would be given free passage to the Idlib Governorate in exchange of the rebel surrender of Wadi Barada west of Damascus.

50|$|Soon, the {{evacuation}} had begun, and around noon, {{the first wave}} of evacuees reached rebel-held territory to the west of Aleppo. Nearly 1,000 people, including 300 children and 28 wounded people, were evacuated in the first convoy. Fighters from <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham</b> and their prisoners were reportedly the first to leave. During {{the evacuation}}, it was reported that pro-government militias had shot at the ambulances carrying the civilians as they left eastern Aleppo. According to one report, one person was killed and four injured, while another said only three people were injured. Syrian state television reported that the convoy also evacuated rebel fighters, while according to the rebels' chief negotiator, the fighters would be evacuated after the first or second convoy. Meanwhile, evacuations had also reportedly begun in Foua and Kafriya. As the withdrawal was getting underway, the rebels burned their command centers, warehouses and vehicles, while Senior Russian general Viktor Poznikhir stated that the Syrian Army had almost finished its operations in Aleppo. Later in the day, the second and third convoy had left, with the second evacuating 1,198 people. The U.N. envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura stated that around 50,000 people were still to be evacuated, of which 40,000 civilians would go to West Aleppo, while the remaining 10,000 consisting of 1,500-5,000 rebels and their families would be taken to Idlib.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIslamist militant organizations {{appear to be}} evolving from traditional disassociated networks, al-Qaeda's model, into centralized regional powers {{with the intent of}} developing into national governments. This thesis presents a comparative case study of five mainstream Islamist militant organizations, the Islamic State, <b>Jabhat</b> <b>Fatah</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> al-Shabaab, the Afghan Taliban, and Hezbollah, to determine how close they have come to statehood and how such a change may affect U. S. homeland security. The criteria used to analyze the case studies were primarily derived from the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, which describes a state as an entity with a permanent population, defined borders, an ability to conduct governance, and an ability to enter into relations with other national governments. Additional criteria were used to determine the organizations' propensity to threaten the United States in their governmental capacity. This thesis found that none of the Islamist militant organizations in the case studies currently fit all the criteria for statehood; however, none fit al-Qaeda's disassociated model either. Therefore, the international community should consider defining and more accurately classifying these groups as militant states.
