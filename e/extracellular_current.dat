Treating one segment of the Chara cell with K+ concentrations greater than 2 millimolar caused a dramatic reduction in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>current</b> pattern in this compartment. Concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 millimolar K+ were used to establish that a normal current profile could be maintained along the cell surface in the control compartment, whereas the <b>extracellular</b> <b>current</b> profile was strongly reduced along the entire cell surface that was located in the second, high-K+ compartment. Simultaneous measurements of the membrane potential in the two segments of the divided Chara cell established that, {{in the presence of}} elevated K+ concentrations, a longitudinal voltage gradient of up to 60 millivolts was maintained. Experiments in which the pH value in one compartment was either decreased (pH 6. 0) or increased (pH 11) gave rise to a reduced <b>extracellular</b> <b>current</b> profile along this segment of the cell, whereas the pattern in the control segment remained unaltered.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{model of}} a single synapse with a {{circular}} contact zone and a single concentric zone containing receptor-gated channels, we studied the dependence of the synaptic current on the synaptic cleft width and on the relative size of the receptor zone. During synaptic excitation, the <b>extracellular</b> <b>current</b> entered the cleft and flowed into the postsynaptic cell through receptor channels distributed homogeneously over the receptor zone. The membrane potential and channel currents were smaller toward the cleft center if compared to the cleft edges. This radial gradient was due to the voltage drop produced by the synaptic current on the cleft resistance. The total synaptic current conducted by the same number of open channels was sensitive to changes in the receptor zone radius and the cleft width. We conclude that synaptic geometry may affect synaptic currents by defining the volume resistor of the cleft. The in-series connection of the resistances of the intracleft medium and the receptor channels plays the role of the synaptic voltage divider. This voltage dividing effect should be taken into account when the conductance of single channels or synaptic contacts is estimated from experimental measurements of voltage-current relationships...|$|E

Most {{of the gap}} junctions (GJs) seen in the gymnotid-fish cerebellum exhibit an asymmetrical configuration, the electron-opaque cytoplasmic material underlying the junction being more extensive in the dendritic than in the axonal side. In the frog cerebellum, the GJs have a symmetrical distribution of such electron-opaque material. In both species the GJs are encountered at the same synaptic interface as the conventional synaptic zone (CSZ), constituting "mixed synapses" in a morphological sense. The axonal surface covered by CSZs is larger than that covered by GJs. In mammalian cerebellum, GJs are observed only in the molecular layer, between perikarya, dendrites, or perikarya and dendrites of the inhibitory interneurons.

However, a neurological substrate for mixing has not been identified. Here we address the issue of nonlinear mixing of neuronal activity in the vibrissa primary sensory cortex of rat, a region that receives intrinsic as well as sensory-driven rhythmic input during natural whisking.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the most suitable}} spike sorting algorithm for intraoperatively recordedextracellular currents in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Background: In PD the STN may {{play an important role}} in the generation of pathological oscillatoryactivity within the basal ganglia-cortex loop. <b>Extracellular</b> <b>currents</b> recorded from the STN of PDpatients, obtained during Deep Brain Stimulation surgery can provide important information aboutpathological spiking activity of STN neurons. A challenge in analyzing neural spike data is to assigndetected spike to individual neurons that contribute to the extracellularly recorded activity. To thisend, a group of algorithms commonly referred to as "spike sorting" is used. Today, numerous spikesorting algorithms are available, partly side-by-side in commercial spike sorting packages. However, itis unclear to which degree different algorithms yield similar sorting results. Methods: Spiking activity was recorded intraoperatively at multiple sites within the STN-area of 3 awake PD patients. The recorded time series were sorted ("Plexon Offline-Sorter") by 2 semi-automatic (template-based (TB) and K-Means) and by 4 automatic algorithms (K-Means, Valley-Seeking (VS), standard- and t-distribution Expectation-Maximization). We took a multiple validationapproach by comparing the spike times in the detected single units (SU) to determine how thesorting procedure influences the subsequent spike train analysis. Results: Preliminary results demonstrated a wide variability in the number of detected SU betweenthe 6 sorting algorithms (26 - 62 SU in 21 channels). Additionally, the analysis of the spike trainsstatistics revealed a large variability in the inter-spike interval (between 52 +/- 38 and 321 +/- 778 (mean +/-SD in ms)) and the coefficient of variation (between 0. 61 and 18. 91). In summary, thoughnot optimal, TB- and VS-algorithms proved to be the most conservative among the sorting methodsinvestigated. Conclusion: Our results strongly argue for the need of a standardized validation procedure for spikesorting algorithms based on ground-truth data.
