40|$|The <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System</b> {{has been}} adopted widely in {{schedules}} of tariff concessions in the WTO and EPAs to ensure greater uniformity among members in customs classification for trade facilitation. The <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System</b> once amended several years {{in order to keep}} up-todate in the light of changes in technology or in patterns of international trade. For the modification of schedules of concessions, since the approval of the members concerned is required, several versions of the <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System</b> have been respectively applying internationally as well as domestically. This paper indicates some mutual solutions on this, based on present economic law systems especially in Japan. 長崎大学経済学部創立 110 周年記念論文集Essays in Commemoration of the 110 th Anniversary of the Faculty of Economics, Nagasaki Universit...|$|R

30|$|Classifications {{of trade}} {{statistics}} divide broadly into two categories: product- and industry-based. They have different origins and most trade statistics are product-based. Industry-based classifications are advantageous in analyzing interactions within industries. However, industry classifications {{such as the}} International Standard Industry Classification {{do not have a}} direct concordance to the <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System.</b> The Central Product Classification can bridge these two, but with many n:n correlations. Therefore, we divide the modern sector into subsectors by using a product-based classification. Specifically, the first three digit codes of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 are considered as a subsector since they have roots in the <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System,</b> but are time-consistent over our time span. There are 262 subsectors in total, and each subsector comprises 20 <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System</b> 6 -digit products on average.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{assessment}} of customs duty, products are given an identification code {{that has come to}} be known as the <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System</b> code. This code was developed by the World Customs Organization based in Brussels. A <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System</b> code may be from four to ten digits. For example, 17.03 is the HS code for molasses from the extraction or refining of sugar. However, within 17.03, the number 17.03.90 stands for [...] "Molasses (Excluding Cane Molasses)".|$|R

30|$|The {{years between}} 2007 and 2012 have fewer {{observations}} due to data availability. In those years, {{a revision of}} the <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System</b> was newly enforced in the relevant countries. Adopting a new system entails a lack of time occasionally since each country should change its own tariff lines conforming to the new <b>Harmonized</b> <b>System.</b> Thus, there is a systematic bias caused by omission of low-income countries for those years. Since there is a correlation between ranges of reporting countries and observed one, level-based interpretation should be excluded.|$|R
