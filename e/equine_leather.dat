5000|$|Shell {{cordovan}} (or cordovan) {{is a type}} {{of leather}} commonly used in high-end shoemaking. Cordovan is an <b>equine</b> <b>leather</b> made from the fibrous flat muscle (or shell) beneath the hide on the rump of the horse. [...] The leather derives its name from the city of Cordoba, Spain, where it was first practiced by the Visigoths in the seventh century, and later also by the Moors. It is a difficult and expensive leather to make, and in the late 19th and early 20th century was mostly used for razor strops to sharpen razors in barber shops. More recently it has been increasingly used for shoes, wallets, and watch straps due to its aesthetic qualities and exceptional durability. Shell cordovan has a unique non-creasing characteristic.|$|E
