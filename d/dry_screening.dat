50|$|While any {{coal mine}} has a {{negative}} environmental impact, and the coal burnt in a power station results in carbon dioxide emissions, the colliery has taken steps to make the negative environmental impact as low as possible: the colliery received ISO 14001 certification in 2010, and activities are controlled using a formal Environmental Management System. All required environmental permitting is in place and EIAs are publicly accessible on the Expansion Project website*. Use of water in a water scarce country is reduced by performing <b>dry</b> <b>screening</b> in the plant, storm water is captured and re-used, and replenishable surface water from the North-South carrier is used. Care was taken during design to construct a plant with a small footprint and the plant will be placed on previously disturbed ground. Energy saving initiatives (energy efficient motors, lighting and solar water heating etc.) have been incorporated into the design. The mine does not produce any discards, does not deposit fines on a slimes dam (these are dispatched to BPC to be burnt in the power station) and does not discharge any effluent water into the environment. While the colliery has mining rights over an area of some 170 square kilometers, mining is conducted below surface, and current land-use owners' rights to farm and graze cattle on tribal land have not been affected. No forced relocation of people living within the mining area has occurred. The colliery operates a small game park of some 1700 hectares {{in the area around}} the mine village, and this is used for conservation and to provide people of the area with recreation and environmental education.|$|E

40|$|Issue: The {{production}} processes {{used to make}} ground or crumb rubber usually produce a range of particle sizes. It is necessary to sort and classify the ground rubber for use. This is accomplished using various screening techniques. This best practice will review some of the common methods {{that are used to}} sort and separate ground rubber. Best Practice: There are many manufacturers of equipment for sorting and classifying ground rubber. They are all based on some type of rotating, vibrating, or shaking screen. The type found to be the most useful for <b>dry</b> <b>screening</b> uses an up and down shaking motion while a scrubbing motion is also occurring. The most well known manufacturer is Rotex. These machines are employed in many rubber recycle operations. In addition there are vibrating screens, rotor sifter screens, and variations of all these techniques. The rotor sifter screen is particularly effective for wet screening. The output for the screen is based on the particle size of the rubbers being screened and the surface area of the screen. The larger the surface area of the screen, the higher the yield and the larger the particle size, the higher the output. Screens are most effective when sorting 10 to 40 mesh ground rubber. A typical yield is 1000 pounds per hour. At the smaller mesh sizes the yield falls off dramatically. On the very fine particles, smaller than 100 mesh screens are ineffective. The general cost of a screening system is $ 15, 000 to $ 20, 000 (U. S.), except for the Rotex equipment. It costs $ 30, 000 to $ 40, 000 (U. S.) and for large systems $ 60, 000 to $ 80, 000 (U. S.).

30|$|There {{are several}} methods for the {{separation}} of cenospheres from CFA. Traditionally, cenospheres were removed from CFA via float-sink in settling lagoons. This simple procedure allows potentially toxic elements to be leached and requires a large space and significant time (Hirajima et al. 2010). Alternatively, a triboelectric separation system was used (Gurupira et al. 2001) but this technique requires that the spheres have a specific gravity ≤ 1. Some solid silica particles with specific gravity of ≥ 1 may contain gas bubbles which over their specific gravity so that they mimic cenospheres during this process, rendering it less effective and attractive. Other studies that {{have looked at the}} extraction of cenospheres on a wet basis. In US Patent No. 4121945 (1978), CFA is mixed with water to form a slurry then a frothing agent is added and cenospheres lighter than water are skimmed. US Patent No. 4652433 (1987) looked at another method where CFA is separated into fine and coarse fractions and the coarse fraction is then mixed with water, subsequently the cenospheres are removed by skimming. These methods have some disadvantages. Wet processing caused environmental problems and imposed space restrictions. In addition, these methods only collect cenospheres with specific gravity ≤ 1.0; those that float on water. Also, these processes are not suitable for CFA that contains 10  % or more lime because high Ca bearing CFA (such as ASTM C 618 Class C fly ash) has cementations properties when mixed with water and when pozolanic reactions occur the material may harden. When using these wet methods many cenospheres can be trapped in agglomerated and/or hardened masses before flotation occurs. This problem was solved by a few recent US Patents (No. 0190327 A 1 2008, No. 8074804 B 2 2011, and No. 0050519 A 1 2012) where cenospheres were separated from CFA in a dry state by using air as the fluid media for the separation. In one of the processes, CFA is separated into narrow particle size fractions, followed by density separation using a fluidized bed of air, preferable in the absence of water by <b>dry</b> <b>screening,</b> and then an optional further particle size separation. The advantages of this technique are that it can yield nearly 100  % cenospheres and it avoids agglomeration of ash having high Ca content.|$|E

Alumina is {{the most}} widely used oxide ceramic material. Its {{applications}} are widespread, and include spark plugs, tap washers, pump seals, electronic substrates, grinding media, abrasion resistant tiles, cutting tools, bioceramics, (hip-joints), body armour, laboratory ware and wear parts for the textile and paper industries. Very large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of monolithic and brick refractories. It is also used mixed with other materials such as flake graphite where even more severe applications are envisaged, such as pouring spouts and sliding gate valves. Sintering of alumina ceramics at relatively low temperatures to obtain dense and fine grained microstructures with sufficient mechanical properties is one of tecnological investigations. Alumina ceramics are extensively used for structural applications due to alumina’s high melting point, chemical stability, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance at elevated temperatures. Restrictions to the applications of alumina arise due to the problems related to low thermal shock resistance and low fracture toughness.   In present day society, boron, an important element of both chemical and biological interest, has a variety of uses. Modern uses of boron-bearing minerals and boron derivatives include heat resistant glass (e. g., pyrex), fiberglass, ceramics, washing products (e. g., detergents and soaps), special alloys, fertilizers, fire retardants, wood treatment agents, insecticides and microbiocides. Colemanite (Ca 2 B 6 O 11. 5 H 2 O), a major source of boron mineral, is semi-soluble calcium-borate hydrate that is found in massive beds with other calcium containing minerals such as calcite and gypsium, and a variety of clays. Colemanite {{is the most}} important calcium containing commercial borate mineral with 5 mol crystal water. Direct use of colemanite is problematic for some industrial applications, e. g., in glasses and ceramics. Moreover, transporting raw colemanite and removing impurities and crystal water is expensive and energy inefficient, as colemanite must then undergo heat treatment before use, or the production process must be carried out under certain conditions. Ideally, the removal of impurities and crystal water at the same time will increase the use of the use of colemanite as amorphous B 2 O 3. Therefore, decrepitation or calcination is receiving increased attention. When raw colemanite is heated up to its decomposition temperature, only colemanite explodes, breaking up into a fine powder. This unique characteristic could be utilized in the upgrading of colemanite. Densification is the outcome of a combination of numerous parameters during processing, which include the powder characteristics, process variables, and sintering kinetics. The use of fine starting powder without agglomeration in the green preforms may improve densification. Regarding the latter, specific additives such as low melting oxides can be used to enhance the sinterability of powder. Additives in small amounts are deliberately and commonly used in ceramic systems to influence densification processes either by reducing sintering temperature or suppressing/promoting grain growth or enhancing mechanical and physical properties. Such additives can promote liquid phase formation at lower sintering temperatures and may considerably increase the rate of sintering. During sintering process, a viscous liquid may promote an additional diffusion mechanism of dissolution, particle rearrangement and capillary forces and finally may improve the densification. A variety of oxides such as B 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, SiO 2, MnO 2, Cr 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 are some of the typical additives that have been commonly used in alumina ceramics. The fundamental explanation of anisotropic grain growth in alumina is not totally understood but includes several proposals: inhomogeneous distribution of the dopant and the presence of a liquid phase on the grain boundary. In this study, initially, colemanite mineral which is found in our country as large scale deposits along worldwide, provided as concentrate from Eti Maden Bigadiç enterprices. The tenor of B 2 O 3  increased from % 33, 08 to % 58, 40 by decrepitation at 4500 C – 2 hours and <b>dry</b> <b>screening</b> processes after cooling down to the room temperature. The characteristic of the obtained colemanite powder determined by experiment studies and powder is processed for incorporating with Al 2 O 3 in order to produce structural ceramics. The experiments for powder characterization are laser particle size distribution, pycnometer density, arnold density, tapped density and chemical analysis before&after decrepitation for the colemanite powder. Afterwards, enriched colemanite powder added to commercial Alcoa™ alumina powder with the ratios of % 1 - 3 - 5. These powder mixtures pelletized by PVA for dry pressing and pressed at 175 MPa to obtain green samples. Green density measurements made for the obtained samples to compare with theorical densities. Pressed samples have been sintered at 13500 C, 14500 C and 15500 C for 2 hours and freely cooled down to room temperature. SEM scanning electron microscope has been used for investigating the microstructure of the sintered samples. Besides, water absorption rates, sintered densities, relative densities, XRD phase analysis and micro hardness values measured in order for investigation of the effects of colemanite added alumina structural ceramics.   Eventually, the examination of powder characterization and sintered samples characterization have been made and commented for the obtained results. After sintering at 13500 C, % 3 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in micro hardness values, % 1 colemanite added alumina exhibits an increase in sintered density values, accordingly undoped alumina. For the same sintering temperature and soaking time, when the addition of colemanite increases, grain growth is also increases according to the scanning electron microscope images. It has been investigated that, while the colemanite additions inside alumina increase, water absorption rates are also increase at the samples which are sintered at 14500 C and 15500 C. XRD measuring results shows corundum and aluminum borate structures obtained during sintering of the samples.   The results in this thesis have revealed that, the place of use where the porosity and hardness is not important like undoped alumina, 1350 C sintered and % 3 added colemanite to alumina products can be substituted for industrial usage. 200 C decrease in sintering temperature brings many advantages such as; saving up the energy consumption, highly increasing the working life of the sintering furnaces, thermal isolation elements and sintering casettes,  reducing amortisation costs of the sintering furnaces, also brings in an alternative for the investing lower temperature furnaces which are cheaper, substantially reduces maintenance, investment and production costs.

Developments {{in the recent past}} have seen the evolution of fine screening to high capacity applications.

40|$|Screening for drought {{resistance}} of rainfed lowland rice using drought score (leaf death) as a selection index {{has a long}} history of use in breeding programs. Genotypic variation for drought score during the vegetative stage in two <b>dry</b> season <b>screens</b> was examined among 128 recombinant inbred lines from four biparental crosses. The genotypic variation detected for drought score in the dry season was used to examine the reliability of the <b>dry</b> season <b>screening</b> method to estimate relative grain yield of genotypes under different types of drought stress in the wet season. Large genotypic variation for drought score existed in two experiments (A and B). However, there was no relationship between the drought scores of genotypes determined in these two experiments. Different patterns of development and severity of drought stress in these two experiments, i. e. slow development and mild plant water deficit in experiment A and fast development and severe plant water deficit in experiment B, were identified as the major factors contributing to the genotypes responding differently. Larger drought score in the dry season experiments was associated with lower grain yield under specific drought stress conditions in the wet season, but the association was weak to moderate and significant only in particular drought conditions. In most cases, a significant phenotypic and moderate genetic correlation between drought score in the dry season and grain yield in the wet season existed only when both drought score and grain yield of genotypes were affected by similar patterns and severity of drought stress in their respective experimental environments. The dry season environments used to measure genotypic variation for drought score should be managed to correspond to relevant types of drought environment that are frequent in the wet season. The efficiency of using the drought score as an indirect selection criterion for improving grain yield for drought conditions was lower than the direct selection for grain yield, and hence wet season screening with grain yield as a selection criterion would be more efficient. However, using drought score as a selection index, a larger number of genotypes can be evaluated than for wet season grain yield. Therefore, it is possible to apply higher selection intensities using the drought score system, and the selected lines can be further tested for grain yield in the wet season. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Six additional subjects were subsequently studied but ingested soil immediately after a standardized breakfast. Bioavailability in this group was only 2. 52 % ± 1. 7. Collectively, this study provides the first experimental estimates of soil Pb absorption in humans, and should allow for more precise estimates of health risks due to Pb-contaminated soil.

State public health laboratories or their associated laboratories routinely <b>screen</b> <b>dried</b> blood spot (DBS) specimens collected from newborns shortly after birth for certain genetic, metabolic, or endocrine disorders. Effective screening, along with follow up, diagnosis,and intervention, helps prevent mental retardation and premature death caused by these inherited diseases.

In this paper, we describe the Ontology for Newborn Screening Follow-‐up and Translational Research (ONSTR). ONSTR is an application ontology for representing data entities, practices and knowledge in the domain of newborn screening short- ‐ and long-‐term follow-‐up of patients diagnosed with inheritable and congenital disorders. It will serve as a core of the data integration framework in the Newborn Screening Follow-‐up Data Integration Collaborative (NBSDC), designed to support Semantic Web tools and applications with the goal of helping clinicians involved in translational research.

Supplemental TSH and T 3 U determinations were required on 8 - 12 % of the population screened initially with a T 4 test to avoid missing affected cases. With an initial T 4 and supplementary TSH and T 3 U testing on cord blood serum, recalls to exclude primary hypothyroidism were reduced to 0. 16 % of the screened population. The incidence of abnormalities detected in this cord blood screening programme was comparable with that reported by others using neonatal <b>dried</b> blood <b>screening</b> methods, indicating that cord blood screening can be effective provided the appropriate recall criteria and transport conditions are used.

40|$|SUMMARY Our {{regional}} {{cord blood}} screening programme for detecting neonatal hypothyroidism using initial cord blood thyroxine (T 4) determinations, with supplemental thyrotropin (TSH), and triiodothyronine resin uptake (T 3 U) measurements, gave an incidence of thyroid abnormalities of 1 / 3000 births, with 115000 infants having severe primary hypothyroidism.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of neonatal hypothyroidism, {{as reflected in}} cord-blood thyroxine and thyrotropin levels, varied from 0. 6 % to 13. 3 % in iodine-deficient and normal regions of India (selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Kerala {{and the city of}} Delhi), depending on the degree of environmental iodine deficiency. In populations with a high {{incidence of}} neonatal hypothyroidism, an increased prevalence of nerve deafness and a shift to the left in the distribution of IQ scores (towards lower scores) have been demonstrated. These indications of mild brain damage suggest that nutritional iodine deficiency can present in other ways than goitre or cretinism.
