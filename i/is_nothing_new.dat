5|$|As of November 2015, a {{majority}} of seats in the Maryland Senate are held {{by members of the}} Democratic Party, with 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans, greater than a two-thirds majority. This dominance <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>new,</b> as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland. The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African-Americans serve, with women averaging around 30% of the seats and African-Americans around 20%.|$|E
5|$|Historically this <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>new,</b> as {{the tense}} {{relations}} between Armenia and Azerbaijan {{because of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting {{in the absence of}} players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012 was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to Kazan, with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan. More recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor, and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship 2014 in Yerevan. Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 Chess World Cup in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.|$|E

Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>new</b> in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility".

500|$|The video {{received}} divided critics. Lipshutz {{was disappointed}} in it, commenting that [...] "the colorful video lacks the innovation of, say, Stefani's 'What You Waiting For?' visual." [...] James Grebey of Spin stated {{how he was}} frustrated with the video's [...] "glitchy, low-resolution land of colorful patterns and shapes," [...] calling it [...] "a jarring rejection of aesthetic design, {{made all the more}} confusing when the last third of the video suddenly changes the scenery from a computer generated blunderland to a back alley filled with live-action cars." [...] Jeff Benjamin of Fuse noted that the video is [...] "not wacky and sassy like past Stefani visuals like 'Wind It Up' or 'Hollaback Girl,' but praised the video, writing that it [...] "oozes sophistication while still adding Gwen's signature quirky side with its crazy computer effects." [...] Carolyn Menyes of Music Times was favorable, remarking that the video [...] "fits the song's strong reggae vibes, with Stefani channeling everything that's chaotic and trippy not just about her own genre but also about her single." [...] Bradley Stern was more negative, claiming that the video lacks a storyline, complaining about its resolution and named it a [...] "phoned-in green screen affair with some poorly rendered graphics." [...] Bianca Gracie wrote for Idolator that the video's geometric and graphic animation <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>new,</b> but praised [...] "the fun dance scene towards the end, which breaks the monotony of the video." ...|$|E
