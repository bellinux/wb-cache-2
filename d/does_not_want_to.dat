60|$|I {{ran down}} the hill in the thick Swiss {{darkness}} to the little bridge, and along the uneven cobbled street. I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> think, I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know.

60|$|Before Loretta {{had been}} at Santa Clara a week, she was {{convinced}} that Captain Kitt's idea was a good one.

And in the second place, though Captain Kitt wouldn't believe it, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave Daisy.

5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, {{such as in the}} Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E
5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, a lion costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E

Being a sperm whale, Pearl has the largest brain of any Bikini Bottom resident and is gifted in math. Mr. Krabs has tried to use this to his own advantage and wants Pearl to eventually become a bookkeeper for his restaurant.|$|E
