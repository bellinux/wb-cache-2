But Basil was dismayed at the change that had befallen them. They had their Sunday's best on, and the women, instead of wearing the peasant costume {{in which he had}} first seen them, were now dressed as if out of [...] "Harper's Bazar" [...] of the year before. He anxiously asked the driver if the broad straw hats and the bright sacks and kirtles were no more. [...] "O, you'd see them on weekdays, sir," [...] was the answer, [...] "but they're not so plenty any time as they used to be." [...] He opened his store of facts about the habitans, whom he praised for every virtue,--for thrift, for sobriety, for neatness, for amiability; and his words ought to have had the greater weight, because he was of the Irish race, between which and the Canadians there is no kindness lost. But the looks of the passers-by corroborated him, and as for the little houses, open-doored beside the way, with the pleasant faces at window and portal, they were miracles of picturesqueness and cleanliness. From each the owner's slim domain, narrowing at every successive division among the abundant generations, runs back to hill or river in well-defined lines, and beside the cottage is a garden of pot-herbs, bordered with a flame of bright autumn flowers; somewhere in decent seclusion grunts the <b>fattening</b> <b>pig,</b> which is to enrich all those peas and onions for the winter's broth; there is a cheerfulness of poultry about the barns; I dare be sworn there is always a small girl driving a flock of decorous ducks {{down the middle of the}} street; and of the priest with a book under his arm, passing a way-side shrine, what possible doubt? The houses, which are of one model, are built by the peasants themselves with the stone which their land yields more abundantly than any other crop, and are furnished with galleries and balconies to catch every ray of the fleeting summer, and perhaps to remember the long-lost ancestral summers of Normandy. At every moment, in passing through this ideally neat and pretty village, our tourists must think of the lovely poem of which all French Canada seems but a reminiscence and illustration. It was Grand Pre, not Beauport; and they paid an eager homage to the beautiful genius which has touched those simple village aspects with an undying charm, and which, whatever the land's political allegiance, is there perpetual Seigneur.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} major reasons why Ascaris {{is still so}} {{prevalent}} in current high intensity pig farms.First, {{because it has a}} direct life cycle, and is therefore not reliant on other organisms for its transmission to new hosts. Second, the female parasitic worms are highly fecund and are capable of producing hundreds of thousands of eggs per day that contaminate the surroundings instantaneously. One study showed that pigs that are naturally exposed to a paddock contaminated with A. suum have the highest egg excretion approximately 17 weeks after being introduced onto the paddock. After this point, egg counts seem to drop again. The lifespan of adult A. suum worms can be over 1 year, which is significantly longer than the average lifespan of a <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> these days. Therefore, once adult worms are present in fattening pigs, egg shedding increases with the age of the pigs unless the worms are cleared from the intestine by anthelmintic therapy. Third, the eggs of A. suum are generally considered to be highly resistant to external environmental factors suggesting their possible survival for up to several years in the appropriate conditions.So, even if parasitic worms are flushed from the intestine by anthelmintic drugs (which do not have a remanent effect), the pig keeps on reinfecting itself continuously since it is present in a highly contaminated environment. This ensures the establishment of fresh infections very rapidly after treatment. These factors, together with the seemingly unimportant health consequences of A. suum infections have led to a certain negligent attitude towards roundworm infections {{on the part of the}} farmer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) as an infectious agent for humans {{has increased in}} recent years in Germany. Although {{it is well known that}} the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in herds of fattening pigs are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in fattening pigs in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds?The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds was 53. 5 %. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in pig herds (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of fattening pigs with antimicrobial drugs (OR= 1. 79) and housing <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds on at least partially slatted floors (OR= 2. 39) compared to plain floor. In contrast, according to the model, <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds on farms keeping other livestock along with pigs were less likely to harbor MRSA (OR= 0. 54).

Identification of such factors, like farm size and net farm result, may help to increase epidemiological knowledge and to specify farm advice and policy making to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. The study used over 300 farm-year records collected during 2004 to 2007 from pig farms in the Netherlands. Data included economic and technical factors as well as antibiotic administration. Data were statistically analyzed for factors associated with antibiotic use, both for <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> and sow farms (piglets only), separately. The response variable was the average number of daily dosages per average pig year. Statistical analysis was performed on 16 and 19 potential explanatory factors for the <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> and sow farms, respectively. The results showed that, both on the <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> and sow farms, the average use of antibiotics increased from 2004 to 2006, but decreased during 2007, but the effect of year was not significant (P > 0. 05). Use of antibiotics varied between individual farms. Large farm repeatability for the use of antibiotics in the different years was found. Factors associated (P 0. 05) related to the on-farm use of antibiotics.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of vaccination against PCV 2 on technical results of pigs on an organic breeding and fattening farm, focussing on growth of weaned pigs and mortality and growth of <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs.</b> The study farm was an organic farm with 170 sows and on average 1, 100 <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs.</b> The study was carried out retrospectively between January 2009 and May 2011. During the study period three subsequent vaccination strategies were used: 1. Stellamune One shot®, 2. Stellamune One shot® + Ingelvac CircoFLEX®, 3. Ingelvac MycoFLEX® + Ingelvac CircoFLEX®. From these three periods the corresponding management data and slaughterhouse data were analysed by an ANOVA test. Due to few data in period 2 and an outbreak of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae during study period 2 and 3, these two periods were combined in one period and analysed by a two-sample t-test. The mortality of weaned piglets decreased with 3. 59 % (0. 62 – 6. 55 %) (P 0. 023) in comparison to period 1. Average daily weight gain (grams) of weaned piglets (6 – 12 weeks old) improved by 20. 67 (7. 40 – 33. 94 gram) (P 0. 004) in periods 2 and 3.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine how the change in agricultural policy and market conditions changes the economy of Finnish <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farms. The economy of these farms is evaluated with the measures of liquidity, profitability, and solvency. Based on the data of 32 book-keeping farms in 1993, a static simulation model, i. e. the physical production processes are assumed to remain constant, is used to project the economic situation of these farms for 1995 - 2000. The same data is used in the support areas A (southern coast), B (southern Finland) and C 1 (central Finland). Projected input and output prices, and support forms relevant to the particular farms are taken into account in the model. The farms were divided into three groups with respect to their cost-efficiency in 1993. The impacts of EU membership for the farms of different cost-efficiency levels are examined. For example, the decrease of net farm income from 1993 to 1995 is considerable in every examined area. In addition, in the areas A and B, the net farm income will decline rapidly during the transitional period (1995 - 1999) as the transitional period support decreases. At the same time, the net farm income in the area C 1 will remain fairly constant because of the Nordic support. The absolute differences between the groups will decrease according to all measures used, but the differences will remain yet considerable in the most measures. While evaluating the results, one must consider the nature of the static model used, and that the farms used as data are larger and more efficiently operated than the average <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farms in Finland. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The impact of EU membership on the economy of Finnish <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> farm...|$|E
