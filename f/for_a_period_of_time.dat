Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E
5|$|NBN {{was one of}} many {{stations}} {{opposed to}} aggregation, and offered an alternative by opening up a second station which it would operate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before selling it.

Following aggregation, the station's coverage expanded to cover all of northern New South Wales, whilst concurrently programming extended to twenty-four hours in a day, in stereophonic sound. In 1994, NBN Television's logo was updated to a pseudo-Nine logo, similar to fellow affiliate WIN Television.|$|E

Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E

5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E
