60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> me in a {{friendly}} way, and went out with a swagger.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> the child, {{remembering that}} he had never even asked her name.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> her slightly, {{watching}} her fixedly, {{turning up the}} corners of his eyes slyly, his nose seeming slyly to sharpen.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{significantly}} <b>at</b> Mr. Scutts {{and closed}} one eye. Mr. Scutts closed both of his.|$|R
6000|$|BOHUN (again {{interrupting}} him). My {{specialty is}} being right when {{other people are}} wrong. If you agreed with me I should be of no use here. (<b>He</b> <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> him to drive the point home; then turns suddenly and forcibly on Crampton.) Now you, Mr. Crampton: what point in this business have you most at heart? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> pleasantly <b>at</b> the stupefied Mr. Green, and, {{turning to}} Mr. Widden, {{gave him a}} {{friendly}} dig in the ribs with his finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Paul Jefferson's sale is goin' well," [...] he remarked, [...] "I {{could see}} the crowd from up yonder," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> the hook in the ceiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, more," [...] {{said the}} king; [...] "what thinkest thou, Mopo, would this people of thine fill the rift behind us?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> {{the gulf of}} stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m glad," [...] said Mr. Miller, slowly, as <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> {{a friend}} of Mrs. Tidger’s who had just {{come in with a}} long face, [...] "because now that Mrs. Pullen is poor, I can say to her what I couldn’t say while she was rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{very funny}} and very foolish," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>at</b> the poster. [...] "I am {{going down to}} the Northbrook Club. Will you come too?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{and winked}} <b>at</b> me. A wicked-looking old fellow; just the man I wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... "The old wizard," [...] <b>he</b> replied, <b>nodding</b> <b>at</b> Umgona; [...] "then his {{daughter}} after him, and last {{of all this}} fellow," [...] and he struck Nahoon {{in the face with}} his open hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't say, {{cats and}} dogs not tumble so many for present, only pups and kitties left, so to speak, but think there plenty more up there," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> the portentous fire-laced cloud {{which seemed to be}} {{spreading}} over them, its black edges visible even through the gloom.|$|E
6000|$|... '"I was {{speaking}} of time past," [...] said Maximus, never fluttering an eyelid. [...] "Nowadays one is only too pleased to find boys who can think for themselves, and their friends." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> Pertinax. [...] "Your Father lent me the letters, Parnesius, so you run no risk from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha! well put--devilish well put!" [...] {{returned}} Mr. Boxsious; [...] "that's {{the only}} sensible {{thing you have}} said since you entered my house; I begin to like you already." [...] With these words <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> me approvingly, and jumped into the high chair that I had placed for him with the alacrity of a young man.|$|E
6000|$|CRAMPTON (suddenly {{gripping}} {{him by the}} arm as {{he turns}} away again to the cabinet). So much the worse for them. I tell you you don't understand my character. If I could spare all my teeth, I'd make you pull them all out one after another to shew you what a properly hardened man can go through with when he's made up his mind to do it. (<b>He</b> <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> him to enforce the effect of this declaration, and releases him.) ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. [...] "That's bechune {{the two of}} us," [...] <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> warningly <b>at</b> Lucius. [...] "For one thing, he says me heart can't stand the high country. 'It's you to the deep valley,' says he." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so ill, Olaf," [...] he answered. [...] "We won, and but now, {{with the}} new light, have {{finished}} the game. They are all quiet yonder," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>nodding</b> <b>at</b> the vessel of Athalbrand, {{to which they were}} still grappled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know you, little maid, and I'm {{glad you}} came here, for I can show you a charming house for the winter. I heard you tell a field-mouse how lonely you were, and I saw tears {{dropping}} just now as you sat here thinking you had not {{a friend in the}} world," [...] said Dart, as <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> her and kindly cracked a chestnut to follow the acorn if she needed more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Sankey," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> Jim, who {{was among}} those invited, [...] "is rather a pickle, but from what I hear Repton is worse. So {{you will have to}} keep a sharp eye upon them, when they are together; and if they are up to mischief, do not {{hesitate}} to masthead both of them. A passenger on board one of His Majesty's ships is amenable to discipline, like anyone else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, Quatermain," [...] {{he said in}} his pleasant, drawling voice, [...] "here you are, up to time. I {{have been}} making bets with these five gentlemen," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> a group of loungers on the stoep, [...] "as to whether you would or would not appear, I putting ten to one on you in drinks. Therefore you must now consume five whiskies and sodas, which will save them from {{consuming}} fifty and a subsequent appearance at the Police Court." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} <b>at</b> {{me with the}} most {{complete}} bright confidence, quite sure {{now that he had}} settled his case perfectly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{it is all}} right,' said Cherry, looking {{with quiet}} {{certainty}} into her brother's face; and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> and coloured <b>at</b> the same time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello! hello! hello! Hello, Central! Can't I {{make you}} hear, any one?" [...] His steps {{advanced}} into the hall, {{and he put}} his head in at the library doorway. [...] "Thought you'd be here," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>at</b> the doctor. [...] "Well, doctor, Brother Peck's beaten us again. He's going." ...|$|R
60|$|I groaned {{under my}} breath, but I made no further comment; {{and in a}} very few minutes I {{presented}} myself at the Ritz Hotel. I was escorted upstairs and ushered into a very delightful suite on the second floor. Eve rose to meet me from behind a little tea-table. She was charmingly dressed and looking exceedingly well. Mr. Bundercombe, on the other hand, who was {{walking up and down}} the apartment with his hands behind his back, was distinctly nervous. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> my entrance.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, there, not so loud, I beg you," [...] said he, with a gesture. [...] "Hot as pounded pepper,--but {{all things}} are the better for a touch of it. I had no {{intention}} of insulting the worthy man, I give my word. I must have my joke, sir. No harm meant." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> John Paul, who looked as if he would sink through the floor. [...] "Robert Carvel is as testy as the devil with the gout, and you are not unlike him in feature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t,” Mr. Ruck replied. “You can’t make me. I’m {{thinking}} of cathedrals. I’m {{thinking of}} {{the way they used to}} chain you up under them or burn you up in front of them—in those high old times. I’m {{thinking of the}} beauties of nature too,” he went on, turning round on the bench and leaning his elbow on the parapet. “You can get killed over there I suppose also”—and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> the shining crests. “I’m thinking of going over—because, whatever the danger, I seem more afraid not to. That’s why I do most things. How do you get over?” he sighed.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Goodman didn't answer 'im because 'e was {{joining in}} the chorus with one side of 'is mouth and keeping 'is cigar alight with the other. <b>He</b> just <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> 'im; but <b>'e</b> looked so 'appy that Sam {{felt it was a}} {{pleasure}} to sit there and look at 'im.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chuck {{some water}} over yourself," [...] <b>he</b> said, hastily, <b>nodding</b> <b>at</b> a jug which {{stood on the}} table. [...] "I can’t very well get up to do it myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's Mr. Pip, aged parent," [...] said Wemmick, [...] "and I {{wish you}} could hear his name. <b>Nod</b> away <b>at</b> him, Mr. Pip; that's what <b>he</b> likes. <b>Nod</b> away <b>at</b> him, if you please, like winking!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have it, sir," [...] said Douglas. [...] "May I smoke as I talk? Well, thank you, Mr. Holmes. You're {{a smoker}} yourself, if I {{remember}} right, and you'll guess {{what it is}} to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away." [...] He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him. [...] "I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet you. But before you are through with that," [...] <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> my papers, [...] "you will say I've brought you something fresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{positive}} infatuation," [...] agreed, little Fyne, in {{the tone}} {{as though he had}} made an awful discovery. [...] "I have never seen anything so hopeless and inexplicable in my life. I--I felt quite frightened and sorry," [...] he added, while I looked at him curiously asking myself whether this excellent civil servant and notable pedestrian had felt the breath of a great and fatal love-spell passing him by in the room of that East-End hotel. He did look for a moment as though he had seen a ghost, an other-world thing. But that look vanished instantaneously, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> me with mere exasperation at something quite of this world-- whatever it was. [...] "It's a bad business. My brother-in-law knows nothing of women," [...] he cried with an air of profound, experienced wisdom.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to her that she might even yet go and meet him at the station. But if so, she must tell him at once, and he would know that she had done so because she was afraid of her aunt, and she disliked the idea of excusing herself before she was accused. If he really loved her, he would listen to her, and believe her. If he did not--why then let Lady Ball have her own way. She had promised to be firm, and she would keep her promise; but she would not intrigue with the hope of making him firm. If he was infirm of purpose, let him go. So she sat in her room, even when she heard the door close after his entrance, and did not go down till it was time for her to show herself in the drawing-room before dinner. When she entered the room was full. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>at</b> her with a pleasant smile, and she made up her mind that he had heard nothing as yet. Her uncle had excused himself from coming to table, and her aunt and John were talking together in apparent eagerness about him. For one moment her cousin spoke to her before dinner.|$|E
50|$|General Dixon soon {{learns that}} Gilcrest {{was telling the}} truth about the nuclear weapons payload and praises him for what he's done, {{revealing}} that authorities will soon be taking Carson into custody. Outside the hotel, Gilcrest finds Ng, who is preparing to leave. He tells her he loves her, is staying in Hawaii and will be waiting for her to return. Later that night, Gilcrest stands outside Grace's hula class and watches her dance. She notices him, <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> <b>at</b> her and she suddenly realizes he is her father. With tears of joy in her eyes, she runs outside and embraces him then returns to her class to continue her hula dancing.|$|R
60|$|And at that Battle {{burst into}} such a roar of {{laughter}} the hut shook. <b>He</b> filled <b>Nod's</b> platter with water, {{and gave him the}} rest of the Ukka-nuts. He went into the hut and fetched musket, powder, and bullets. He put a thick-peaked hat on his head, then, with his musket over his shoulder, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> handsomely <b>at</b> the little blinking Mulgar, and off he went.|$|R
60|$|Joe remembered {{all his own}} adventures {{which he}} had {{imagined}} on land and sea, and <b>nodded.</b> <b>He</b> <b>at</b> least understood that much.|$|R
