50|$|Cordwood {{homes are}} {{attractive}} for their visual appeal, maximization of interior space (with a rounded plan), economy of resources, {{and ease of}} construction. Wood usually accounts for about 40- 60% of the wall system, the remaining portion consisting of a mortar mix and insulating fill. Cordwood construction can be sustainable depending on design and process. There are two main types of Cordwood Construction, Throughwall and M-I-M (mortar-insulation-mortar). In Throughwall, the mortar mix itself contains an insulative material, usually sawdust, chopped newsprint, or paper sludge, in sometimes very high percentages by mass (80% paper sludge/20% mortar). In the more common M-I-M, and unlike Brick or Throughwall masonry, the mortar does not continue throughout the wall. Instead, three- or four-inch (sometimes more) beads of mortar {{on each side of}} the wall provide stability and support, with a separate insulation between them. Cordwood walls can be load-bearing (using built-up corners, or curved wall designed) or laid within a post and beam framework which provides structural reinforcement and is suitable for earthquake-prone areas. As a load-bearing wall, the compressive strength of wood and mortar allows for roofing to be tied directly into the wall. Different mortar mixtures and <b>insulation</b> <b>fill</b> material both affect the wall's overall R value, or resistance to heat flow; and conversely, to its inherent thermal mass, or heat/cool storage capacity.|$|E

The highly insulated external walls are essential prerequisites for low energy consumption of buildings. Filling shell of the brick with insulation material {{is one of the}} methods to reduce cooling loads in buildings. This paper aims to investigate the dynamic thermal parameters of various <b>insulation</b> <b>filled</b> bricks. The dynamic thermal parameters highlighted in the study include thermal transmittance, admittance, decrement factor, time lag and areal thermal heat capacity. The cyclic admittance method was employed in computer simulation program to compute dynamic thermal parameters of stuffed bricks. The four brick materials such as mud bricks, burnt bricks, concrete blocks and fly ash bricks were selected. The insulation materials used for filling shells of the brick are foam glass and asbestos fibre. The total forty eight stuffed bricks were investigated. The shell of the brick is <b>filled</b> by the <b>insulation</b> and the each layer of insulation is separated by a brick web. The shell and web thickness of the brick were maintained as per the Indian standards. The six configurations of the stuffed bricks were investigated (1. Solid brick, 2. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with single layer of insulation, 3. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with two layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated with a brick web, 4. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with three layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated by a brick web, 5. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with four layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated by a brick web and 6. Bricks with the shell of the brick filled with five layers of insulation with each insulation layer separated by a brick web).

Two key features of masonry walls contribute in providing acceptable performance by mitigating the effects of wind-driven rain: the evident capacity of the exterior masonry to absorb and store rainfall; an open cavity behind the exterior masonry cladding to drain infiltrated water.

This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other. Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies. Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject. Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode. These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of <b>insulation</b> that <b>fills</b> the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode. As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable. However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles. Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated.|$|R

Roxul Inc. Final Report [...] October 7, 1997 Page i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fire stops can introduce a physical connection between the two sides of a double-stud wall, hence providing structural flanking paths for transmission of vibration which worsens the sound insulation. This study primarily addressed the specific case of a load-bearing party wall with double wood studs, supporting a floor with wood joists perpendicular to the party wall and a floor deck or sub-floor of 15. 9 mm OSB. Even without structural transmission of vibration through a fire stop, the sound insulation in a real building is normally affected by flanking transmission. Addition of a fire stop provides yet another path for vibration transmission between the rooms, and hence tends to worsen the sound insulation further. This study examines how a fire stop at the floor/wall junction can degrade the apparent sound insulation of the party wall (the nominal separation) by increasing structural transmission of vibration around that wall via the connected floor system (the flanking path). Group 0 Constructions have no physical fire stop. Adding batt <b>insulation</b> to <b>fill</b> the wall's inter-stud cavities leaving a gap of 25 mm or less (Case 2) improves sound insulation provided by the party wall itself while adding negligible structural transmission.
