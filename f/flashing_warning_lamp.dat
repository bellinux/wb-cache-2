50|$|Bindon Hill is only {{accessible}} {{when the}} Lulworth Ranges {{are open to}} the public. It can be reached by a short walk from West Lulworth, or alternatively via the South West Coast Path from Lulworth Cove. The ranges are owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and is part of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFV) Gunnery School. The ranges, which are more than 2830 ha, lies within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and stretch along the Jurassic Coastline between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge. Visitors are advised to keep to official footpaths and abide to local site notices, because tanks and Armoured vehicles are used in this area. Safety warnings about explosives and unexploded shells are posted nearby by the MoD and there is a <b>flashing</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> situated on the hill, which is illuminated when the ranges are in use.|$|E
50|$|For safety reasons, {{access to}} the public is only {{permissible}} when the ranges are not in operation. Large red flags are flown and <b>flashing</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> on Bindon Hill and St Alban's Head are lit when the ranges are in use. At such times the entrance gates are locked and wardens patrol the area.|$|R
5000|$|A {{large part}} of the {{district}} is now designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), but a portion of the coast around Worbarrow Bay and the ghost village of Tyneham is still, after nearly 60 years, in the possession of the Ministry of Defence who use it as a training area. Lulworth Ranges are part of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Gunnery School at Lulworth Camp. Tanks and other armoured vehicles are used in this area and shells are fired. Due to safety reasons, right of entry is only given when the army ranges are not in operation. Large red flags are flown and <b>flashing</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> on Bindon Hill and St Alban's Head are lit when the ranges are in use.At such times the entrance gates are locked and wardens patrol the area.Other places of note are: ...|$|R

25|$|The 2008 TL {{features}} an improved new immobilizer system, {{and a separate}} Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) <b>warning</b> <b>lamp.</b> The navigation system has been updated to work in Hawaii, and the AcuraLink satellite capability has been expanded to incorporate 76 markets (up from 38 markets for the 2007 model).|$|R
50|$|Tall {{structures}} {{in excess of}} certain legislated heights are often equipped with aircraft <b>warning</b> <b>lamps,</b> usually red, to warn pilots of the structure's existence. In the past, ruggedized and under-run filament lamps were used to maximize the bulb life. Alternatively, neon lamps were used. Nowadays such lamps tend to use LED arrays.|$|R
50|$|Isolation {{transformers}} {{are also}} used for the power supply of devices not at ground potential. An example is the Austin transformer for the power supply of air-traffic obstacle <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> on radio antenna masts. Without the isolation transformer, the lighting circuits on the mast would conduct radio-frequency energy to ground through the power supply.|$|R
5000|$|The mast of Deutschlandsender Herzberg/Elster had no {{aircraft}} <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> installed. It {{was instead}} lit by skybeamers mounted on small masts near the tower. This method {{was chosen as}} the mast was a mast radiator insulated against ground and for feeding the lamps on the mast otherwise special devices like Austin transformers would be required.|$|R
50|$|On the new C3, the {{instrumentation}} {{is a mix}} of analogue dials {{beneath a}} styled cowl and a digital display for the fuel and trip computer. There is no temperature gauge (unlike the DS3), but a red and blue <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> to show hot or cold engines which come on as required. The drag coefficient is 0.307 Cd.|$|R
50|$|The mandate did, however, {{provide a}} minimum {{standard}} {{for the type of}} data that EDRs would be required to record: at least 15 types of crash data. Some of the required crash data include pre-crash speed, engine throttle, brake use, measured changes in forward velocity (Delta-V), driver safety belt use, airbag <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> status and airbag deployment times.|$|R

50|$|In addition, some NWS Weather Forecast Offices have instituted an {{enhanced}} <b>flash</b> flood <b>warning,</b> {{referred to as}} a flash flood emergency (or as termed by the Albany, New York office as a <b>flash</b> flood <b>warning</b> emergency), which indicates a severe flooding situation in densely populated areas, similar to the procedure for declaring a tornado emergency.|$|R
50|$|The Met Office, the NWS's {{counterpart}} in the United Kingdom, does not issue separate weather warnings and watches, but has an analogous system of <b>flash</b> <b>warnings</b> and advance warnings that serve {{the same general}} role of weather warnings and weather watches, respectively. Other official meteorological departments may use similar systems but use different terms.|$|R
50|$|An {{annunciator}} panel, {{also known}} in some aircraft as the Centralized Warning Panel (CWP), {{is a group}} of lights used as a central indicator of status of equipment or systems in an aircraft, industrial process, building or other installation. Usually, the annunciator panel includes a main <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> or audible signal to draw the attention of operating personnel to the annunciator panel for abnormal events or conditions.|$|R

50|$|The Diablo range also {{received}} an updated interior. Instead {{of the traditional}} flat dashboard with a separate upright instrument binnacle, as in many Italian sports cars of the era (and the previous Diablo), the new dash was an integrated wave-shaped design. A thin strip of black glass {{ran the length of}} the dash and contained various instrument indicator and <b>warning</b> <b>lamps.</b> This aesthetic design was inspired by Bang & Olufsen Hi-Fi products.|$|R
50|$|Sigma SE offered {{equipment}} including five-position, reclining rear seats. An interior {{boot lid}} release, roof console (incorporating dome lamp, map reading lamp, seat belt and door ajar <b>warning</b> <b>lamps),</b> steel belt radial ply tyres, laminated windscreen, distinctive grille, smoked glass on all instrument dials, front seat back pockets, and Ivanhoe cloth trim were also standard with the SE (with leather optional). The SE was further distinguished by its body-coloured hubcaps with silver trim.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{strategies}} have been experimented with nationwide {{in an attempt}} to reduce the overall number of pedestrian-vehicle crashes, especially in instances where improper crossing or failure to yield was the proximate cause of the crash. Some of these measures include overhead signs, <b>flashing</b> <b>warning</b> beacons, advanced crossing signs, more visible pavement markings, in-street “Yield to Pedestrian” signs, and more recently, in-pavement flashing lights. Pedestrian safety has been a key issue for the City of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in particular at non-controlled intersections and mid-block crossings. In 2002, the city council gave preliminary approval to implement a pedestrian-actuated overhead flasher system in conjunction with an in-pavement flasher system at the intersection of 1 st Avenue NE and 4 th Street NE in the downtown central business district. This location is uncontrolled and has several elements that can create conflicts between pedestrians, vehicles, and trains that service local industry. This report summarizes the results from a small-scale study completed by CTRE {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the in-pavement flasher system installed in downtown Cedar Rapids. The installation of in-pavement <b>flashing</b> <b>warning</b> lights at the pedestrian crosswalk at this site has had a net positive effect on the safety characteristics of the location. The results of this study show a marked improvement in motorist compliance with the state law requiring that motorists yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk. The pedestrian and motorist surveys show that both groups felt the in-pavement flashing lights have increased motorist awareness, especially at night. The data indicate the in-pavement <b>flashing</b> <b>warning</b> lights improved the motorists' response to pedestrians in the area, and that the system could be operational throughout summer and winter conditions...|$|R
