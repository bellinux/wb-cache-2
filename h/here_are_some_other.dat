Let me smell it. No, it's sealed; smell is locked in. Those are pretty flowers. Let's smell them: no smell again. Ah, I see--sort of flowers in women's bonnets--sort of calico flowers. Beautiful soap. This smells anyhow--regular soap-roses--a white rose and a red one. That long-necked bottle there looks like a crane. I wonder what's in that? Hallo! E-a-u--d-e--C-o-l-o-g-n-e. I wonder if Dr. Franklin understands that? It looks like his white wine. This is nice sugar. Let's taste. Yes, this is very nice sugar, sweet as--yes, it's sweet as sugar; better than maple sugar, such as they make at home. But I'm crunching it too loud, the Doctor will hear me. But here's a teaspoon. What's this for? There's no tea, nor tea-cup; but here's a tumbler, and here's drinking water. Let me see. Seems to me, putting this and that and the other thing together, it's a sort of alphabet that spells something. Spoon, tumbler, water, sugar,--brandy--that's it. O-t-a-r-d is brandy. Who put these things here? What does it all mean? Don't put sugar here for show, don't put a spoon here for ornament, nor a jug of water. There is only one meaning to it, and that is a very polite invitation from some invisible person to help myself, if I like, to a glass of brandy and sugar, and if I don't like, let it alone. That's my reading. I have a good mind to ask Doctor Franklin about it, though, for there's just a chance I may be mistaken, and these things <b>here</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> person's private property, not at all meant for me to help myself from. Cologne, what's that--never mind. Soap: soap's to wash with. I want to use soap, anyway. Let me see--no, there's no soap on the wash-stand. I see, soap is not given gratis here in Paris, to boarders. But if you want it, take it from the marble, and it will be charged in the bill. If you don't want it let it alone, and no charge. Well, that's fair, anyway. But then to a man who could not afford to use soap, such beautiful cakes as these lying before his eyes all the time, would be a strong temptation. And now that I think of it, the O-t-a-r-d looks rather tempting too. But if I don't like it now, I can let it alone. I've a good mind to try it. But it's sealed. I wonder now if I am right in my understanding of this alphabet? Who knows? I'll venture one little sip, anyhow. Come, cork. Hark!" ...|$|R

For this in computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a particular value in a list, this consists of checking every one of its elements, {{one at a time}} and in sequence, until the desired search element is found. The other approach to find element in given list is binary search. A binary search is work only for sorted array. Binary search works by comparing an input value to the middle element of the array. The comparison determines whether the element equals the input, less than the input or greater. When the element being compared to equals the input the search stops and typically returns the position of the element. This procedure is goes on till element is found or not found in list. By taking these two pints or techniques as base <b>here</b> we <b>are</b> giving <b>some</b> <b>other</b> way to find the element in sorted and unsorted list of elements. Here in this algorithm will work similar to the linear search for unsorted list of elements and like binary for sorted list. In this root concept is introduce to improve the search efficiency...|$|R

Through the identification process to parents, and through the learning process will influence adolescent attitudes and behavior. The influence of mass media, cultural factors and the shift of value to give different views among adolescents with parents. Through social learning processes tend to be teenagers choose androgin attitude, in contrast to parents who have a traditional role, which tends masculine father and mother tend feminine. This research is quantitative research that will be used to test the hypothesis, whether there are differences in the role of sex between young men with a father and teenage daughter with the mother. The variables in this study consist of two independent variables namely in this study were gender (status in the family), and the dependent variable is the role of sex. The population in this study were adolescents aged 15 - 19 years and their parents respectively. Sampling technique using purposive sampling technique. The population there is 50 pairs. The research was conducted on December 17 to 21 December 2005. Instruments in this research is by using the BSRI (Bem Sex Role Inventory) from <b>here</b> will <b>be</b> obtained <b>some</b> <b>other</b> categories of sex roles between sex role masculine, feminine, or androgin. BSRI consists of 60 statements with details; 20 including the nature of the masculine, 20 feminine characteristics, and 20 neutral. The result of the data obtained {{in the form of the}} number of frequencies for each sex (status in the family). Then the results were tested with Chi-Square technique, for the father and teenage son obtained value = 12. 155, Sig = 0. 007 0. 050 which means no sex role differences between mothers with teenage daughters. The results showed that many young men who have androgin nature, in contrast with the father of the greatest frequency is in the masculine sex role. But for girls with mothers not having sex role differences they both have a feminine sex role...|$|R

Models of information retrieval are discussed within the two mentioned models of libraries. New virtual concepts as "navigation" or "surfing" are {{compared with those}} present in more traditional information retrieval systems, as "the best match". <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> opposite concepts discussed: fuzzy set theory opposed to boolean logic; the interrelation between the basis of information technology {{and the development of}} information retrieval tools are also under scrutinity.

The radical differences perceived between tradicional and virtual libraries does not leads the author to a polarization when considering the future.

40|$|This {{article is}} the second in a series ofeight, dealing with ÔTeaching Eye HealthÕ. Almost {{everybody}} who is involved in community eye health is also a teacher- but many have never had any training on how teach effectively. The aim of the series is to stimulate readers to teach and learn more effectively, {{and we will be}} working through important topics related to teaching and learning in a systematic and practical way. This article sets the scene by examining some important con-cepts related to ÔteachingÕ and ÔlearningÕ. Words we use to Talk About Teaching and Learning People use different words when talking about teaching and learning. Sometimes the same word will mean different things to different people, and sometimes differ-ent words will carry the same meaning. For example, Americans tend to use the word ÔevaluateÕ to describe testing stu-dents to see if they have learnt, while the British often use the word ÔassessÕ. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> examples of words with related meanings...|$|E

What a command the Holy Spirit gives us here through {{the writings of}} Paul! We are to be imitators of the Holy Father, the One Who is omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, Holy, Full of Glory, etc. ! Theologians talk about two categories of characteristics of God: the communicable and the noncommunicable. The noncommunicable we certainly cannot share and I mentioned five of those above. Other noncommunicable aspects include self-existent, self-sufficient, and eternal. However even when we face the communicable aspects of God we run into some severe problems! Consider some of those communicable aspects of God: justice, wrath, wisdom, faithfulness, goodness, love, mercy, compassion, and forgiveness. These certainly are aspects of God that we should strive to have in our life, but God is perfect in all of them. Certainly part of the sanctification that the Holy Spirit is working in our lives is to be imitators of God in those communicable aspects. <b>Here</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> relevant Scripture verses...|$|E
