5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam <b>Direct,</b> Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the <b>Direct</b> fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the <b>Direct</b> fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing the need to keep this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to <b>Direct,</b> Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with <b>Direct</b> in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the <b>Direct</b> fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E

5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual <b>direct</b> experience of God's grace.
