50|$|The {{theme is}} similar to that of Sappho, but on a larger scale. It is again the tragedy of the heart's desire, the {{conflict}} of the simple happy life with that sinister power, be it genius or ambition, which upsets the equilibrium of life. There is delicate art in the delineation of the mingled fascination and repulsion which Medea and Jason feel for each other, and when at last repulsion becomes the dominant force, the dramatist gives splendid utterance to the rage of the disappointed wife and mother. Medea, her revenge stilled, her children dead, bears the fatal <b>Fleece</b> <b>back</b> to Delphi, while Jason is left to realize the nothingness of human striving and earthly happiness. The end is bitter disillusionment; the only consolation renunciation. Some critics consider Medea Grillparzer's highest achievement.|$|E
50|$|The poet calls {{upon the}} Muse to {{describe}} Medea’s state of mind: is it shame, alarm or love that leads her to flee Colchis? Her treason is already known {{to her father}} and self-poisoning seems like an option again. She decides instead to flee Colchis with her nephews, the sons of Phrixus, camped with the Argonauts by the river. Doors open for her by magic as she hurries barefoot though the palace, and the moon laughs at her outdoors, recalling the many times that she was captured and brought to earth by Medea’s cruel love spells (a reference to the moon’s passion for Endymion). Arriving at the camp, Medea warns the others about her father’s treachery and offers to help steal the Golden Fleece from its guardian serpent. Jason solemnly pledges to marry her, she puts the snake to sleep with a spell and then the hero takes the <b>Fleece</b> <b>back</b> to the Argo, exulting in its sheen like a young girl who has caught moonbeams {{in the folds of}} her gown.|$|E

40|$|Felt is {{considered}} mankind 2 ̆ 7 s oldest textile. Created of wool or hair through pressure and shocking, {{and the application}} of heat and cold, felt is a warm, sturdy fabric used for shelter, clothing, carpets, saddles, and bags or container covers. Feltmaking is a world-wide tradition {{in the sense that it}} is practiced in such disparate regions as Mongolia, Central Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. In the souk in Marrakech, Morocco, a two-sided prayer rug is created, one side white and one side grey, using the natural color of the fleece. The process involves the addition of soap which acts as a binding agent during the felting process. Rolling and pressure cause the fibers to bind together forming a flat, finished mat. In Central Asia and the Middle East, the biblical bow and mallet is employed to break up the fiber into a cloud-like mass which is laid on a dampened canvas in a given shape. The feltmakers in this area create inlaid coats and carpets for local consumption. Once a coat has been partially felted, it is folded over, and the softly rolled fleece is applied to the surface in a given design. The laminating process continues in order to felt in the yarn design and to shape the coat. The finished garment has closed sleeves which act like mittens. In Afghanistan, where the carpet designs are very intricate, the dyed fleece is laid in a given pattern on a reed mat and the plain black <b>fleece</b> <b>backing</b> is then laid on top. The entire mass of wool is rolled up in the mat and a canvas and felted through continuous rolling and pressure. In Aqsha, an Afgan town very near the Russian border, a carpet market takes place every week, featuring pile carpets and 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 or felt carpets. This is my carpet which took me 7 hours to buy. During the price haggling which is, as you know, a ritual in this part of the world, this is the crowd which gathered on my carpet and this is the gentleman who made off with my SS 2 ̆ 6 D - an issue devoted to American Indian rug design. I wonder how many Hopi and Pueblo 2 ̆ 2 namdas 2 ̆ 2 are being created in Aqsha today?!...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION This paper {{focuses on}} weavers and {{textiles}} {{from the island}} of Taquile, in Lake Titicaca, Peru, in the southern Andes. In my abstract I wrote that I would speak about both Taquileans and the Sakaka of Bolivia, but due to the richness {{and complexity of the}} material, I shall concentrate on Taquile. This paper dates back to a conversation I had with Natividad Machaca (Figure 1), a matron of Taquile, on a winter afternoon in June 1984, after the festival of Saint John, which Taquilean families dedicate to ceremonies to increase the fertility of their scrawny sheep. Along with her husband and daughter, we were in the patio, more or less sitting up, suffering from postfestival, post-very-abundant-drinking hang-overs. I was trying to pack, and catch the boat to the mainland; no one was very talkative. But when I mentioned that I might accompany my former mother-inlaw to the little town of Ichu, Natividad practically jumped up. She bombarded me with questions. 2 ̆ 2 Would I go? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Was my mother-in-law going to trade alpaca fleece? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Could I bring <b>back</b> <b>fleece?</b> 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Black fleece, 2 ̆ 2 Natividad emphasized. 2 ̆ 2 Good black alpaca fleece, 2 ̆ 2 she added, spreading apart her thumb and index fingers to remind me of the requisite fiber length. 2 ̆ 2 I need, 2 ̆ 2 she said, 2 ̆ 2 two, no, three hides. 2 ̆ 2 Natividad reiterated that her daughter Alejandrina was spinning black alpaca for an overskirt (aqsu, now no longer made or worn). Natividad emphasized that Alejandrina soon would marry. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s so hard to get alpaca fleece — black especially, 2 ̆ 2 Natividad sighed. She hadn 2 ̆ 7 t obtained any alpaca all year, (Herders mostly raise white alpacas now, since white fleece brings a higher price in the international wool market.) Natividad said that she also needed black fleece for herself. She also needed white alpaca to weave a coca carrying cloth (istalla), and her sister-inlaw, Regoria, was looking for a certain shade of brown to weave a food carrying cloth (unkhuna). And so on, and on, and on. I felt so awful that I could barely think, let alone get excited about anything, but Natividad was keen to not lose this opportunity to get raw materials. Taquile is an island of weavers, but on their tiny island Taquileans can 2 ̆ 7 t raise alpacas. The patronal festival of Saints Peter and Paul in Ichu is the occasion for an important regional wool market; peasant herders of llamas and alpacas descend from their remote mountain homes to trade fiber for food (especially corn), which farmers bring. With modernization, few herders, or itinerant petty traders, visit Taquile to trade fleece for fresh and/or freeze-dried potatoes, or small corn. Like most peasants, Taquileans are short of cash, despite the growth of tourism to their island, and sales of their textiles...|$|R
