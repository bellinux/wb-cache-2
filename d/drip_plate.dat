The waste laden water from the aquarium spreads over the <b>drip</b> <b>plate,</b> and rains down through a medium. This may be a filter wool/plastic grid rolled into a circular shape (DLS or [...] "Double Layer Spiral") or any number of plastic media commonly known as Bio Balls. As the water cascades over the media, CO2 is given off, oxygen is picked up, and bacteria convert the waste from the tank into less harmful materials. From here the water enters the sump. The sump may contain a number of compartments, each with its own filtration material. Often, heaters and thermostats are placed in the sump.|$|E

Glass companies needed to change with the times or face extinction, and Sneath Glass did not make enough changes. Refrigerator parts such as <b>drip</b> <b>plates</b> were being made of plastic instead of glass, and the company declined opportunities in both fibreglass and plastics. By making glassware mostly for other companies, Sneath had lost brand recognition, {{and it did not}} promote the Sneath brand or products such as its heat proof glass. Competitors making ovenware products had gained much better brand recognition. This meant that the company faced declining demand for its top two categories of products.|$|R

The purpose of the process-level models developed in this report is to model dry oxidation, general corrosion, and localized corrosion of the <b>drip</b> shield <b>plate</b> material, which is made of Ti Grade 7. This document is prepared according to ''Technical Work Plan For: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]).

The drip shield may suffer from other forms of failure such as the hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) or stress corrosion cracking (SCC), or both. Stress corrosion cracking of the drip shield material is discussed in ''Stress Corrosion Cracking of the Drip Shield, the Waste Package Outer Barrier, and the Stainless Steel Structural Material'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169985]).

Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy <b>drips</b> from the <b>plate</b> down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing.

40|$|We report trace-element {{data from}} a series of {{carbonate}} growth experiments in cave-analogue conditions in the laboratory with the goal of better understanding environmental controls on trace-element incorporation in stalagmites. The experimental setup closely mimics natural processes (e. g. precipitation driven by CO-degassing, low ionic strength solution, thin solution-film) but with a tight control on growth conditions (temperature, pCO, drip rate, calcite saturation index and the composition of the initial solution). Calcite is dissolved in deionized water in a 20, 000 ppmV pCO environment, with trace-elements (Li, Na, Mg, Co, Sr, Cd, Ba, U) at appropriate concentrations to mimic natural cave drip-waters. This solution is <b>dripped</b> onto glass <b>plates</b> (coated with seed-calcite) in a lower pCO environment at 7, 15, 25 and 35 °C and drip rates of 2, 6 and 10 drips per minute. D(Sr) was shown to be statistically invariant over the full range of temperature and growth rate studied. No relationship between Sr/Ca and growth rate is therefore expected in stalagmite samples over comparable growth rates. D(Mg) has a relationship with temperature defined by D(Mg) = 0. 01 e, but temperature is not expected to be the dominant control on Mg/Ca in cave calcite due to the larger impact of calcite precipitation on Mg/Ca. Over short timescales, in conditions where temperature is well buffered, the fraction of calcium remaining in solution (f) {{is likely to be the}} dominant control on Mg/Ca and other trace-element ratios. But differences in the response of trace-elements to f and T may allow their combined use to assess past cave conditions. High Cd/Ca is particularly indicative of low amounts of prior calcite precipitation and Cd/Ca would be a useful addition to trace-element studies of natural stalagmites. Significant scatter is observed in trace-element ratios during the laboratory experiments, which cannot be explained by simple Rayleigh distillation. This scatter is well explained by solution mixing and by the mixing of calcite with different fractions of calcite growth. Accounting for the effects of mixing on trace-element concentrations or ratios may help to achieve more robust interpretations of stalagmite chemistry as part of a multi-proxy approach to assessment of past environments. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Speleothem oxygen {{isotopes}} {{and growth}} rates are valuable proxies for reconstructing climate history. There is debate, however, {{about the conditions}} that allow speleothems to grow in oxygen isotope equilibrium, and about the correct equilibrium fractionation factors. We report results {{from a series of}} carbonate growth experiments in karst-analogue conditions in the laboratory. The setup closely mimics natural processes (e. g. precipitation driven by CO 2 -degassing, low ionic strength solution, thin solution film) but with a tight control on growth conditions (temperature, pCO 2, drip rate, calcite saturation index and the composition of the initial solution). Calcite is dissolved in water in a 20, 000 ppmV pCO 2 environment. This solution is <b>dripped</b> onto glass <b>plates</b> (coated with seed-carbonate) in a lower pCO 2 environment (< 2500 ppmV), where degassing leads to calcite growth. Experiments were performed at 7, 15, 25 and 35 °C. At each temperature, calcite was grown at three drip rates (2, 6 and 10 drips per minute) on separate plates. The mass of calcite grown in these experiments varies with temperature (T in K) and drip rate (d_r in drips min- 1) according to the relationship daily growth mass= 1. 254 + 1. 478 * 10 - 9 *e 0. 0679 T+(e 0. 00248 T- 2) *(- 0. 779 d_r 2 + 10. 05 d_r+ 11. 69). This relationship indicates a substantial increase of growth mass with temperature, a smaller influence of drip rate on growth mass at low temperature and a non-linear relationship between drip rate and growth mass at higher temperatures. Low temperature, fast dripping conditions are found to be the most favourable for reducing effects associated with evaporation and rapid depletion of the dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir (rapid DIC-depletion). The impact of evaporation can be large so caves with high relative humidity are also preferable for palaeoclimate reconstruction. Even allowing for the maximum offsets that may have been induced by evaporation and rapid DIC-depletion, δ 18 O measured in some of our experiments remain higher than those predicted by Kim and O'Neil (1997). Our new results are well explained by equilibrium at a significantly higher αcalcite-water, with a kinetic-isotope effect that favours 16 O incorporation as growth rate increases. This scenario agrees with recent studies by Coplen (2007) and Dietzel et al. (2009). Overall, our results suggest that three separate processes cause δ 18 O to deviate from true isotope equilibrium in the cave environment. Two of these drive δ 18 O to higher values (evaporation and rapid DIC-depletion) while one drives δ 18 O to lower values (preferential incorporation of 16 O in the solid carbonate at faster growth rates). While evaporation and DIC-depletion can be avoided in some settings, the third may be inescapable in the cave environment and means that any temperature to δ 18 O relationship is an approximation. The controlled conditions of the present experiments also display limitations {{in the use of the}} Hendy test to identifying equilibrium growth. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety issue}} has been raised with regards to {{potential}} molten metal detachments from the weld pool and cold filler wire during electron beam welding in space. This investigation was undertaken to evaluate if molten metal could detach and {{come in contact with}} astronauts and burn through the fabric of the astronauts' Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) during electron beam welding in space. Molten metal detachments from either the weld/cut substrate or weld wire could present harm to a astronaut if the detachment was to burn through the fabric of the EMU. Theoretical models were developed to predict the possibility and size of the molten metal detachment hazards during the electron beam welding exercises at Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The primary molten metal detachment concerns were those cases of molten metal separation from the metal surface due to metal cutting, weld pool splashing, entrainment and release of molten metal due to filler wire snap-out from the weld puddle, and molten metal accumulation and release {{from the end of the}} weld wire. Some possible ways of obtaining molten metal drop detachments would include an impulse force, or bump, to the weld sample, cut surface, or filler wire. Theoretical models were developed for these detachment concerns from principles of impact and kinetic energies, surface tension, drop geometry, surface energies, and particle dynamics. The surface tension represents the force opposing the liquid metal drop from detaching whereas the weight of the liquid metal droplet represents a force that is tending to detach the molten metal drop. Theoretical calculations have indicated that only a small amount of energy is required to detach a liquid metal drop; however, much of the energy of an impact is absorbed in the sample or weld plate before it reaches the metal drop on the cut edge or surface. The tendency for detachment is directly proportional to the weld pool radius and metal density and inversely proportional to the surface tension of the liquid metal. For a detachment the initial kinetic energy of the weld pool with respect to the plate has to exceed the energy to form the extra surface required for the detachment of the pool. The difficulty is in transferring the energy from the point of impact through the plate and sample to the cut edge. It is likely that not all of the kinetic energy is available for detaching the pool; some may be sequestered in weld pool oscillations. The coefficient of restitution for the collision will be lower than one if irreversible deformation, for example plastic flow deformation, takes place during the collision. Thus determining the amount of energy from an impact that actually reaches the molten metal droplet is critical. Various molten metal detachment scenarios were tested experimentally in an enclosed vacuum chamber using the Ukrainian Universal Hand Tool, an electron beam welder designed for space welding. The experimental testing was performed in a 4 ft. X 4 ft. vacuum chamber at Marshall Space Flight Center, evacuated to vacuum levels of at least 50 microTorr, and also some welding garment material was utilized to observe the effect of the molten metal detachments on the material. A "carillon" apparatus consisting of four pendulum hammer strikers, each weighing approximately 3. 65 lbs, raised to predetermined specific heights was used to apply an impact force to the weld sample/plate during electron beam welding and cutting exercises. The strikers were released by switching on an electric motor to rotate a pin holding wires retaining the strikers at desired heights. The specimens were suspended so as to be free to respond to the blows with a sudden velocity increment. The specimens were mounted on a hinged plate for minimizing effective mass with the option to fasten it down so as to raise its effective mass closer to that anticipated for an actual space welding scenario. Measurements were made of the impact energy and the horizontal fling distances of the detached metal drops. It was not particularly easy to generate the detachments for this experiment. This document presents the details of the theoretical modeling effort and a summary of the experimental effort to measure molten metal drop detachments from terrestrial electron beam welding in the enclosed vacuum chamber. The results of the experimental effort have shown that molten metal detachments can occur from the sample/weld plate only if a sufficiently large impact force is applied to the weld plate. A "weld pool detachment parameter" was determined to indicate whether detachment would occur. Detachment can be either full or partial (dripping), Partial detachment means that the weld pool detached from one side of the liquid-solid boundary so as to leave a hole at the puddle site but remained attached over part of the liquid-solid boundary and <b>dripped</b> down the <b>plate</b> with no fully detached material detected. Full detachment, however, does not necessarily mean that the whole pool fully detached; in some cases only a smaller portion of the pool detached, the remainder dripping down the plate. The weld pool detachment parameter according to theory and according to the empirical data allows a determination of whether full detachments might occur. Theoretical calculations indicated titanium alloy would be the most difficult from which to detach molten metal droplets followed by stainless steel and then by aluminum. The experimental results were for the most part consistent with the theoretical analysis and predictions. The above theory is applicable to other situations as desired for assessing the potential for molten metal detachments...|$|R
