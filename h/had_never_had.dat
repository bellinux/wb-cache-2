5|$|Paul Schlesselman is of German {{descent and}} {{was a high school}} dropout raised by a single father in Helena–West Helena, Arkansas. He hated his small Delta region {{hometown}} because of its predominantly black population. He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> any problems with the law prior to the alleged Obama plot. He had a strong affinity for drinking and smoking.|$|E
5|$|Black Americans {{were not}} {{permitted}} to fly for the U.S. armed services prior to 1940. The Air Corps at that time, which <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a single black member, {{was part of an}} army that possessed exactly two black Regular line officers at the beginning of World War II: Brigadier Generals Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. The first Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) students completed their instruction in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{became the}} seventh {{former member of}} the Mets to go on to throw a no-hitter for another team. The other six are Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, Dwight Gooden, Hideo Nomo and David Cone. The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect game, <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a no-hitter thrown by a player in the 50-year history of the {{franchise}} (Johan Santana has since accomplished this feat).|$|E

5|$|Upon Nevelson's death her {{estate was}} {{worth at least}} $100 million. Her son, Mike Nevelson, removed 36 sculptures from her house. Documentation showed that Nevelson had bequeathed these works, worth millions, to her friend and {{assistant}} of 25 years Diana MacKown, yet Mike Nevelson claimed otherwise. Proceedings began about the estate and will, which Mike Nevelson claimed did not mention MacKown. There was talk of a potential palimony case, but despite public speculation that the two women were lovers, MacKown maintained that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> {{a sexual relationship with}} Nevelson, as did Mike Nevelson.|$|E
5|$|After {{an attempt}} on Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) life, Mark is {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective in the case. When he received conflicting information from the suspects he interviews, Mark struggled to identify the culprit. McGregor told a writer from SX News that he enjoyed {{being involved in the}} storyline, as he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> that much responsibility before. To prepare for the role, McGregor chose to research his character's job. Mark was described as being handsome, charming and a perfectionist. He was dedicated to his job as a police detective and often put his work ahead of everything else. As a consequence, Mark struggled to balance his work and personal lives. McGregor stated that he shared some similarities with Mark and he enjoyed getting into character.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{of their}} lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the {{indigenous}} sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in the fact that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E

5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Stengel was {{introduced}} as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th {{anniversary of his}} second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference {{as a sign of}} team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a major league team finish in {{the top half of the}} standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a heart attack or stroke.|$|E

5|$|When the Welsh {{family moved}} to Los Angeles, the Earps {{accepted}} an invitation to stay {{with them for a}} while in their top-floor apartment until the Earps found a place to rent. After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma were concerned about the care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, she still did not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.|$|E
5|$|According to German {{assessments}} of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets, although recent research suggests a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast {{in a press conference}} the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future Lebensraum in the east.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{decision}} {{to create a}} duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the comes civitatis (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count (comes) to duke (dux) and from county (comitatus) to duchy (ducatus) also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.|$|E

5|$|On 31 December, the {{battered}} Vénus docked in Rivière Noire and Stewart and his men, who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> {{an opportunity to}} seize their freedom, were marched to Port Louis, where they witnessed the arrival of Manche, accompanied by Créole, Charlton and United Kingdom on 1 January 1810. For their services, Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope. There they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France. Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm, they had been sighted, chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis. Bellone and her prizes arrived at Port Louis on 2 January, having slipped past Rowley's blockade {{during a period of}} calm weather.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett {{were the}} only {{experienced}} combat leaders. However, Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a chance to practice formation flying or bombing with these squadrons. He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron, or even as flight sections. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do {{in the event of}} fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
