5|$|The {{final two}} <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century saw {{the birth of}} modern {{scientific}} archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of Alfred Maudslay and Teoberto Maler. By the early 20th century, the Peabody Museum was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula. In the first two <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts. Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region.|$|E

40|$|In 2007, ten world-renowned neuroscientists {{proposed}} “A <b>Decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mind Initiative. ” The contention was that, despite <b>the</b> successes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brain, “a fundamental understanding <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> brain {{gives rise}} to the mind [was] still lacking” (2007, 1321). <b>The</b> primary aims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind were “to build on <b>the</b> progress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent <b>Decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brain (1990 - 99) ” by focusing on “four broad but intertwined areas” of research, including: healing and protecting, understanding, enriching, and modeling the mind.

5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had {{to take into account}} the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. Beginning in the last <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixteenth century, the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E

5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark.

However, the treaty {{did not address the}} situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{possesses}} definite comparative {{advantages in}} agriculture, {{as the country}} is endowed with {{a vast amount of}} highly fertile land.

5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962.
