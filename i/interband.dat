40|$|The giant {{polytene}} chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster {{have long}} been {{of interest to the}} geneticist because of the visible map of the genome provided by their characteristic banding patterns. An issue in the understanding of the molecular basis of chromosome banding has been whether the chromosomal DNA is replicated to the same extent in bands and <b>interbands.</b> Although various suggestions have been put forward the point has remained controversial. We have isolated 315 kilobases (kb) of contiguous Drosophila genomic DNA which spans an interval of approximately 13 bands and <b>interbands</b> of the polytene chromosomes.

To characterize the role of woc in telomere maintenance, we analyzed its relationships with Su(var) 205, cav, atm, and rad 50, four genes that prevent telomeric fusions; Su(var) 205 and cav encode HP 1 and HP 1 /ORC Associated Protein (HOAP), respectively. woc mutants displayed normal telomeric accumulations of both HP 1 and HOAP, and mutations in cav, Su(var) 205, atm, and rad 50 did not affect Woc localization on polytene chromosome telomeres.

50|$|<b>Interband</b> cascade lasers (ICLs) are a type {{of laser}} diode that can produce {{coherent}} radiation over {{a large part of}} the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are fabricated from epitaxially-grown semiconductor heterostructures composed of layers of indium arsenide (InAs), gallium antimonide (GaSb), aluminum antimonide (AlSb), and related alloys. These lasers are similar to quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) in several ways. Like QCLs, ICLs employ the concept of bandstructure engineering to achieve an optimized laser design and reuse injected electrons to emit multiple photons. However, in ICLs, photons are generated with <b>interband</b> transitions, rather than the intersubband transitions used in QCLs. Consequently, the rate at which the carriers injected into the upper laser subband thermally relax to the lower subband is determined by <b>interband</b> Auger, radiative, and Shockley-Read carrier recombination. These processes typically occur on a much slower time scale than the longitudinal optical phonon interactions that mediates the intersubband relaxation of injected electrons in mid-IR QCLs. The use of <b>interband</b> transitions allows laser action in ICLs to be achieved at lower electrical input powers than is possible with QCLs.|$|E

In addition to the DNA, chromosomes contain an equal weight of histones and an equal weight of non-histone chromosomal proteins. These histones are the major chromosomal structural proteins. The non-histone chromosomal proteins are involved in the DNA processes of transcription and replication, in chromosome organization and in nuclear architecture.

5000|$|Burstein's {{pioneering}} scientific achievements {{have had}} {{a major impact on}} the understanding of fundamental optical phenomena that are exhibited by condensed matter. His early work with diamond-structure crystals and with rock salt and zincblende type crystals at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) elucidated their infrared properties, explaining the mechanisms of second-order infrared absorption by long wavelength lattice vibrations in terms of electrical and mechanical anharmonicity. His fundamental studies of infrared photoconductivity due to the photoionization of impurities in silicon and germanium at liquid helium temperature provided the foundation for the development of impurity-doped silicon and germanium infrared detectors. The 1954 paper that has become his most-cited publication explained an [...] "anomalous shift" [...] of the <b>interband</b> optical absorption edge of InSb to higher energies that had been reported by researchers at Bell Labs. [...] The shift results from the conservation of wave vector in optical <b>interband</b> transitions when the Pauli exclusion principle forbids transitions to carrier-occupied states in the conduction or valence band. In later work at NRL, Burstein and his collaborators used low temperature absorption spectra to study the excited states of shallow impurities in silicon and detected deviations from the existing theoretical models. In other work, they investigated <b>interband</b> magneto-optical transitions in semiconductors, and formulated the theory of the phenomenon in terms of <b>interband</b> transitions between Landau subbands. They also reported the first observation of cyclotron resonance of electrons in InSb at room temperature at frequencies in the infrared, and explained this quantum mechanically as corresponding to intraband optical transitions between discrete Landau levels within the valence or conduction bands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{energy gap}} in a {{semiconductor}} {{under the influence}} of pressure or magnetic field slightly varies and thus does not deserve any consideration. On the other hand, in narrow-gap semiconductors this variation of energy is considerable and therefore external pressure or magnetic field may serve the purpose of tuning into the resonance of one-phonon <b>interband</b> transition. Note that <b>interband</b> transition is the transition between the conduction and valence band. This scheme considers of indirect semiconductors instead of direct semiconductors. The reasoning behind that comes from the fact that, due to the k-selection rule in semiconductors, <b>interband</b> transitions with the production of only one phonon can be only those that produce an optical phonon. However, optical phonons have a short life-time (they split into two due to anharmonicity) and therefore they add some important complications. Here we can note that even in the case of multi-stage process of acoustic phonon creation it is possible to create SASER. [...] Examples of narrow-gap indirect semiconductors that can be used are chalcogenides PbTe, PbSe and PbS with energy gap 0.15 - 0.3 eV. For the same scheme, the usage of a semiconductor heterostructure (layers of different semiconductors) with narrow gap indirect in momentum space between valence and conduction bands may be more effective. This could be more promising since the spatial separation of the layers provides a possibility of tuning the <b>interband</b> transition into resonance by an external electric field. An essential statement here is that this proposed phonon laser can operate only if the temperature is much lower than the energy gap in the semiconductor.|$|E
