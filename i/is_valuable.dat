5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective <b>is</b> <b>valuable,</b> he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E

50|$|While Rashid et al. did not examine lurkers directly, they {{conducted}} an experimental study on MovieLens that investigated {{how to raise}} low contribution rates in online communities. They discovered that participants showed a higher likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to someone than when ratings {{were associated with the}} probability of having previously watched a movie. Furthermore, they found that participants showed an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to MovieLens subgroups than when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to the entire MovieLens online community, and participants demonstrated an enhanced likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to individuals who liked similar movie genres as the participant than when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to individuals who liked dissimilar movie genres as the participant. These authors also found that participants demonstrated a reduced likelihood of rating movies when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to oneself than when ratings <b>were</b> <b>valuable</b> to someone else. Given these findings, Rashid et al. claim, “…designers can use information about the beneficiaries of contributions to create subtle and integrated messages to increase motivation”(p. 958).|$|R

5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four varieties are recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential, {{and none of the}} varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis <b>is</b> <b>valuable</b> to the beekeeping industry.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is one of}} four {{elements}} (iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium) {{that are}} ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal <b>is</b> <b>valuable</b> in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.|$|E

He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised {{that he was about to}} be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.|$|E

5|$|The pink whipray <b>is</b> <b>valuable</b> to {{ecotourism}} {{at sites}} in the Maldives, French Polynesia, and elsewhere; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers {{by the promise of}} food. The government of the Maldives has taken steps to preserve ray ecotourism by banning all exports of ray products in 1995. In 2005, stingray ecotourism at Moorea brought in over €500,000. However, a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of ecotourism in the form of bite and impact injuries, stemming from artificially high ray density and interactions with boat traffic at the feeding sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pink whipray as Vulnerable overall. Although the species has a wide distribution that includes refuge regions with few conservation threats such as the population off northern Australia. By contrast the Southeast Asian population is heavily fished.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It <b>is</b> <b>valuable</b> enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E
