Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver.

5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. <b>He</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E

5|$|Jacques {{joined the}} Quebec Citadelles in 1947. It was while {{playing for the}} Citadelles that Plante started to play the puck outside his crease. He {{developed}} this technique when <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers. They believed that a goaltender should stay in net and let his players recover the puck. Plante {{had come to the}} conclusion that as long as he was in control of the puck, the opponents could not shoot it at him – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team. The Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Frank J. Selke, became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract with the Canadiens' organization. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate Royal Montreal Hockey Club, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|Megalosaurus {{may have}} been the first dinosaur, apart from modern birds, to be {{described}} in the scientific literature. Part of a bone was recovered from the Taynton Limestone Formation of Stonesfield limestone quarry, Oxfordshire in 1676. Sir Thomas Pennyson gave the fragment to Robert Plot, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum, who published a description and illustration in his Natural History of Oxfordshire in 1676. It was the first illustration of a dinosaur bone published. Plot correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the thighbone or femur of a large animal and <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> it was too large to belong to any species known to be living in England. He therefore at first concluded it to be the thighbone of a Roman war elephant and later that of a giant human, such as those mentioned in the Bible. The bone has since been lost, but the illustration is detailed enough that some have since identified it as that of Megalosaurus.|$|E

25|$|Many {{important}} political {{figures on the}} left have never publicized their views on biology, and so their opinions of evolutionary theory are unknown. To some extent, Marxists are the exception. Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin supported Darwin's evolutionary theory.

Karl Marx's work was based on a material view of the world that showed natural causes and effects for all aspects of human society and economy. <b>He</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> Darwin's work provided a similar material explanation for all of nature, thus supporting Marx's worldview.|$|E

After that defeat, Borg {{walked off}} the court {{and out of the}} stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun, and headed {{straight}} for the airport. There are reports that Borg received threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often.

25|$|Sheridan's raid was {{an overall}} {{tactical}} success, having killed Jeb Stuart at Yellow Tavern and beaten Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge, all with relatively minimal casualties—about 625 {{men for the}} entire raid, compared to 800 Confederate. From a strategic standpoint, however, the raid deprived General Grant of the cavalry resources {{that would have been}} helpful at Spotsylvania Court House and his subsequent advance to the North Anna River, and there are lingering questions about whether Sheridan should have attempted to assault the city of Richmond. In the latter case, Sheridan believed {{it would not have been}} worth the risk in casualties and <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> the chances of holding the city for more than a brief time would be minimal; any advantages would primarily result from damage to Confederate morale.|$|E
25|$|Einstein (1908) tried– as a {{preliminary}} {{in the framework}} of special relativity– also to include accelerated frames within the relativity principle. In the course of this attempt <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> for any single moment of acceleration of a body one can define an inertial reference frame in which the accelerated body is temporarily at rest. It follows that in accelerated frames defined in this way, the application of the constancy of the speed of light to define simultaneity is restricted to small localities. However, the equivalence principle that was used by Einstein in the course of that investigation, which expresses the equality of inertial and gravitational mass and the equivalence of accelerated frames and homogeneous gravitational fields, transcended the limits of special relativity and resulted in the formulation of general relativity.|$|E
25|$|Navigation through Lincoln {{and on to}} Boston was {{hampered}} by the shallow draught available under the medieval High Bridge, just below Brayford Pool. Sir Joseph Banks, when proposing {{the construction of the}} Horncastle Canal knew that the problem needed addressing, and William Jessop was commissioned to survey the Witham and the Fossdyke in 1791, with particular reference to the junction between the two. He proposed a bypass to the south of the city, using the Sincil Dyke, or excavating the channel beneath the bridge, although <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>that</b> this solution was not ideal, due to the narrow width of the bridge hole, and the lack of a towing path through it. However, the city was keen to keep trade within its limits, and improvements to High Bridge, which were completed by 1795, were authorised as part of the Horncastle Canal act of 1792.|$|E
