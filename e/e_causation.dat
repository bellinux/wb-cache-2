40|$|The {{recent decades}} {{have seen a}} steady growth of {{international}} trade of goods. In order to harmonize the legal environment concerning this materia, attempts for unification of international sales law have been made. In the field of sales of goods, several international instruments have been adopted. These include the (unsuccessful) Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods, the model laws, i. e. the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and the Principles of European Contract Law, and, most notably, the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods (CISG). This master's thesis aims to explore one type of remedies for non-performance under the CISG, namely provisions on damages. In a great detail, articles 74, 77, 79 and 80 will be analysed. First, a detailed commentary on two major prerequisites for liability for damages, i. <b>e.</b> <b>causation</b> and foreseeability, will be given. The various factual and legal causation theories will be described. Then it will be demonstrated why it is just and useful that the CISG contains a provision for limiting liability to foreseeable loss and how foreseeability is measured. We will then move to another method of limiting damages - mitigation rule. It will be shown why {{it is in the}} aggrieved party's best [...] ...|$|E

In this dissertation, I confront the issue of negative causation, (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>causation</b> by or of absences). I investigate the causal status of absences with regard to particular philosophical concerns and argue that absences are very often causes and effects. On my analysis, it turns out that absences - at least those absences thought to be causally efficacious - are not metaphysical absences. They are perfectly ordinary entities, thus candidates for causal relata. Generally, I argue that the notion of an "absence" has been ill-understood and that this has been aggravated by focusing on sentences of the canonical form, "the absence of x caused y. " Such a focus engenders the view that absences are capable of being causally efficacious only if there exists some entity, absence of x. If such a view were correct, then the case for absences as causes is a non-starter; there are no such entities. Instead, I recast the argument for negative causation as a vindication of our intuitive judgments that statements of the canonical and related forms are very often true and express genuine causal relations...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{the past}} decade has {{centered}} around questions concerning the impact of cohabitation on marriage. A number of studies confirm that people who cohabit prior to marriage report lower levels of marital quality and experience higher rates of divorce than those who do not cohabit prior to marriage. Researchers have failed to agree, however, on why marriages preceded by cohabitation tend to be less successful. One possibility is that people who cohabit are also the same people who are more likely to divorce (i. e. Selection Hypothesis). It is also possible that the experience of cohabitation increases the risk of divorce, perhaps by causing changes in values and attitudes which are associated with it (i. <b>e.</b> <b>Causation</b> Hypothesis). ^ Determining what causes greater instability of marriages preceded by cohabitation is important for many reasons. Studies show that many cohabitating relationships involve children who may suffer the consequences of family disruption. Policy makers and professionals can benefit from this research as they strive to create family policy which will strengthen marriages and also try to help troubled relationships. Although previous work has examined areas of difference among cohabitors and noncohabitors, we still lack information as to why these differences exist. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare these two explanations for differences in marital quality between those who cohabit and those who do not. Data are taken from the National Survey of Families and Households, a nationally representative survey of adults age 19 and up, in the United States. The sample for the present study includes three-hundred-sixteen respondents age 35 and younger, who were never married and had never cohabited at the time of NSFH 1 and who were married, divorced or separated from their first marriage at NSFH 2. ^ In this sample, evidence that cohabitation is associated with reduced marital quality is weak to nonexistent. Cohabitation was not a significant predictor of marital happiness, marital interaction or marital instability. The only outcome measures significantly related to cohabitation were marital disagreements, marital success and the index of marital instability. In the cases of these variables, some seems to be explained by selection. I conclude that the selection hypothesis may become less useful as an explanation for lower marital quality and higher rates of divorce among cohabitors as younger cohorts of couples continue to cohabit at high rates. While cohabitation appears to be related to levels of discord in a marriage, it does not appear to be related to measures of marital happiness. Future research should examine the reasons why couples choose to cohabit, as well as the personal characteristics of partners in cohabiting relationships. These factors could have an impact on the level of disagreements among cohabiting couples. ...|$|E

We propose an alteration that improves the analysis of dynamics, especially with respect to emerging innovation systems.

By mapping events, the interactions between system functions and their development over time can be analysed.

However, while the use of ICTs in development has increased dramatically in recent years, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the impact and uptake of programmes. Therefore, the following article describes the development of El Promotor, a multi-media, interactive programme for poor farmers on the Bolivian Altiplano. The study further examined the relationship between new and existing knowledge regarding animal health and production among 85 farmers in 13 communities, who utilised the programme. The authors found that the uptake of new knowledge was highly dependent upon the specific topic involved i. <b>e.</b> disease <b>causation,</b> symptoms, treatment and prevention. Not surprisingly, the level of challenge to existing beliefs also impacted learning levels. Nonetheless, by utilising visual referents, which supported customary knowledge, improvements in farmer understanding of disease causation, diagnosis, treatment were noted after use of the programme.

In order to successfully create a coherent representation of the described situation, readers are required to monitor all these situational dimensions during reading. However, {{little is known about}} whether these dimensions differ in the ease with which they can be monitored. In the present study, we examined whether children in Grades 4 and 6 monitor four different dimensions (i. <b>e.,</b> emotion, <b>causation,</b> time, and space) during reading, using a self-paced reading task containing inconsistencies. Furthermore, to explore what causes failure in inconsistency detection, we differentiated between monitoring processes related to availability and validation of information by manipulating the distance between two pieces of conflicting information. The results indicated that the monitoring processes varied as a function of dimension. Children were able to validate emotional and causal information when it was still active in working memory, but {{this was not the case}} for temporal and spatial information. When context and target information were more distant from each other, only emotionally charged information remained available for further monitoring processes. These findings show that the influence of different situational dimensions should be taken into account when studying children’s reading comprehension...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the causal {{relationships}} between work characteristics, {{in terms of}} job demands and job resources, and both targets' and perpetrators' reports of workplace bullying, are investigated. In line with the Job Demands-Resources model and the bullying literature, we assumed that both high job demands (i. e. workload, role conflict and job insecurity) and low job resources (i. e. task autonomy, social support and skill utilization) increase bullying over time (i. <b>e.</b> normal <b>causation).</b> Our sample included 177 employees of various establishments of a large Belgian organization. The results of structural equation modelling analyses partially supported our hypothesis. As expected, we found that T 1 job demands related positively to targets' reports of bullying at T 2 one year later, and that T 1 job resources related negatively to T 2 targets' reports of bullying. Unexpectedly, {{there was no significant}} cross-lagged effect of T 1 job demands and resources on T 2 perpetrator's reports of bullying. No evidence was found for reverse causation or reciprocal effects. Overall, at least for targets, these findings support the validity of the theoretical models postulating a causal link from work characteristics to workplace bullying. status: publishe...|$|R

In recent years, {{agent-based}} modeling has gained popularity in many scientific areas as a modeling tool capable of capturing the dynamics that arise from the interactions between individuals (e. g, Gilbert and Troitzsch, 2005). The perspective of this method, rooted in complexity theory, is that phenomena at the macro—or aggregated—level can be understood as emerging from interactions between individuals at the micro level. On their turn, these macro phenomena affect the behavioral context at the micro level, a process referred to as downward <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., Emmeche, K ppe, and Stjernfelt, 2000).

Abstract concepts that define our everyday realities (<b>e.</b> g. states, <b>causation)</b> are claimed {{by some to be}} metaphorically structured, and reducible to a universal set of primary metaphors (LAKOFF; JOHNSON, 1999), while argued by others to be structured by non-metaphorical cultural understandings instead (QUINN, 1991). Recognizing the need for empirical testing of the universalist claim, I analyze Buddhist conceptualizations of states-of-being, rebirth and event structure for their reducibility to primary metaphors. I show that while some concepts are reducible to universal primary metaphors, others might be constituted by culture-specific understandings instead. I also question the concept of primary metaphor itself, suggesting that supposedly universal primary metaphors already carry culturally-biased preconceptions, and urge the Lakoffian school to justify the assumed universality of subjective experiences which give rise to primary metaphors...|$|R

To achieve this end we have to successfully integrate explanations based on semiotic causation into well-established accounts given by traditional biology, the latter typically grounded on chains of efficient <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., bioenergetic flows, oxidation-reduction mechanisms, etc.). How this integration is to be achieved in different situations is somewhat elusive at present.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} semantic-pragmatic {{functions}} of the Korean causal connective –nikka. It has been widely observed that because-clauses are ambiguous depending {{on the level of}} causation: propositional, epistemic, and speech-act level <b>causations.</b> (<b>e.</b> g.

I argue, departing from previous analyses, that the three different levels of causation do not exist in Korean. Alternatively, I propose that a nikka-clause always targets a propositional argument. Under this point of view, it is assumed that a nikka-clause takes a mood marked phrase: [ϕ-nikka [Mood(φ) ]. On the basis of this structure, I argue that the various function of the nikka-clause results from the different types of mood in the main clause...|$|R

Drawing upon the theoretical framework of the situational action theory of crime <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g.

To achieve this we use data from the English Peterborough Youth Study and the Swedish Eskilstuna Youth Study. The findings show that in both cities (1) young people’s self-reported violent behaviour is predicted by crime propensity and lifestyle, and their interaction, and (2) a substantial proportion (40 percent) of the difference in the level of violence vanishes when taking into account national differences in young people’s crime propensity and lifestyles. We conclude that the findings support the notion that one major cause of the difference in the level of violence among young people in England and Sweden is that more young people in England have a higher crime propensity and are living criminogenic lifestyles than in Sweden...|$|R
40|$|How {{do people}} {{attribute}} responsibility {{in situations where}} the contributions of multiple agents combine to produce a joint outcome? The prevalence of over-determination in such cases makes this a difficult problem for counterfactual theories of causal responsibility. In this article, we explore a general framework for assigning responsibility in multiple agent contexts. We draw on the structural model account of actual <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., Halpern & Pearl, 2005) and its extension to responsibility judgments (Chockler & Halpern, 2004). We review the main theoretical and empiri-cal issues that arise from this literature and propose a novel model of intuitive judgments of responsibility. This model {{is a function of}} both pivotality (whether an agent made a difference to the outcome) and criticality (how important the agent is perceived to be for the outcome, before any actions are taken). The model explains empirical results from previous studies and is sup-ported by a new experiment that manipulates both pivotality and criticality. We also discuss possi-ble extensions of this model to deal with a broader range of causal situations. Overall, our approach emphasizes the close interrelations between causality, counterfactuals, and responsibility attributions...|$|R

Our findings indicate that lay conceptions of hypocrisy are often at odds with philosophical speculation. We argue that a complete understanding of the criteria for hypocrisy requires consideration of how ordinary people construe the concept. In contrast to some concepts (<b>e.</b> g., physical <b>causation),</b> for which lay conceptions, while interesting, are largely irrelevant, hypocrisy is an essential component of social judgment. One could argue, therefore, that folk wisdom is the ultimate arbiter of what hypocrisy entails. We note limitations of our methodology and suggest avenues for future research...|$|R
40|$|Commentators {{traditionally}} {{attribute the}} success of twentieth century bio-logy to the assumption that complex biological phenomena and their causal pathways are reducible to elementary causal phenomena. Recently, however, some commentators challenge the sufficiency of reductionism for investiga-ting these phenomena.

In this paper, I utilize contemporary cancer research as a case study to explore the role of reductionism and antireductionism for guiding scientific research. The chief paradigm directing contemporary cancer research is a modified somatic mutation theory, in which researchers presume mutated genes are responsible for causing cancer. An organicism approach (top-down <b>causation),</b> <b>e.</b> g. the tissue organization field theory, is contesting this traditional reductionism approach (bottom-up causation) to the disease. Today, however, a systems biology approach is superseding both of these approaches. In this approach, systems biologists explain cancer in terms of a heterogeneous complex network composed of bidirectional or reciprocal interactions (bottom-up and top-down causation combined) among various hierarchical levels including genes, cells, and tissue architecture, organism, and environment. In a concluding section, I discuss the question of whether systems biology represents a synthesis between reductionism and antireductionism. 1...|$|R

40|$|While men {{do indeed}} {{construct}} self-validating and often peculiar {{interpretations of the}} realities of their world {{the simple fact that}} these views become consensually shared doctrines of experience does not protect them from the revisionism of historical scrutiny. These perceptions of the world become retrospectively altered as developing bodies of knowledge reject them as being clearly deceptive or anachronistic. The concept of psychopathology, distinguished historically under many rubrics, has not been immune to these same processes of modification, nor has it ever been free of the diverse irrationalities which men of all ages have constructed to explain the etiology and treatment of deviant behavior. Historically, consideration of atypical behavior all reflect attempts to explain dysfunction utilizing existing systems of belief and knowledge. For example, primitive and ancient societies advanced quasi-theoretical frameworks that stressed either external <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., spirit intervention, sorcery, demonic possession, lunacy, bewitchment) or personal <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., loss of soul, breach of taboo, object intrusion, brain disease). Of course, retrospective evaluation of these explanatory devices have found them to be woefully impoverished. With the advent of science these archaic beliefs were found to be incompatible with a rational view of the world where all events had logical and determinable causes. Moreover, with the development of the medical model of disease, aberrant behavior, of a functional nature, could be explained and treated in the same systematic manner as that which had an organic basis. While the 2 ̆ 2 new view 2 ̆ 2 still distinguished between external and internal causation of psychopathology, it radically redefined explanatory concepts and apparently located dynamics of the disease process within the individual. The classic psychiatric/psychological approach has (and continues to) stressed the description and classification of pathological signs and symptoms and when etiology was considered, illness was accounted for more often than not by such intra-psychic factors as anxiety, stress, breakdown of defense mechanisms and ego strength. Current theories of psychopathology have not been quite as oblivious to the effects of the individual 2 ̆ 7 s environment in the production and maintenance of both functional and organic illness.

In line with the occupational stressor-strain model, we integrated P-E fit literature with workplace bullying research; where this phenomenon is seen as a form of a social-behavioral strain. We hypothesized that a low fit between the employee and his/her job (P-J), his/her work unit (P-G) as well as her/her organization (P-O) increases workplace bullying over time (i. <b>e.</b> normal <b>causation).</b> Based on scholars’ findings of reversed strain-stress relationships, we also tested a reversed causation where workplace bullying predicts low fit. Finally, we compared these two causal relationships with a reciprocal model in which both misfit and bullying influence each other over time. In all, this study adds to the literature by (1) being among the first to explore the combination of both personal and environmental factors as antecedents of workplace bullying by integrating the P-E fit theoretical lens, (2) applying a cross-lagged design which may indicate causality and (3) extending previous research on P-E fit theory by focusing on misfit and exploring its relation with workplace bullying using the recent multidimensional approach of fit theory. Our hypotheses were examined in a full panel two-wave longitudinal design of Belgian employees (N= 333) with a time lag of one year. Preliminary results – in which we tested the manifest SEM model using AMOS 22 – revealed a reversed negative causal relationship between being a target of workplace bullying at Time 1 and P-G fit at Time 2. The other hypothesized relationships were not significant. These findings suggest that being a target of workplace bullying could be regarded as a possible cause of perceived misfit within the group instead of being its consequence. However, since these findings are preliminary, further analyses – applying a latent SEM – will also be presented at the symposium allowing us to compare the results and discuss them in view of theory and future research. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{alternative}} conception of self-control {{and its role}} in crime causation to the one advanced by Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) in their influential General Theory of Crime. Our conception is based on the theoretical framework outlined in the situational action theory of crime <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g. Wikström 2006 a). We propose that self-control is best analysed as a situational concept (a factor in the process of choice) rather than as an individual trait. We suggest that the core individual trait influencing an individual's ability to exercise self-control is executive capability. We maintain that there are also important environmental influences on an individual's ability to exercise self-control. We submit that the ability to exercise self-control is a relevant factor in crime causation only in situations where an individual considers (deliberates) whether or not to engage in an act of crime. We argue that for most people (in most circumstances) whether or not they engage in acts of crime {{is not a question of}} their ability to exercise self-control but rather a question of their morality. In short, this paper aims to clarify the concepts of ‘executive capability’, ‘self-control’ and ‘crime’, and to specify their relationships and role in the explanation of crime...|$|R

However, few studies have explored the extent to which this association reflects reverse causation.

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children collected data on objectively assessed activity levels of 4, 296 children at age 11 y with recorded BMI and genotypic data. We used 32 established genetic correlates of BMI combined in a weighted allelic score as an instrumental variable for adiposity to estimate the causal effect of adiposity on activity. In observational analysis, a 3. 3 kg/m² (one standard deviation) higher BMI was associated with 22. 3 (95 % CI, 17. 0, 27. 6) movement counts/min less total physical activity (p =  1. 6 × 10 ⁻¹⁶), 2. 6 (2. 1, 3. 1) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity (p =  3. 7 × 10 ⁻²⁹), and 3. 5 (1. 5, 5. 5) min/d more sedentary time (p =  5. 0 × 10 ⁻⁴). In Mendelian randomization analyses, the same difference in BMI was associated with 32. 4 (0. 9, 63. 9) movement counts/min less total physical activity (p =  0. 04) (∼ 5. 3 % of the mean counts/minute), 2. 8 (0. 1, 5. 5) min/d less moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity (p =  0. 04), and 13. 2 (1. 3, 25. 2) min/d more sedentary time (p =  0. 03). There was no strong evidence for a difference between variable estimates from observational estimates. Similar results were obtained using fat mass index. Low power and poor instrumentation of activity limited causal analysis of the influence of physical activity on BMI. Our results suggest that increased adiposity causes a reduction in physical activity in children and support research into the targeting of BMI in efforts to increase childhood activity levels. Importantly, this does not exclude lower physical activity also leading to increased adiposity, i. <b>e.,</b> bidirectional <b>causation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose Can a {{perceived}} misfit {{with the work}} environment lead to workplace bullying {{or is it the}} other way around? The current study explores this question and examines the causal relationship between the different types of person-environment (P-E) misfit and both targets’ and perpetrators’ reports of workplace bullying. In line with the occupational stressor-strain model, we integrated P-E fit literature with workplace bullying research; where this phenomenon is seen as a form of a social-behavioral strain (Baillien, De Cuyper, & De Witte, 2011). We hypothesized that a low fit between the employee and his/her job (P-J), his/her work unit (P-G) as well as her/her organization (P-O) increases workplace bullying over time (i. <b>e.</b> normal <b>causation).</b> Based on scholars’ findings of reversed strain-stressor relationships (Tang, 2014), we also tested a reversed causation where workplace bullying predicts low fit. Finally, we compared these two causal relationships with a reciprocal model in which both misfit and bullying influence each other over time. In all, this study adds to the literature by (1) being among the first to explore the combination of both personal and environmental factors as antecedents of workplace bullying by integrating the P-E fit theoretical lens, (2) applying a cross-lagged design which may indicate causality and (3) extending previous research on P-E fit theory by focusing on misfit and exploring its relation with workplace bullying using the recent multidimensional approach of fit theory. Method Our hypotheses were examined in a full panel two-wave longitudinal design of Belgian employees (N= 333) with a time lag of one year. Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (AMOS 22). Results Preliminary results – in which we tested the manifest SEM model – revealed only a significant reversed negative strain-stressor relationship between being a target of bullying at Time 1 and P-G fit at Time 2. Normal stressor-strain and reciprocal hypotheses were not significant. Conclusions These findings suggest that being a target of bullying could be regarded as a possible cause of perceived misfit within the group instead of being its consequence. However, since these findings are preliminary, further analyses – applying a latent SEM – will also be presented at the conference allowing us to compare the results and discuss them in view of theory and future research. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to improve students’ reading comprehension through recognizing text organizations at SMP N 3 Polokarto Sukoharjo. This research applied the principles of action research. It was conducted in two cycles. The subjects of the study were 40 students of Class VIIIC of SMP N 3 Polokarto, Sukoharjo. In collecting data, the research employed some techniques, namely observations, interviews, and reading tests. The data were in the forms of field notes, students’ tests and interview transcripts. To deal with the problems, the researcher implemented recognizing text organizations as the main activity. This strategy has five kinds of patterns organization, i. <b>e.</b> description, sequence, <b>causation,</b> problem/solution, and comparison. This research employed the strategies of recognizing the description pattern for descriptive texts and recognizing the sequence pattern for recount texts because the focus on this research was descriptive and recount texts. In reference to the application of two cycles, the results of the research reveal that the use of recognizing text organizations, particularly, the strategy of recognizing the description and the sequence patterns successfully improved the students’ reading comprehension. The students were able to identify the ideas of paragraphs explained in supporting details and topics told in the chronological order in the texts so that they understood the texts. In addition, these activities made them become more active because they were accustomed to identifying the patterns before they answered questions. They also enjoyed the teaching and learning process of reading. The improvements were also seen from the students’ mean score from Pre-test and Post-test, 4. 57 and 6. 61, and from Achievement Tests 1 and 2 were 8. 03 and 9. 13...|$|R
40|$|Situations {{in which}} there is {{uncertainty}} over the cause of harm are studied (e. g., was the lung cancer due to normal exposure to medical x-radiation, to smoking, to exposure to carcinogens discharged by a chemical plant?); and the effects on incentives to reduce risk of various ways of treating such uncertainty under the liability system are identified using a theoretical model of the occurrence of harm. The main points are these. Use of a threshold probabilit' of <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., 50 %) as a criterion for determining liability may adversely affect behavior: parties might face a diminished burden of liability (if their probability of causation systematically fell below the threshold) and thus do too little to reduce risk; or they might face an extra burden (if their probability were systematically above the threshold), and thus do too much. Second, the best all or nothing criterion for determining liability (a criterion under which a party is fully liable if at all liable) is different in form from a threshold probability criterion. Third, liability in proportion to the probability of causation is superior to all other criteria and results in socially ideal behavior. These points are demonstrated and analyzed in two types of case: where the uncertainty involves a party versus natural or "background" factors; and where it involves which party among several was the author of harm. The importance of the points is shown to depend on the type of case, and as well on the form of liability (strict liability or the negligence rule). The interpretation of the analysis and important qualifications to it are discussed in a concluding section. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new series}} {{entitled}} Oxford Philosophical Concepts (OPC) {{made its debut}} in November 2014. As the series’ Editor Christia Mercer notes, this series {{is an attempt to}} respond to the call for and the tendency of many philosophers to invigorate the discipline. To that end each volume will rethink a central concept in the history of philosophy, <b>e.</b> g. efficient <b>causation,</b> health, evil, eternity, etc. “Each OPC volume is a history of its concept in that it tells a story about changing solutions to specific philosophical problems” (xiii). The series presents itself as innovative along three main lines: its reexamination of the so-called “canon,” its reconsidering the value of interdisciplinary exchanges, and its encouraging philosophers to move beyond the current borders of philosophy. By engaging with non-Western traditions and carefully considering topics and materials which are not strictly philosophical, the collections from this series aim to render the history of philosophy accessible to a wide audience. The first OPC volume to appear in print is “Efficient Causation – A History” edited by Tad Schmaltz. Using careful historical and philosophical analysis as well as interdisciplinary reflections this anthology proposes {{to tell the story of}} how efficient causation, equated nowadays with “causation” tout court, came to play its prominent role in our philosophical and scientific vocabulary. Eleven contributions cover the period from Ancient times (Aristotle and the Stoics), through the Middle Ages (both the Western and the Islamic traditions), passing through the Early Modern times (represented here by Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Malebranche, Berkeley and Hume), all the way to Kant and finally contemporary philosophers (classified into two opposing camps: Humean and Neo-Aristotelian). There are also four reflections which explore the applications of the notion of efficient causation to areas different from philosophy, especially the arts (literature, music, painting, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|Trace element {{concentrations}} {{and combined}} Sr- and Nd-isotope compositions were determined on stromatolitic carbonates (microbialites) from the 2. 52 Ga Campbellrand carbonate platform (South Africa). Shale-normalised {{rare earth element}} and yttrium patterns of the ancient samples {{are similar to those}} of modern seawater in having positive La and Y anomalies and in being depleted in light rare earth elements. In contrast to modem seawater (and microbialite proxies), the 2. 52 Ga samples lack a negative Ce anomaly but possess a positive Eu anomaly. These latter trace element characteristics are interpreted to reflect anoxic deep ocean waters where, unlike today, hydrothermal Fe input was not oxidised, and scavenged and rare earth elements were not coprecipitated with Fe-oxyhydroxides. The persistence of a positive Eu anomaly in relatively shallow Campbellrand platform waters indicates a dramatic reversal from hydrothermally dominated (Archaean) to continental erosion-dominated (Phanerozoic) rare earth element flux ratio. The dominant hydrothermal input is also expressed in the initial Sr- and Nd-isotope ratios. There is collinear variation in Sr-Nd systematics, which range from primitive values (Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 of 0. 702386 and epsilon (Nd) of + 2. 1) to more evolved crustal ratios. Mixing calculations show that the range in trace element ratios (e. g., Y/Ho) and initial isotope ratios is not a result of contamination by trapped sediment, but that the chemical band isotopic variation reflects carbonate deposition in an environment where different water masses mixed. Calculated Nd flux ratios yield a hydrothermal input into the 2. 52 Ga oceans one order of magnitude larger than continental input. Such a change in flux ratio most likely required substantially reduced continental inputs, which could, in turn, reflect a plate tectonic <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., reduced topography or expansion of epicontinental seas).

40|$|Abstract Background Women’s {{beliefs and}} {{representations}} {{of breast cancer}} (BC) and breast screening (BS) are salient predictors for BS practices. This study utilized the health belief model (HBM) and common-sense model (CSM) of illness self-regulation to explore factors associated with BS uptake in Malta and subsequently, to identify the most important predictors to first screening uptake. Methods This cross-sectional survey enrolled Maltese women (n =  404) ages 50 to 60 {{at the time of}} their first screening invitation, invited to the National Breast Screening Programme by stratified random sampling, with no personal history of BC. Participants responded to a 121 -item questionnaire by telephone between June–September 2015. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and logistic regression. Results There is high awareness of BC signs and symptoms among Maltese women (> 80 % agreement for 7 out of 8 signs), but wide variation about <b>causation</b> (<b>e.</b> g., germ or virus: 38. 6 % ‘agree’, 30. 7 % ‘disagree’). ‘Fear’ was the key reason for non-attendance to first invitation (41 %, n =  66) and was statistically significant across all subscale items (p <  0. 05). Most items within HBM constructs (perceived barriers; cues to action; self-efficacy) were significantly associated with first invitation to the National Breast Screening Programme, such as fear of result (χ 2  =  12. 0, p =  0. 017) and life problems were considered greater than getting mammography (χ 2  =  38. 8, p =  0. 000). Items within CSM constructs of Illness Representation (BC causes; cyclical cancer timeline; consequences) were also significantly associated, such as BC was considered to be life-changing (χ 2  =  18. 0, p =  0. 000) with serious financial consequences (χ 2  =  13. 3, p =  0. 004). There were no significant associations for socio-demographic or health status variables with uptake, except for family income (χ 2  =  9. 7, p =  0. 047). Logistic regression analyses showed that HBM constructs, in particular perceived barriers, were the strongest predictors of non-attendance to first invitation throughout the analyses (p <  0. 05). However, the inclusion of illness representation dimensions improved the model accuracy to predict non-attendance when compared to HBM alone (65 % vs 38. 8 %). Conclusions Interventions should be based on theory including HBM and CSM constructs, and should target first BS uptake and specific barriers to reduce disparities and increase BS uptake in Malta...|$|R
40|$|Biological functions, at all {{integrative}} {{levels of}} biology, are readily {{understood as the}} justification (or explanation) of the actual occurrence of the structures involved into their execution. This brings back directly to Aristotelian " final causes " and it is why modern epistemologists have struggled to offer concepts of function rid of any finalism. The two current answers, known as the etiological and systemic concepts of function respectively echo Mayr's distinction between historical and functional biology (1961). Those two aspects of biology convey either the historical (phylogenetic) or functional (mechanistic) modes of explanations for every actual structuro-functional occurrences. Each aspect is set within distinct epistemological (experimental/nomological vs. comparative/historical) frameworks, dealing with the analysis of proximate and ultimate causes, respectively. A third {{point of view on}} causal explanation of form/function relationships was reintroduced in modern science by Seilacher (1970) and Gould, (2002) namely a structuralist (or constructional) input which mainly deals with the constraints (eg. topological) imposed by the materials organisms are built from. Accordingly, three general aspects of causation, historical, functional and structural, may be involved together in the origin of any form/function relationship in biology. Integrating them should bring satisfactory causal explanations of empirical data. However, little progress has been accomplished in practice towards this goal, because a methodologically efficient tool was lacking. We have applied a new statistical method which allows partitioning the variation of a given biological trait among the three causal factors evoked above to analyze growth function in bone. 1 / Historical component. The variation of bone growth rates contains a significant phylogenetic signal, suggesting that the observed patterns are partly the outcome of shared ancestry. 2 / Functional causation. Resting metabolic rate may determine the maximum possible bone growth rate. 3 / Structural constraint. While soft tissues grow through a multiplicative process, growth of mineralised tissues is accretionary (additive, i. e. it occurs only at free surfaces). Bone growth of many amniotes partially circumvents this topological constraint by new bone being laid down not only at the external surface of the bone shaft, but also within cavities included in the bone cortex as it grows centrifugally. The three causal components interfere a great deal: i. <b>e.</b> the functional <b>causation</b> is in part phylogenetically structured. Accordingly, it becomes possible now to decipher quantitatively the complex causality of the structure/function conundrum...|$|R

John T. Distelhorst Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Melissa A. Schiff Epidemiology BACKGROUND: Trauma occurs in 6 to 7 % of all pregnancies, however, no studies have {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the trauma certification level of the hospital as it relates to maternal and neonatal outcomes for injured pregnant women who are hospitalized in a trauma center. METHODS: We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study evaluating the association between trauma designation Levels 1 and 2 (Level 1 - 2) and Levels 3 and 4 (Level 3 - 4) and maternal and neonatal birth outcomes. Study subjects were pregnant women hospitalized for injury identified by linking Washington State birth and fetal death certificate data and the Washington State Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Recording System (CHARS). As the start date of the study was chosen to correspond with the initiation of the trauma hospital designation system in Washington State, this study evaluated injured pregnant women from 1995 through 2012. Injury was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 9) injury diagnosis and external <b>causation</b> (<b>E)</b> codes. Specific types of injuries and mechanisms of injury were abstracted from the database. The association between higher-level trauma hospital designation and risk of adverse maternal and neonatal birth outcomes was analyzed using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for Injury Severity Score. RESULTS: Following exclusions, 2, 492 injured pregnant women hospitalized in a trauma center were identified for analysis. With few exceptions, maternal and neonatal birth outcomes showed no association with trauma hospital level designation. Women treated at trauma Level 1 - 2 hospitals had an adjusted odds ratio of preterm labor of 1. 43 (95 % CI: 1. 15 - 1. 79, p 9, treated at trauma Level 1 - 2 hospitals had an adjusted odds of low birth weight, < 2, 500 grams, of 2. 52 (95 % CI: 1. 12 - 5. 64, p < 0. 01). All other maternal and neonatal birth outcomes showed no association with trauma hospital level designation. CONCLUSION: The majority of maternal and neonatal outcomes had no association with hospitalization at a Level 1 - 2 trauma center compared to a Level 3 - 4 trauma center. This study can inform state trauma systems, guide allocation of trauma resources and pre-hospital patient care...|$|R
