5|$|Two {{species are}} IUCN Vulnerable: the desert {{tortoise}} (California and Nevada) and the gopher tortoise (Georgia, also the official tortoise of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin</b> (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), {{and the common}} box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. Interestingly, all the non-turtle reptiles fall into this category, but the only two turtles in relative safety are the common snapping turtle (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} the home of {{approximately}} 175 different species of birds, including terns and osprey. More than 1,000 <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins</b> have been reported hatching annually on the island in recent years.|$|R
50|$|Many human {{activities}} threaten {{the safety of}} <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins.</b> The terrapins get caught and drown in crab nets that humans put out, are suffocated by pollution that humans greatly contribute to, and lose their marsh and estuarine habitats because of urban development.|$|R
5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin</b> (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog turtle and spotted turtle are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood turtle.|$|E

25|$|Species {{other than}} blue crab are often caught {{incidentally}} in crab pots, including fish, turtles, conch, and other crab species. In Georgia, hermit crabs (Pagurus spp.), channeled whelk (Busycon canaliculatum), spider crabs (Libinia spp.), and stone crabs (Menippe mercenaria) {{were the most}} common species observed as bycatch in commercial crab pots. Of important concern is the <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin,</b> Malaclemys terrapin. The blue crab and <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin</b> have overlapping ranges along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States. Because the funnels in a crab pot are flexible, small terrapins may easily enter and become entrapped. Traps are checked every 24 hours or less, frequently resulting in drowning and death of terrapins. Crab pot bycatch may reduce local terrapin populations to less than half. To reduce terrapin entrapment, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) may be installed {{on each of the}} funnels in a crab pot. BRDs effectively reduce bycatch (and subsequently mortality) of small terrapins without affecting blue crab catch.|$|E

Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda include its national bird, the Bermuda petrel or cahow. It was rediscovered in 1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620s. It is important {{as an example of a}} Lazarus species. The government has a programme to protect it, including restoration of a habitat area. The Bermuda rock skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. Recently through genetic DNA studies, scientists have discovered that a species of turtle, the <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin,</b> previously thought to have been introduced, pre-dated the arrival of humans in the archipelago. As this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds, some question whether it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Curley Byrd—who {{served as}} the university's {{football}} and baseball coach, athletic director, and president—proposed adopting the <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin</b> as a mascot. The first statue of Testudo cast in bronze was donated by the Class of 1933 and displayed on Baltimore Avenue in front of Ritchie Coliseum. However, the 300-pound sculpture was subjected to vandalism by visiting college athletic teams. One such incident occurred in 1947 when students from Johns Hopkins University stole the bronze statue and moved it to their campus. Maryland students traveled to Baltimore to retrieve it, laying siege to the house where it was hidden. Over 200 city police responded to quell the riot. In 1949, University President Byrd was awakened by {{a phone call from}} a University of Virginia fraternity requesting that Testudo be removed from their lawn. Testudo was later filled with 700 pounds of cement and fastened to his pedestal to prevent future removals, but students at rival schools continued to vandalize it. It was moved to Maryland Stadium in 1951. In the 1960s, Testudo was moved back to a spot in front of McKeldin Library.|$|E

25|$|Turtle {{farming in}} the United States {{started in the}} early 1900s, with farms in Maryland and North Carolina raising <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins,</b> which are {{considered}} a delicacy in those parts. However, by the late 20th century, few turtles were raised for food in the United States, and American restaurants mostly relied on wild-caught turtles. Still, in 2012, red-ear sliders raised in Oklahoma were reported to be sold in Virginia and Maryland's Asian supermarkets.|$|R
5000|$|The major {{threats to}} <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins</b> are all {{associated}} with humans and probably differ {{in different parts}} of their range. People tend to build their cities on ocean coasts near the mouths of large rivers and in doing so they have destroyed many of the huge marshes terrapins inhabited. [...] Nationwide, probably >75% of the salt marshes where terrapins lived have been destroyed or altered. Currently, ocean level rise threatens the remainder.|$|R

50|$|The Turtle Conservancy is a proud {{partner of}} the Terrapin Nesting Project on Long Beach Island, New Jersey. The Terrapin Nesting Project is a {{grassroots}} organization founded by Kathy Lacey in 2011 with the ongoing support of the Sierra Club. The aim is to restore terrapin populations on Long Beach Island by protecting nests and releasing hatchlings back into the bay. Northern <b>Diamondback</b> <b>Terrapins</b> (Malaclemys terrapin terrapin) are native to the East coast of the United States {{and over the past}} two centuries have seen their numbers dwindle precipitously. Through the grassroots effort of Lacey and her team of volunteers, terrapin numbers are on the rise. In 2016 alone, over 2,000 hatchling terrapins were released back into the wild.|$|R
5000|$|Traps used {{to catch}} crabs both commercially and privately have {{commonly}} caught and drowned many <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins,</b> which {{can result in}} male-biased populations and local population declines and even extinctions. [...] When these traps are lost or abandoned (“ghost traps”), they can kill terrapins for many years. Terrapin-excluding devices are available to retrofit crab traps; these {{reduce the number of}} terrapins captured while having little or no impact on crab capture rates.

5000|$|According to the FAA National Wildlife Strike Database, a {{total of}} 18 strikes between <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins</b> and civil {{aircraft}} were reported in the US from 1990 to 2007, none of which caused damage to the aircraft. On July 8, 2009, flights at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City were delayed for up to {{one and a half}} hours as 78 <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins</b> had invaded one of the runways. The turtles, which according to airport authorities were believed to have entered the runway in order to nest, were removed and released back into the wild. A similar incident happened on June 29, 2011, when over 150 turtles crossed runway four, closing the runway and disrupting air traffic. Those terrapins were also relocated safely. [...] The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey installed a turtle barrier along runway 4L at JFK {{to reduce the number of}} terrapins on the runway and encourage them to nest elsewhere. [...] Nevertheless, on June 26, 2014, 86 terrapins made it onto the same runway, as a high tide carried them over the barrier. Their population is controlled by the raccoon population; it has been shown that as the raccoons decrease in number, mating terrapins increase, leading to increased turtle activity at the airport.|$|R

500|$|When {{the school}} {{was known as the}} Maryland Agricultural College, from 1856 to 1916, the media called the {{athletics}} teams the [...] "Farmers" [...] and the [...] "Aggies". As the University of Maryland, the teams became known as [...] "The Old Liners" [...] in reference to the state nickname. During the 1923 season, The New York Times referred to Maryland as the Orioles, after a bird species endemic to the region that was already the namesake for several baseball teams. In 1932, Curley Byrd suggested that the namesake become the <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin</b> (Malaclemys terrapin), a species of land-dwelling turtle common throughout the state, particularly the Chesapeake Bay area where Dr. Byrd spent his early life. The student newspaper had already been named The Diamondback since 1921, and the athletics teams were sometimes referred to as the [...] "Terrapins" [...] as early as 1928. Newspapers began referring to the team simply as the [...] "Terps" [...] to shorten headlines. The truncated name stuck and is now in official use by the school.|$|E
500|$|The mascot is a <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapin</b> named Testudo, {{which means}} [...] "turtle" [...] in Latin. It {{is also the}} name of an ancient Roman {{military}} tactic, in which soldiers protected their infantry square from projectiles by completely enclosing it with their shields. Derivations of the word have also been used in scientific nomenclature related to the reptile, such as the order Testudine and the family Testudinidae. In 1933, the graduating class raised funds for a 300-pound bronze replica of a terrapin. It was initially placed in front of Ritchie Coliseum, which was then the home arena of the basketball team. In 1951, after being the subject of numerous pranks, the statue was relocated to Maryland Stadium, reinforced with 700pounds of concrete, and anchored with steel rods. It was moved again in the 1960s, in front of McKeldin Library, and a second replica was placed at Maryland Stadium in 1992. In the 2000s, under coach Ralph Friedgen, it was a pregame tradition for the football players to walk 200yards, through what is known as [...] "Terp Alley", to the locker rooms, and touch the bronze Testudo.|$|E
40|$|<b>Diamondback</b> <b>terrapins</b> (Malaclemys terrapin) {{are native}} to the remote oceanic islands of Bermuda and {{presently}} inhabit only four small brackish water ponds on a private golf course. The life history of this species is poorly understood on Bermuda and so {{the aim of this}} study was to fill these knowledge gaps, to compare the results with what is known from other areas in the North American range, and to inform the development of a local management plan. The results of a mark-recapture census revealed that ca. 100 individuals ≥ 81 mm straight carapace length live on Bermuda, of which nearly half (48. 5 %) were considered sexually mature. The population is dominated by females (sex ratio 2. 9 : 1) and annual recruitment over the three year period was found to be extremely low (approximately two <b>terrapins).</b> Female <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins</b> in Bermuda nest almost exclusively within a limited number of sand bunkers on the golf course. Nesting commenced in late March or early April and ended in late August. Peak oviposition was observed in May and June. Clutch size averaged 5. 1 eggs (range 0 - 10; SD 2. 4) and the incubation period averaged 61. 8 days (range 49 - 83; SD 10. 5). Delayed emergence was documented, with 43. 8 % of the hatchlings remaining in their natal nests over the winter months. The mean annual hatching success rate was determined to be 19 % (range 17. 6 - 21; SD 1. 9). Radio-telemetry was used to investigate the movements and survivorship of postemergent hatchling <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins.</b> The results indicated that mangrove swamps and grass-dominated marshes adjacent to the ponds are important developmental habitats for hatchlings. Yellow-crowned night herons (Nyctanassa violacea) were found to be significant predators of small terrapins during spring emergence. Small aquatic gastropods comprised 66. 7 % of the faecal samples analysed from the Bermudian population. Scavenged fish and vertebrate animal remains, terrestrial arthropods, polychaete worms and bivalves were consumed in lesser amounts. Sediment from the pond environment was found in 74 % of the faecal samples analysed and is believed to have been incidentally ingested while foraging for the small benthic gastropods. Eco-toxicological analyses of the pond sediment, prey and terrapin eggs showed that the Bermudian <b>diamondback</b> <b>terrapins</b> live and feed in wetland habitats characterised by chronic, multifactorial contamination; principally total petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a variety of heavy metals. This study found that some of those contaminants are accumulating in the gastropod prey as well as being transferred to terrapin eggs. This may be reducing the incidence of successful embryonic development for this species in Bermuda and may likely contribute to the observed low hatching rates. These collective findings indicate that the Bermudian population is very vulnerable to local extirpation...|$|R
