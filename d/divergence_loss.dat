The experimental work is carried out in a controlled laboratory environment where fog could be generated {{and its impact on}} the FSO link investigated. The experimental data obtained is compared to the theoretical prevision. The paper also presents how the data transmission performance depends on the exact position of the fog source within the chamber. The beam <b>divergence</b> <b>loss</b> is analyzed and optical solutions are shown. Moreover, the improvement of the beam spot size through applying a combination of concave and convex mirrors which consequently improve the link performance is also studied...|$|E
40|$|This paper details a {{numerical}} investigation of performance losses in low-thrust solar thermal rocket nozzles. The effects of nozzle geometry on {{three types of}} losses were studied; finite rate dissociation-recombination kinetic losses, two dimensional axisymmetric <b>divergence</b> <b>losses,</b> and compressible viscous boundary layer losses. Short nozzle lengths and supersonic flow produce short residence times in the nozzle and a nearly frozen flow, resulting in large kinetic losses. Variations in geometry have a minimal effect on kinetic <b>losses.</b> <b>Divergence</b> <b>losses</b> are relatively small, and careful shaping of the nozzle can nearly eliminate them. The boundary layer in these small nozzles can grow to a major fraction of nozzle radius, and cause large losses. These losses are attributed to viscous drag on the nozzle walls and flow blockage by the boundary layer, especially in the throat region. Careful shaping of the nozzle can produce {{a significant reduction in}} viscous losses...|$|R

An analogous class of predictive densities is defined and any member of this class is shown to dominate the predictive density corresponding to a uniform prior in three or higher dimensions. For the prediction problem, in the special case of Kullback–Leibler loss, our results complement {{to a certain extent}} some of the recent important work of Komaki [F.

40|$|Through {{employing}} {{an external}} mirror that is tilted by an angle beta = lambda/ 2 d {{in the external}} cavity, whose round-trip cavity length is one-half a Talbot distance, a laser diode array (LDA) is made to oscillate with only an in-phase supermode. This makes the far-field distribution of the LDA have a central-single-lobe far-field pattern, and it also makes the output from the LDA be nearly diffraction limited. However, if the phase-locked output energy from the LDA is extremely high, then the thermal radiation from the output deforms the external mirror stochastically. This makes the tilt angle (beta) mismatched to the in-phase supermode, which results in undesirable supermode oscillations; so the far-field distribution of the LDA {{is no longer a}} central-single-lobe far-field pattern. Naturally, the intensity of the output from the LDA is attenuated, and the <b>divergence</b> <b>loss</b> is worsened. Therefore, suitable measures must be taken to guarantee the quality of the phase-locked output from the LDA. Accordingly, after analysis of the deformation of the external mirror, a novel one-spot and multispot processing (OMP) technology is developed. With special sensors, deformation of the external mirror is ascertained as a function of time. Then the deformation is compensated by appropriate equipment, which counteracts any bad influence on the angle beta. The experiment significantly demonstrates that only the in-phase supermode oscillated in an extremely high-energy LDA after the implementation of OMP, allowing such lasers to satisfy the requirements of high-quality laser applications.

40|$|Because of its {{importance}} as a pollinator {{and its potential}} economic usefulness for the biodegradation of organic animal waste, the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the drone fly, Eristalis tenax L. (Diptera: Syrphidae), was studied in both wild and captive populations from southeastern Europe. Wild specimens from a natural protected habitat (with low human impact), field crop habitat (semisynanthropic condition), and intensive pig farming habitat (synanthropic condition) were compared with a laboratory colony reared on artificial media. An integrative approach was applied based on allozyme loci, cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial DNA, wing traits (size and shape), and abdominal color patterns. Our {{results indicate that the}} fourth and eighth generations of the laboratory colony show a severe lack of genetic diversity compared with natural populations. Reduced genetic diversity in subsequent generations (F 4 and F 8) of the laboratory colony was found to be linked with phenotypic <b>divergence.</b> <b>Loss</b> of genetic variability associated with phenotypic differentiation in laboratory samples suggests a founder effect, followed by stochastic genetic processes and inbreeding.

40|$|The {{maximization}} of {{the likelihood}} {{and that of the}} Shannon entropy are the most famous principles in statistical inference. This paper reveals notable duality of these two important notions in the Bayesian prediction problems. We shed light on this duality through the dual Kullback-Leibler <b>divergence</b> <b>losses.</b> Under the e-divergence loss we find the following: 1) the minimization of the Bayesian risk is equivalent to the maximization of the Shannon entropy under a constraint, and 2) the maximization {{of the likelihood}} guarantees the minimum prediction {{in the sense that it}} derives the worst member of a class of nice predictors. An equality implying the balance of the log-likelihood ratio and the e-divergence plays an important role, which we call a saddlepoint equality.

40|$|Aluminum {{combined}} with oxygen {{has been proposed}} as a potential lunar in situ propellant for ascent/descent and return missions for future lunar exploration. Engine concepts proposed to use this propellant have not previously been demonstrated, and the impact on performance from combustion and two-phase flow losses could only be estimated. Therefore, combustion tests were performed for aluminum and aluminum/magnesium alloy powders with oxygen in subscale heat-sink rocket engine hardware. The metal powder was pneumatically injected, {{with a small amount}} of nitrogen, through the center orifice of a single element O-F-O triplet injector. Gaseous oxygen impinged on the fuel stream. Hot-fire tests of aluminum/oxygen were performed over a mixture ratio range of 0. 5 to 3. 0, and at a chamber pressure of approximately 480 kPa (70 psia). The theoretical performance of the propellants was analyzed over a mixture ratio range of 0. 5 to 5. 0. In the theoretical predictions the ideal one-dimensional equilibrium rocket performance was reduced by loss mechanisms including finite rate kinetics, two-dimensional <b>divergence</b> <b>losses,</b> and boundary layer losses. Lower than predicted characteristic velocity and specific impulse performance efficiencies were achieved in the hot-fire tests, and this was attributed to poor mixing of the propellants and two-phase flow effects.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{recharge well}} at the Water Resources Research Center Field Laboratory, University of Arizona, {{was used to compare}} the head losses for discharging conditions with the head losses during recharging conditions. For discharging conditions the formation loss coefficient, B, increased from an initial value of 14. 0 sec/ft^ 2 to an almost constant value of 16. 4 sec/ft^ 2 after 200 minutes of pumping. The initial value o B 1 or recharging conditions was 16. 8 sec/ft^ 2, increasing to a maximum of 18. 3 sec/ft^ 2 after 90 minutes of recharge. After 90 minutes 13 began to decrease, reaching a value of 16. 4 sec/ft^ 2 after 200 minutes of recharge. The decline in the rate of growth of B during pumping and the decrease in the value of B during recharge probably reflected a decrease in the convergence and the <b>divergence</b> <b>losses,</b> respectively, as the cone of influence and the groundwater mound increased to a size such that the aquifer began to act more homogeneously. The well loss coefficient, C, had an average value of 6. 9 for discharging conditions. The initial value of C during recharge was 1. 4 which increased to a value of 4. 8 after 200 minutes. It is speculated that the increase was caused by plugging of the aquifer by entrained air and fine suspended particles in the recharge water.

In addition, many loci produce multiple alternatively spliced transcripts encoding proteins that may serve separate and perhaps even opposing regulatory roles because of the modular motif structure of KRAB-ZNF genes. The tissue-specific expression patterns and rapid structural divergence of ZNF 91 subfamily genes suggest a role in determining gene expression differences between species and the evolution of novel primate traits...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Komaki studied the second-order {{asymptotic}} properties of predictive distributions, using the Kullback-Leibler <b>divergence</b> as a <b>loss</b> function. He showed that estimative distributions with asymptotically efficient estimators {{can be improved}} by predictive distributions that {{do not belong to}} the model. The model is assumed to be a multidimensional curved exponential family. In this paper we generalize the result assuming as a loss function any f divergence. A relationship arises between alpha connections and optimal predictive distributions. In particular, using an alpha divergence to measure the goodness of a predictive distribution, the optimal shift of the estimate distribution is related to alpha-covariant derivatives. The expression that we obtain for the asymptotic risk is also useful to study the higher-order asymptotic properties of an estimator, in the mentioned class of loss functions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSkn 7 is a conserved fungal {{heat shock}} factor-type {{transcriptional}} regulator. It participates in maintaining cell wall integrity and regulates the osmotic/oxidative stress response (OSR) in S. cerevisiae, {{where it is}} part of a two-component signal transduction system. Here, we comprehensively address the function of Skn 7 in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. We provide evidence reinforcing functional <b>divergence,</b> with <b>loss</b> of the cell wall/osmotic stress-protective roles and acquisition of the ability to regulate morphogenesis on solid medium. Mapping of the Skn 7 transcriptional circuitry, through combination of genome-wide expression and location technologies, pointed to a dual regulatory role encompassing OSR and filamentous growth. Genetic interaction analyses revealed close functional interactions between Skn 7 and master regulators of morphogenesis, including Efg 1, Cph 1 and Ume 6. Intracellular biochemical assays revealed that Skn 7 is crucial for limiting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in filament-inducing conditions on solid medium. Interestingly, functional domain mapping using site-directed mutagenesis allowed decoupling of Skn 7 function in morphogenesis from protection against intracellular ROS. Our work identifies Skn 7 as an integral part of the transcriptional circuitry controlling C. albicans filamentous growth and illuminates how C. albicans relies on an evolutionarily-conserved regulator to protect itself from intracellular ROS during morphological development.
