No mRNA from pdc and no PDC activity were detected in uninduced cell extracts, indicating that the expression is transcriptionally regulated by p-coumaric acid, which corresponds to an activation factor up to 6, 000.

Sequencing 3, 453 bp from overlapping fragments revealed two open reading frames that were 1, 623 and 942 nucleotides long and were followed by a putative terminator structure. The first deduced protein (molecular weight, 59, 118) is very similar (level of similarity, 66 %) to the malolactic enzyme of Lactococcus lactis; as in several malic enzymes, highly conserved protein regions are present. The synthesis of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa was highlighted {{by the results of}} labelling experiments performed with Escherichia coli minicells. The gene was expressed in E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and conferred "malolactic activity" to these species. The second open reading frame encodes a putative 34, 190 -Da protein which has the characteristics of a carrier protein and may have 10 membrane-spanning segments organized around a central hydrophilic core. Energy-dependent L-[14 C]malate transport was observed with E. coli dicarboxylic acid transport-deficient mutants carrying the malate permease-expressing vector.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} the BLAST software on the UPMEM architecture. BLAST is a well-known molecular biology software to rapidly scan DNA or protein <b>genomic</b> <b>banks.</b> It is daily used by thousands of biologists. Given a query sequence, BLAST reports all the sequences of the bank where similarities are found. The result is a list of alignments that detail the similarities. UPMEM’s Processing-In-Memory (PIM) solution consist of adding processing units into the DRAM, to minimize data access time and maximize bandwidth, in order to drastically accelerate data-consuming algorithms. A 16 GBytes UPMEM-DIMM module comes then with 256 UPMEM DRAM Processing Units (named DPU). To find similarities, BLAST proceeds in 3 steps: (1) search of common words between the query sequence and the bank sequences; (2) evaluation of local similarity on the neighbourhood of these words; and (3) computation of the final alignment. As the 2 first steps are limited by memory bandwidth, and represent the majority of time of the overall computation, they have been massively parallelized on UPMEM DPUs. The 3 rd step is performed on the host processor and is overlapped with the UPMEM processing. Experimentation on real datasets shows a speed-up of 25 when using UPMEM configuration, versus a standard server running 20 Intel cores...|$|R

For molecular biologists, this mass of data is potentially {{a rich source of}} knowledge with appropriated n-silico processes. From a computational point of view, the data to manipulate are basically text sequences (protein or DNA), and the main task consist in computing similarities. This falls into the string processing computation family which has been studied for a long time, and where numerous parallel architectures have been proposed. FPGA are well suited for implementing these regular structures and dedicated reconfigurable accelerators have naturally been designed to speed-up the main bioinformatic programs.

One, represented by pLASC 3, can complement some mutants, whereas the other, represented by a single plasmid, pLAHH 2, can complement all of the other mutants. Restriction mapping showed that the two recombinant plasmids shared an EcoRI fragment of 8. 9 kb.

An Escherichia coli strain, auxotrophic for guanine and unable to use deoxyguanosine as source of guanine, was constructed to clone the corresponding genes. By screening a <b>genomic</b> <b>bank</b> {{for the production of}} guanine, the L. helveticus ptd and ntd genes coding for DRTase I and II, respectively, were isolated. Although the two genes have no sequence similarity, the two deduced polypeptides display 25. 6 % identity, with most of the residues involved in substrate binding and the active site nucleophile Glu- 98 being conserved. Overexpression and purification of the two proteins shows that DRTase I is specific for purines with a preference for deoxyinosine (dI) > deoxyadenosine > deoxyguanosine as donor substrates whereas DRTase II has a strong preference for pyrimidines as donor substrates and purines as base acceptors. Purine analogues were substrates as acceptor bases for both enzymes.

This gene encodes a 15. 5 -kDa protein that specifically represses the virC and virD operons in the virulence region of the Ti plasmid. The ros gene was cloned from a <b>genomic</b> <b>bank</b> by electroporation and complementation in Agrobacterium cells. Reporter fusion to the ros gene indicates that the level of transcription is controlled in part by autoregulation. A consensus inverted repeat sequence present in the ros promoter and in the virC and virD promoters of pTiC 58, pTiA 6, and pRiA 4 b suggests that a specific Ros binding site exists in these promoters. In the virC and virD promoter region, this binding site is within a cluster of vir box consensus sequences in which the VirG protein binds. This suggests possible binding competition between Ros and VirG at the virC and virD promoters. That the Ros protein binds DNA is suggested by the presence of a 'zinc finger ' consensus sequence in the protein. The virulence (vir) regulon of the Agrobacterium tume-faciens Ti plasmid contains six operons (29, 44, 53).

Single-nucleotide polymorphism accumulation analysis correlated river flow direction with the spread of PSC- 2. We found at least 2 sources of cholera in Pakistan during the 2010 epidemic and illustrate {{the value of a}} global <b>genomic</b> data <b>bank</b> in contextualizing cholera outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Suppression of {{nonsense}} codons in Schizosaccharomyces pombe by sup 3 -e tRNASerUGA or sup 3 -i tRNASerUAA is reduced or abolished by mutations within the suppressor locus. Twenty-five suppressor-inactive sup 3 -e genes and thirteen mutant sup 3 -i genes were isolated from S. pombe <b>genomic</b> clone <b>banks</b> by colony hybridization. Sequence {{analysis of these}} revertant alleles corroborates genetic evidence for mutational hotspots within the sup 3 tRNA gene. Fifteen types of point mutations or insertions were found. Many of these replace bases which are highly or completely conserved in eucaryotic tRNA genes. Transcription of the altered sup 3 genes in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae extract enabled the identification of mutations which affect the rate of 5 '-end maturation or splicing of the tRNA precursors or both. A total of seven mutations were found which alter transcriptional efficiencies. Of these, five are located outside the internal transcription control regions...|$|R
