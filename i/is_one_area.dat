5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E

25|$|Biologists {{and other}} {{research}} scientists constantly monitor the welfare, living conditions, {{and health of}} reindeer, {{as well as the}} ecological health of their habitat, and they make recommendations and set quotas designed to ensure that game resources and natural biodiversity are protected, managed, and maintained. Many factors, some of them difficult to measure or predict, are analyzed including natural cycles, parasites, disease, short-term weather conditions (relative harshness of winter or summer), long-term climate changes, and condition of food sources. Hunting is not the only factor affecting reindeer welfare, but it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> that can be managed to some degree.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} all {{contemporary}} Formula One designs, the FW30's basic architecture {{is built around}} a carbon fibre, aramid and honeycomb composite material monocoque. The design carries over the FW29's zero keel, double wishbone suspension arrangement, along with the twin-pillar rear wing. The FW30's front wing <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> in which {{the design of the}} FW29 was not followed. In place of the older car's two-element wing a three-element design was introduced, similar to that used on the 2007 McLaren MP4-22. As with the McLaren design the Williams wing's upper element features a central section that is raised up and passes over the tip of the car's, slightly lower, nose cone. However, unlike the McLaren, the FW30's front wing is suspended from the nose cone using the forward element.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "brownfield" [...] {{industrial}} {{area of the}} Port Lands, {{on the east side}} of the harbour, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> planned for redevelopment. Formerly a marsh that was filled in to create industrial space, it was never intensely developed, its land unsuitable for large-scale development, because of flooding and unstable soil. It still contains numerous industrial uses, such as the Portlands Energy Centre power plant, some port facilities, some movie and TV production studios, a concrete processing facility and various low-density industrial facilities. The Waterfront Toronto agency has developed plans for a naturalized mouth to the Don River and to create a flood barrier around the Don, making more of the land on the harbour suitable for higher-value residential and commercial development. A former chemicals plant site along the Don River is slated to become a large commercial complex and transportation hub.|$|E

2500|$|The B-DR {{component}} shows {{a similar}} distribution, but lacks adequate testing {{to the south}} to resolve its most southern extent. DR3-DQ2 is very common in West and North Africa. And B18 is also elevated in N. Africa and Middle East, with peak levels in Italy. However B18 found in the Middle East is linked to B18-DR11 (DR11 is very common in the Eastern Mediterranean). The level of B18-DR3 peaks in Sardinia but is also very high in the Basque region of Northern Spain. This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> of Europe where the B18-DR3 level is relatively different from Cw5-B18, as it appears there was a rare recombination event {{in the evolution of}} Cw5-B18-DR3 that lead to the replacement of Cw*0501 with Cw*1201. This might have occurred in northwest Iberia. Sardinia lacks this recombinant. Levels of B18-DR3 in Europe appear to be combinations of the Cw*0501 and Cw*1201 haplotype. For instance, Albania has significant levels of B18-DR3 but lacks Cw5-B18 in significant quantities. In the Dutch and German populations B-DR haplotypes have undergone more intense studies allowing the detection of haplotypes to very low frequencies (0.25% in the Dutch and 0.05% in the Germans) consequently the edge of B18-DR3 haplotype in Europe is evident. Areas where typing lacks resolution are Austria, Slovakia, Czech republic, etc. The levels detectable in these regions may be higher, similar to levels detected in Switzerland during early studies.(See Table-left and Map-left) ...|$|E
