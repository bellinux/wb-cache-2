40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the emergence of}} <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> in China after 1978 -reform. It argues that the emergence of <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> in China after 1978 is inherent in two salient features of Chinese economic reform, namely, decentralization and gradualism. The low capital mobility between different market segments is largely attributable to the distortions in the financial system generated by the initiatives of local governments. Using provincial loans and deposits data, this paper found that the mobility of financial capital has been actually low across Chinese provinces in the reform period. In addition, <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> as assessed by provincial loan-deposit correlation is a new phenomenon emerged since the mid- 1980 s. Also, the loan-deposit correlation has been significantly influenced by the local fiscal policies {{and the size of}} state-owned sector. ...|$|E

40|$|Center for Business and Corporate Law (CBC) Working Paper Series 001 / 2017 European Banking Institute Working Paper Series 2017 - No. 11 University of Luxembourg Law Working Paper No. 006 / 2017 Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, {{financial}} innovation {{was viewed}} very positively, {{resulting in a}} laissez-faire, deregulatory approach to financial regulation. Since the Crisis the regulatory pendulum has swung to the other extreme. Post-Crisis regulation, plus rapid technological change, have spurred the development of financial technology companies (FinTechs). FinTechs and data-driven financial services providers profoundly challenge the current regulatory paradigm. Financial regulators are increasingly seeking to balance the traditional regulatory objectives of financial stability and consumer protection with promoting growth and innovation. The resulting regulatory innovations include technology (RegTech), regulatory sandboxes and special charters. This paper analyses possible new regulatory approaches, ranging from doing nothing (which spans being permissive to highly restrictive, depending on context), cautious permissiveness (on a case-by-case basis, or through special charters), structured experimentalism (such as sandboxes or piloting), and development of specific new regulatory frameworks. Building on this framework, we argue for a new regulatory approach, which incorporates these rebalanced objectives, and which we term ‘smart regulation’. Our new automated and proportionate regime builds on shared principles {{from a range of}} jurisdictions and supports innovation in <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> The <b>fragmentation</b> of <b>market</b> participants and the increased use of technology requires regulators to adopt a sequential reform process, starting with digitization, before building digitally-smart regulation.

40|$|Financial {{markets in}} less {{developed}} countries suffer from financial dualism, {{a situation in which}} a large informal sector coexists alongside a formal one. Contemporary financial market theories are not able to incorporate an understanding of the informal sector and are, therefore, only applicable to the formal system which is unsatisfying. With over 80 percent of the worlds population relying on informal financial arrangement (World Bank 2001), financial informality is not just a small exception. The intention of this dissertation is to show that financial market theories can never be applicable without considering OIE mechanisms. The reasoning is not only limited to informal/formal institutions in {{less developed countries}}, but also to developed countries. While politicians often argue that <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> in less developed countries is caused by inefficient formal institutions, fragmentation in developed countries is caused by too efficient formal institutions. In this sense, the relevance of a financial market theory solely focusing on efficiency becomes questionable. The intention is to show that NIEOIE is not only a theoretical experiment, rather it builds the theoretical foundation for future financial market theories...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades most stock and {{derivatives}} exchanges in the world transitioned to electronic trading in limit order books, creating a need for a new set of quantitative models to describe these order-driven markets. This dissertation offers a collection of models that provide insight into the structure of modern financial markets, and can help to optimize trading decisions in practical applications. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we study the dynamics of prices, order flows and liquidity in limit order markets over short timescales. We propose a stylized order book model that predicts a particularly simple linear relation between price changes and order flow imbalance, defined as a difference between net changes in supply and demand. The slope in this linear relation, called a price impact coefficient, is inversely proportional in our model to market depth - a measure of liquidity. Our empirical results confirm both of these predictions. The linear relation between order flow imbalance and price changes holds for time intervals between 50 milliseconds and 5 minutes. The inverse relation between the price impact coefficient and market depth holds on longer timescales. These findings shed a new light on intraday variations in market volatility. According to our model volatility fluctuates due to changes in market depth or in order flow variance. Previous studies also found a positive correlation between volatility and trading volume, but in order-driven markets prices are determined by the limit order book activity, so the association between trading volume and volatility is unclear. We show how a spurious correlation between these variables can indeed emerge in our linear model due to time aggregation of high-frequency data. Finally, we observe short-term positive autocorrelation in order flow imbalance and discuss an application of this variable as a measure of adverse selection in limit order executions. Our results suggest that monitoring recent order flow can improve the quality of order executions in practice. In the second part of the thesis we study the problem of optimal order placement in a fragmented limit order market. To execute a trade, market participants can submit limit orders or market orders across various exchanges where a stock is traded. In practice these decisions are influenced by sizes of order queues and by statistical properties of order flows in each limit order book, and also by rebates that exchanges pay for limit order submissions. We present a realistic model of limit order executions and formalize the search for an optimal order placement policy as a convex optimization problem. Based on this formulation we study how various factors determine investor's order placement decisions. In a case when a single exchange is used for order execution, we derive an explicit formula for the optimal limit and market order quantities. Our solution shows that the optimal split between market and limit orders largely depends on one's tolerance to execution risk. Market orders help to alleviate this risk because they execute with certainty. Correspondingly, we find that an optimal order allocation shifts to these more expensive orders when the execution risk is of primary concern, for example when the intended trade quantity is large or when it is costly to catch up on the quantity after limit order execution fails. We also characterize the optimal solution in the general case of simultaneous order placement on multiple exchanges, and show that it sets execution shortfall probabilities to specific threshold values computed with model parameters. Finally, we propose a non-parametric stochastic algorithm that computes an optimal solution by resampling historical data and does not require specifying order flow distributions. A numerical implementation of this algorithm is used to study the sensitivity of an optimal solution to changes in model parameters. Our numerical results show that order placement optimization can bring a substantial reduction in trading costs, especially for small orders and in cases when order flows are relatively uncorrelated across trading venues. The order placement optimization framework developed in this thesis can also be used to quantify the costs and benefits of <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> from the point of view of an individual investor. For instance, we find that a positive correlation between order flows, which is empirically observed in a fragmented U. S. equity market, increases the costs of trading. As the correlation increases it may become more expensive to trade in a fragmented market than it is in a consolidated market. In the third part of the thesis we analyze the dynamics of limit order queues at the best bid or ask of an exchange. These queues consist of orders submitted by a variety of market participants, yet existing order book models commonly assume that all orders have similar dynamics. In practice, some orders are submitted by trade execution algorithms in an attempt to buy or sell a certain quantity of assets under time constraints, and these orders are canceled if their realized waiting time exceeds a patience threshold. In contrast, high-frequency traders submit and cancel orders depending on the order book state and their orders are not driven by patience. The interaction between these two order types within a single FIFO queue leads bursts of order cancelations for small queues and anomalously long waiting times in large queues. We analyze a fluid model that describes the evolution of large order queues in liquid markets, taking into account the heterogeneity between order submission and cancelation strategies of different traders. Our results show that after a finite initial time interval, the queue reaches a specific structure where all orders from high-frequency traders stay in the queue until execution but most orders from execution algorithms exceed their patience thresholds and are canceled. This "order crowding" effect has been previously noted by participants in highly liquid stock and futures markets and was attributed to a large participation of high-frequency traders. In our model, their presence creates an additional workload, which increases queue waiting times for new orders. Our analysis of the fluid model leads to waiting time estimates that take into account the distribution of order types in a queue. These estimates are tested against a large dataset of realized limit order waiting times collected by a U. S. equity brokerage firm. The queue composition at a moment of order submission noticeably affects its waiting time and we find that assuming a single order type for all orders in the queue leads to unrealistic results. Estimates that assume instead a mix of heterogeneous orders in the queue are closer to empirical data. Our model for a limit order queue with heterogeneous order types also appears to be interesting from a methodological point of view. It introduces a new type of behavior in a queueing system where one class of jobs has state-dependent dynamics, while others are driven by patience. Although this model is motivated by the analysis of limit order books, it may find applications in studying other service systems with state-dependent abandonments...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of latency {{arbitrage}} on allocative efficiency and liquidity in fragmented <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> We propose a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with aggregate information available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur profits from <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> by reaping the surplus when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. We develop a discrete-event simulation system to capture this processing and information transfer delay, and using an agent-based approach, we simulate the interactions between high-frequency and zero-intelligence trading agents at the millisecond level. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity arising from the simulated order streams, and we find that <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> {{and the presence of}} a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{function of}} <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> is to channel funds within an economy. To efficiently do so, <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> need to generate asset prices that consistently incorporate all available information and reflect all non-diversifiable dimensions of risk. While perhaps elegant, perfect market functionality and efficiency can nonetheless {{be seen as}} an unattainable ideal. <b>Financial</b> <b>market</b> imperfections, such as those generated by asymmetric information or transactions costs, can easily distort the underlying <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> mechanisms. The research questions that are addressed in this thesis are all related to phenomena that have been associated with, or explained by, <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> frictions or imperfections. This thesis consists of four separate essays that examine questions that would be irrelevant in a perfect market – that is, in a world with no predictability of returns, informational advantages or institutional weaknesses. At least, they would be irrelevant when considering the perfect market setting as described by financial economists up until the mid- 1980 s. While the guiding principles may have been somewhat updated, it is nonetheless important to stress that recent findings do not necessarily conflict with the view that markets are reasonably efficient or driven by rational market forces. The first essay of this thesis examines the under-diversification of investors and its sources using data from the Finnish Central Securities Depository (FCSD) legal liability accounts. That is, is under-diversification rational and driven by informational advantages, or the result of the behavioral biases of investors? The former source relies on market inefficiency to justify its existence whereas the latter is an imperfection in itself. In the second essay, I examine the impact of <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> on private investors using the same data source. It examines whether market functionality deteriorated for private investors {{as a result of a}} regulatory change (MiFID I) that enabled <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> on a large scale, but did not guarantee equal access to all market venues across all investor types. In the third essay, we explore and document a novel and robust connection between firm-level asset changes and return momentum using US stock data. The momentum anomaly is one of the most robust documented return anomalies and is recognized as one of the biggest challenges to asset pricing research. While the existing theoretical literatures on risk-based or behavioral models do not offer a clear explanation to our empirical results, recent real options models appear to hold the most promise. In the last paper, we explore the relation between ownership structures and capital structures in Russia. This is a market plagued by severe institutional imperfections and inefficiencies...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a theoretical framework and a literature review of M&As in financial sector. It then carries out a case study on a potential merger between the UAE Stock Exchanges and a discussion on the implications for the actors involved. Findings – The contraction both in market capitalization and in trading value in the three UAE Stock Exchanges caused by subprime <b>financial</b> crisis and <b>market</b> <b>fragmentation</b> could be a key factors in implementing a merger between them. Because of high-fixed costs and trading platform, a single consolidated stock exchange may benefit from significant economies of scale, particularly network effects, and economies of scope.
