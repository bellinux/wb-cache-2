40|$|For space applications, {{solar cells}} should be {{optimized}} for highest power density {{rather than for}} highest efficiency. In this context, relatively low efficiency thin-film solar cell may well surpass multi-junction III-V based solar cells {{if they can be}} made thin enough. In thin-film solar cells the power density is mostly limited by the substrate. The introduction of ultra-thin polymeric substrates is the key for decreasing the cell mass. In this work, a very thin polyimide film LaRCtrade-CP 1 was used as substrate or superstrate for amorphous silicon solar cell fabrication. CP 1 films were either fixed on a <b>glass</b> <b>carrier</b> or spin coated onto a <b>glass</b> <b>carrier</b> coated with a release agent. By depositing amorphous silicon cells on 6 mum thick CP 1 films, a power density of 2. 9 W/g under AM 1. 5 g and of 3. 9 W/g (estimated) under AM 0 illumination spectra was achieved, in substrate (n-i-p) configuration (for a cell area of ca. 0. 25 cm 2). A similar cell deposited in superstate (p-i-n) configuration exhibits a record power density of 3. 2 W/g under AM 1. 5 g and an estimated value of 4. 3 W/g under AM 0 illumination spectra.

This study examined the impact of PX-UV disinfection on an Ebola surrogate virus on <b>glass</b> <b>carriers</b> and PPE material to examine the potential benefits of using PX-UV to decontaminate PPE while worn, thereby reducing the pathogen load prior to doffing. Ultraviolet (UV) safety and coverage tests were also conducted. PX-UV exposure resulted in a significant reduction in viral load on <b>glass</b> <b>carriers</b> and PPE materials. Occupational Safety and Health Administration–defined UV exposure limits were not exceeded during PPE disinfection. Predoffing disinfection with PX-UV has potential as an additive measure to the doffing practice guidelines.

40|$|Glass as {{a carrier}} {{material}} for electrical and optical interconnects has many benefits compared to conventional materials like silicon, ceramic or polymer based laminates {{because of its}} excellent dielectric and transparent properties that are becoming important for electrical high-frequency signal wiring {{as well as for}} optical wave guiding.

A small pitch size of conductor traces, small scale through-vias and high alignment accuracy are the key requirements that will be achieved from <b>glass</b> <b>carrier</b> based packaging. Another outstanding benefit is the transparency of glass that allows the planar integration of optical waveguides inside the glass core material and the light transmission through the carrier between different optical layers.

40|$|There is {{a steady}} trend to ultra-thin microelectronic devices. Especially for future {{particle}} detector systems a reduced readout chip thickness {{is required to}} limit the loss of tracking precision due to scattering. The reduction of silicon thickness is performed at wafer level in a two-step thinning process. To {{minimize the risk of}} wafer breakage the thinned wafer needs to be handled by a carrier during the whole process chain of wafer bumping. Another key process is the flip chip assembly of thinned readout chips onto thin sensor tiles. Besides the prevention of silicon breakage the minimization of chip warpage is one additional task for a high yield and reliable flip chip process. A new technology using <b>glass</b> <b>carrier</b> wafer will be described in detail. The main advantage of this technology is the combination of a carrier support during wafer processing and the chip support during flip chip assembly. For that a glass wafer is glue-bonded onto the backside of the thinned readout chip wafer. After the bump deposition process the glass-readout chip stack is diced in one step. Finally the <b>glass</b> <b>carrier</b> chip is released by laser illumination after flip chip assembly of the readout chip onto sensor tile. The results of the flip chip assembly process development for the ATLAS IBL upgrade are described more in detail. The new ATLAS FEI 4 B chip with a size of 20 × 19 mm 2 is flip chip bonded with a thickness of only 150 m, but the capability of this technology has been demonstrated on hybrid modules with a reduced readout chip thickness of down to 50 m which is a major step for ultra-thin electronic systems...|$|E

The polymer grafting to silica gel (pore diameter 100 A, particle size 5 pm) resulted in 15 - 30 -fold reduction in protein adsorption on the carrier at 35 degrees C. Adsorption isotherms of myoglobin indicate completely different characters of the protein adsorption to silica gel and its polyNIPAM-grafted derivative. Cooling of the grafted carrier containing adsorbed myoglobin to 9 degrees C led to a partial release of the protein to the contacting solution, whereas heating of the system to 35 degrees C resulted in reversible binding of the protein.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using carriers made of recycled glass in anaerobic packed bed reactors {{has been studied}} in laboratory-scale experiments. Two types of carrier were studied: a porous bead of glass foam and an open ring of a smoother, sintered glass. The performance of processes with these carriers was compared with a conventional upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) process. The treatment of wastewater from a pulp and paper mill, and from a pharmaceutical plant was studied. Both carrier types {{were found to be}} suitable for supporting biofilm growth. With the porous beads, however, suspended sludge accumulated between the carriers, which caused clogging of the process. This, together with the low mechanical strength of the material, makes this carrier less suitable for full-scale processes. The sintered rings showed no signs of clogging and had better mechanical qualities and the maximum loading rate for pulp and paper processing wastewater was 10 kg COD m- 3 d- 1. This is similar to processes with commercially available plastic carriers, but with the UASB process, the maximum load with this wastewater was around 20 kg COD m- 3 d- 1, which makes the sintered ring process non-competitive. An anaerobic packed bed process with <b>glass</b> <b>carriers</b> could, however, find applications where the UASB process is not applicable.

For that, single specimens of the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex prepared according to the dry method were measured by TXRF before and after CPA. To determine the efficiency of the removal of organic matrix, the background and signal-to-background relationship of 28 samples were analyzed.

The element concentrations (with exception of Cr, Ni and Pb) after ashing were in the same range or slightly higher than that before ashing. No significant differences between the two treatments were observed for Mn, As, Pb, Se (November), Sr (November), Cr (March) and Pb (March).

The different plasmas were induced at 2. 63 and 4. 21 w/cm^ 3 microwave power densities to have the low temperature distributions below 60 ℃. Certain external factors that may affect the pathogen survival under plasma processing such as the extent of bio-indicator loads {{and the nature of}} bio-indicator carriers was examined. The increase of microwave power density of the plasma treatments caused significant reductions in the pathogen survival, and thereby correlated with the increases in cell injury. Among the pathogens subjected to the plasmas, the gram-positive S. aureus cells were the most resistant and the plasma sensitivity was followed by the gram-negative E [...] coli and S. typhimurium cells. Survival of the E [...] coli cells was lower when the extent of bio-indicator loads was larger, and its survival was affected most strongly on paper followed by propylene and <b>glass</b> bio-indicator <b>carriers...</b>|$|R
