40|$|The Advanced Light Source (ALS) {{storage ring}} sextupole {{is a unique}} {{multi-purpose}} magnet. It is designed to operate as a sextupole with three auxiliary trim modes: horizontal steering, vertical steering, and skew quadrupole. A perturbation theory for iron-dominated magnets developed by Klaus Halbach provides the basis for this <b>design.</b> The three <b>trim</b> excitations are produced by violating sextupole symmetry and are thus perturbations of the normal sextupole excitation. The magnet was designed such that all four modes are decoupled and can be excited independently. This paper discusses the use of Halbach`s perturbation theory to <b>design</b> the <b>trim</b> functions and to evaluate the primary asymmetry in the sextupole mode, namely, {{a gap in the}} return yoke to accommodate the vacuum chamber...|$|R

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} cofficients {{and trim}} angle for an aerobrake at Mach 9. 2 and 11. 8 were found {{using a combination}} of experiment and computation. Free-flight tests were performed at NASA Ames Research Center's Hypervelocity Free-Flight Aerodynamic Facility, and the forebody pressure distribution was calculated using a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code with an effective specific heat ratio. Using the computed drag, lift, and moments to prescribe the number of terms in the aerodynamic coefficient expansions and to specify the values of the higher order terms, the experimental aerodynamic coefficients and trim angle were found using a six-degree-of-freedom, weighted, least-squares analysis. The experimental and computed aerodynamic coefficients and trim angles are in good agreement. The trim angle obtained from the free-flight tests, 14. 7 deg, differs from the <b>design</b> <b>trim</b> angle, 17 deg, and from the Langley wind tunnel results, 12 deg in air and 17 deg in CF 4.

Leeward heating initially decreased, then increased, with increasing angle of attack. Windward heating rates predicted with a computer code that solves the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations were in good agreement with measurements for helium and air.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a method of}} laser {{trimming}} thick film resistors to lower resistance, that is downwards, is suggested. It involves heating of certain regions of the resistor film {{in the form of}} tracks (to a temperature where certain transformation {{in the structure of the}} film takes place, like segregation of the constituents of the resistor material, but not high enough to evaporate the material) by the use of a laser beam of appropriate power density. The heated regions are found to become regions of very high electrical conductivity. It has been found that trimming tracks made perpendicular to the current flow direction are not effective in reducing the resistance. On the other hand, trimming tracks made along the direction of the current flow are found to be effective in decreasing the value of the resistance. It has also been found that the resistance decreases with an increase in length and width of the track. This paper provides data from computer simulations and measurements made on analog resistor networks that enable one to <b>design</b> <b>trimming</b> tracks...|$|R

Through analyzing the relationship of structure and function of trimming dies, the systematic analysis of modularization for trimming dies is achieved from assembly-level division. By using parametric design method, the internal connection between modules is analysis from part-level division, and the module-based design process of complex part is accomplished. The CAD system for trimming dies is developed on platform of UGNX software. The application results show the high efficiency and design flexibility...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{control valves}} often handle flows with very high {{pressure}} drops (conditions {{often referred to}} as severe service). In order to cope with such pressure drops, geometrically complex valve trims with many stages of pressure drops, are designed to prevent undesirable side effects such as cavitation etc. There are many different product designs for control valve trims produced by different manufacturers. One such design uses cylindrical obstructions in the flow field to control the pressure drop. The <b>design</b> of these <b>trims</b> is based on their capacity (Cv) values. With the advent of advanced computational tools, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics based codes, it has become possible to numerically test these trims over a wide range of flow conditions. Hence, this study presents capacity testing and local flow analysis of a complex geometry trim, installed within a commercial control valve for severe service. The results show that the capacity of this particular <b>design</b> of <b>trim</b> decreases as the valve opening position decreases...|$|R
