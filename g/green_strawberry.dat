40|$|Efficacy and mode {{of action}} were {{investigated}} for Aureobasidium pullulans, a potential biocontrol agent for grey mould on strawberry fruit. Wound inoculation of detached <b>green</b> <b>strawberry</b> cv. Elsanta fruit with Aureobasidium pullulans prevented grey mould rot on fruit inoculated 2 days later with Botrytis cinerea. Treatment of white, pink and red-ripe fruit did not, however, control grey mould. Treatment of wound sites on green fruit with both live and heat-killed A. pullulans cells reduced B. cinerea infection compared to controls. Dip-inoculation of unwounded <b>green</b> <b>strawberry</b> fruit with A. pullulans when still attached to the plant delayed the development of grey mould after harvest at the fully ripe stage. The (i) efficacy of A. pullulans on green but not on ripening fruit, (ii) partial inhibitory effect of both live and heat-killed A. pullulans cells and (iii) absence of evidence for antibiotic production from in vitro competition tests suggest that control of grey mould on green fruit is at least partly due to a mechanism other than antagonism and / or competition. Bioassays showed that skin tissue from green fruit treated with A. pullulans had greater antifungal activity than control tissue. Thus, enhanced natural disease resistance in <b>green</b> <b>strawberry</b> fruit contributed to grey mould rot suppression by A. pullulans...|$|E

40|$|A ripe {{strawberry}} looks red to {{our eyes}} in sunlight {{and in the}} green light of a forest, although the spectrum of light reflected from its surface differs dramatically. This is caused by two effects: colour constancy and our ability to learn relative colour cues - the ripe strawberry remains relatively 'redder' than an unripe <b>green</b> <b>strawberry.</b> While colour constancy - the ability to recognize colours in shifted illumination - has been studied in many animals, the use of relative colour cues is investigated more rarely. In a previous study on chickens, we measured how large a shift in illumination their colour constancy mechanisms tolerate without reliable relative colour cues. Here, we show that chickens remain colour constant over larger illumination shifts, if they can use such relative colour cues. As relative colour cues are readily available in natural environments, we suggest that their use contributes strongly to colour constancy performance in nature...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} of conidia and competitive ability of Ulocladium atrum, an antagonist of Botrytis cinerea, were studied in field plots of strawberry in The Netherlands. Single application of conidial suspensions (2 ± 106 conidia ml- 1) of U. atrum were sprayed on the canopy and repeated 14 times, each {{in a different}} plot during the spring, summer or early winter of 1997 and 1998. Leaf samples were taken approximately weekly in the summer crops and monthly in the overwintering crops up to 30 - 120 days after application, to assess total conidial density, conidial viability, and competitive colonization of necrotic leaf tissue by U. atrum in relation to naturally occurring B. cinerea and other necrotrophic fungi. The total density of U. atrum conidia on <b>green</b> <b>strawberry</b> leaves declined exponentially after application by an average relative rate of - 0. 10 /day. Variation {{in the rate of}} decrease between individual sprays was large and partly associated with the average daily precipitation during the first week after application. For pooled data, percentage viability of U. atrum conidia declined linearly at a rate of 1 ýay after application. Colonization of necrotic strawberry leaf tissue by U. atrum increased with total conidial density and, at densities > 1500 conidia cm- 2, leaf colonization by naturally occurring B. cinerea was consistently reduced. With the exponential decline in total conidial density of U. atrum, effective suppression of B. cinerea on strawberry leaves can only be expected when U. atrum is applied less than one week before the leaves become necrotic. Further research needs to focus on enhanced rain-fastness of deposited conidia of U. atrum to reduce spore loss...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{isolation}} of ascorbic acid (AsA) in 1928, few papers {{have been published}} regarding the biosynthesis of AsA in plants, especially in fruits. It took as long as 1998, before Wheeler, Jones and Smirnoff, based on a study with Arabidopsis leaves, proposed what can be considered the main pathway of biosynthesis of AsA, in which L-galactose (L-GAL) is a key precursor. This paper reports the effectiveness of some precursors (cold or radiolabeled) in the biosynthesis of AsA in different plants: green sweet pepper, white-pulp guava, red-pulp guava, papaya and strawberry at two ripening stages (mature green and ripe for papaya and mature green and half red for strawberry) and broccoli. The 'Smirnoff-Wheeler' pathway was functioning and active in all sources studied, {{as demonstrated by the}} increase in AsA contents and incorporation of labeled precursors into AsA. In papaya, the AsA content in the ripe fruit was higher than in the mature green, indicating the synthesis of AsA during ripening. On the other hand, the AsA content in the mature <b>green</b> <b>strawberry</b> was {{similar to that of the}} half red fruits. Our data demonstrate that L-GAL and L-Galactono- 1, 4 -lactone (L-GL) are effective precursors for the biosynthesis of AsA in fruits and also provided additional evidence for the participation of D-mannose (D-MAN) and D-glucose- 1 P in the biosynthesis of AsA in plants. Apesar da importância do ácido ascórbico (AA) para os organismos animais e vegetal, sua biossíntese somente foi elucidada em 1998, quando Wheeler, Jones e Smirnoff demonstraram, em folhas de Arabidopsis, que L-galactose (L-GAL) é um precursor chave. Neste trabalho, investigou-se a atuação de supostos precursores na síntese do AA em diferentes fontes vegetais: pimentão-verde, goiabas de polpa branca e vermelha, mamão e morango em dois estádios do amadurecimento: verde e maduro para o mamão e verde e rosa para o morango e em brócolis, verificando-se a atuação da via "Smirnoff-Wheeler" mediante a constatação do aumento dos conteúdos de AA e incorporação de precursores radiativamente marcados. O conteúdo de AA no mamão maduro apresentou-se maior do que no verde, indicando que há predomínio da síntese durante o amadurecimento desse fruto. O mesmo não ocorreu com o morango, onde não houve diferenças significativas entre os conteúdos de AA nos frutos verde e intermediário. Os resultados confirmaram que a L-GAL e a L-galactono- 1, 4 -lactona (L-GL) são precursores bastante eficientes do AA, e também que há síntese de AA a partir de D-manose (D-MAN), L-GAL e D-glicose- 1 P nos vegetais estudados...|$|E
