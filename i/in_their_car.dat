The police find out that Linda {{used to work at}} Brian's restaurant and received psychological abuse until Dave found out and confronted him. Brian has started to abuse Nina, so the police get Nina away from Brian, as he caused Linda to suffer from bulimia due to the abuse.|$|E

During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>car.</b> Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things.

5|$|Pescarolo {{started the}} 2003 FIA Sportscar Championship {{season with a}} victory at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Estoril, with Boullion partnering Stéphane Sarrazin in the C60. Like the {{previous}} year, three C60s were entered at the 24 Hours of Le Mans; Courage ran Jonathan Cochet, Jean-Marc Gounon and Stéphan Grégoire <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>car,</b> whilst Pescarolo ran Boullion, Sarrazin and Lagorce in one car, with Nicolas Minassian, Soheil Ayari and Hélary in the other. The three C60s finished seventh, eighth and ninth respectively, which equated to fifth, sixth and seventh in the LMP900 category. Pescarolo followed this result {{with a string of}} retirements at the 500 km of Monza, the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Oschersleben and the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Donington. The 1000 km of Spa saw a return to form, as Sarrazin and Lagorce took second, before Pescarolo ended the FIA Sportscar Championship season with a victory at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Nogaro (where Ayari replaced Sarrazin). Despite the mid-season slump, Pescarolo were still able to deliver Courage second in the SR1 Constructor's Championship. The final race of the C60's season came at the non-championship 1000 km of Le Mans, where Sarrazin, Lagorce and Bourdais took second place.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins as police {{officers}} and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police {{from the beginning of}} the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>car.</b> Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.|$|E
5|$|West {{attacks and}} kills a {{fisherman}} in a wood, then encounters and frightens {{a little girl}} (Julie Drazen) there, but she escapes unharmed. Nelson tracks West by following his radiation trail with a geiger counter, but only finds his detached ear stuck to a tree branch. Perry arrives by plane, and is picked up by Nelson; shortly thereafter, they visit the crime scene where the fisherman's body was found. Sheriff Neil Blake (Michael Alldredge) suspects that Nelson knows something, but Nelson tells the sheriff nothing because Perry had earlier informed him that any information about West was classified. Later that night, Nelson returns home to his pregnant wife Judy (Ann Sweeny), who tells him that her elderly mother Helen (Dorothy Love) and Helen's boyfriend Harold (Edwin Max) are coming over for dinner. On their way, however, Helen and Harold are attacked by West <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>car,</b> and he kills them both.|$|E

30|$|In an {{evacuation}} {{experiment in the}} Benelux tunnel a truck fire was simulated to study human behaviour. In 6 out of 7 tests, motorists stayed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> until the first announcement. In one test motorists started to leave <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> immediately and others followed. In all seven tests the first announcement was sufficient to start the evacuation. One test showed extreme passivity by the motorists in the front who stayed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> even after they were engulfed with smoke. First after the second announcement did they react and commence evacuation. A common reason for not reacting to the incident was {{that no one else}} did anything. Another reason to stay in the car without reacting can be to stick to the role of being a motorist. As visibility decreases so do these social influences. This is believed {{to be part of the}} explanation as to why some motorists stayed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>cars</b> being engulfed by smoke: they did not see the motorists leaving behind them (Boer and van Zanten 2007).|$|R

Two tactics used by many insurgents are assassinations and suicide bomb attacks. The latter tactic is used when an insurgent has a bomb strapped to them or <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>car,</b> which provides a low-tech way for insurgents to get explosives close to critical enemy targets.|$|E
