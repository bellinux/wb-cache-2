5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, <b>homosexuality</b> <b>and</b> bisexuality.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of <b>homosexuality,</b> <b>and</b> also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male <b>homosexuality,</b> <b>and</b> maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of <b>homosexuality</b> <b>and</b> non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E

5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest {{that the lack of}} female companionship for the male characters indicates their latent <b>homosexuality</b> <b>and</b> that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity.

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male <b>homosexuality</b> <b>and</b> neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E

They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of <b>homosexuality</b> <b>and</b> the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E

In 2012, he was nominated to fill a vacancy on the state's 13th General District Court, which serves Richmond, Virginia. Before the vote, the conservative advocacy group Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied heavily against his nomination due to his <b>homosexuality</b> <b>and</b> past activism. He had served for a time {{on the board of}} Equality Virginia, a gay rights advocacy organization. If his nomination had succeeded, he would have become the first openly gay judge in the state.|$|E
5|$|With a seed {{grant from}} Steven Spielberg, {{the creators of}} the film have set up the Trembling Before G-d Orthodox Education Project, to teach Orthodox {{educators}} and rabbis about homosexuality, as well as convening the first Orthodox Mental Health Conference on <b>Homosexuality</b> <b>and</b> training facilitators to show the film to community leaders. Over 2000 principals, educators and school counselors have attended screenings within Israel's religious school system. The film has now been seen by an estimated 8 million people worldwide.

5|$|Animated {{television}} advertisements starring the transgender playboy cow Graham Heffer {{ran from}} 1999 until 2002.

To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer's Manchester heritage with a Happy Mondays soundtrack, even though production had {{moved out of the}} city. Mike Thompson, a former worker at the brewery and representative of the Transport & General Workers' Union, said: This is at best cynical and at worst a slur on our great city, its heritage and the Strangeways workers. People have lost their livelihoods because of how this company has behaved. They will not be best pleased at what we can only see as pouring salt on the wounds.|$|E
