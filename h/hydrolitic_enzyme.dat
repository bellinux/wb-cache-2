40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Candida parapsilosis complex species, {{frequently}} {{found in}} hospital environments, have gained importance as etiological agents of candidemia. METHODS: Candida parapsilosis complex isolates from a nosocomial environment {{were identified and}} their <b>hydrolitic</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity and ability to form biofilm were characterized. RESULTS: Twenty-two C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates produced proteinase and three produced phospholipase. Most Candida metapsilosis isolates produced proteinase and one also produced phospholipase. All 29 isolates formed biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The nosocomial environment may act as a reservoir for C. parapsilosis complex isolates with phenotypic features that could possibly lead to nosocomial infections and health complications in hospital patients...|$|E
40|$|Cellulase enzymes are <b>hydrolitic</b> <b>enzyme</b> capable c. f hydrolyzing {{cellulose}} to glucose monomers {{that can}} be isolated from mussel shells (Atacodea strain) using cellulose paper substrateThis study aims to determine the optimum condition for cellulase enzymes from mussel sheels covering the substrate concentration, pH, temperature, and concentratiom of the enzyme and determine the value of KM and VMax. This study begins by isolating cellulase enzymes through the cell destruction, homogenation, and centrifugation. Determination of optimum conditions {{can be seen from}} values of enzyme activity and determined by measuring glucose levels. Glucose levels were determiden based on obtained Nelson-Somogy method. Determintion of protein was 2 %, the optimum temperature was 40 C, the optimum pH was 5. 4 and the optimum enzyme concentration was 12 mg/mL, respectively. KM and VMax values was at 1. 192 % (w/v) and 1. 12 umol/mL/min. At the optimum conditions, the specific activity of the cellulase enzyme from mussel sheels (Atactodea striata) in hydrolyzing cellulose contained in old newspapers into glucose was 1. 62 x 10 - 4 U/mg...|$|E
40|$|Physicochemical {{characteristics}} and freshness indicators of cow and buffalo butter during freezing (- 15 [...] . - 18 oC) storage were studied. Changes in freshness parameters and alterative processes installation, when butter becomes improperly for consumption were studied, inducing acidity, peroxide value (PV), iodine value (IV) andthe presence of epyhidrinic aldehyde. There {{was an increase}} of titrable acidity during storage, cow butter hydrolysis was installed after 35 days and after 30 days for buffalo butter. Hydrolysis processes are installed more quickly in terms of freezing than oxidative processes, being intensified by a higher water content inproduct and by <b>hydrolitic</b> <b>enzymes</b> presence...|$|R

Title of thesis: Study of lipid {{monolayer}} {{models of}} skin barrier diseases Skin protects human body from external factors and maintain internal integrity of organism. Skin barrier is formed by corneocytes and lipid matrix in intercellular space of stratum corneum, the uppermost layer of epidermis. Lipid matrix consists of ceramides, {{free fatty acids}} and cholesterol. The composition and organisation of lipid matrix are essential for the skin barrier properties. Ceramides are synthetized from glucosylated ceramide and sphingomyelin by <b>hydrolitic</b> <b>enzymes</b> β-glucocerebrosidase and sphingomyelinase. Insufficiency or malfunction of these enzymes lead to functionless skin barrier. The aim of this work was to prepare and study monolayer lipid models, which simulated the malfunction of sphingomyelinase in skin diseases. For valuation we used several techniques such as Langmuir monolayers, Brewster angle microscopy (at the air-liquid interface), Langmuir-Blodgett technique and atomic force microscopy. Monolayers with 100 % substitution of sphingomyelin layout the most readily with rising surface pressure and {{the course of their}} isotherm is very [...] ...|$|R
40|$|From leaves, {{stems and}} roots of healthy yellow passion fruit plants 93 {{isolates}} of endophytic fungi were obtained, with the colonization rates varying from 59. 8 to 92. 4 % (leaves), 27. 2 to 90 % (stems) and 2. 4 to 87. 2 (roots). Twenty-nine of these isolates were evaluated for extracelular <b>hydrolitic</b> <b>enzymes</b> production (amylolitic, cellulolitic, lypolytic and proteolytic) and capacity to promove growth of yellow passion fruit seedlings. The isolates {{were identified as}} Fusarium (44. 82 %), Colletotrichum (37. 93 %), Acremonium, Glomerella, Curvularia, Alternaria and Aspergillus (3. 45 % each). The isolates EM 11, EM 50, EM 172, EM 20, EM 81, EM 72, EM 135 and EM 24 presented lypolytic activity with halos varying from 1. 52 to 3. 74 cm, and no isolate produced proteolytic, cellulolytic and amylolitic enzymes. Fifteen endophytic isolates promoted growth of yellow passion fruit seedlings, being the best EM 173 (Alternaria), EM 155 (Fusarium), EM 139 (Curvularia), EM 20 (Colletotrichum), EM 6 (Acremonium) and EM 151 (Colletotrichum) that increased aerial and root fresh biomass and root dry biomass of until 108. 4, 204. 4 and 70. 2 %, respectively, 90 days after the inoculation...|$|R
