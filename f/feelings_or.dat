5|$|Tristano is {{regarded}} as one of the first to teach jazz, particularly improvisation, in a structured way. He taught musicians irrespective of their instrument and structured lessons to meet the needs of each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways that would allow them to find and express their own musical <b>feelings,</b> <b>or</b> style.|$|E

25|$|Low {{levels of}} effortful control can render the {{individual}} {{less able to}} distract themselves from unpleasant <b>feelings</b> <b>or</b> overcome strong affective impulses, resulting in maladaptive responses to distress – such as continued substance use. Low effortful control may also interact with negative and positive affect, predisposing individuals to substance or behavioural use, and impair their ability to control use.|$|E
25|$|Oral sex {{is often}} {{regarded}} as taboo, but most countries {{do not have}} laws which ban the practice. Commonly, people do not regard oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary. People may also have negative <b>feelings</b> <b>or</b> sexual inhibitions about giving or receiving oral sex, or may flatly refuse {{to engage in the}} practice.|$|E

25|$|Peer support {{occurs when}} people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or {{practical}} help to each other. It commonly {{refers to an}} initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided by peers without training), and can take a number of forms such as peer mentoring, reflective listening (reflecting content and/or <b>feelings),</b> <b>or</b> counseling. Peer support {{is also used to}} refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other support on a reciprocal basis.|$|E
25|$|Epiphenomenalism is {{the theory}} in {{philosophy}} {{of mind that}} mental phenomena are caused by physical processes in the brain or that both are effects of a common cause, as opposed to mental phenomena driving the physical mechanics of the brain. The impression that thoughts, <b>feelings,</b> <b>or</b> sensations cause physical effects, is therefore {{to be understood as}} illusory to some extent. For example, it is not the feeling of fear that produces an increase in heart beat, both are symptomatic of a common physiological origin, possibly in response to a legitimate external threat.|$|E
25|$|This {{process has}} been studied {{extensively}} in social psychology as implicit associations and implicit attitudes, a component of implicit cognition. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience. Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action towards social objects. These thoughts, <b>feelings</b> <b>or</b> actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.|$|E

25|$|HR characterizes {{feelings}} and emotions {{as indicators of}} the quality of one's thinking. Within the HR model, unpleasant <b>feelings</b> <b>or</b> emotions, or stressful feelings, indicate that one's thinking is based on insecurity, negative beliefs, conditioning or learned patterns that are not necessarily appropriate to the live moment here and now. They simultaneously indicate that the individual has temporarily lost sight of what HR asserts is his or her own role in creating experience. Pleasant or desired feelings (such as a sense of well-being, gratitude, compassion, peace, etc.) indicate, within the HR model, that the quality of one's thinking is exactly as it needs to be.|$|E
25|$|After Maugham's {{return to}} Britain his uncle found him a {{position}} in an accountant's office, but after a month Maugham gave it up and returned to Whitstable. His uncle tried to find Maugham a new profession. Maugham's father and three older brothers were distinguished lawyers; however, Maugham wasn't interested. A career in the Church was rejected because a stammering clergyman might make the family appear ridiculous. His uncle rejected the Civil Service, {{not because of the}} young man's <b>feelings</b> <b>or</b> interests, but because his uncle concluded that it was no longer a career for gentlemen, since a new law required applicants to pass an entrance examination. The local physician suggested the medical profession and Maugham's uncle agreed.|$|E
25|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can develop after {{a person is}} exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, <b>feelings,</b> <b>or</b> dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in how a person thinks and feels, {{and an increase in}} the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last {{for more than a month}} after the event. Young children are less likely to show distress but instead may express their memories through play. A person with PTSD is at a higher risk for suicide and intentional self-harm.|$|E

25|$|Famous {{individuals}} have sometimes been diagnosed, albeit at a distance, as psychopaths. As one example {{out of many}} possible from history, in a 1972 version of a secret report originally prepared for the Office of Strategic Services in 1943, and {{which may have been}} intended to be used as propaganda, non-medical psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer suggested Adolf Hitler was probably a psychopath. However, others have not drawn this conclusion; clinical forensic psychologist Glenn Walters argues that Hitler's actions do not warrant a diagnosis of psychopathy as, although he showed several characteristics of criminality, he was not always egocentric, callously disregarding of <b>feelings</b> <b>or</b> lacking impulse control, and there is no proof he could not learn from mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Anatta (not-self): all dhammas lack a fixed, unchanging 'essence'; {{there is}} no permanent, {{essential}} ātta (self). A living being is a composite of the five aggregates (khandhas), which are the physical forms (rupa), <b>feelings</b> <b>or</b> sensations (vedana), perception (sanna), mental formations (sankhara), and consciousness (vinnana), none {{of which can be}} identified as one's Self. From the moment of conception, all entities (including all living beings) are subject to a process of continuous change. A practitioner should, on the other hand, develop and refine their mind to a state so as to see through this phenomenon. Truly understanding this counter-intuitive concept of Buddhism requires direct and personal experience. This is given in vipassanā practice, closely watching the continuous changes in the Five Aggregates.|$|E
25|$|A {{clinical}} psychologist studies and applies psychology {{for the purpose}} of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. In many countries it is a regulated profession that addresses moderate to more severe or chronic psychological problems, including diagnosable mental disorders. Clinical psychology includes a wide range of practices, such as research, psychological assessment, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. Central to clinical psychology is the practice of psychotherapy, which uses a wide range of techniques to change thoughts, <b>feelings,</b> <b>or</b> behaviors in service to enhancing subjective well-being, mental health, and life functioning. Unlike other mental health professionals, psychologists are trained to conduct psychological assessment. Clinical psychologists can work with individuals, couples, children, older adults, families, small groups, and communities.|$|E
