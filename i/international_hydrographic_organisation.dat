50|$|Joe Abulu became Executive Director of Rank Shipping Nigeria Limited. He {{spoke in}} favor of a new {{cabotage}} law that would confine local shipping between Nigerian ports to locally owned ships.In August 2007 he warned that the government's failure to carry out any hydrographic survey since 1933 had pushed up the cost of cargo freight. Without current charts, foreign vessels see Nigeria's territorial waters as dangerous, and therefore increase their freight charges to cover the risk. He called for government funding for a new survey.He said that Nigeria lost out at the recent elections of officers of the <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Organisation</b> because there was hardly any hydrography practice in the country.|$|E

A Differential Global Positioning System correction signal is broadcast continuously on 289 kHz to assist mariners using GPS navigation to position-fix their vessels more accurately. Tidal height predictions and real-time tidal information are provided on the department's website. Pilotage is compulsory for ships of 3,000 gross tonnes and above and gas carriers of any tonnage. Quarantine and immigration facilities are available on a 24-hour basis. Advance immigration clearance and radio pratique may be obtained by certain vessels on application.|$|E

The source data were subjected to area-based editing to remove data spikes, then combined with the previous Sexton (2005) grid to produce a new grid with a resolution of 0. 001 -arcdegree. Satellite-derived datasets were used to provide island topography and to fill in areas of no data.
