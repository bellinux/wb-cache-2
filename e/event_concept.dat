25|$|On 13 October 2010 Thomas Schreiber, {{coordinator}} at ARD, outlined details of Düsseldorf's <b>event</b> <b>concept.</b> The Esprit Arena {{was to be}} split in two parts separated from each other. On {{one side of the}} stadium the stage would be installed while the other side would function as background dressing rooms for the artist delegations. An athletics arena next to the Esprit Arena would serve as the press centre for the event. The Esprit Arena offered comfortable seats relatively near to the stage that created an indoor event arena atmosphere rather than a football-stadium ambiance. There were plans to allow the public the chance to attend the dress rehearsals. Altogether, tickets were sold for seven shows (the final, two semi-finals and four dress rehearsals).|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{leverage}} concept-level representations for complex event recognition in photographs given limited training examples. We introduce a novel framework to discover <b>event</b> <b>concept</b> attributes from {{the web and}} use that to extract semantic features from images and classify them into social event categories with few training examples. Discovered concepts include a variety of objects, scenes, actions and event sub-types, leading to a discriminative and compact representation for event images. Web images are obtained for each discovered <b>event</b> <b>concept</b> and we use (pretrained) CNN features to train concept classifiers. Extensive experiments on challenging event datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several baselines using deep CNN features directly in classifying images into events with limited training examples. We also demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall accuracy on a dataset with unseen event categories using a single training example.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the possible coding alternatives and the factual realizations {{of a complex}} <b>event</b> <b>concept.</b> We assume that any concept is built on a perceptional and functional basis and ask in what ways different languages encode such a concept, i. e., how the surface realizations of such a concept differ from one another. The concept under consideration in this paper, henceforth termed FETCH, is the concept realized in British English 'fetch' and Croatian 'dohvatiti'. After characterizing the event structure of FETCH at the beginning, a discussion of potential coding alternatives in terms of conceptual vs. lexical chunking follows. We then compare the cross-linguistic encoding of FETCH {{in a sample of}} 29 languages and show how the different surface realizations demonstrate different instantiations of potential conceptual and lexical chunking. Moreover, we discuss whether the <b>event</b> <b>concept</b> FETCH itself is universal. Finally, we test current theories on event structures, with a focus on the often assumed binary construction scheme. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in process engineering and application integration {{has resulted in}} the appearance of various new process modelling languages. Understanding and comparing such languages has therefore become a major problem in information systems research and development. We suggest a framework to solve this problem involving several instruments: a general process metamodel with a table, an analysis of the <b>event</b> <b>concept,</b> and a classification of concepts according to the interrogative pronouns: what, how, why, who, when, and where. This framework can be used for several purposes, such as translating between languages or verifying that relevant organisational aspects have been captured.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine a {{cognitive}} mechanism of incommensurability. Using the frame model of concept representation to capture structural relations within concepts, I reveal an ontological difference between object and event concepts: {{the former are}} spatial but the latter temporal. Experiments from cognitive sciences further demonstrate that the mind treats object and event concepts differently. Thus, incommensurability can occur in conceptual change across different ontological categories. I use a historical case to illustrate how the ontological difference between an object and an <b>event</b> <b>concept</b> actually caused incommensurability {{in the context of}} 19 th-century optics. The cognitive and historical analyses indicate that incommensurability can be a local phenomenon and does not necessarily imply incomparability...|$|E
