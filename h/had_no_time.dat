5|$|Despite being {{designed}} to fire at trajectories with a steep angle of descent, howitzers can be fired directly, {{as was done}} by the 11th Marine Regiment at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, during the Korean War. Two field batteries fired directly upon a battalion of Chinese infantry; the Marines were forced to brace themselves against their howitzers, as they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to dig them in. The Chinese infantry took heavy casualties, and were forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Kvale {{hoped that}} {{his friend and}} fellow Minnesotan, Senator Henrik Shipstead, could persuade {{sculptor}} Gutzon Borglum to design the medal for no fee or a nominal one. Borglum, who was busy with construction at Stone Mountain in Georgia (he would later sculpt Mount Rushmore), had designed the Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar; he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to accept the work. Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, {{a member of the}} Commission of Fine Arts, was engaged for a fee of $1,500, about the usual for a commemorative coin.|$|E

5|$|Other riders {{named as}} contenders {{included}} Philippe Gilbert, Damiano Cunego, Thomas Löfkvist, David Millar, Italian national champion Giovanni Visconti and Edvald Boasson Hagen. 2010's top two, Stefano Garzelli and Michele Scarponi, both returned, {{but as the}} race <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> trial in 2010 and had two in 2011, their chances were diminished due to their relatively weak time trial skills. Other notable riders present in the field included 2008 winner Fabian Cancellara, American time trial specialist David Zabriskie, Italian classics rider and former Tirreno–Adriatico podium finisher Alessandro Ballan, former Italian national champion Filippo Pozzato, 2010 Giro d'Italia runner-up David Arroyo, and Australian sprinter Robbie McEwen.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was taken up with TV shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients could see it was him. After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E
5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

In his final party conference speech as Colonial Secretary, in October 1961, he declared that “I believe quite simply in the brotherhood of man – men of all races, of all colours, of all creeds”.|$|E
25|$|Both ships sank quickly, and Varangberg <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> {{to launch}} her {{lifeboats}}. Avoceta sank by the stern, and her bows quickly rose {{to such an}} angle that her lifeboats could not be lowered. However, the liner had three liferafts mounted so as to float clear {{in the event of}} a shipwreck, and one of her radio officers survived by clinging to a large piece of her cork cargo that had floated free from one of her holds.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the battle, the rebellion of Postumus had already started, so Gallienus <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to deal {{with the rest of the}} usurpers, namely Balista and Quietus. He came to an agreement with Odenathus, who had just returned from his victorious Persian expedition. Odenathus received the title of dux Romanorum and besieged the usurpers, who were based at Emesa. Eventually, the people of Emesa killed Quietus, and Odenathus arrested and executed Balista about November 261.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Claudius {{fell ill}} {{on the march}} to the battle and {{returned}} to his regional headquarters in Sirmium, leaving Aurelian in charge of operations against the Goths. Aurelian used his cavalry to great effect, breaking the Goths into smaller groups which were easier to deal with. By late summer the Goths were defeated: any survivors were stripped of their animals and booty and were levied into the army or settled as farmers in frontier regions. Aurelian <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to relish his victories; in late August news arrived from Sirmium that emperor Claudius was dead.|$|E
25|$|Soon, Han's {{greatest}} fear approached as the Jurchens treacheriously betrayed its alliance with Song and attacked the Song army by surprise. Han was enlisted {{with the many}} deputies under General Liang Fongping. He was given fifty cavalry {{to take back the}} fortress of Yishan from the Jurchens. Many regarded this as a suicidal assault since there were over 2000 experienced Jin troops guarding it. However, Liang enforced the idea, and Han didn't reject it. Miraculously, Han emerged victorious over the Jurchens. Yet, Han <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to celebrate as all the other armies under Liang had been routed by Jurchens.|$|E

25|$|German and Soviet armies {{relied heavily}} on work horses to pull {{artillery}} and supplies. Horses {{seemed to be a}} cheap and reliable transport especially in the spring and fall mud of the Eastern Front but the associated costs of daily feeding, grooming and handling horses were staggering. In theory horse units could feed off the country, but grazing on grass alone rendered horses unfit for work and the troops <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to spend searching the villages for fodder. Hard-working horses required up to twelve pounds of grain daily; fodder carried by the troops made up a major portion of their supply trains.|$|E
25|$|At Jamestown, {{a warning}} by an Indian boy named Chanco to his employer, Richard Pace, helped reduce total deaths. Pace secured his plantation, and rowed {{across the river}} during the night to alert Jamestown, which allowed colonists some {{defensive}} preparation. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to warn outposts, which suffered deaths and captives at almost every location. Several entire communities were essentially wiped out, including Henricus and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin's Hundred. At the Falling Creek Ironworks, which had been seen as promising for the Colony, two women and three children were among the 27 killed, leaving only two colonists alive. The facilities were destroyed.|$|E

In determining the penalty, the court took into account the finding that De G. was legally insane {{at the time of the}} crime. De G. was acquitted of manslaughter on the basis of the possibility that another of the three people whose DNA was found, who was never affirmatively identified, was involved in the death.|$|E

25|$|Toungoo {{was to get}} a {{much needed}} breather, however. For much of the rainy season of 1542, the Confederation chiefs were still {{coming to terms with}} their new leader Hkonmaing (son of Hkonmaing I of Onbaung), and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to plan for an invasion. Initially, the {{leadership}} of Mohnyin was deeply unsatisfied with Hkonmaing, who was put on the throne by the Ava court, not only because the heirs of Sawlon felt the throne of Ava was theirs but also because Hkonmaing's father was someone they bitterly fought against in the 1520s. In the end, in August/September 1542, the chiefs reluctantly decided to back Hkonmaing, and form a united front against a rising Toungoo. They agreed to invade Lower Burma in the dry season of 1543–44.|$|E
25|$|These uniforms were officially {{decided by}} edict of the Dajō-kan on December 12, 1872. The Iwakura Mission, which had {{departed}} Japan earlier, also gathered information on uniform design via Hayashi Tadasu. However, the mission <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> {{to wait for}} a final decision before an audience with Queen Victoria. They therefore ordered uniforms in England, based on the designs they had been discussing with the homeland. Unfortunately, the designs they reported back were determined to be impossible to create in Japan's still-immature Western clothing stores and were not adopted directly. The versions ultimately decreed by the Dajō-kan differed considerably from the Iwakura mission's prototypes. The Dajō-kan's edicts were still incomplete as a form of law, and the details of the original edict itself were in some areas insufficient, so variations were visible depending on the manufacturer.|$|E
