5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
25|$|According to Simmel, {{in small}} groups, secrets are less needed because <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be more similar. In larger groups secrets are needed {{as a result}} of their heterogeneity. In secret societies, groups are held {{together}} by the need to maintain the secret, a condition that also causes tension because the society relies on its sense of secrecy and exclusion.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the later}} singles [...] "Lovesong" [...] and [...] "Friday I'm in Love" [...] reached higher chart positions, [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was the band's American breakthrough, {{and has been}} {{described}} as [...] "in American terms, at least, the one Cure song <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know." [...] The song inspired the name of, and was used in the 2005 film Just Like Heaven. In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 483 on their list of the [...] "500 Greatest Songs of All Time". In 2005 Entertainment Weekly ranked [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] 25th on its list of [...] "The 50 Greatest Love Songs", saying, [...] "Turns out guys who wear black eyeliner can be happy." [...] The following year the song placed at number 22 on VH1's poll [...] "100 Greatest Songs of the 80s".|$|E

500|$|After {{initially}} being {{a successful}} police officer, Marge becomes unenthusiastic about {{her job as}} <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be breaking the law, including Homer, whom she arrests for taking her hat and taunting her when she tries to write him a parking ticket. After being released, Homer hosts a poker game and finds Herman running a jean-counterfeiting operation in the Simpsons' garage. As Herman and his henchmen are about to beat him up, Marge bursts in. As she is cuffing {{the rest of the}} minions, Herman takes Homer hostage and runs to Bart's treehouse, with Marge in pursuit. Herman tries to escape using a pair of counterfeit jeans as a rope, but they rip and he falls to the ground. Wiggum informs Marge that they cannot hold Herman due to the evidence [...] "mysteriously disappearing", with him and the other cops openly stealing the jeans for themselves. Upset at the corruption on the force, Marge resigns.|$|E
500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
2500|$|Filipa Jodelka from The Guardian said, [...] "Carl is an EastEnders speciality, a new {{character}} shoehorned {{in with a}} backstory that's not so much shadowy {{as completely}} obscured. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be scared of him, though, because apparently wandering around the Square silently pulling faces counts as menacing these days." [...] Victoria Garo-Falides from the Daily Mirror said Carl is [...] "on track to be the shortest, scariest man ever to walk the Square".|$|E
6000|$|The bright moments flew on. Suddenly {{there was}} a mysterious silence in the hall, {{followed}} {{by a kind of}} suppressed stir. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be speaking with bated breath, or, if moving, walking on tiptoe. It was the supper hour? ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{an early}} flurry of success, she told The Independent: [...] "We weren't happy. It was a nightmare, {{breaking}} the rules and all that. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be having fun, but they were taking so many drugs they wouldn't know it anyway." ...|$|R
5000|$|In addition, Army Chief of Staff George C.

Always seems to win every battle – apart from a Christmas short – against Weebl, who states [...] "damn you wee bull. you win this time." [...] Popular with the ladies. Possibly descended from Wee Mammoth, he always talks by snorting. No words are formed, but <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> understand him, much like Weebl's and Bob's slurred speech. He still loves Weebl however, and wants to talk, according to the subject line of an E-Mail he sends in the recent episode 'Email' ("Son, We Need To Talk. Love Wee Bull").|$|E
2500|$|One day, {{while playing}} with his grandson, Kamin is summoned by his adult {{children}} to watch the launch of a rocket, which <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know about except him. As he walks outside into the glaring sunlight, Kamin sees Eline and Batai, as young as {{when he first saw}} them. They explain that he has already seen the rocket, just before he came there. Knowing that the planet was doomed, the planet's leaders placed the memories of their culture into a probe and launched it into space, in the hope that it would find someone who could tell others about their species. Picard then realizes the entire context: [...] "Oh, it's me, isn't it?", he says, [...] "I'm the someone...I'm the one it finds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked by Samuel French, Inc. if {{he could}} name the playwright who had most {{influenced}} him, Heinze said, [...] "If I were darker, it would be Orton. If I were more laconic, it would be Pinter. If I were more lyrically erudite, it would be Stoppard. If I had ten additional brains, it would be Shakespeare. Hm. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be English. [...] If I were more Irish, it would be Beckett. (And if I had more savoir faire, it would be Molière.)" [...] He added, [...] "I think all my sources of inspiration are unconventional. It's the feeling of something unconventional that {{makes me want to}} write the play. At least for a full-length play that’s true. I think I wouldn't want to invest the time if I didn’t have that feeling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biographers {{have looked}} for {{consistency}} from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; Lockwood, {{who knew him}} as his mother's partner; David [...] "Honeyboy" [...] Edwards, whose cousin Willie Mae Powell {{had a relationship with}} Johnson. From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts, biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character. [...] "He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable". [...] "As for his character, <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way". [...] "Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to comics {{historian}} Les Daniels, [...] "nearly <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{agree that}} Two-Face was Kane's brainchild exclusively". [...] Catwoman, originally introduced by Kane with no costume as [...] "the Cat", was partially {{inspired by his}} cousin, Ruth Steel. Kane, a frequent movie goer, mentioned that Jean Harlow was {{a model for the}} design and added that [...] "I always felt that women were feline". [...] Kane created the Scarecrow and drew his first appearance, which was scripted by Finger. [...] Kane also created the original incarnation of Clayface. [...] According to Kane, he drew the Penguin after being inspired by the then advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes — a penguin with a top hat and cane. Finger, however, claimed that he created the villain as a caricature of the aristocratic type, because [...] "stuffy English gentlemen" [...] reminded him of emperor penguins.|$|E
2500|$|Asturias {{received}} much criticism for his earlier essay [...] "El problema social del indio" [...] (1923), which saw no future for a Guatemalan identity {{based on its}} Mayan heritage, and encouraged a progressive ideology to take over. The criticism comes from the complete change of attitude which Leyendas de Guatemala seems to convey. Martin Lienhard argues that this former essay has become a dark spot in Asturias' past, which <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have forgotten once the author received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967. He goes on {{to argue that the}} young Asturias made undeniably racist claims in this essay, which cannot be deleted, and Leyendas de Guatemala does not entirely break from such an attitude either. Lienhard compares the way in which Asturias re-wrote the creation myths of Guatemala to that of Soviet educational propaganda, claiming that he progressively manipulated the culture and the collective memory of a people to serve the interest of a State.|$|E

On the London Underground, Norwich fans sang “we won the cup”, while Sunderland’s retorted with: “we scored the goal”.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} section, the {{performers}} play their {{instruments in the}} same doll-like manner. The three performers at the rear play the antique cymbals and glockenspiel rapidly, blurring together high overtones. The marimba attendants play independently of <b>everyone,</b> <b>seeming</b> <b>to</b> be in their own separate world. The klangplatten performer plays independently as well, but he eventually strikes a tubular bell.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Ellada Eheis Talento (season 4) {{was finally}} aired and Eugenia kept her {{position}} as the female judge.

2500|$|Eumenius {{addressed}} the Franks {{in the matter}} of the execution of Frankish prisoners in the circus at Trier by Constantine I in 306 and certain other measures: [...] ("Where now is that ferocity of yours? Where is that ever untrustworthy fickleness?"). [...] was used often to describe the Franks. Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view. A formulary written by Marculf about 700 AD described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that [...] "all the peoples who dwell , Franks, Romans, Burgundians and those of other nations, live... according to their law and their custom." [...] Writing in 2009, Professor Christopher Wickham pointed out that [...] "the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the River Loire <b>everyone</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been considered a Frank by the mid-7th century at the latest; Romani were essentially the inhabitants of Aquitaine after that".|$|E

Recently, a range of new fears – of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, war and refugees – have joined the old ones that surface regularly – fear of crime, unemployment, illiteracy, family breakdown and so on.

Why, I ask, should it have stopped precisely when a counter- attraction was so necessary? <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> drift towards the area of disturbance, of which the chairs of the Archdeacon's wife and Reginald formed the storm-centre. Conversation flagged, and there settled upon the company that expectant hush that precedes the dawn--when your neighbours don't happen to keep poultry.|$|R
