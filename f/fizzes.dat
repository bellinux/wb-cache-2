2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{three and a}} half stars out of four, the same rating he gave the first film, writing: [...] "In every way the equal of del Toro's {{original}} Hellboy, although perhaps a little noisier, it's another celebration of his love for bizarre fantasy and diabolical machines." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen writing in The Hollywood Reporter said Hellboy II was an uncompromised vision of del Toro's imagination. He said that with the director given free rein, the film came across as an amalgam of the best moments from his previous films, only with better visual effects. John Anderson of Variety wrote of a rococo precision to the visuals that exceeded that of the first film. He cited del Toro's [...] "clockmaker's preoccupation with detail" [...] and ability to blend state-of-the-art technology with more classical visuals as the reasons for the film's success. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the plot did not often deviate from its comic-book traditions, but that del Toro staged the action [...] "brilliantly". He said that while the visual effects deserved recognition, what made the film so exciting was the personality they were imbued with. Chuck Wilson of The Village Voice said that del Toro was on autopilot, but that he and his Pan's Labyrinth crew, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro in particular, staged the steady stream of action set-pieces expertly. Mike Goodridge of Screen International wrote that del Toro had retained the B movie tone of the first film, saying the film managed to avoid the self-importance of The Incredible Hulk and the Batman film series and that del Toro was simply a [...] "great storyteller" [...] providing a [...] "good time". Stuart Levine in Premiere praised the visuals and [...] "beautiful" [...] set-pieces, but said del Toro's script fell a little short of his direction. Alonso Duralde writing for msnbc.com said it represented a backwards step for del Toro, saying that despite several creepy sequences, the film was a return to the muddled storytelling and pretty visuals of his pre-Pan's Labyrinth films. He said del Toro's screenplay lacked energy or momentum. However, Peter Bradshaw, of The Guardian said almost the opposite was the case, as he thinks [...] "it is a crackingly enjoyable and exciting sequel, with something that the memory of Pan's Labyrinth might have entirely erased: a sense of humour." [...] Noting that [...] "this spectacular movie seethes and <b>fizzes</b> with wit and energy, absorbing and transforming influences such as Ghostbusters and even Harry Potter and the secret world of Diagon Alley." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>FIZZ</b> (found in {{inflammatory}} zone) 1, {{a member}} of a cysteine-rich secreted protein family, is highly induced in lung allergic inflammation and bleomycin induced lung fibrosis, and primarily expressed by airway and type II alveolar epithelial cells. This novel mediator is known to stimulate a-smooth muscle actin and collagen expression in lung fibroblasts. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the in vivo effects of <b>FIZZ</b> 1 on the development of lung fibrosis by evaluating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in <b>FIZZ</b> 1 deficient mice. <b>FIZZ</b> 1 knockout mice exhibited no detectable abnormality. When these mice were treated with bleomycin they exhibited significantly impaired pulmonary fibrosis relative to wild type mice, along with impaired proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression. Deficient lung fibroblast activation was also noted in the <b>FIZZ</b> 1 knockout mice. Moreover, recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to injured lung was deficient in <b>FIZZ</b> 1 knockout mice. Interestingly in vitro <b>FIZZ</b> 1 was shown to have chemoattractant activity for bone marrow cells, including bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Finally, overexpression of <b>FIZZ</b> 1 exacerbated fibrosis. These findings suggested that <b>FIZZ</b> 1 exhibited profibrogenic properties essential for bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis, as reflected by its ability to induc...|$|R
40|$|Myofibroblasts play an {{essential}} role in the abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix in pulmonary fibrosis. The presence or prolonged survival of these cells may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Found in inflammatory zone (<b>FIZZ)</b> 1 can induce myofibroblast differentiation and has an antiapoptotic effect on embryonic lung explant cultures. In this study, we investigated whether <b>FIZZ</b> 1 also has an antiapoptotic effect on mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs). Cells were treated with <b>FIZZ</b> 1 for 24 h and then apoptosis was induced by TNFΑ in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). <b>FIZZ</b> 1 exhibited an antiapoptotic effect in MLFs, as assessed by flow cytometric analysis and TUNEL staining. Moreover, the cell number was higher in the <b>FIZZ</b> 1 -treated group relative to the non-treated control group after treatment with TNFΑ and CHX. <b>FIZZ</b> 1 treatment also inhibited the apoptotic agent-induced activities of caspase- 3 and caspase- 8. Examination of potential signalling pathways revealed that <b>FIZZ</b> 1 induced rapid phosphorylation of ERK- 1 / 2, while PD 98059, a MEK/ERK inhibitor, markedly induced activation of caspase- 3. This anti-apoptotic effect of <b>FIZZ</b> 1 was associated with induction of myofibroblast differentiation in response to <b>FIZZ</b> 1 stimulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that <b>FIZZ</b> 1 is involved in pulmonary fibrosis through both induction of myofibroblast differentiation and increased or prolonged survival of myofibroblasts. This effect of <b>FIZZ</b> 1 was mediated by inhibition of caspase- 3 and - 8, with involvement of the ERK pathway. Copyright © 2007 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
