5|$|The {{judicial}} system in Belarus lacks independence and {{is subject to}} political interference. Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and whistleblower protection and national ombudsman are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, and the government <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations {{in order to improve}} transparency in the tax office.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people in}} China {{and other parts}} of Asia have a belief that various tiger parts have {{medicinal}} properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs. There is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. The use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in China is already banned, and the government <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death. Furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and a domestic trade ban has been in place in China since 1993.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken a backseat because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and commercial (shopping) complexes. Horticulture, though, <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.|$|E

25|$|The intense {{process of}} {{urbanization}} {{that is taking}} place in the metropolitan region <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> of the political boundaries between municipalities in the region obsolete.

25|$|Alabama <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> {{changes since}} the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to {{increase}} representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, Dillard v. Crenshaw County, challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they {{had been unable to}} elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.|$|E

25|$|American {{use of its}} {{military}} aid for political pressure on Israel, {{as well as the}} economic and strategic restrictions attached to it, <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> Israelis question the value of American military aid. Israeli columnist Caroline Glick has argued that Israel's interests may be best served by ending the military assistance, and urged her government to initiate a conversation on cutting back on the assistance package. Former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens also opposes continued US aid, arguing that Israel no longer needs it. Several Israeli political parties, including National Union, oppose the aid and propose a gradual reduction in dependency on it.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of respect}} for the {{historic}} character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation. Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the Committee for the Preservation of the White House must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family—usually represented by the First Lady, the White House Curator, and the Chief Usher—to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in South Africa is characterised by both achievements and challenges. After {{the end of}} Apartheid South Africa's newly elected government struggled with the then growing service and backlogs with respect to access to {{water supply and sanitation}} developed. The government thus made a strong commitment to high service standards and to high levels of investment subsidies to achieve those standards. Since then, the country <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> progress with regard to improving access to water supply: It reached universal access to an improved water source in urban areas, and in rural areas the share of those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{only known}} {{copy of the}} Model of Poesy is found in British Library Additional Manuscript 81083. The Modell of Poesye: Or The Arte of Poesye drawen into a short or Summary Discourse (to give its full title in the manuscript) is found on folios 1 to 49, written in a scribal italic hand with scribal and authorial/authorized {{corrections}} throughout. At least one gathering (i.e. eight pages) close to the start has been lost. Scott's dedicatory letter to Sir Henry Lee introduces the treatise, describing it as 'the first fruits of my study'. Folios 51 to 76 contain a partial translation {{of the first two}} jours of Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas' La Sepmaine. The translation ends mid-sentence during 'The Second Day', and water damage to the final surviving leaves <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> lines illegible.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} life, known as abiogenesis, {{distinct}} from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive {{to the formation of}} organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the panspermia hypothesis.|$|E
