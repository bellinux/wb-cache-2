50|$|The <b>host</b> <b>application</b> {{provides}} services {{which the}} plug-in can use, including {{a way for}} plug-ins to register themselves with the <b>host</b> <b>application</b> and a protocol for the exchange of data with plug-ins. Plug-ins depend on the services provided by the <b>host</b> <b>application</b> and do not usually work by themselves. Conversely, the <b>host</b> <b>application</b> operates independently of the plug-ins, {{making it possible for}} end-users to add and update plug-ins dynamically without needing to make changes to the <b>host</b> <b>application.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Downloading of any {{external}} resource {{from the}} Internet happens after notification of the <b>host</b> <b>application.</b> The <b>host</b> <b>application</b> may allow or discard any external request.|$|R

50|$|TCKs {{tend to be}} {{obtained}} from the Specification Lead of a given JSR. They usually (but not always) consist of a graphical <b>host</b> <b>application</b> which communicates over TCP/IP with the device or Java virtual machine that is under test. Tests are typically obtained by the device over HTTP, and results are posted back to the <b>host</b> <b>application</b> in a similar way. This decoupling enables TCKs to be used to test virtual machines on devices such as CLDC mobile phones which do not have the power to run the full TCK <b>host</b> <b>application.</b>|$|R

50|$|The SCIM {{standard}} {{has grown}} in popularity and importance, as organizations use more SaaS tools. A large organization can have {{hundreds or thousands of}} <b>hosted</b> <b>applications</b> (internal and external) and related servers, databases and file shares that require user provisioning. Without a standard connection method, companies must write custom software connectors to join these systems and their IdM system.|$|E

5000|$|Visual Studio Tools for Applications {{consists}} {{of both a}} runtime and design time environment or IDE. The runtime is used by <b>host</b> <b>applications</b> to expose their object models to add-ins as well as discover and load add-ins. Add-ins {{have access to the}} host object model through a proxy which utilizes the VSTA runtime, or alternatively add-ins can directly reference the <b>host</b> <b>application.</b> The IDE is a streamlined and customizable version of the Visual Studio IDE- Visual Studio 2005 for VSTA 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 for VSTA 2.0. It supports Visual Basic [...]Net and C#. The IDE can be customized to add or hide functionality. This makes it ideal for professional developers as well as power users and other end users who may have a more macro recording oriented coding style. Visual Studio Tools for Applications also features 64-bit support and macro recording of the <b>host</b> <b>application,</b> but does not incorporate Active Scripting support. In order to integrate VSTA into a <b>host</b> <b>application</b> the SDK is needed, to distribute VSTA with an application a license and the VSTA distributable is required.|$|R
50|$|SaaS Maker {{is written}} in ASP.NET and uses MS SQL or Firebird RDBMS for {{managing}} application databases. Platform is portable across data centers, and natively hosted on Amazon EC2 as a Virtual Global enterprise cloud platform. SOAP API enables developers to extend functionality by 3rd party services. SaaS Maker includes an ASP.NET SDK for developing 3rd party plug-ins which can be uploaded into SaaS Maker platform and used by <b>hosted</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the program}} was created as a {{companion}} to Far Manager, bringing some features common for graphical file managers to this console application (thumbnails and tiles, drag and drop with other windows, true color interface, and others). As of 2012, ConEmu could be used with any other Win32 console application or simple GUI tool (such as Notepad, PuTTY or DOSBox). ConEmu doesn't provide any shell itself, but rather allows using any other shell. It does provide a limited macro language, to control the <b>hosted</b> <b>applications</b> startup.|$|E
50|$|Remote mobile virtualization, {{like its}} {{counterpart}} desktop virtualization, is {{a technology that}} separates operating systems and applications from the client devices that access them. However, while desktop virtualization allows users to remotely access Windows desktops and applications, remote mobile virtualization offers remote access to mobile operating systems such as Android. Remote mobile virtualization encompasses both full operating system virtualization, referred to as virtual mobile infrastructure (VMI), and user and application virtualization, termed mobile app virtualization. Remote mobile virtualization allows a user to remotely control an Android virtual machine (VM) or application. Users can access remotely <b>hosted</b> <b>applications</b> with HTML5-enabled web browsers or thin client applications {{from a variety of}} smartphones, tablets and computers, including Apple iOS, Mac OS, Blackberry, Windows Phone, Windows desktop, and Firefox OS devices.|$|E

50|$|Berbee Information Networks Corporation, an American company {{specializing in}} IT, was {{purchased}} by CDW in 2006. Prior to {{that it was a}} privately held company headquartered in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Berbee was founded in 1993 by James G. Berbee and grew to over 300 million USD in revenue and more than 800 employees. Berbee's IT solutions included network infrastructure, systems and storage, productivity applications, communication and collaboration, application development, and security. Its data centers delivered <b>hosted</b> <b>applications,</b> co-location, and managed services. Berbee had offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In October 2006, Berbee accepted an $175 million all-cash acquisition offer from CDW. It became a division of CDW and is now known as CDW Advanced Technology Services. The Berbee Voice-Over IP software product group, creator of the InformaCast family of IP notification solutions, was spun off to form the new company Singlewire Software in April, 2009.|$|E
5000|$|XAML Browser Applications (XBAP, {{pronounced}} [...] "ex-bap") are Windows Presentation Foundation (.xbap) {{applications that}} are hosted and run inside {{a web browser}} such as Firefox or Internet Explorer. <b>Hosted</b> <b>applications</b> run in a partial trust sandbox environment and are not given full access to the computer's resources like opening a new network connection or saving a file to the computer disk and not all WPF functionality is available. The hosted environment is intended to protect the computer from malicious applications; however it can also run in full trust mode by the client changing the permission. Starting an XBAP from an HTML page is seamless (with no security or installation prompt). Although one perceives the application running in the browser, it actually runs in an out-of-process executable (PresentationHost.exe) managed by a virtual machine. In the initial release of [...]NET Framework 3.0, XBAPs only ran in Internet Explorer. With the release of [...]NET Framework 3.5 SP1, which includes an XBAP extension, they also run in Mozilla Firefox.|$|E
5000|$|Charting {{applications}} {{have become}} increasingly 'onlined', made available either to a wider public or to a territorially remote userbase via networked applications. The World wide web (the Web) has become [...] "by far, the most popular Internet protocol" [...] to disseminate online applications. Most major IDEs now offer environments for web application developede aimed at browser <b>hosted</b> <b>applications.</b> Charting components, TeeChart among them, have adapted to provide models that work within a browser environment, often using static images and scripted layering techniques such as Ajax (programming) to offer a level of interactivity, improve response times and hide apparent delay from the user. Options to enrich client, browser-side processing flexibility are exploited by TeeChart libraries via modules that offer 'micro-environments' within the browser, such as the long established ActiveX technology, Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight or Java Applets. Serverside environments offer too, a means to interact with browser based script to dynamically respond to charting requests. Joomla and CodeIgniter are host environments for TeeChart PHP and {{an example of an}} Embarcadero IntraWeb VCL designed application using TeeChart, is documented here.|$|E
