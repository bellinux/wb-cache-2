[...] The Observer editor Kitty Empire wrote in an assessment, [...] "With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive."

The song {{is one of the}} few up-tempo tracks on the album and contains multiple keyboard overdubs by Brion. Chris Yurkiw of the Montreal Mirror considered the track to be the most moving love song on the album, with an [...] "overt and open-hearted" [...] reference to his homosexuality: [...] "I may not be so manly, but still I know you love me." [...] Wainwright's Summer Stage performance of [...] "Beauty Mark" [...] appears on his 2005 DVD All I Want. In [...] "Barcelona", Wainwright recalls a love affair that took place in the city of the same name. The song is loosely about AIDS and contains the Italian language lyric [...] "Fuggi, regal fantasima", taken from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Macbeth. According to Wainwright, the line appears in a scene when [...] "Macbeth is going mad and sees the ghost, and in [...] mind the ghost was AIDS." [...] "Matinee Idol" [...] is about the rise and fall of an entertainment figure, inspired by the death of actor River Phoenix. According to Greenwald, the musical song has a [...] "1920s, cabaret musical feel". [...] "Damned Ladies" [...] is a slow ballad about the [...] "beloved yet doomed ladies of opera". Wainwright said the following of [...] "Damned Ladies", which contains references to nine opera heroines: [...] "In the song, I lament how these women are constantly dying brutal deaths, which I can see coming but cannot stop. It <b>gets</b> <b>me</b> every time." [...] Greenwald described [...] "Sally Ann" [...] as a 1920s love ballad of [...] "lost love and emotional regret".

2500|$|The {{character}} of Pete lasted {{in the show}} for eight years, and was eventually written out in 1993 when the writers felt that the character {{had come to a}} natural end. There was initially talk of Pete getting back together with his ex-wife Kathy, but it was felt {{that it would have been}} a retrogressive step, and it was dismissed. The character was killed off-screen in December 1993 and brought back to Walford to be buried. The press reported at the time that Pete was killed-off because he spoke negatively about EastEnders in the press following his axing. There was also speculation that he had not got along with Gillian Taylforth, who played his ex-wife Kathy. Dean commented, [...] "When they wrote me out of EastEnders, they said they had run out of storylines. I was a naughty boy and said if the wheel falls off the cart, get rid of the cart.

And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so.

2500|$|Critic Steve Huey of AllMusic {{writes that}} the album's {{influence}} [...] "was felt more in spirit than in direct copycatting, as a catalyst rather than a literal musical starting point. However, its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context {{laid the groundwork for}} countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the punk and new wave era." [...] In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by Rolling Stone in their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: [...] "On first listen, Trout Mask Replica sounds like raw Delta blues," [...] with Beefheart [...] "...singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. But the seeming sonic chaos is an illusion—to construct the songs, the Magic Band rehearsed twelve hours a day for months on end in a house with the windows blacked out. (Producer Frank Zappa was then able to record most of the album in less than five hours.) Tracks such as [...] "Ella Guru" [...] and [...] "My Human <b>Gets</b> <b>Me</b> Blues" [...] are the direct predecessors of modern musical primitives such as Tom Waits and PJ Harvey." [...] Guitarist Fred Frith noted that during this process [...] "forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable".|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Twain {{followed}} with Come On Over, which topped Top Country Albums {{for a record}} 50 non-consecutive weeks and had tremendous pop crossover success.

In Canada, it reached similar success and was certified double diamond by Music Canada. In 1998, Come On Over was released internationally, duplicating the commercial success it encountered in North America. It became one of the best-selling albums in several countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom.

2500|$|Lords {{made the}} first of her many illegal movies during October 1984, when she {{appeared}} in What <b>Gets</b> <b>Me</b> Hot! alongside Tom Byron, who later became her boyfriend off-screen. She first appeared only in a non-sex role, but was later replaced with a hardcore scene. In her next movie, Those Young Girls, she appeared in a sex role alongside Harry Reems and Ginger Lynn. After appearing at age 16 with John Leslie (an actor 23 years her senior) in the porno parody of the movie Splash, Talk Dirty to Me Part III (which won the AVN Award for the best movie), Lords was hailed as the [...] "Princess of Porn" [...] (she had appeared in a torrid sex scene with Leslie {{at the end of}} the film). [...] She became one of the highest-paid porno actresses of that time, earning more than $1,000 a day. Besides her work in porn, she also appeared in the music video for [...] "Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'" [...] by the heavy metal band Helix. Lords continued making more movies until the autumn of 1985, when she decided to quit the industry at age 17 (she came out of retirement a few months later). Afterwards, she met Stuart Dell, who became her boyfriend, manager, and business partner. During January 1986, she announced her return to porn with the formation of TLC (the Traci Lords Company). Dell and Lords made a distribution deal with Sy Adler, an industry veteran who ran Vantage International, that they would produce three movies for the company. During March, the first TLC feature, Traci Takes Tokyo, was released. The second, Beverly Hills Copulator, was released afterwards, and the third movie, Screamer, (Eddie Dzial) was shelved.|$|E
