The reason is that effective collective intelligence requires diversity of opinion, decentralization and individual independence, as demonstrated by James Surowiecki in his book The Wisdom of Crowds. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.|$|E

2500|$|It can be {{understood}} as an emergent property from the synergies among: 1) data-information-knowledge; 2) software-hardware; and 3) experts (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that continually learns from feedback to produce just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone. Or more narrowly as an emergent property between people and ways of processing information. This notion of collective intelligence is referred to as [...] "symbiotic intelligence" [...] by Norman Lee Johnson. The concept is used in sociology, business, computer science and mass communications: it also appears in science fiction. Pierre Lévy defines collective intelligence as, [...] "It is a form of universally <b>distributed</b> <b>intelligence,</b> constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills. I'll add the following indispensable characteristic to this definition: The basis and goal of collective intelligence is mutual recognition and enrichment of individuals rather than the cult of fetishized or hypostatized communities." [...] According to researchers Pierre Lévy and Derrick de Kerckhove, it refers to capacity of networked ICTs (Information communication technologies) to enhance the collective pool of social knowledge by simultaneously expanding the extent of human interactions.|$|E

40|$|In <b>distributed</b> {{artificial}} <b>intelligence</b> systems it {{is important}} that the constituent intelligent systems communicate. This may be a problem if the systems use different methods to represent uncertain information. This paper presents a method that enables systems that use different uncertainty handling formalisms to qualitatively integrate their uncertain information, and argues that this makes it possible for distributed intelligent systems to achieve tasks that would otherwise be beyond them. 1 Introduction <b>Distributed</b> artificial <b>intelligence</b> (DAI) is that part of the field of artificial intelligence that deals with problem solving distributed amongst a number of intelligent systems.

50|$|In the 1975 <b>distributed</b> {{artificial}} <b>intelligence</b> {{emerged as}} a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interaction of intelligent agents2. <b>Distributed</b> artificial <b>intelligence</b> systems were conceived {{as a group of}} intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving 1. In Multi-agent systems the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities. For distributed problem solving the major focus is how the problem is decomposed and the solutions are synthesized.|$|R
40|$|This paper fits in the {{framework}} of <b>Distributed</b> Artificial <b>Intelligence</b> and more specifically in the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). We show why antagonism should be considered in MAS made up of autonomous agents and how these systems can even turn antagonism to advantage. We present a case study of a MAS aimed at exploring the possibilities of antagonism, oriented towards mobile robotics applications. Experimental results relative to a preliminary study of antagonism, namely implicit cooperation, illustrating the complexity and the power of this approach, are reported.
