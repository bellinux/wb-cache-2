5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E

The aim of this study was to assess the hemodynamic status of the cerebral arteries in patients with hypercholesterolemia using TCD. Methods: In a case-control study, 60 individuals, including 30 hypercholesterolemic cases (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] &gt; 160 mg/dL) and 30 healthy controls were enrolled. Other arterial risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, and obesity (body mass index &gt; 30), were evaluated and matched as well. TCD was used to assess the hemodynamics of the intracranial arteries as well as the <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> The mean blood flow velocity, pulsatility index, and resistance index were recorded in all the arteries. Results: The mean blood flow velocity, pulsatility index, and resistance index of the intracranial <b>arteries</b> and <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> were not significantly different between the two groups (P &gt; 0. 05). However, those with higher levels of LDL (&gt; 180 mg/dL) showed significantly lower mean blood flow velocity and resistance index of the <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> than the healthy controls. In addition, individuals with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) &lt; 35 mg/dL had significantly lower mean blood flow velocity in the <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> Conclusion: Hypercholesterolemia (LDL &gt; 160 mg/dL) does not seem to have a detrimental effect on the hemodynamic status of the intracranial <b>arteries</b> and <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> However, in cases of higher LDL (&gt; 180 mg/dL) and lower HDL, decreased TCD parameters in the <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries,</b> as a surrogate of the peripheral arteries, are prominent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{head and}} neck cancer (HNC) patients, {{long-term}} treatment-related complications include radiotherapy (RT) -induced carotid vasculopathy and stroke. The current study investigated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the carotid wall in long-term HNC survivors treated with RT. METHODS: MRI of the <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was performed within a prospective cohort of 42 HNC patients on average 7 years after RT. Two independent radiologists assessed maximal vessel wall thickness of common and <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries.</b> In case of wall thickening (>/= 2 mm) the MRI signals as well as length of the thickened segment were assessed. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age of the 42 patients at baseline was 53 (13) years and mean (SD) follow-up time after RT was 6. 8 (1. 3) years. In total 62 % were men and 60 % had one or more cerebrovascular risk factors. Mean (SD) dose of RT on the common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> and <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was 57 Gy (11) and 61 Gy (10), respectively. Wall thickening was observed in 58 % of irradiated versus 27 % of non-irradiated common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> and 24 % of irradiated versus 6 % of non-irradiated <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (p < 0. 05). Mean (SD) thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was 2. 5 (0. 9) and 2 (0. 7) mm (p = 0. 02). Mean thickness of the irradiated and non-irradiated <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> was 1. 8 (0. 8) and 1. 5 mm (0. 3) (n. s.). Mean length of the thickened vessel wall was 48 mm versus 36 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated common <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (p = 0. 03) and 20 mm versus 15 mm in the irradiated versus non-irradiated <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>arteries</b> (n. s.).

25|$|Vertebrobasilar artery stroke (VAS) is {{statistically}} associated with chiropractic services in persons under 45 years of age, {{but it is}} similarly associated with general practitioner services, suggesting that these associations are likely explained by preexisting conditions. Weak to moderately strong evidence supports causation (as opposed to statistical association) between cervical manipulative therapy (CMT) and VAS. There is insufficient evidence to support a strong association or no association between cervical manipulation and stroke. While the biomechanical evidence {{is not sufficient to}} support the statement that CMT causes cervical artery dissection (CD), clinical reports suggest that mechanical forces have a part in a substantial number of CDs and the majority of population controlled studies found an association between CMT and VAS in young people. It is strongly recommended that practitioners consider the plausibility of CD as a symptom, and people can be informed of the association between CD and CMT before administrating manipulation of the cervical spine. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of stroke from cervical manipulation. Many chiropractors state that, the association between chiropractic therapy and vertebral arterial dissection is not proven. However, {{it has been suggested that}} the causality between chiropractic cervical manipulation beyond the normal range of motion and vascular accidents is probable or definite. There is very low evidence supporting a small association between <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> dissection and chiropractic neck manipulation. The incidence of <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> dissection following cervical spine manipulation is unknown. The literature infrequently reports helpful data to better understand the association between cervical manipulative therapy, cervical artery dissection and stroke. The limited evidence is inconclusive that chiropractic spinal manipulation therapy is not a cause of intracranial hypotension. Cervical intradural disc herniation is very rare following spinal manipulation therapy.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery</b> {{enters the}} canal in the petrous {{portion of the}} {{temporal}} bone, it first ascends a short distance, then curves anteriorly and medially. The artery lies at first {{in front of the}} cochlea and tympanic cavity; from the latter cavity it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is cribriform in the young subject, and often partly absorbed in old age. Farther forward it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by a thin plate of bone, which forms the floor of the fossa for the ganglion and the roof of the horizontal portion of the canal. Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater, and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the carotid plexus, derived from the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the <b>internal</b> <b>carotid</b> <b>artery.</b> IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E
