The planting employs a naturalistic style with broad <b>drifts</b> of herbaceous perennials and grasses providing colour through a long season, extending through the winter with dry stems and seed heads.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Thebe lies near {{the outer edge}} of the Thebe gossamer ring, which is {{composed}} of the dust ejected from the satellite. After ejection the dust <b>drifts</b> in the direction of the planet under the action of Poynting–Robertson drag forming a ring inward of the moon.|$|E
5|$|When powdery, snow <b>drifts</b> {{with the}} wind from the {{location}} where it originally fell, forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{advocated}} {{more natural}} and less formal-looking plantings of hardy perennials, shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He railed against standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy perennials and native plants; and large plantings of perennials in natural-looking <b>drifts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object <b>drifts</b> out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit to appear to rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino <b>drifts</b> backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E

After several days they encounter a rain of ashes and then observe a huge cataract of fog or mist, which splits open to accommodate their entrance upon approach. The native dies as a huge shrouded white figure appears before them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drifting</b> is a 2-8 player {{mode that}} uses the same tracks as {{simulation}} and arcade modes, but lap times and position do not matter. Rather the winner of a <b>drift</b> round is determined by how many <b>drift</b> points the players can score. <b>Drift</b> points are determined by angle (of {{the car in the}} curve), speed, length of the <b>drift,</b> and the <b>drift</b> multiplier. A unique feature of the <b>drift</b> mode is the ability to use specialized <b>drifting</b> cars, one of which resembles the Falken Mustang driven by Vaughn Gittin.|$|R
50|$|As a hobby, {{radio-controlled}} <b>drifting</b> {{is one of}} many {{variations of}} R/C car types and activities. Informal or formal practice events and competitions are held worldwide. When one judging R/C <b>drifting</b> competitions, R/C <b>drifting</b> typically follows the guidelines and judging criteria set by professional <b>drifting</b> organizations like the D1 Grand Prix. These judging criteria often include <b>drift</b> factors such as <b>drift</b> line, <b>drift</b> angle, speed, and show factor. Some R/C <b>drifting</b> competitions include the use of tsuiso or tandem-drift competition in which competitors are paired together to <b>drift</b> in a lead-chase format. This hobby was founded in Japan but has gained popularity in other countries.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} of <b>drift</b> in PCM devices at different temperatures and with different memory alloys is presented. It was shown that: <b>drift</b> exponent is reduced with decreasing chalcogenide film thickness, <b>drift</b> is observed to saturate with time, <b>drift</b> exponent rises and time of <b>drift</b> saturation decreases with increasing temperature. In this paper we report {{for the first time}} <b>drift</b> for more conducting alloys, which have <b>drift</b> maxima at intermediate resistance. <b>Drift</b> dependence on programmed resistance, i. e. dependence on d vs. Ro and position of maxima of d vs. Ro. and d absolute value during <b>drift</b> depends dramatically on the composition of the phase change memory alloy material. In this paper we add new data and interpretation on the resistance <b>drift</b> and its nature: a) Not only amorphous parts of device might be responsible for <b>drift.</b> b) <b>Drift</b> might be caused not only by the phase change but also by electrical switching, which in turn is the consequence of electronic high current density filaments appearance.

5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the <b>drifts</b> were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow <b>drifts</b> down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E
5|$|An {{abandoned}} sailboat <b>drifts</b> into New York Harbor and is boarded by harbor patrol officers. One {{is killed}} by a zombie, which falls overboard after being shot by another officer. The police question the boat owner's daughter, Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), who claims she hasn't seen her father for months. At the morgue, the officer's corpse stirs. Anne meets journalist Peter West (Ian McCulloch), and the pair follows her father's trail to the Caribbean island Matul. En route, they befriend Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay), who are sailing around the area and agree {{to take them to}} Matul.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Turnout <b>Drift</b> Operating Envelope Calculation is to {{identify}} the design parameters of the typical turnout <b>drift</b> and advance the preliminary design of the typical turnout <b>drift.</b> The scope of this calculation requires the turnout <b>drift</b> geometry be identified in sufficient detail to provide input to develop a typical turnout <b>drift</b> design. This turnout <b>drift</b> design strategy {{will be used to}} develop a preliminary turnout <b>drift</b> design for each distinct grouping of turnout <b>drift</b> type. The calculation will define the operating envelope of the relevant interfaces such as the turnout <b>drift</b> invert and the ventilation door. This information will be used to describe the space allocation of the turnout <b>drift</b> components and operating equipment. The turnout <b>drift</b> is an elemental component of the subsurface repository design layout. Other elemental components are the emplacement <b>drift,</b> the access mains, the exhaust mains, and ventilation shafts. This calculation will describe the fundamental dimensions and geometry of a turnout <b>drift</b> and will serve as a basis for subsequent detailed design...|$|R

5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck <b>drifts,</b> the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drifting</b> {{has evolved}} into a {{competitive}} sport where drivers compete (almost exclusively in rear-wheel-drive cars) to earn points from judges based on various factors. At the top levels of competition, the D1 Grand Prix in Japan pioneered the sport. Others such as IDC (Irish <b>Drift</b> Championship) in Ireland, Formula D in the United States, World <b>Drift</b> GP formerly <b>Drift</b> Allstars, King of Europe and the British <b>Drift</b> Championship in Europe, WDS in China, RDS in Russia, Formula <b>Drift</b> Asia in the Malaysia/Singapore/Thailand/Indonesia, NZ <b>Drift</b> Series in New Zealand, Australian <b>Drifting</b> Grand Prix and Greek <b>Drift</b> Championship (<b>Drift</b> Wars) have come along to further expand it into a legitimate motor sport worldwide. The drivers within these series were are able to keep their cars sliding for extended periods of time, often linking several turns.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{most amazing}} {{has been the}} South Sea <b>Drift.</b> Blind, fortuitous, {{precarious}} as no other <b>drift</b> has been, nevertheless the islands in that waste of ocean have received <b>drift</b> after <b>drift</b> of the races. Down from the mainland of Asia poured an Aryan <b>drift</b> that built civilisations in Ceylon, Java, and Sumatra. Only the monuments of these Aryans remain. They themselves have perished utterly, though not until after leaving evidences of their <b>drift</b> clear across the great South Pacific to far Easter Island. And on that <b>drift</b> they encountered races who had accomplished the <b>drift</b> before them, and they, the Aryans, passed, in turn, before the <b>drift</b> of other and subsequent races whom we to-day call the Polynesian and the Melanesian.|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} 17th century coal was largely {{obtained}} by excavating the outcrops and driving <b>drifts</b> which followed the seam into the ground. Only {{small amounts of}} coal could be obtained by these methods and bell pits were also dug. These were vertical pits, with a 4feet (1.2m) diameter shaft up to 60feet (18.3m) deep, which were opened out at the bottom. When all the coal that could safely be extracted from the pit had been recovered, another pit was sunk close by to intersect the seam and the waste from the second pit thrown into the first.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} English {{translation}} of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale {{opens with a}} beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and <b>drifts</b> on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company.|$|E
5|$|The {{peak in the}} {{brightness}} just inside of the Amalthea's orbit and, therefore, the vertical asymmetry the Amalthea gossamer ring {{may be due to}} the dust particles trapped at the leading (L4) and trailing (L5) Lagrange points of this moon. The particles may also follow horseshoe orbits between the Lagrangian points. The dust may be present at the leading and trailing Lagrange points of Thebe as well. This discovery implies that there are two particle populations in the gossamer rings: one slowly <b>drifts</b> in the direction of Jupiter as described above, while another remains near a source moon trapped in 1:1 resonance with it.|$|E
