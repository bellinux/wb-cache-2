MFGM material isolate from <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> contains various proteins and polar lipids (PLs) which are efficient natural surface-active materials that could be used as emulsifiers. However, in view of this use, the functional properties of the MFGM-specific proteins and PLs need to be investigated. Currently, the role of MFGM components and their possible interaction at the oil-water interface during emulsification is lacking. In addition, the combined effects of MFGM proteins and PLs on the surface characteristics and adsorption behavior at the interface have, so far, not been addressed. Therefore, the major accomplishments of this doctoral research are (i) giving a greater insight into the possibility of using MF for isolating MFGM materials from <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> and the efficiency of these MFGM materials as emulsifiers for improving the stability of emulsions, (ii) understanding of the separated roles of MFGM protein fraction and PL fraction and the possible interaction between PLs and membrane-specific proteins and their potential emulsifying properties and (iii) preliminary application of the MFGM materials isolated from <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> as a novel ingredient for improving the whipping properties of recombined cream...|$|E

The use of enzyme technology may be an interesting strategy to convert whey into added-value products. The hydrolysis of whey proteins can generate bioactive peptides, which are described to perform physiological effects in vivo, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antihypertensive and antidiabetic activities. Bioactive peptides derived from whey proteins have been also associated with immunomodulatory, anticancer, opioid and hypocholesterolemic activities.

30|$|Paradoxically, the animals, {{which have}} always {{constituted}} the plurality of the island's inhabitants - estimated livestock population of over 566, 000, {{with a human}} population of over 44, 000 (see Elie [2014 b]) - and represented {{the foundation of the}} communal economy, have never been the objects of production for an external market. In fact, the primary aim of pastoralism in Soqotra - with its complex system of livestock management encompassing the repertoire of know-how of animal husbandry, which initially motivated Soqotrans' acquisition and accumulation of an encyclopaedic compendium of ethno-botanical knowledge about the island's environmental resources (see Miller and Morris [2004]) - is solely dedicated to the maximization of milk production. For example, `breeding females constitute the main age and sex group for all ruminant species'[which] ensure that the conversion of available range vegetation to milk is maximized' (EU [2000 b]: 2 - 10; Morris [2002]: 310). Pastoralism in Soqotra has persisted as a milk-subsistent livelihood. This is partly a legacy of the production of butter oil as export commodity, which was once a thriving cottage industry on the island. Soqotrans had developed a menu of <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products,</b> as the large quantity of available milk was transformed into, at least, seven milk by-products, as a means of preserving and extending consumption. The availability of the full range of milk by-products epitomized the Soqotrans' notion of baraka, as it symbolized nature's largess in terms of rain and pastures. Today, however, milk consumption is merely a seasonal delicacy, and the amount available allows, at the most, three <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products.</b> Nevertheless, meat production is not entirely neglected as it is pursued through the following practices: in the case of goats and sheep, young male stocks are reared for about 3 months for sale in the local market; mature female animals that have lost their breeding capacity are sold as well; in the case of cattle, some young males are reared for about 6 months or castrated and reared for 3 to 4 years for sale to the army base or for wedding ceremonies (EU [2000 b]).|$|E
40|$|Practically {{all of the}} 85, 000 hogs on {{the farms}} of Utah (as of August 1, 1934) are in the {{irrigated}} sections of the state where they fit in well with dairying. Utah, however, is a hog-deficient area and produces about 109, 000 hogs less than are slaughtered in the state for its own use. Large amounts of milk by-products such as skim milk, buttermilk, and whey are produced in Utah. Large amounts of alfalfa are also grown in the irrigated sections, thus providing excellent pasture for the growing out and feeding of market hogs. Barley is the principal feeding grain grown in this state. Much wheat, however, is grown, which {{in recent years has}} been fed extensively to livestock.

Using hyperconcentrated sweet whey led to enhanced multistress tolerance acquisition, overexpression of key stress proteins, and accumulation of intracellular storage molecules and compatible solutes, as well as enhanced survival upon spray drying. A simplified process from growth to spray drying of propionibacteria was developed using sweet whey as a 2 -in- 1 medium to both culture P. freudenreichii and protect it from heat and osmotic injury without harvesting and washing steps.

In this review, fermentation of lactose to ethanol is discussed, focusing on wild lactose-fermenting yeasts, particularly Kluyveromyces marxianus, and recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The early efforts in the screening and characterization of the fermentation properties of wild lactose-consuming yeasts are reviewed.

The objective of this review is to identify the main African dairy products, mainly focussing on typical production processes based on the use of local animal resources. To this aim, dairy products were classified into five categories, according to the type and the production method: fresh cheese, ripened cheese, fermented milk, butter and <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products.</b> These categories give rise to an extraordinary range of local products where tradition, culture, and environmental conditions and constraints {{play a major role in}} contributing to this diversification. In some countries, some attempts are being made in order to valorise the local dairy products by establishing Slow Food Presidia or including them in the Ark of Taste compiled by Slow Food. One of the main constraints that limits the commercialisation and export of African dairy products is related to the scarce hygiene in milk production and processing, and the frequent absence of starter cultures, which result in products with non-standardised characteristics, short shelf life and high spoilage susceptibility, with consequent risks for human health. Efforts should be made to support the dairy products chain in Africa, by making production processes safer and by valuing local resources, in order to expand the internal market and the export opportunities.

40|$|Irregular pagination: missing pages 131, 133 The {{results of}} a recent Nationwide survey (Davenport 1966) showed that 93 % of all pig units were still {{dependent}} on supplies of liquid <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> - whey and skim milk - for their major source of pig food. Calculations made from figures for cheese and casein production (N. Z. Govt. Statistics, 1967) show that in 1966, approximately 500 million gallons of whey alone, were produced. Of this, a comparatively small amount is utilized by the dairy industry to produce alternative by-products. Condensed or dried whey production involves the costly removal of large volumes of water. This necessarily results in a high price to the consumer, and consequently a low consumer demand. The quantities of lactose produced are unlikely to increase appreciably as {{there is only a}} limited demand for this sugar, and it is still too early to tell whether current research into alternative uses for the whey, such as the production of food yeast (Chapman, 1966), will make significant inroads into the very large whey surpluses. It is clear that the conversion of these surpluses into pigmeat is still the most profitable single outlet for a large amount of the whey produced. On the basis of calculations similar to those made by Owtram, (1961) full utilization of the whey produced in 1966 if fed alone, could yield up to 19, 000 tons of pigmeat.

The objective ofthis study was then to characterize {{the efficiency of the}} skimming of industrial buttermilk and butter serum and todetermine its consequences on the lipid composition and microstructure of related products. This work clearlyshows that the efficiency of the skimming step, operated both at pilot and industrial scales, is never complete anddepends on the characteristics of the fluids to be treated. There exists a threshold of lipid content (7 % total lipidsin drymatter for buttermilk; 20 % for butter serum) under which the skimming is not efficient. Above this thresholdof lipid content, the skimming step removes all particles with a size larger than 1 μm(large fatglobules,butter fines),but does not succeed in removing small size lipid fraction (fragments of membrane, lipid vesicles), which results inan increase in the polar lipids on total lipid ratio for both products (up to 20 ± 5 % and 49 ± 6 % for buttermilks andbutter serums respectively). The difference of skimming efficiency, threshold values of skimming, and compositionof final products between the buttermilks and butter serums could be attributed to differences in themicrostructureof the lipids.

Today over the 25 % of the whey produced in the European Union is used for human consumption but after extraction and concentration of the protein fraction it becomes a by-product. Due to the reduced availability of fossil fuels, bio-hydrogen production can actually represent a future prospect of renewable energy. The ability of growing and producing hydrogen was demonstrated for the Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 type strain and for its pSOL 1 deficient mutant Mu 56, using deproteinized whey derived from Grana Padano cheese production as substrate. The mutant Mu 56 lacks the 210 -Kb plasmid pSOL 1 which carries the genes responsible for acetone and butanol production. This causes the interruption of the solventogenic pathway and the redirection of the electrons flow toward the production of hydrogen, with the consequent increasing in its yield. The loss of the pSOL 1 megaplasmid in Mu 56 was demonstrated by PCR and southern blot and it was confirmed by genome analysis. Genome-wide analyses also identified a number of mutations occurring during the 56 sub-culturing steps employed for plasmid curing. The higher yield achieved in deproteinized whey from the C. acetobutylicum Mu 56, compared to the parent strain DSM 792, was demonstrated using two independent analysis: the BHP and the water displacement methods.

In general, core subsistence activities are {{the responsibility of}} men (e.g. herdinga, milking, date farming and fishing), while the auxiliary ones belong to women (e.g. all household chores: water and wood collecting, cooking, milk churning, horticulture, rug weaving, pottery making). However, this gendered division concerning the performance of core vs. auxiliary chores, alternated in response to historically induced changes in the rural economy. For example, herding was principally, but not exclusively, a male activity as well as milking, but the processing of milk into different <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products,</b> but most importantly butter oil, which was the pillar of the pastoral economy, was a female activity. With the discontinuation of the export of butter oil that followed {{the demise of the}} Sultanate, and the increasing importance of fishing encouraged by the succeeding Socialist administration in the 1970 s, herding, and even the milking of animals, at least in some places and during the extended absence of men (as milking remains taboo for womenb in certain parts, as in the central mountain region in contrast to the southern coastal plains), and milk churning for the preparation of hilub (butter milk) was taken up by men, at least in some places. I witnessed one instance of this in the village of Aduno in the central internal valleys. This reallocation of task within the household was due to the seasonal migration of men to the coast for fishing and to their frequent search for odd jobs in response to the increasingly cash exigent economy.

40|$|Abstract Postweaning {{diarrhea}} (PWD) is {{a significant}} enteric disease causing considerable economic losses for the pig industry. Among several aetiological risk factors, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) {{is considered to be}} a major cause. After being routinely used for several decades to control bacterial disease outbreaks in piglet, the use of antibiotics at subtherapeutic concentrations has been banned in the European Union because of the increasing prevalence of resistance to antibiotics in pigs. The removal of in-feed antibiotics from piglet diets has negative economic consequences as it dramatically increases the rate of morbidity and mortality due to ETEC as well as the use of antibiotics for therapeutic purposes. Other than subtherapeutic antibiotics, zinc oxide (ZnO) had been reported to ameliorate and/or prevent the development of PWD in piglets, but its excretion may have negative impacts on the environment. Thus, other alternatives that control ETEC infections in piglets postweaning will be of great advantage. A number of nutritional strategies have been proposed as alternative means of preventing ETEC infections, of which feeding dairy-based products to piglets could be one of such strategies. It is apparent that colostrums, milk and milk fractions such as whey and casein contain several biologically active compounds with anti-microbial and immunomodulatory properties. Recently, these dairy products and their isolated compounds such as lactoferrin and oligosaccharides have been employed as anti-infective agents against ETEC infections in iglets postweaning. The <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> (e. g. whey or whey permeate) may also be fermented to further improve the anti-infective potential of the products. Overall, the anti-infective activities of dairy-based products against ETEC could be attributed to the improvement of the intestinal barrier functions, microbial ecosystem and immunity of the piglets.

40|$|Pig meat {{production}} in New Zealand {{has traditionally been}} associated with the dairy industry, relying upon <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> (principally skim-milk and whey) as major sources of protein and energy for pig feed. However, export market prospects for milk protein led to the diversification of dairy factory products, such as the ultra-filtration of whey protein and lactose extraction of whey. The prevailing economic climate also encouraged dairy farmers to change to whole milk,anker collection and large numbers of the supplementary pig enterprises were closed down. Despite fluctuations, market prices generally showed an increase and many farmers began investigating alternative food supplies in order to take advantage of these higher prices. Garbage and other edible waste provided only limited scope for expansion, and the main alternative appeared to be the use of cereal grains. The New Zealand pig industry, in the last 5 - 10 years, has therefore begun to move towards a specialised form of production based upon the use of diets containing a predominance of cereals, similar to what has prevailed in many overseas countries for a longer period. The local report of Kingma and Ryan (1971) illustrates the need for efficiency in the high cost system of production based upon meal feeding. Where skimmilk is the principal ingredient in the ration, the supply of dietary protein is generally adequate due to the high nutritive value of the protein in this feedstuff. However, when the major source of nutrients comes from cereal grains, although these provide a concentrated source of energy, the poor balance of amino acids becomes limiting to the utilization of such rations. In New Zealand there is a restricted range of feeds high in protein and suitable for incorporation into pig rations. They include skimmilk powder, buttermilk powder, meat meal, meat and bone meal, liver meal and fish meal.

Mixotrophic cultivation of C. vulgaris using the main <b>dairy</b> industry <b>by-product</b> could be considered a feasible alternative to reduce the costs of microalgal biomass production, since it does not require the addition of expensive carbohydrates to the culture mediumThis study was supported by the grants SFRH/BD/ 44724 / 2008 (Bruno Fernandes) and SFRH/BPD/ 44935 / 2008 (Giuliano Dragone) from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portugal).

25|$|Apart from gas fields, an {{alternative}} {{method of obtaining}} methane is via biogas generated by the fermentation of organic matter including manure, wastewater sludge, municipal solid waste (including landfills), or any other biodegradable feedstock, under anaerobic conditions. Rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth. Methane hydrates/clathrates (ice-like combinations of methane and water on the sea floor, found in vast quantities) are a potential future source of methane. Cattle belch methane accounts for 16% of the world's annual methane emissions to the atmosphere. One study reported that the livestock sector in general (primarily cattle, chickens, and pigs) produces 37% of all human-induced methane. Early research has found a number of medical treatments and dietary adjustments that help slightly limit the production of methane in ruminants. A 2009 study found that at a conservative estimate, at least 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the life cycle and supply chain of livestock products, meaning all meat, <b>dairy,</b> and <b>by-products,</b> and their transportation. More recently, a 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44 percent of human-induced methane and 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production and trap the gas to use as energy.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{prerequisite}} {{to the economic}} prosperity of an agricultural company specializing in dairy cows is maximum production of milk and, by extension, <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> at minimal production costs. In order to achieve {{that it is necessary}} to have dairy cows with the potential to reach optimal dairy production in the conditions of the given agricultural company. The objective of this paper is to assess the effect of genotype, lactation sequence, and age of the dairy cow at first calving on the parameters of her milk productivity. Our monitoring was conducted at a company named CIZ-AGRO, a. s., Cizkrajov. For our analysis, we used productivity data measured from October 2012 to February 2015, during which the cows ended at least one lactation period lasting 240 305 days. These input parameters were collected from a total of 495 dairy cows that had ended a total of 997 lactations. The compilation of lactations was subsequently sorted out by genotype and lactation sequence, and thereupon by genotype and age of the dairy cows at first calving. Thus classified groups were assessed by average milk production, dairy fat, milk protein per lactation, and percentage content of fat and protein in their milk. The obtained results were thereupon subjected to a statistical analysis. The highest average milk productivity per lactation (9283 liters) was achieved by dairy cows in the group H 100 that calved first at the age of over 27 months; the lowest milk (6239. 2 liters) was recorded with a C 100 heifer. In the group classified by lactation sequence, the differences were not statistically significant, the groups classified by the age at first calving, the differences were less significant statistically (P< 0. 05). Evaluation of the percentage content of milk components as well as the overall production of milk components per lactation in the group of lactations classified by genotype and lactation sequence, there were no statistically significant differences between the individual groups identified. In the group of lactations classified by genotype and age at first calving, the result showed less significant differences (P< 0. 05) between the group evaluated by total milk fat productivity and milk protein content per lactation. Monitoring the percentage content of fat in the milk in relation to the genotype and age of the dairy cow at first calving recorded medium level of statistically significant differences between the groups (P< 0. 01) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an econometric {{investigation of the}} New Zealand, pig-meat market over the period 1969 to 1979. The objective {{of the study is}} to provide policy-makers within the pig industry with a model of their industry {{that can be used to}} improve their ability to anticipate and respond to problems facing the industry. In particular, the study is concerned with providing policy-makers with a tool which can be used to improve their ability to reduce instability in the pig-meat market. The transition from dairy by-product to grain ration feeding of pigs appears to have aggravated price and production instability in the industry and this problem is now major concern of policy-makers. This study describes the impact of the transition from <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products</b> to grain ration feeding of pigs as well as the causes and consequences of the associated increase in production and price instability. A 20 equation model of the market is specified that describes production, consumption, price formation, imports, exports and stock changes at various levels of disaggregation. This model is estimated using quarterly data for the period 1968 (fourth quarter) to 1979 (second quarter) and the two stage principal components estimating procedure. The estimated model is evaluated using simulation analysis. In most respects the performance of the model described in this study is satisfactory. It is able to reproduce cyclic behaviour when all of the exogenous variables are held at a fixed level. These cycles are convergent with a mean length of approximately 3. 5 years. Although the model does have some problems associated with it, it is useful to policymakers in its present form. Model forecasts should be accurate enough to improve policy-makers' ability to predict many of the important market variables. The model should also prove useful in evaluating the implications of alternative future scenarios as well as the impact of alternative policy decisions on the market. The staff of the Pork Marketing Board have already begun to use the model as an aid to policy making in the industry. Over the last nine months the model has primarily been used to provide quarterly forecasts and to evaluate the impact of alternative scenarios (e. g. increases in feed-grain prices) in the slightly longer term. Interest is also being shown in using the model to evaluate alternative policies under consideration by policy-makers. Research currently underway should help to overcome some of the problems associated with the model and, therefore, extend its usefulness as a policy tool...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{application}} of HACCP principles in dairy production systems for mitigation of potential water related hazards by control measures and legislation applicable at farm level. HACCP logical sequence approach including some principles of environmental risk assessment was the method used for the present study (FAO/IDF, 2004;Horchner et al., 2006). Literature review, farms visits, interviews, informal questionnaires and confirmation on site of the gathered information were the prerequisites of the study. Four flow diagrams in SA and three in Benin were drawn to describe the 11 steps relating the activities of the seven types of dairy farming systems recorded altogether in these countries (FAO/IDF, 2004,McCrindle, 2007). From the flow diagrams, almost three groups of 30 potential hazards were identified. Biological, chemical and physical hazards were characterized and their effects described according to the source, pathways, mechanisms, of water pollution. It was noticed that water use during farming activities is linked to the number of animals and is an important factor to qualify the magnitude of the risk of water pollution. Critical Control Points (CCPs) were identified. In SA, national legislation includes legal prerequisites for commercial dairy farming systems (SA GOVERNMENT 2005, 2006, 2007). Although water resources policies, strategies, legislation and management are strongly established, their implementation does not clearly include <b>dairy</b> <b>by-products.</b> In Benin dairy production strategy and development started in 2000. Basic legislation relating water resources is being updated. In commercial farming systems (F 1 and F 2 in SA), F 7 in Benin, biological and chemical potential hazards are the main threat to water quality. Direct or indirect source of contamination due to manure, feces, urine, chemicals and stock remedies, waste water, occurs through husbandry practices (milking), pasture and housing. In SA, farmers are aware of International dairy standards, norms and practices such as GAP, GMP and GHP even if the practices are not completely respected. HACCP is not well yet well implemented at producer level althougth some commercial dairy processors have started the implementation of the system (FEDICS, 2004, CEBENOR, 2007). Environmental care (CCP 11 and CCP 12) are the main critical control points recorded which are not mitigated by the national legislation in both countries. In regard to traditional farming systems (F 3, F 4) and in SA, (F 5, F 6) in Benin, national legislation does not include prerequisites for biological and physical hazards; these are the main threat of water pollution and are due to direct or indirect contamination through drinking and grazing. Chemical hazards are not important because inputs of stock remedies are low in these systems. Farmers are not aware of International dairy standards, norms and practices such as GAP, GMP and GHP which are fairly respected. HACCP is unknown at producer level. CCPs relating animal treatment and care are partly mitigated by the national legislation. Stock remedies, drugs residues and Pharmaceuticals are controlled in both countries although Benin faces the introduction of uncontrolled veterinary drugs through illegal frontiers. The majority of the CCPs are not completely mitigated by national legislation for traditional dairy farms in both countries. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Taurine, a {{sulfonated}} {{amino acid}} derived from methionine and cysteine metabolism, {{has been identified}} as a major player in numerous biological functions. The distribution of taurine among <b>dairy</b> products, their <b>by-products</b> and waste was followed during different cheese-making processes based on goat's milk. The results obtained showed that, compared with the amount of taurine present in the starting milk, the biggest proportion of taurine was found in whey while only 12. 5 - 16. 5 % was found in the goats' cheeses. Besides, a significantly higher content of taurine was found in Cacioricotta goats' cheese, obtained from milk after initial heating at 95 degrees C for 5 min, than in Caprino goat's cheese, obtained from milk heated at lower temperatures, thus highlighting the role of thermal treatment for taurine retention. The findings indicated the opportunity of recovering taurine from whey...|$|R
40|$|The paper uses Actor Network Theory and {{the field}} of market studies to take a processual and {{relational}} approach to the alternative/mainstream food duality. Questions about how food systems or products make claim {{to be of the}} alternative or mainstream, and to what consequence, underpin the study. Analysis traces the making and shaping of two market versions for male <b>dairy</b> calves, a <b>by-product</b> of the <b>dairy</b> industry, often treated as ‘waste’ in the UK. Analysis focuses on the assemblage of actors, the breaking of matters of fact and shaping and communication of concerns, and at actions. Contra many approaches to the alternative, focus is paid to overlap between systems, knowledge and actors and simultaneous development of two products. From this, the ethicality of the mainstream, the continued duality and its consequences are discussed. Beyond seeing mainstream/alternative as co-constituted constructs, the two are symbiotic, mutually supportive and implicated in the circuit of culinary capital...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{exploring}} new microbial sources of extracellular β-d-galactosidase (EC. 3. 2. 1. 23), Alternaria alternata was found to excrete elevated quantities of a thermostable form of the enzyme when cultivated in whey growth medium. Optimum cultural conditions for maximum enzyme production were a whey lactose concentration of 6 %, supplementation of the medium with 0. 050 M (NH 4) 2 SO 4, an inoculum size of 103 conidia per ml, and a cultivation time at 28 to 30 °C of 5 days. The fungus utilized whey lactose {{for the production of}} the enzyme most efficiently, and the observed maximum yield, 280 nanokatals of hydrolyzed o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside per g of whey lactose, was comparable to maximum yields reported for certain commercial fungi. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzymatic reaction were 4. 5 to 5. 5 and 60 to 70 °C, respectively, and the enzyme lost half of its activity when heated at 65 °C for 84 min. These properties make the enzyme particularly suitable for processing acid and less-acid (pH 5 to 6) <b>dairy</b> products and <b>by-products...</b>|$|R
