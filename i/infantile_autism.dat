40|$|Reduced folate {{transport}} to the CNS was identified in two autism spectrum disorders, i. e., Rett syndrome and <b>infantile</b> low-functioning <b>autism</b> with neurological abnormalities. Twenty-five patients with early-onset low-functioning autism {{with or without}} neurological deficits, were evaluated for serum folate, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 MTHF), and serum FR autoantibodies of the blocking type to determine the significance of folate receptor (FR) autoantibodies with respect to folate transport across the blood-CSF barrier. In spite of normal serum folate, CSF 5 MTHF was low in 23 of 25 patients. The reduced CSF folate in 19 of these 23 patients {{could be explained by}} serum FR autoantibodies blocking the folate binding site of the membrane-attached FR on the choroid epithelial cells. Oral folinic acid supplements led to normal CSF 5 MTHF and partial or complete clinical recovery after 12 months.

Controls were employed to evaluate potential biases in VAERS. Evaluations as to whether whole-cell and acellular vaccines were administered to populations of similar age and sex were undertaken because these factors might influence the study’s results. Statistical increases were observed for all events examined following whole-cell pertussis vaccination in comparison to acellular pertussis vaccination, excepting cerebellar ataxia. Reporting biases were minimal in VAERS, and whole-cell and acellular pertussis vaccines were administered to populations of similar age and sex.

5000|$|In 1949, Kanner {{published}} another notable study, [...] "Problems of Nosology and Psychodynamics of Early Infantile Autism*." [...] Kanner {{explored the}} issues surrounding [...] "early infantile autism" [...] {{as it moved}} from having a well-defined symptomatology to being ready for a place in psychiatric nosology. Kanner focused on how early <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> was related and unrelated to the [...] "intrinsic nature" [...] of other conditions such as dementia infantilis and childhood schizophrenia. While early <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> and childhood schizophrenia have virtually identical symptoms, Kanner argued that they differ in onset.

Kanner reported that the babies with early <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> were unusually apathetic, did not respond normally to people, did not assume proper posture to be picked up, startled at anything that disrupts their isolation, and lacked responsiveness. Kanner raised doubts about the necessity of separating <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> entirely from the schizophrenias because it can be considered as [...] "the earliest possible manifestation of childhood schizophrenia." [...] Unlike his other studies, Kanner decided to focus closely on the adult parents of the children and found something an intriguing pattern. Most of the adult parents had extremely successful careers: scientists, college professors, artists, clergymen, and business executives. In fact, Kanner had trouble finding autistic children of unsophisticated parents. This sparked Kanner's curiosity about the attitudes of the parents and the relationship dynamic between the parents and the children. He found that most of the parents had unaffectionate, mechanical relationships with their autistic children and would oftentimes dismiss them entirely. Kanner concluded that this unaffectionate dynamic potentially causes the autistic children to turn away and [...] "seek comfort in solitude." [...] He even argued that the children's obsessive preoccupations and remarkable memory feats represent [...] "a plea for parental approval." ...|$|E

Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably [...] "autistic aloneness" [...] and [...] "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.

50|$|Of {{the five}} PDD forms, Asperger {{syndrome}} {{is closest to}} autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or sometimes the autistic disorders, whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or <b>infantile</b> <b>autism.</b> In this article, autism refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, autism, ASD, and PDD are often used interchangeably.

5000|$|The reasons Leon Eisenberg {{is listed}} as a famous figure in world and American {{psychiatry}} are numerous; here are eight select reasons. Leon Eisenberg identified rapid return to school {{as the key to}} treatment in the management of the separation anxiety underlying school phobia. He completed the first outcome study of autistic children in adolescence and recognized patterns of language use as the best predictor of prognosis. Of the two first studies of the outcome of <b>infantile</b> <b>autism,</b> he reported the American study in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1956, and the UK study was reported in JCPP shortly afterward by Victor Lotter and Sir Michael Rutter. That was a time when a narrow rather than a broad definition of autism was in fashion. It is of interest that the poor prognosis was evident both in the narrowly and broadly defined cases and that, because many of the cases now called autistic would have been called [...] "mental retardation: moderate to severe", they would have joined other such children with a relatively poor outcome.|$|E

5000|$|Rimland {{published}} his book, Infantile Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior, in 1964. Its foreword, by Leo Kanner, {{the man who}} first identified autism as a syndrome, gave the book credibility among professionals in the field. It was an about-turn for Kanner, the originator of the word [...] "autism" [...] and of the [...] "refrigerator mother" [...] theory; through his observations and research, Kanner {{had come to believe}} that autism had a neurological cause—the accepted view in the medical profession today. But at the time Rimland's book was published, and for many years afterwards, a common theory was that autism was caused by unloving 'refrigerator mothers', an unproven but widely accepted idea most famously propounded by University of Chicago professor Bruno Bettelheim, notably in his book The Empty Fortress: <b>Infantile</b> <b>Autism</b> and the Birth of the Self (1967), which claimed that the traumatized unloved child retreated into autism. As a professional research psychologist, Rimland was well positioned to launch the first major attack on Bettelheim's theory. Rimland's was the first authoritative voice to dispute Bettelheim's research and call into question his conclusions.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, a {{revision}} to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) {{was presented in}} the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5), released May 2013. The new diagnosis encompasses previous diagnoses of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and PDD-NOS. Compared with the DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, the DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD no longer includes communication as a separate criterion, and has merged social interaction and communication into one category. Slightly different diagnostic definitions are used in other countries. For example, the ICD-10 is the most commonly-used diagnostic manual in the UK. Rather than categorizing these diagnoses, the DSM-5 has adopted a dimensional approach to diagnosing disorders that fall underneath the autism spectrum umbrella. Some have proposed that individuals on the autism spectrum may be better represented as a single diagnostic category. Within this category, the DSM-5 has proposed a framework of differentiating each individual by dimensions of severity, as well as associated features (i.e., known genetic disorders, and intellectual disability). Another change to the DSM includes collapsing social and communication deficits into one domain. Thus, an individual with an ASD diagnosis will be {{described in terms of}} severity of social communication symptoms, severity of fixated or restricted behaviors or interests, and associated features. The restricting of onset age has also been loosened from 3 years of age to [...] "early developmental period", with a note that symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities. Autism forms the core of the autism spectrum disorders. Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; unlike autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no significant delay in language development, according to the older DSM-4 criteria. PDD-NOS is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Some sources also include Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, which share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; other sources differentiate them from ASD, but group all of the above conditions into the pervasive developmental disorders. Autism, Asperger syndrome, and PDD-NOS are sometimes called the autistic disorders instead of ASD, whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder, childhood autism, or <b>infantile</b> <b>autism.</b> Although the older term pervasive developmental disorder and the newer term autism spectrum disorder largely or entirely overlap, the earlier was intended to describe a specific set of diagnostic labels, whereas the latter refers to a postulated spectrum disorder linking various conditions. ASD is a subset of the broader autism phenotype (BAP), which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact.|$|E

Alcohol consumption was obtained by self-report during pregnancy. Information on ASD {{was obtained from the}} Danish Central Psychiatry Register. Follow-up ended February 2008. Data was analysed by means of Cox regression. Results: In total 401 children were diagnosed with ASD and 157 with <b>infantile</b> <b>autism.</b> No association was found between average alcohol consumption and ASD or <b>infantile</b> <b>autism,</b> respectively. For binge drinking, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for ASD was 0. 72 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 53 to 0. 97) among women who binge drank once during pregnancy compared to women who did not binge drink. The corresponding HR for <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> was 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 36 to 1. 02). However, the hazard ratio for ASD was 0. 84 (95 % CI: 0. 51 to 1. 36) when restricting the analysis to first-time pregnancies conceived within 6 months of trying. No estimate was made for <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> due to low number of cases. No association was seen for more than one binge episode and for the timing of binge drinking. Conclusion: Our findings do not support that a low prenatal alcohol exposure increases the risk of ASD or <b>infantile</b> <b>autism.</b> The lower risk for women who binge drank once during pregnancy is most likely non-causal.

Infectious disease {{is the most common}} path to maternal immune activation during pregnancy. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the occurrence of common infections, febrile episodes, and use of antibiotics reported by the mother during pregnancy and the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> in the offspring. METHODSWe used a population-based cohort consisting of 96 736 children aged 8 to 14 years and born from 1997 to 2003 in Denmark. Information on infection, febrile episodes, and use of antibiotics was self-reported through telephone interviews during pregnancy and early postpartum. Diagnoses of ASD and <b>infantile</b> <b>autism</b> were retrieved from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register; 976 children (1 %) from the cohort were diagnosed with ASD. RESULTSOverall, we found little evidence that various types of mild common infectious diseases or febrile episodes during pregnancy were associated with ASD/infantile autism. However, our data suggest that maternal influenza infection was associated with a twofold increased risk of <b>infantile</b> <b>autism,</b> prolonged episodes of fever caused a threefold increased risk of <b>infantile</b> <b>autism,</b> and use of various antibiotics during pregnancy were potential risk factors for ASD/infantile autism. CONCLUSIONSOur results do not suggest that mild infections, febrile episodes, or use of antibiotics during pregnancy are strong risk factors for ASD/infantile autism. The results may be due to multiple testing; the few positive findings are potential chance findings. AVU 3 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 06 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23147969 PMC 445106...|$|E
