5|$|Past Lone Pine, {{the highway}} passes by Manzanar National Historic Site, a {{concentration}} camp where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II. The next community is Independence, the county seat of Inyo County and the home to the Eastern California Museum. Just north is the small Fort Independence <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation</b> and the Tinemaha Reservoir. Nearby is where the Los Angeles Aqueduct is tapped from the Owens River; with more vegetation visible north of this point. In {{this portion of the}} valley is Big Pine and the Big Pine <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> From here to Bishop the highway is overlapped with SR 168.|$|E

50|$|State courts do {{not have}} {{jurisdiction}} over criminal cases arising on <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations</b> even if those reservations are located in their state. Less serious crimes on <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations</b> are prosecuted in tribal courts. A large share of violent crimes that are prosecuted in federal court arise on <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations</b> or federal property, where state courts lack jurisdiction, since tribal court jurisdiction is usually limited to less serious offenses. Federal crimes on federal property in a state are often defined with reference to state criminal law.|$|R
5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the Lac Courte Oreilles <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation,</b> and Lac du Flambeau <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> The La Pointe Band {{was given a}} reservation at Bad River around the Band's traditional wild ricing grounds on the south shore of Lake Superior, and some reserved land for fishing grounds at the eastern tip of Madeline Island. In Minnesota, the reservations for the Fond du Lac and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band. In Michigan, reservations for the Lac Vieux Desert, Ontonagon and L'Anse bands were established. The St. Croix and Sokaogon bands left the negotiations in protest and {{were excluded from the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|At the Pennsylvania {{state line}} in South Valley, PA346 exits the Allegheny National Forest and becomes NY280 upon {{entering}} New York. The route heads {{north along the}} eastern edge of the Allegheny Reservoir as East Bank Perimeter Road, clipping the southwestern corner of Allegany State Park prior to entering the Allegany <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> NY280 passes in and out of the park once more before turning to the east toward Quaker Lake as it enters the town of Coldspring. At Quaker Lake, NY280 penetrates the park boundary once more and intersects Allegany State Park Route3 (ASP Route3) at the Quaker Run entrance. Here, NY280 turns north, traversing a small waterway separating Quaker Lake from the reservoir before reentering the Allegany <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation</b> limits.|$|E

50|$|This {{case had}} an {{extraordinary}} {{effect on the}} adjudication of Indian reserved water rights, though some legal scholars argue that it was never intended to apply to <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations.</b> Elizabeth McCallister argued in 1976 American Indian Law Review article that legislative history shows proponents of the bill were more concerned with adjudication of individual water rights against the United States, rather than claims against <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations.</b> In fact, the acting secretary of the Interior at the time argued such a law should only be enacted if it explicitly excluded <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations.</b>|$|R
5|$|On December 29, 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre {{occurred}} on the Pine Ridge <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Lakota Sioux Nation, the massacre resulted {{in the deaths of}} at least 146 Sioux, many of them women and children. 31 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the conflict.|$|E

5|$|SR76 {{then goes}} through Pala and the Pala <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation,</b> {{providing}} access to the Pala Casino and intersecting CR S16, the turnoff to the Pala Mission and Temecula. Continuing to parallel the San Luis Rey River, SR76 passes by the Wilderness Gardens County Park before entering the community of Pauma Valley and meeting the southern terminus of CR S7 (Nate Harrison Grade), a dirt road leading into Palomar Mountain State Park. SR76 intersects the southern leg of CR S6 (Valley Center Road), leading to Valley Center and Escondido. East of the small Yuima <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation,</b> it then encounters the northern leg of CRS6, the southern approach to the Palomar Observatory and Palomar Mountain State Park, {{as well as the}} community of La Jolla Amago. It then briefly passes through the Cleveland National Forest and meets the eastern terminus of CR S7, the eastern approach to Palomar Mountain. SR76 then passes along the shores of Lake Henshaw before terminating at the intersection with SR 79 at Morettis Junction, southeast of Lake Henshaw.|$|E

50|$|Maine {{contains}} three federally recognized <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations.</b> One of these, the Penobscot <b>Indian</b> Island <b>Reservation,</b> {{includes a}} very small amount of territory in Aroostook County. Maine currently treats <b>Indian</b> <b>reservations</b> as distinct entities, not part of any organized municipality or unorganized entity. This {{has not always been}} the case in the past; at one time, present-day reservation land was regarded as part of the municipalities or unorganized entities within which it is geographically located.|$|R
5|$|United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} upheld the {{constitutionality}} of the Major Crimes Act of 1885. This Congressional act gave the federal courts jurisdiction in certain cases of Indian-on-Indian crimes, even if the crimes were committed on an <b>Indian</b> <b>reservation.</b> Kagama, a Yurok Native American (Indian) accused of murder, was selected as a test case by the Department of Justice to test {{the constitutionality of}} the Act.|$|E
5|$|American {{exploration}} of the area began in 1851, when prospector Samuel Hancock was led by Indian guides on a canoe up the Stillaguamish River. The area was opened to logging after {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 between the United States government and the Stillaguamish tribe, who were relocated to trust lands and the Tulalip <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> The U.S. Army built a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, crossing the Stillaguamish River near the confluence.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, the Bannock {{people and}} {{northern}} Shoshone tribes {{participated in the}} Bannock War, a war against white settlers in the region over the destruction of camas root — {{a major source of}} food for the natives — by white settlers' hogs. The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the white settlers had won the war, the natives were allotted into various reservations. The Northern Paiute were sent to the Yakama <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation,</b> and in later years have been dispersed throughout several reservations in the western United States.|$|E

5|$|Marysville was {{established}} in 1872 by government-appointed Indian agent James P. Comeford, an Irish immigrant who {{had served in the}} Civil War, and his wife Maria as a trading post on the Tulalip <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> The reservation, located to the west of modern-day Marysville, {{was established}} by the Point Elliot Treaty of 1855, signed by local Native American tribes and territorial governor Isaac Stevens at modern-day Mukilteo. The treaty's signing opened most of Snohomish County to American settlement and commercial activities, including logging, fishing and trapping.|$|E
5|$|NY323 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY249 and CR9 {{north of the}} Cattaraugus <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation</b> in Brant. The route headed northward as Brant–Angola Road through a rural area dominated by open fields and forests. It proceeded to the Brant–Evans town line, where it met Cain Road (CR491) a short distance south of the New York State Thruway (I-90). The highway progressed onward, passing over the Thruway {{on its way to}} a junction with Dunfee Road, a connector leading to US20. NY323 met US20 itself a short distance to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|Public {{schools in}} Marysville are {{operated}} by the Marysville School District, which covers most of the incorporated city and the Tulalip <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> The district had an enrollment of approximately 10,804 students in 2013 and has 23 total schools, including two high schools (Marysville Pilchuck and Marysville Getchell), four middle schools, eleven elementary schools, and several alternative learning facilities. The school district {{was the site of}} the then-longest teacher strike in Washington state history in 2003, lasting for 49 days until the Snohomish County Superior Court declared the strike illegal.|$|E

Private property, property belonging {{to the state of}} Wyoming and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management form the eastern boundaries. Lastly, the Wind River <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation</b> also borders on the east, and bisects a smaller southern section which includes the Popo Agie Wilderness and the Washakie Ranger District.|$|E
5|$|The South Mountain Freeway, {{presently}} under construction, is a southerly bypass of Downtown Phoenix {{which will}} {{run along the}} southern edge of the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix and pass just to the south and west of South Mountain Park. It begins at the already complete traffic interchange of the Santan Freeway and Interstate 10. Heading west along the Pecos Road alignment through Ahwatukee, the freeway straddles the border with the Gila River <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation.</b> Turning northwest and eventually north, the freeway will follow the 59th and 55th Avenue alignments north to its terminus with Interstate 10 in west Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The park is {{bordered on}} the north by Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, and the Flathead Provincial Forest and Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park in British Columbia. To the west, the north fork of the Flathead River forms the western boundary, while its middle fork {{is part of the}} {{southern}} boundary. The Blackfeet <b>Indian</b> <b>Reservation</b> provides most of the eastern boundary. The Lewis and Clark and the Flathead National Forests form the southern and western boundary. The remote Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is located in the two forests immediately to the south.|$|E
