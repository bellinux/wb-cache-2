40|$|Abstract — Multi-channel {{communication}} protocols in wireless networks usually assume perfect orthogonality between wireless channels or consider only {{the use of}} interference-free channels. The first approach may overestimate the performance whereas the second approach may fail to utilize the spectrum efficiently. Therefore, a more realistic approach would be the careful use of <b>interfering</b> <b>channels</b> by controlling the interference at an acceptable level. We present a methodology to estimate the packet error rate (PER) due to inter-channel interference in a wireless network. The methodology experimentally characterizes the multi-channel interference and analytically estimates it based on the observations from the experiments. Furthermore, the analytical estimation is used in simulations to derive estimates of the capacity in larger networks. Simulation {{results show that the}} achievable network capacity, which is defined as the number of simultaneous transmissions, significantly increases with realistic <b>interfering</b> <b>channels</b> compared with the use of only orthogonal channels. When we consider the same number of channels, the achievable capacity with realistic <b>interfering</b> <b>channels</b> can be close to the capacity of idealistic orthogonal channels. This shows that overlapping channels which constitute a much smaller band, provides more efficient use of the spectrum. Finally, we explore the correctness of channel orthogonality and show why this assumption may fail in a practical setting. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} joint channel-estimation method for the desired and <b>interfering</b> <b>channels</b> for cell edge users in reuse- 1 {{orthogonal}} frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) cellular systems. The following assumptions {{are made in}} proposing the algorithm: 1) The desired and interferer’s channel multipath delays do not overlap; 2) the same pilot sequence is sent from the desired and interfering base stations (BSs); and 3) reuse- 3 preamble symbols, as in the preamble structure in IEEE 802. 16 d/e (Wimax) systems, are used to obtain initial channel estimates without interference. If we make these assumptions, then {{it is possible to}} estimate the desired and <b>interfering</b> <b>channels,</b> even with reuse- 1 pilots. The proposed pilot-based channel estimation technique exploits the delay subspace structure to reduce the impact of cochannel interference (CCI) on channel estimation. Delay subspace refers to the set of basis vectors spanning the frequency response of the desired and <b>interfering</b> multipath <b>channels.</b> This enables us to jointly estimate and track the desired and <b>interfering</b> <b>channels</b> with a lower mean-squared error (MSE), when compared with the conventional modified least-squares (mLS) technique, which ignores the structure of interference. The significance of accurate channel estimates in symbol detection schemes is demonstrated for systems employing two or more receiver antennas. The proposed channel estimator significantly improves the performance of symbol-detection schemes based on either interference nulling combiner (INC) or minimum MSE diversity combiner (MMSE-DC), when compared with detection schemes using mLS-based channel estimates. Analytical expressions are derived for the MSE of the estimated multipath delays. Simulation results are also provided to show the improved performance for the proposed channel-estimation method compared with the mLS-based channel estimation method, when used in conjunction with INC and MMSE-DC detectors.
