25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing the price tag to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve <b>financial</b> <b>self-sufficiency.</b> A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E

2500|$|The Peel Commission of 1937 was {{the first}} to propose a two-state {{solution}} to the conflict, whereby Palestine would be divided into two states: one Arab state and one Jewish state. The Jewish state would include the coastal plain, Jezreel Valley, Beit She'an and the Galilee, while the Arab state would include Transjordan, Judea and Samaria, the Jordan Valley, and the Negev. The 2 main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation. The Arab leadership in Palestine rejected the conclusions and refused to share any land in Palestine with the Jewish population. The rejection of the Peel Commission's proposal by The Arabs led to the establishment of the Woodhead Commission.

40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Finance & Investment)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2013. This {{research}} work explores {{the risks that}} microfinance institutions (MFIs) face in their operations and the risk management strategies they adopt to mitigate their risks. Microfinance institutions serve some of the world’s most financially challenged population who otherwise would {{not have access to}} banking services. Risk management within the context of microfinance banking has gained importance within the last decade due partly to the fact that most MFIs are adopting business/profitability principles in their operations. Also, due to the recent financial crisis, MFI cannot afford to be indifferent to risk management practices in the battle for survival, <b>financial</b> sustainability and <b>self-sufficiency.</b> The data for this study is from both secondary and primary sources; 48 MFIs in Ghana responded to a questionnaire made up of 25 questions. Analysis of the responses obtained was done using Chi-Square test of equal proportions, P-values and other descriptive statistics. The Analysis found that the microfinance institutions surveyed are aware of the types of risk inherent in their line of business and do in varying ways employ some form of risk management strategies to mitigate losses and enhance profitability. Since credit granting stands {{at the core of the}} operations of MFIs, the management of risk as a result of the credits extended is crucial for their survival and profitability...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{brain drain}} {{is defined as}} the {{migration}} of health personnel from developing countries to developed countries and between industrialized nations in search for better opportunities. This phenomenon became a global growing concern due to its impact on both the donor and the destination countries. This article aims to present the main theoretical contributions starting from 1950 until today and the historical evolution, in the attempt of correlating the particular case of medical brain drain with the theory and evolution of the brain drain in general. This article raises questions and offers answers, identifies the main issues and looks for possible solutions {{in order to reduce the}} emigration of medical doctors. Factors of influence include push (low level of income, poor working conditions, the absence of job openings and social recognition, oppressive political climate) and pull (better remuneration and working conditions, prospects for career development, job satisfaction, security) factors. Developing countries are confronting with the loss of their most valuable intellectuals and the investment in their education, at the benefit of developed nations. An ethical debate arises as the disparities between countries increases, industrialized nations filling in the gaps in health systems with professionals from countries already facing shortages. However, recent literature emphasizes the possibility of a “beneficial brain drain” through education incentives offered by the emigration prospects. Other sources of “brain gain” for donor country are the remittances, the scientific networks and return migration. Measures to stem the medical brain drain involve the common effort and collaboration between developing and developed countries and international organizations. Measures adopted by donor countries include higher salaries, better working conditions, security, career opportunities, incentives to stimulate return migration. Destination countries could fight against the exodus of physicians through <b>self-sufficiency,</b> <b>financial</b> compensations paid for the skilled workforce coming from developing countries and agreements forbidding the recruitment of health professionals from countries already suffering of scarce resources. International organizations’ contribution includes collaboration and actions oriented towards the adoption of an ethical guideline. As the medical brain drain is a global concern, its contraction requires global solutions...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative {{research}} {{based on}} a half standardized interview with seniors is aimed at identifying the seniors´ perception of the dignity concerning dignity of merit, moral strength and personal identity, and the related values of every human being, also known as Menschenwürde { [...] } human dignity. The results show the risk of loss or reduction of dignity in old age. The reasons are external and internal. External reasons include the approach of society and individuals to the elderly, (un) availability of social services for seniors {{and their families and}} also the social system. Internal reasons involve the change of the inner self, reduction of <b>self-sufficiency,</b> <b>financial</b> provision, degree of independence, evaluation of the past life, the age and gender. In the highest risk of loss of dignity are the very old, individuals dependent on the care of others and women. The research makes us think about creating decent living conditions for the elderly. The issues of supportive background creation and available home care services for the elderly and possibilities of a better support for families caring for dependent and dying elderly persons are also addressed. On an individual level it is necessary to instruct people, who come into contact with the elderly, with risk factors that may decrease dignity of the elderly and to gain skills for assistance to enhance seniors´ dignity by an appropriate and sensible approach. Perception of dignity changes with a social system. Dignity is {{an important component of the}} quality of life perception. Attention must be paid to this issue also in the future. With prolonged longevity of an individual and an active participation in community life up to the old age it should be reconsidered since what age an individual is regarded as old. For example, according to the WHO the early old age starts at 60 years of age. This is what young seniors perceive negatively. They do not consider themselves old even when they are 65 years old...|$|R

While American society has a long tradition of regarding higher education as a means of achieving long-term <b>financial</b> security and <b>self-sufficiency,</b> current welfare policy unfortunately adds additional obstacles for welfare recipients who may be motivated to rise above the low-wage welfare-to-work employment opportunities that only promote continued dependence on social welfare programs despite full-time employment. The potential of higher education as a means by which financially disadvantaged single mothers may achieve independence and become productive members of society was addressed in this study along with the study 2 ̆ 7 s primary focus of determining the major influences and motivations in the lives of single mothers receiving public assistance that led to their success in completing their higher education and/or training as well as determining characteristics of the institutional programs that helped lead to the educational success of these women. Literature encompassing an historic review of public welfare policy, the prevalence of poverty in the United States, and the value of higher education provided the background premises for this study, while critical feminist constructivist theory provided the theoretical framework helping to explain the societal contexts wherein women are caught in a conflictual relationship between capitalism (the work ethic) and patriarchy (the family ethic) and how welfare policy has evolved within the confines of societal norms and values.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the optimum guidance of agricultural loans and subsidies financed by the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank to the specialized agricultural projects in the central region in order to improve the investment returns of allocating loans and subsidies over different agricultural projects. Random primary data of five specialized agricultural projects have been used which include wheat, vegetables produced in green houses, broilers, table-eggs, and dairy products that were financed by the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank in the central region. Lamb projects were not operating at the time of conducting this study, so lambs data were obtained from Sherin's et. al. paper[1]. The sample survey covered 52 projects which represents 11 % of specialized projects in the central region. The sample data include investment costs, operating costs, production costs, production capacity, and gross return which can be used to estimate the investment criteria and to formulate the financial problem through the procedure of portfolio selection problems. The Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank financial plans have been aiming at rationalizing government expenditure along with maximizing returns, and achieving high levels of <b>financial</b> efficiency and <b>self-sufficiency</b> ratios. Therefore, the analysis of con-strained maximization of the expected returns from a certain plan followed by the Saudi Arabia Agricultural Bank is made. Saudi Arabian or Agricultural Bank in general is aiming to achieve more than one goal at the same time, thus, goal programming has been used to fulfil the Bank's goals. The results indicate that there is a deviation of the expected returns of the existing plan (first plan) from the goals of the declared agricultural development plans. One of the suggested financial plans (seventh plan) outweighed with the rest through realizing an increase of 4. 75 %, which represents 2 %, in the expected returns compared with the existing plan, along with achieving higher levels of self-sufficieny goals and lower costs of opportunity losses by 10. 5 %. Moreover, the study recommended that the returns on investment in the above indicated projects could be increased by 25 % affecting the production capacities of these which are also examined and analyzed. The expected average return for all the six projects is 3. 69 % in the existing plan while it is 15 % in the optimal plan (seventh plan) according to the shadow prices in the optimal plan results obtained from the programming model...|$|R
40|$|In these {{uncertain}} times, {{important questions}} arise: What are the economic challenges facing Illinois families today? How are Illinois families faring and meeting their basic needs? How much income {{is needed to}} ensure Illinois families can reach self-sufficiency? What strategies can be implemented to help Illinois families both get by and get ahead? This report utilizes the 2009 Illinois Self-Sufficiency Standard to help answer these questions. The Self-Sufficiency Standard calculates a very basic, modest budget that helps us better understand {{the cost of living}} in each Illinois county for a variety of different family types [...] from single adults {{all the way up to}} two adults with children of various ages and dependent adults in the household. It illustrates how much income families need to make ends meet, with no public or private assistance. The Self-Sufficiency Standard illustrates that many more families in Illinois are falling short of economic stability than the traditional measure of hardship [...] the federal poverty line [...] suggests. The Self-Sufficiency Standard helps us think more broadly about a spectrum of solutions to economic security, from helping families escape poverty to crafting opportunities for families to build assets. The Standard can be used to show that even for a family living right at <b>self-sufficiency,</b> <b>financial</b> security is precarious illustrating the importance of having savings to fall back on in hard times and to get ahead in the future. It allows us to see how critically important income supports are in bridging the gap between the low wages many jobs pay and what it actually takes to meet basic needs. The Standard provides useful benchmarks on wage levels for leaders seeking to strengthen their communities by attracting new businesses with jobs that pay family-supporting wages. It offers a yardstick for income adequacy progress for those looking to move up the career ladder through education and training. In Illinois it takes an annual income of $ 49, 030 for a single parent with a preschooler and a school-age child to meet their basic needs without assistance. An estimated 1 million Illinois households (non-senior headed) fall below the Self-Sufficiency Standard, with 652, 000 households falling between the poverty line and the Self- Sufficiency Standard. This report illustrates that the struggles facing many Illinois families did not begin with the current economic crisis. Over the last few decades wages have stagnated and incomes have declined, while the cost of basic goods has skyrocketed. Consequently, Illinoisans are under tremendous pressure to provide for their families - they have fewer resources available to pay for more. The report concludes by discussing strategies to help families get by and get ahead and also discusses how advocates, business leaders, policymakers, and service providers can use the Standard as they educate, advocate, and plan in their communities...|$|R
