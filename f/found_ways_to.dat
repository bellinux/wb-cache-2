5|$|Earlier in his Atlético Madrid career, Costa's {{physical}} {{play was}} used in support of Radamel Falcao, thus ensuring a lower goalscoring rate. After Falcao was sold in 2013, the attack was restructured around Costa by manager Diego Simeone. Simeone, who like Costa {{was known for his}} competitiveness and aggression, <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> enhance his discipline while retaining his determination.|$|E
5|$|Walker began {{monitoring}} Riley and denying him {{access to}} liquor, but Riley <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> evade Walker. At {{a stop at}} the Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room. He became too drunk to perform, and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E

25|$|The {{agency has}} grown in size and sophistication from its early beginnings. As times change, {{information}} needs change accordingly. For example, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, politicians {{became interested in the}} concept of sustainable development. The agency <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> measure these trends to provide helpful information for planners. In August 2002, it published its first report on Sustainable Development Indicators, which measured variables such as water quality, energy usage, sustainability of cities, and youth development.|$|E

While most companies dumped gasoline in rivers (this was before the automobile was popular), Standard used it to fuel its machines. While other companies' refineries piled mountains of heavy waste, Rockefeller <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> sell it. For example, Standard created the first synthetic competitor for beeswax and bought the company that invented and produced Vaseline, the Chesebrough Manufacturing Co., which was a Standard company only from 1908 until 1911.|$|E

25|$|Similar to Left 4 Dead {{and other}} Source Engine-based games, {{a number of}} players have {{constructed}} new maps, campaigns, and other variations for Left 4 Dead 2, supported by Valve through their software development kit for the game. With the kit, players have <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> include the original Left 4 Dead campaigns into Left 4 Dead 2. Players have also <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{increase the number of}} survivors up to 16, duplicating the graphics for the existing survivor characters as needed. In August 2010, Valve announced that it will promote selected community generated maps, one every two weeks, both by blog posts on their official site, and by offering the map on a number of their dedicated servers. Valve updated the game in January 2013 to include support for Steam Workshop, allowing users to create and share new scenarios, maps, clothing and weapons. and to create Mutation-like changes that can be applied to existing maps. A further patch in February 2013 introduced a new scripting system, Expanded Mutation System, that gives programmers more control and options to create new Mutations that can be played across any map or to customize behavior in specific campaigns; one such user-created Mutation creates an experience similar to the Zombie mode in , allowing players to buy weapons and barricades to fight off waves of zombies.|$|E
25|$|By 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal {{had been}} destabilized by: British {{pressure}} on Portugal's colonies; the royal family's expenses; {{the assassination of}} the King and his heir in 1908; changing religious and social views; instability of the two political parties (Progressive and Regenerador); the dictatorship of João Franco; and the regime's apparent inability to adapt to modern times. The proponents of the republic, particularly the Republican Party, <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the situation. The Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{that refused}} to pay the {{licensing}} fee or were rejected by Nintendo <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> circumvent the console's authentication system. Most of these companies created circuits that used a voltage spike to temporarily disable the 10NES chip. A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia {{came in the form}} of a dongle to connect to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game's 10NES chip for authentication. To combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed titles and multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent unlicensed games from working.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the basic}} {{concept of the}} strip is simple, Herriman always <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> tweak the formula.

The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or gnomic pronouncements irritating the mouse {{so much that he}} goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even self-referential humor is evident—in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.|$|E
25|$|In August 2011, Land Rover {{announced}} an update of the Defender for the 2012 model year. By this time, Land Rover publicly {{acknowledged that it}} {{was working on a}} project to produce an all-new replacement for the Defender. This would lead to the unveiling of the first DC100 concept vehicle in September that year. While emissions and safety regulations have threatened the Defender since the early 2000s, these had either been avoided or Land Rover had <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> modify the vehicle to economically meet the new requirements. However, safety regulations due for introduction in 2015 requiring minimum pedestrian safety standards and the fitment of airbags to commercial vehicles cannot be met without a wholesale redesign of the Defender.|$|E
25|$|Although {{strongly}} opposed {{by both the}} business community and the Conservative Party when introduced in the UK in 1999, the Conservatives reversed their opposition in 2000. Accounts differ as to the effects of the minimum wage. The Centre for Economic Performance found no discernible impact on employment levels from the wage increases, while the Low Pay Commission found that employers had reduced their rate of hiring and employee hours employed, and <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> cause current workers to be more productive (especially service companies). The Institute for the Study of Labor found prices in the minimum wage sector rose significantly faster than prices in non-minimum wage sectors, in the four years following the implementation of the minimum wage. Neither trade unions nor employer organizations contest the minimum wage, although the latter had especially done so heavily until 1999.|$|E
