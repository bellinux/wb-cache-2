Even though <b>getting</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> living habits of the authoritarian Aravind's household is difficult, Hasini stays for Siddhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Aravind reprimands Siddhu when he finds out about his bank loan and his career plans, only to further enrage Siddhu.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first title in the Fire Emblem series on a {{portable}} console. While development of a handheld Fire Emblem title had been considered for earlier games, the team felt available hardware lacked the expression to realize their vision. The GBA offered technical capacities superior to the Super Famicom, the release platform of the last Fire Emblem title , while also offering portability, making it more appealing to players. The platform was also chosen due to estimated development time and budget considerations. Developing for the new hardware proved challenging in some respects, and easy in others such as creating basic software. During development, two different versions were developed while the team were <b>getting</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new hardware. One of the main issues they faced was the limited resolution and screen size of the GBA. The game's combat animations were intended to evoke scenes from high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings, contrasting with the equivalent styles of fantasy fighting in Japanese stories.|$|E
25|$|David O. Stewart, in his {{biography}} of Burr, American Emperor, {{notes that the}} reports of Hamilton's intentionally missing Burr with his shot began {{to be published in}} newspaper reports in papers friendly to Hamilton only in the days after his death. But Ron Chernow, in {{his biography}}, Alexander Hamilton, states Hamilton told numerous friends well before the duel of his intention to avoid firing at Burr. Additionally, Hamilton wrote a number of letters, including a Statement on Impending Duel With Aaron Burr and his last missives to his wife dated before the duel, that also attest to this intention. The two shots, witnesses reported, followed one another in close succession, and none of those witnesses could agree as to who fired first. Prior to the duel proper, Hamilton took {{a good deal of time}} <b>getting</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feel and weight of the pistol (which had been used in the duel at the same Weehawken site in which his 19-year-old son had been killed), as well as putting on his eyeglasses in order to see his opponent more clearly. The seconds placed Hamilton so that Burr would have the rising sun behind him, and during the brief duel, one witness reported, Hamilton seemed to be hindered by this placement as the sun was in his eyes.|$|E

500|$|Trench warfare was {{a dreadful}} ordeal for soldiers, and the Southern Rhodesians, {{coming from the}} open veld of {{southern}} Africa, had a particularly difficult time <b>getting</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cold and the mud. Brady reported {{that some of his}} men had contracted frostbite within 48 hours of reaching the trenches. Despite this, the KRRC's Rhodesians acquitted themselves well in the eyes of their superiors; Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Edward Hutton, who wrote a history of the KRRC, commented that the Southern Rhodesian contingent [...] "earned for itself great reputation for valour and good shooting". Southern Rhodesians became especially valuable to the KRRC as designated snipers, grenadiers, Lewis Gunners and other specialists. While discussing a KRRC sniper section, Hutton singles its Southern Rhodesian members out for their fine marksmanship, commenting that [...] "accustomed to big game shooting, [...] particularly excelled in this system of 'snipers', and inflicted continual losses upon the enemy". In their 2008 history of sniping, Pat Farey and Mark Spicer highlight the prowess of South African and Rhodesian sharpshooters on the Western Front, and claim that one group of 24 southern African colonials collectively accounted for over 3,000 German casualties and fatalities.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Justin Speer {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "a ridiculously violent, unbelievably profane game {{that lets you}} glorify {{yourself}} with virtual {{millions of dollars in}} hard-earned drug money, fast cars, boats, underlings, women and copious amounts of blood. It's a good feeling." [...] However, he noted that [...] "gamers who are <b>getting</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next-generation of console visuals aren't going to be impressed with either the PS2 or the Xbox version." [...] He also argued the game becomes somewhat repetitive towards the end. However, he concluded [...] "Scarface is a long-lasting experience that's simply a lot of fun. Part guilty pleasure, part blazingly successful experiment in game design, Scarface: The World is Yours is definitely worth a shot." ...|$|E
