The film received Production Code approval despite <b>having</b> <b>language</b> that was clearly prohibited. The British-produced, but American-financed film Blowup (1966) presented a different problem.

30|$|An {{additional}} {{contribution of the}} paper is that it illustrates the role of host language proficiency in shaping wage inequality. Average estimates assume that the marginal impact of language proficiency on wages is constant over the wage distribution. If true, the effect of <b>having</b> <b>language</b> skills can be represented by a shift (to the right) of the conditional wage distribution. In contrast, the IVQR estimates represent the impact of host language proficiency on wages at different points of the distribution, thus describing changes {{not only in the}} location but also {{in the shape of the}} distribution. By combining average with quantile estimates, we can assess the impact of Spanish proficiency on wage inequality between and within groups: while average returns measure the average differential between proficient and non-proficient immigrants, differences in quantile returns represent the wage differential between proficient immigrants that are located at different quantiles of the distribution.|$|E
