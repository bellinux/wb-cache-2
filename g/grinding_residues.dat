40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{laboratory}} and semi-industrial {{study on the}} discontinuous wet-grinding raw-material process which is widely used in the ceramic tile industry for body preparations. It focuses {{on the importance of}} controlling the rheology and particle size distribution of the aqueous suspensions and the mineralogical characteristics and amounts of the <b>grinding</b> <b>residues</b> of three raw materials-two clays (named Badia and Riola), and one sand-and of their 1 / 1 / 1 mix, generally used in factories for the production of porous, single-fired ceramic wall tiles. The apparent viscosities of the electrostatically deflocculated slips strongly depend on the grinding times. The highest solids content of the slips, enabling a good industrial workability, is about 55 to 57 wt% for both the clays, 70 to 72 wt% for the sand, and 60 to 62 wt% and 66 wt% for the mix (body) examined in the laboratory and semi-industrial experiments, respectively In all the samples, the weighted <b>grinding</b> <b>residues</b> on the 45 -mu-m sieves, formed of the hard unclayey materials. decrease with increasing grinding times, attaining practically constant values at about 20 and 150 min, respectively, in the laboratory and semi-industrial experiments. The optimum apparent viscosity values, which enable the best grinding action on a ceramic body in a drum ball mill, are greater than those required for moving the final slip to the spray dryer. The results suggest that the grinding action is exerted only on the nonplastic materials. Therefore, the individual grinding of the raw materials forming the ceramic body is strongly indicated for optimization of the wet-grinding process. Other useful hints for the rationalization of the wet-grinding process, which may contribute to increasing production, lowering costs, and improving quality, are suggested...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>residues</b> {{from the}} {{processing}} of commercial and model ceramics consisting of SiC-whisker-aluminiumoxide-matrix composites and of silicon nitride containing in situ grown columnar crystallites have been analyzed with respect to size and portion of whiskers and columnar crystallites in the residue. It is shown that the particles in the residue consist almost exclusively of isotropic breakages from the matrix material. A pulling out of whiskers or columnar-crystallites during the grinding process is connected with crystal destruction. The portion of particles with carcinogenic potency (length > 5 #mu#m) is < 0. 005 % (SiC-whisker) and < 0. 01 % (columnar crystallites), respectively.

40|$|Concrete <b>grinding</b> <b>residue</b> (CGR) is a slurry {{byproduct}} {{created by}} concrete pavement maintenance operations. Disposal of CGR slurry is presently regulated {{on the basis}} of very minimal information. The least immediate expense is incurred by spreading CGR slurry directly on vegetated roadway ditches and embankments. The direct disposal impacts to environmental quality in terms of soil physical or chemical properties are not known. Five CGR materials from widely dispersed sites in the United States were analyzed for particle size distribution and evaluated with a suite of USEPA physical and chemical analyses. Values found for the parameters examined are not considered harmful. An infiltration column study was also conducted in which two CGRs were mixed at 8 and 25 % by weight and also surface applied 2. 5 mm deep with two contrasting (relatively fine and coarse textured) soils. With the finer soil, statistically (p < 0. 05) significant decrease in infiltration time (increased infiltration rate) was associated with the 25 % and surface-applied CGR treatments, compared with the untreated control soil. The results indicate that excessive application of CGR may increase water infiltration into soil in the short term. This should be kept in mind, but {{does not appear to be}} generally detrimental...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of an investigation into centrifugal mills with an energy-saving working body. Rational geometric parameters of the working body of the centrifugal mill, which <b>grinds</b> the solid <b>residue</b> from the pyrolysis of used tyres, have been justified on the criterion of the lowest specific energy consumption during the grinding process. A method to determine the dependence of the in-grinding power consumption on the basic parameters of the working body has been developed, while an analytical expression to determine the power consumption for <b>grinding</b> the solid <b>residue</b> from the pyrolysis of used tyres has been obtained. It has been found that the power consumption in the grinding process linearly depends on the rotational speed of the working body, which is to the 0. 3 power on the average size of solid particles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Concrete <b>grinding</b> <b>residue</b> (CGR) is a {{by-product}} created by concrete pavement maintenance operations. The application of CGR to roadside soils is not consistently regulated by state agencies across the USA, which is partially {{due to the}} lack of science-based information on its impacts to soils and plants. The objectives of this research were to determine the impact of CGR additions to soil on both smooth brome (Bromus inermis L.) biomass and plant and soil chemical parameters. In a greenhouse study, two soils were treated with two CGR by-products at 8 % and 25 % by weight. Shoot biomass was significantly influenced by the main effects (Soil, CGR, and Rate) and by all two-way interactions, but not consistently positively or negatively correlated. Trace metal concentrations in the shoot biomass were variable, but 68 % of these metals had the same concentration or lower in the 25 % CGR treatments compared with the controls. Soil pH and electrical conductivity were significantly influenced by the main effects and two-way interactions of Soil × Rate and CGR × Rate, and soil pH was significantly greater in the CGR-treated soils. Calcium, Na, Mg, Al, and S concentrations in soils were all influenced by additions of CGR, but trace metal levels in the treatments were all within the range for uncontaminated soils. Ecosystem impact of applying CGR will be dependent upon the quality of CGR and soil characteristics. Controlling the liming potential of CGR should be considered a best management practice...|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} composition and mechanical {{properties of the}} steel plate were supplied by the manufacturer. Microstructural characterizations were carried out using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, EDAX GENESIS). The specimens for the OM and SEM observations were prepared using Nital (2  %) etching solution on the specimen’s surface. Before the chemical attack, the specimens were ground using sandpaper of 100 – 1000 mesh. Then, a polishing process was performed using diamond paste (1  μm) as the abrasive material. Finally, the <b>grinding</b> and polishing <b>residues</b> were removed using water, ethanol, and drying.|$|R
40|$|Aqueous biphasic {{extraction}} {{systems are}} being developed to treat radioactive wastes. The separation technique involves the selective partitioning of either solutes or colloid-size particles between two scible aqueous phases. Wet <b>grinding</b> of plutonium <b>residues</b> to an average particle size of one micron {{will be used to}} liberate the plutonium from the bulk of the particle matrix. The goal is to produce a plutonium concentrate that will integrate with existing and developing chemical recovery processes. Ideally, the process would produce a nonTRU waste stream. Coupling physical beneficiation with chemical processing will result in a substantial reduction in the volume of mixed wastes generated from dissolution recovery processes. As part of this program, we will also explore applications of aqueous biphasic extraction that include the separation and recovery of dissolved species such as metal ions and water-soluble organics. The expertise and data generated in this work will form the basis for developing more cost-effective processes for handling waste streams from environmental restoration and waste management activities within the DOE community. This report summarizes the experimental results obtained {{during the first year of}} this effort. Experimental efforts were focused on elucidating the surface and solution chemistry variables which govern partitioning behavior of plutonium and silica in aqueous biphasic extraction systems. Additional efforts were directed toward the development of wet grinding methods for producing ultrafine particles with diameters of one micron or less...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} plant based subsistence {{across the}} ‘agricultural transition’ in North China. The study was based around the Middle Yellow River region and included the Yiluo Basin in Henan Province, other sites in Henan and the Late Palaeolithic site of Shizitan in Shanxi Province. The study {{time period covered}} from c. 20, 000 cal BP {{until the end of}} the Yangshao period c. 5, 000 cal BP, with a focus on the transition period between c. 13, 800 cal BP – 5, 000 cal BP. Plant remains examined included charred macrobotanical remains from the Late Palaeolithic, Peiligang and Yangshao periods. Microfossil remains from Peiligang artefacts included both starch and phytolith <b>residues</b> from <b>grinding</b> implements and denticulate stone sickles. The first macrobotanical evidence for the use of millet tribe grasses in North China was presented, with these occurring at the Shizitan site during the Late Palaeolithic period. Millet tribe grasses were subsequently domesticated during the Peiligang period and occur in the study region in the form of small numbers of foxtail and broomcorn millet grains. Domesticated cereal seeds accounted for less than 30 percent of seed taxa in the Peiligang period and less than 12 percent of seed taxa in the Yangshao period. During the Late Palaeolithic and Peiligang periods evidence for experimentation with other grasses was present in the form of panicoid and pooid (cf. Triticeae) starch remains on <b>grinding</b> implements. <b>Residues</b> recovered from Peiligang grinding implements suggest that acorns were an important aspect of subsistence. Macrobotanical evidence for acorns is recorded in the study region at sites such as Jiahu. Macrobotanical evidence for acorns was not present at Tieshenggou, where many of the analysed grinding implements were recovered. In addition to both Lithocarpus sp. and Quercus sp. acorns, Peiligang grinding implements preserved underground storage organ starch from the Cucurbitaceae or Dioscoreaceae families. Starch similar to that from the Phaseoloeae tribe of the bean family was also recovered. Denticulate stone sickles preserved evidence of both grass and eudicotyledonous residues from both the Shigu site and the Jiahu site. These residues do not rule out the possibility that these sickles were used to harvest grasses including millets (Shigu) and rice (Jiahu) but further evidence is needed to support this. The agricultural transition occurred later than expected in the study region, with domesticated cereals only accounting for a small proportion of seed-based subsistence in both the Peiligang and Yangshao periods. This is consistent with ‘middle ground’ subsistence (Smith, B. D., 2001) located between the two extremes of agriculture and hunting-gathering communities on a food production continuum scale...|$|R
40|$|A major {{industrial}} use of pyrotechnic compositions is as delay fuses in electric detonators. Suitable delay times may {{be achieved through}} (i) choice of chemical components (ii) adjustment of composition of the system chosen and, finally, (iii) adjustment {{of the length of}} fuse used. This study forms part of a survey of binary fuel/oxidant combinations in an attempt to provide some fundamental information on the first step above: (i) choice of chemical components. The complete survey has included studies of a single fuel in combination with one of a variety of oxidants, and studies of the oxidation of one of several different fuels separately by barium peroxide and strontium peroxide. This study is part of this second approach and the fuels chosen were iron and zinc powders, mainly for chemical reasons (including the potential for use of thermomagnetometry on the iron systems), but also for possible environmental advantages. The mixed oxide products of pyrotechnic combustion could also have some scientific and/or commercial value. The techniques used included thermal analyses of mixtures and their individual components, and measurements of temperature-time profiles during combustion. Thermodynamic and kinetic information was obtained under a variety of conditions and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and microprobe analyses provided additional information. Possible mechanisms of reactions are discussed in detail. The practical conclusions were that any potential use which the Fe/peroxide systems may have as delay compositions, with burning-rates of from 3 - 30 mm s⁻¹, is offset by the susceptibility of the oxidants to reaction with water and CO₂ in the atmosphere. The Zn/BaO₂ and Zn/SrO₂ systems did not burn under compaction, and combustion of uncompacted powders was erratic. Zinc liquid (and probably zinc vapour) take part in the reaction and the gaseous nature of the combustion makes zinc-fuelled pyrotechnic systems unsuitable for delay applications. All the techniques used showed the heterogeneity of the solid residues of combustion. If these residues were to be of any value, they would need further conventional treatment involving <b>grinding</b> of the <b>residue,</b> possible adjustment of compositions, and calcining to produce uniform materials. ...|$|R
