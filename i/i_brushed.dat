60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> it away, {{but back}} it came again {{in spite of}} all my brushing, and insisted on {{remaining}} to trouble me.|$|E
60|$|And at that <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> by {{the sailors}} {{and the boy}} (who neither spoke nor moved), and ran up the ladder on deck.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> {{away the}} tears that my utmost {{resolution}} {{had not been able}} to keep back, and I made a clumsy laugh of it, and we sat down together, side by side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait till <b>I</b> <b>brush</b> up a bit," [...] he said, {{and got out}} {{a pocket}} comb, with which he {{adjusted}} his hair and his stubby mustache.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait till <b>I</b> <b>brush</b> you off," [...] said Hal, {{and taking}} off his cap he {{commenced}} to strike off the snow and dirt from the gentleman's clothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital! We're close together. Come on! We'll do the West End {{like two}} gay young bucks. Five o'clock, isn't it? We'll walk up Regent Street {{and have an}} 'ap√©ritif' at Biflore's. Wait till <b>I</b> <b>brush</b> my hat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is the day-star too fair {{up above}} you? It burns you not. Dare you [...] imply [...] <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> you more close than the star does, when Walter had set me [...] as high? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt I {{might be}} the better," [...] it {{occurred}} to him, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> my hair, and smelt a little of perfume. Yes. I'll make a toilet. Where's the boy's bedroom, I wonder?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Gertie (interrupting): [...] "Perfectly dreadful!... Ray, don't {{put your}} feet on that couch; <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> it thoroughly, just this morning.... It was simply terrible, Carl; I've always said that if Plato couldn't {{appreciate}} her greatest son----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Did I {{tell you}} that the {{severity}} of the weather, and the heat of the intolerable furnaces, dry the hair and break the nails of strangers? There is not a complete nail in the whole British suite, and my hair cracks again when <b>I</b> <b>brush</b> it. (<b>I</b> am losing my hair with great rapidity, and what I don't lose is getting very grey.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Kesha song [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{mentions}} [...] "Before <b>I</b> leave, <b>brush</b> {{my teeth}} {{with a bottle}} of Jack".|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> waked <b>brushing</b> a {{fly from}} my nose, {{and saw the}} Club waiter set out the evening papers on the table.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me. <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> it aside.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} upon the topmost of the terrace steps, and made her sit beside me. This she did after some demur about the honour of it and her own unworthiness, {{objections}} which <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> peremptorily aside.|$|E
60|$|The purring {{rose to a}} roar. The car {{turned and}} began to move with {{increasing}} speed down the drive. Its drone grew fainter, and ceased. <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> the snow from my coat {{and walked to the}} front door.|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{entertaining}} paradox," [...] said Mr. Leavenworth, [...] "if we {{had time}} to exercise our wits upon it. I remember at Florence an intoxicated figure by Michael Angelo which seemed to me a deplorable aberration of a great mind. I myself touch liquor in no shape whatever. I have traveled through Europe on cold water. The most varied and attractive lists of wines are offered me, but <b>I</b> <b>brush</b> them aside. No cork has ever been drawn at my command!" ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Russo, [...] "The {{process is}} that of a painter; the {{materials}} those of the photographer. I make no use of the camera. There is no negative... In the darkroom, <b>I</b> <b>brush</b> developers onto sensitized photographic papers. My colors come from transparent oils, chemical toners or a combination of the two... Each chemograph is an original creation, an end in itself. The result is a very personal statement since it proceeds from the mind and the imagination in the isolation of the darkroom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] thought I, [...] "why {{should the}} loss of a miserable dog--a mere mass of shapeless hair--affect me so much? Pooh! <b>I</b> will <b>brush</b> the subject away." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{glanced at}} Elsie sideways. I had an uncomfortable {{suspicion}} {{that she said}} it slyly, like one who knew he wanted nothing of the sort. But at any rate, <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> the suggestion aside frankly. 'Nonsense,' I answered. 'He wants me, not a bicycle.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{put down}} {{the last of the}} pens, {{brushing}} away with it the quill-chips from her desk first, and she looked at me with a kind, wondering face. <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> them away, clicked the penknife into my pocket, made her a bow, and walked off--for the bell was ringing for school.|$|E
6000|$|My showman, {{his hard}} face sleek with sweat, insisted on {{counting}} out three huge platelike crown pieces into my lap--for a douceur. <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> them off {{on to the}} ground. [...] "Only to clinch the bargain," [...] he said. His teeth grinned {{at me as if}} he would gladly have swallowed me whole.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't; but I {{holds them}} wi' the buttons. This {{is the way}} of it. W'en I chance to see a wery pretty lady--not one o' your beauties, you know; I don't care a dump for them stuck-up creatures! but one o' your sweet, amiable sort, with souls above buttons, an' faces one likes to look at and to kiss w'en you've a right to; vell, w'en I sees one o' these <b>I</b> <b>brushes</b> up again' 'er, an' 'ooks on with my buttons to some of 'er togs.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> will <b>brush</b> {{you with}} pleasure,' said the girl, {{and set to}} work with the tangled hair, and, as may be easily imagined, this too was by no means {{pleasant}} work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! When {{you speak}} of the soul an' I speak of life we mean the same. You an' I will have some talks while you're here. <b>I</b> must <b>brush</b> up my thoughts." ...|$|R
60|$|My intendant {{was still}} talking of me. The room was crowded, for Rodenard alone had brought with him my twenty followers. One of these looked up as <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> past him, and uttered a cry of {{surprise}} upon recognizing me. But Rodenard talked on, engrossed in his theme {{to the exclusion of}} all else.|$|E
6000|$|I did {{not wait}} to hear what she said. <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> past her, down the stairs. My heart was bursting--my flesh felt cold. I ran breathlessly and {{recklessly}} into the room where {{my father and mother}} had received me. They were both sitting there still. I ran up to them, wringing my hands, and crying out in a passion of tears: ...|$|E
60|$|As it was, I found {{just the}} right words of {{consolation}} and of hope wherewith to bow my brilliant client out of my humble apartments, and then to settle down to deep and considered meditation. Nothing, Sir, is so conducive to thought as a long, brisk walk through the crowded streets of Paris. So <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> my coat, put on my hat at a becoming angle, and started on my way.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall not}} be useless," [...] her mother answered. [...] "If fifty Mr. Kellers {{threatened}} your happiness, my child, <b>I</b> would <b>brush</b> the fifty out of your way. Oh, my darling, my darling!" ...|$|R
60|$|When George Wright sought Sally {{out there}} was added to my jealousy a real anxiety. <b>I</b> had <b>brushed</b> against Wright more than once that evening. He was not drunk, yet under the {{influence}} of liquor.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> must needs <b>brush</b> my cheek, then, {{with the}} sleeve of my night-rail.|$|R
60|$|To my surprise, the doggie came {{promptly}} forward, {{sat down}} on his hind-legs, and looked up into my face. I was touched by this display of ready confidence. A confiding nature {{has always been to}} me powerfully attractive, whether in child, cat, or dog. <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> the shaggy hair from his face in order to see his eyes. They were moist, and intensely black. So was the point of his nose.|$|E
60|$|So it {{was with}} a deep sigh--half of regret at being called away, and all of joy at the thought of seeing my old friend again--that I {{followed}} Marvell's coat-tails over the threshold. With a silly, animal-like affection <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> purposely against Fanny's skirts as I passed her by; and even smirked in a kind of secret triumph at Percy Maudlen, who happened to be idling on the staircase as I hastened from room to room.|$|E
6000|$|She {{pointed out}} the {{scientific}} tete-a-tete {{going on behind the}} azalea, and Steve grinned as he peeped, then grew sober and said in a tone of despair: [...] "If you had seen the pains I took with that fellow, the patience with which <b>I</b> <b>brushed</b> his wig, the time I spent trying to convince him that he must wear thin boots, and the fight I had to get him into that coat, you'd understand my feelings when I see him now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{painting}} [...] "La Tricoteuse", hanging next to works by Gris, Metzinger reveals himself {{more of a}} painter, more natural, more flexible [...] than Gris. Often, Gris would tell me: [...] "Ah! If <b>I</b> could <b>brush</b> [...] like the French!" ...|$|R
50|$|Because I {{had only}} my writing brush and ink slab to {{converse}} with, <b>I</b> call it <b>Brush</b> Talks.|$|R
6000|$|The tree yet sparkles, I say. I {{am writing}} {{on the day before}} Twelfth Day, if you must know; but already ever so many of the fruits have been pulled, and the Christmas lights have gone out. Bobby Miseltow, who has been staying with us for a week (and who has been {{sleeping}} mysteriously in the bath-room), comes to say he is going away {{to spend the rest of}} the holidays with his grandmother -- and <b>I</b> <b>brush</b> away the manly tear of regret as I part with the dear child. [...] "Well, Bob, good-bye, since you will go. Compliments to grandmamma. Thank her for the turkey. Here's ----" [...] (A slight pecuniary transaction takes place at this juncture, and Bob nods and winks, and puts his hand in his waistcoat pocket.) [...] "You have had a pleasant week?" ...|$|R
