5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> ruined dilapidation, {{with a small}} road being built through {{the centre of the}} {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif.

5|$|The Bubonic Plague struck Gaza {{again in}} 1839 and the city, lacking {{political}} and economic stability, went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> stagnation.

Welensky dispatched the Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) to assist in their evacuation, but was prevented by the British government from entering the Congo itself. Refugees fled by foot to Ndola in Northern Rhodesia, where RRAF planes picked them up and flew them to camps in Salisbury. More than 6,000 people were evacuated by the RRAF.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage of missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> ruined dilapidation, perhaps {{experiencing}} deliberate destruction in the Late Medieval period, either by Christian iconoclasts or treasure hunters.

The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 19th century, while archaeological excavation {{took place in the}} early 20th. In 1926, ownership was transferred to heritage charity The National Trust. Open without charge to visitors all year around, the stones are the site of a rag tree, a May Day morris dance, and various modern Pagan rituals.|$|E
5|$|Angry at his {{treatment}} by the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means of}} pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to denounce Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> torpor, assisted by tranquilisers, {{and for a while}} presented no threat to Thorpe.|$|E

Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|By 1934, {{there was}} a large system of {{interconnected}} bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path.|$|E

In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm. Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the , a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary. Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation.|$|E
