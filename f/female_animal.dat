In the same way, God called on the Red Cow to come and atone for the incident of the Golden Calf.|$|E

Anywanwu possesses the magical ability to transform into any animal she wishes, after she has tasted its flesh.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{elective}} surgical procedures in animals are those that render animals incapable of reproducing. [...] Neutering in animals describes spaying or castration (also please see castration). [...] To spay (medical term: ovariectomy or ovario-hysterectomy) is to completely remove the ovaries and often the uterus of a <b>female</b> <b>animal.</b> [...] In a dog, this is accomplished through a ventral midline incision into the abdomen. In a cat, this is accomplished either by a ventral midline abdominal incision, or by a flank incision (more common in the UK). With an ovariectomy ligatures are placed on the blood vessels above and below the ovary and the organ is removed. With an ovariohysterectomy, the ligaments of the uterus and ovaries are broken down and the blood vessels are ligated and both organs are removed. [...] The body wall, subcutis, and skin are sutured. [...] To castrate (medical term: orchiectomy) is to remove the testicles of a male animal. [...] Different techniques are used {{depending on the type of}} animal, including ligation of the spermatic cord with suture material, placing a rubber band around the cord to restrict blood flow to the testes, or crushing the cord with a specialized instrument like the Burdizzo.|$|E

60|$|Only {{four days}} {{afterwards}} some Dyaks saw another Mias near the same place, {{and came to}} tell me. We {{found it to be}} a rather large one, very high up on a tall tree. At the second shot it fell rolling over, but almost immediately got up again and began to climb. At a third shot it fell dead. This was also a full-grown female, and while preparing to carry it home, we found a young one face downwards in the bog. This little creature was only about a foot long, and had evidently been hanging to its mother when she first fell. Luckily it did not appear to have been wounded, and after we had cleaned the mud out of its mouth it began to cry out, and seemed quite strong and active. While carrying it home it got its hands in my beard, and grasped so tightly that I had great difficulty in getting free, for the fingers are habitually bent inwards at the last joint so as to form complete hooks. At this time it had not a single tooth, but a few days afterwards it cut its two lower front teeth. Unfortunately, I had no milk to give it, as neither Malays, Chinese nor Dyaks ever use the article, and I in vain inquired for any <b>female</b> <b>animal</b> that could suckle my little infant. I was therefore obliged to give it rice-water from a bottle with a quill in the cork, which after a few trials it learned to suck very well. This was very meagre diet, and the little creature did not thrive well on it, although I added sugar and cocoa-nut milk occasionally, to make it more nourishing. When I put my finger in its mouth it sucked with great vigour, drawing in its cheeks with all its might in the vain effort to extract some milk, and only after persevering a long time would it give up in disgust, and set up a scream very like that of a baby in similar circumstances.|$|E

The late Mrs. Betteredge took her exercise on that favourite <b>female</b> <b>animal</b> whenever I happened to deny her anything that she had set her heart on. So sure as I came home from my work on these occasions, so sure was my wife to call to me up the kitchen stairs, and to say that, after my brutal treatment of her, she hadn't the heart to cook me my dinner. I {{put up with it}} for some time--just as you are putting up with it now from Miss Rachel. At last my patience wore out. I went downstairs, and I took Mrs. Betteredge--affectionately, you understand--up in my arms, and carried her, holus-bolus, into the best parlour where she received her company. I said 'That's the right place for you, my dear,' and so went back to the kitchen. I locked myself in, and took off my coat, and turned up my shirt-sleeves, and cooked my own dinner. When it was done, I served it up in my best manner, and enjoyed it most heartily. I had my pipe and my drop of grog afterwards; and then I cleared the table, and washed the crockery, and cleaned the knives and forks, and put the things away, and swept up the hearth. When things were as bright and clean again, as bright and clean could be, I opened the door and let Mrs. Betteredge in. 'I've had my dinner, my dear,' I said; 'and I hope you will find that I have left the kitchen all that your fondest wishes can desire.' For the rest of that woman's life, Mr. Franklin, I never had to cook my dinner again! Moral: You have put up with Miss Rachel in London; don't put up with her in Yorkshire.

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} focal models of {{traumatic}} brain injury have shown that <b>female</b> <b>animals</b> have a higher postinjury mortality than male animals, and that this higher mortality {{may be due to}} a worsened magnesium homeostasis in the <b>female</b> <b>animals.</b> The present study examined whether a similar difference in male and female mortality existed following a more diffuse model of {{traumatic brain injury}} and whether any mortality coule be attentuated by ovariectomy or posttraumatic magnesium administration. Severe impact-acceleration induced diffuse brain trauma resulted in a 20 % mortality in male rats as opposed to a 100 % mortality in <b>female</b> <b>animals</b> (p< 0. 05). This difference was not apparent at less severe injury levels. Administration of 750 micromoles/kg magnesium suphate intramuscularly at 30 min after severe trauma reduced female mortality to 29 % (p< 0. 05). Female outcomes were similar in ovariectomised animals suggesting that the protective effects of magnesium were unrelated to cyclic changes in gonadal hormones. We conclude that the higher mortality observed in <b>female</b> <b>animals</b> following brain trauma is dependent on injury severity and that this mortality can be significantly attenuated with posttraumatic administration of magnesium suphate...|$|R
