40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the {{deregulation of the}} <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> industry in Western Europe has affected 1 - the total quantity of cross-border <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> in the region; 2 - {{the degree to which}} shippers outsource rather than integrate vertically their cross-border transport needs; and 3 - the extent to which different countries participate in <b>international</b> <b>road</b> freight <b>transport</b> in Western Europe. Not surprisingly, we find that deregulation has had a large positive effect on the amount of <b>international</b> <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> net of the effect of the trade ties that grew over time among European Union countries. Moreover, consistent {{with the fact that the}} regulation disproportionately affected for-hire trucking, we find that deregulation has led shippers to shift toward more for-hire transport as opposed to own-account or private haulage. However, despite concerns voiced by member countries, we find no evidence that deregulation has disproportionately favored carriers of countries that were initially more (or less) intensively involved in international haulage...|$|R

50|$|Truckers {{making use}} of the TIR {{procedure}} must first obtain an internationally harmonised customs document, {{referred to as a}} TIR carnet. TIR carnets are issued by national <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> associations. This customs document is valid internationally and as well as describing the goods, their shipper and their destination, represents a financial guarantee. When a truck arrives at a border customs post it need not pay import duties and taxes on goods at that time. Instead the payments are suspended. If the vehicle transits the country without delivering any goods, no taxes are due. If it fails to leave the country with all the goods, then the taxes are billed to the importer and the financial guarantee backstops the importer's obligation to pay the taxes. TIR transits are carried out in bond, i.e. the lorry must be sealed as well as bearing the carnet.
