5|$|After independence, modern {{buildings}} {{appeared in}} Ahmedabad. Architects given commissions {{in the city}} included Louis Kahn, who <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> IIM-A; Le Corbusier, who <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> Shodhan and Sarabhai Villas, the Sanskar Kendra and the Mill Owner's Association Building, and Frank Lloyd Wright, who <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> administrative building of Calico Mills and the Calico Dome. B. V. Doshi came to the city from Paris to supervise Le Corbusier's works and later set up the School of Architecture. His local works include Sangath, Amdavad ni Gufa and the School of Architecture. Charles Correa, who became a partner of Doshi's, <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> Gandhi Ashram and Achyut Kanvinde, and the Indian Textile Industries Research Association. Christopher Charles Benninger's first work, the Alliance Française, {{is located in the}} Ellis Bridge area. Anant Raje designed major additions to Louis Kahn's IIM-A campus, namely the Ravi Mathai Auditorium and KLMD.|$|E

5|$|After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, {{the city}} was {{drastically}} westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 Ristiḱ Palace. Architecture of that time {{is very similar to}} the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine train station, both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by Milan Zloković. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange who <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> new train station. Macedonian architects also took part to the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Delčev in 1975, while Janko Konstantinov <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). Slavko Brezovski <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, {{called in}} the {{architect}} William Burn to build new stables {{to the east of}} the house, in collaboration with W. A.

This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, the monumental fountain of Saint George and the Dragon dated c. 184957 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> large stone orangery, with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and windowless.|$|E
