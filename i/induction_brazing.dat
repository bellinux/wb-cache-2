In this respect {{the use of}} metallic brazes is considered to have advantages {{in comparison to the}} widely used brittle glasses or glass ceramics. In this study the mechanical properties and the long-term stability of ceramic-metal joints prepared by induction heating are investigated. Fracture experiments are carried out to characterize the bending strength and failure mechanisms of silver-based reactive air brazes. Due to thinner interfacial layers the <b>induction</b> <b>brazed</b> 4 -point bending specimens showed higher strength than samples brazed in conventional furnaces. Characterization of fracture surfaces wi th SEM reveals details of fracture origin and crack propagation. The cracks in the interfacial layers between braze/ceramic and braze/metal are identified as failure reason for tested samples. It is shown that during annealing in air at 850 °C the 4 -point bending strength decreases with time while the thickness of the oxide reaction layers increases.

40|$|Diffusion bonding and brazing of high purity copper were {{investigated}} to develop procedures for joining precision machined copper components for the Next Linear Collider (NLC). Diffusion bonds were made over {{a range of}} temperatures from 400 °C to 1000 °C, under two different loading conditions [3. 45 kPa (0. 5 psi) and 3. 45 MPa (500 psi) ], and on two different diamond machined surface finishes. Brazes were made using pure silver, pure gold, and gold-nickel alloys, and different heating rates produced by both radiation and <b>induction</b> heating. <b>Braze</b> materials were applied by both physical vapor deposition (PVD) and conventional braze alloy shims. Results of the diffusion bonding experiments showed that bond strengths very near that of the copper base metal could be made at bonding temperatures of 700 °C or higher at 3. 45 MPa bonding pressure. At lower temperatures, only partial strength diffusion bonds could be made. At low bonding pressures (3. 45 kPa), full strength bonds were made at temperatures of 800 °C and higher, while no bonding (zero strength) was observed at temperatures of 700 °C and lower. Observations of the fracture surfaces of the diffusion bonded samples showed the effects of surface finish on the bonding mechanism. These observations clearly indicate that bonding began by point asperity contact, and flatter surfaces resulted in {{a higher percentage of}} bonded area under similar bonding conditions. Results of the brazing experiments indicated that pure silver worked very well for brazing under both conventional and high heating rate scenarios. Similarly, pure silver brazed well for both the PVD layers and the braze alloy shims. The gold and gold-containing brazes had problems, mainly due to the high diffusivity of gold in copper. These problems led to the necessity of overdriving the temperature to ensure melting, the presence of porosity in the joint, and very wide braze joints. Based on the overall findings of this study, a two-step joining method is proposed for fabricating the NLC structures. The structure would be assembled with pure silver braze inserts using a self-aligning step joint design, then the assembly would be vacuum diffusion bonded at 700 °C and 3. 45 MPa pressure to seal the critical inner portion of the assembly. Finally, during the same furnace cycle, the temperature would be increased to 800 °C in order to react the silver with the copper to form a liquid braze alloy that would join and seal the outer portion of the cells together...|$|R

Such plants contain numerous tubular structures and to obtain ultrasonic signals with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ultrasonic transducers (UTs) often need to conform to these structures and operate at elevated temperatures. Flexible UTs are suitable under such conditions and adaptable to different tube diameters because they ensure good self-alignment with the object 2 ̆ 019 s surface and a uniform couplant thickness. This results in good transmission of ultrasonic energy into the component and reduced noise. In this study flexible UTs, consisting of piezoelectric films with thicknesses larger than 40 3 ̆bcm deposited on a 75 3 ̆bcm thick metal membrane, were developed for NDT applications up to 5000 C. The piezoelectric films were made by a sol-gel spray technique {{and can be used}} for NDT of pipes of diameters larger than 25. 4 mm. At room temperature the ultrasonic performances of flexible UTs were at least as good as commercially available 5 MHz and 10 MHz broadband UTs.
