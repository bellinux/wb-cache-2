40|$|The {{application}} of microphotographic methods for the processing and storage of information has grown steadily {{during the last}} two decades. The microphotographic system, through which the information must pass at a minimum is as follows: Step 1 : Photographing of the original document at a large reduction onto a silver halide microfilm. Step 2 : Duplicating through contact printing onto a non-silver photographic material. Step 3 : Second generation duplication onto a nonsilver photographic material (This image may be used on a microfilm reader). Step 4 : Enlargement of the second generation duplicate to give a <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>print.</b> One of the main objectives of this system is the production of a legible image {{at the end of the}} process. As the steps mentioned above indicate, the creation of the original negative at a large reduction is the first major step and critical to the success of future steps in the process. A mistake in camera exposure at this point may well cause an illegible image to be produced at the end of the system. A technique long utilized by the microfilm industry for the measurement of small scale image quality of greatly reduced images is resolution in lines per millimeter. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between resolution and legibility for similarly produced original negatives. The methodology of the experiment consisted of producing original negatives in a conventional microphotographic system at 24 x reduction of two types of resolution test targets. The NBS 10 - 10 (100 : 1 contrast) test chart and the R. I. T. alphanumeric (100 : 1 and 8 : 1 contrast) test objects v/ere the three targets used. The three targets were photographed at eight equally spaced exposure levels with a total ratio of 10 : 1. Replicate images were made at each exposure level. The resolution measurements were read from an 80 x microscope and from a microfilm reader at 24 x by this author. A series of standard documents in two different type faces (ten point serif and sanserif) were exposed and processed in the same manner as the resolution targets. Replicate sets were made at each exposure level. The standard documents consisted of meaningful, continuous, textual material. The original negatives of these standard documents were evaluated for their legibility by placing them in a microfilm reader (24 x) and determining the distance at which the images became legible. Fifteen observers were employed. The average distance measurements were used to determine the relative legibility of the original negatives. A two- factor ANOVA at an alpha risk of 0. 05 indicated that type face did not affect the relative legibility of the negatives. Camera exposure level was found to be significant, which means that images of varying legibility were produced. The functional relationships between resolution from the three targets versus camera exposure level and between relative legibility versus camera exposure level were determined and found to fit second-order models. The optimum camera exposure for both measures of image quality were less than one-third of a stop apart. The correlation between resolution and relative legibility was high in all cases (minimum of. 86) and significant at the 0. 01 level. A linear model best fits these functional relationships. The R. I. T. 8 : 1 contrast target provided the highest correlation with r equal to O. 96. The NBS and R. I. T. test charts were very similar in the resolution measurements obtained from each. However, when a secondary observer 2 ̆ 7 s measurements were compared to this author 2 ̆ 7 s the between observer differences in resolution values for the NBS target were nearly four times as large as the differences on the R. I. T. target. In summary, the camera exposure of the original negative that provides the highest resolution in a microfilm system will also be very close to the exposure that yields the optimum legibility for commonly employed type styles and sizes. The resolution measurements can be obtained directly from the microfilm reader that is a part of the system. If the R. I. T. 8 : 1 contrast target is used the legibility predictions will have a high level of accuracy and excel lent precision...|$|E

40|$|What {{effect has}} {{technology}} had on {{our ability to}} read in both <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>print</b> and technological form? Gerry White from DERN reviews the latest research. The use of computers in education has introduced dual reading modes: on paper and on screen. Concerns have been raised about how readers interact with each mode, especially on screen, and the processes that are used for reading and comprehension given that most university students use computers and increasingly tablets for study. Two recent announcements in the US may mean that students will be reading from screens even more. The US Government has set the goal of an e-textbook for all school students within five years and Apple have launched digital textbooks and free software called ibooks to develop digital textbooks. What does research find about reading on screen compared to reading on paper? In a study called The Phenomology of on-screen reading: University students’ lived experience of digitised text researchers found that increasingly ‘paper based books and papers are digitised and then read on screen’ (p. 516). Previous research had suggested that on screen reading is haphazard, interrupted, unfocused and does not translate into academic reading. The Phenomology of on-screen reading: University students’ lived experience of digitised text overcame that simplistic and erroneous perspective and delved deeper into the processes that students use when reading on screen. Six interesting phenomena were identified that provide an insight into the practices of on screen reading. They can be summarised as: The disappearing page (p. 518) – where the page becomes immaterial because of top to bottom scrolling rather than turning pages plus the difference of reading a two-column display To have not to hold (p. 519) – where making notes and annotations require more effort on screen The ever present screen (p. 520) – where the screen is always the focus Getting in focus (p. 521) – where distractions such as an email require an effort {{to focus on the}} text The disciplined body (p. 522) – where reading occurs at a desk with a computer not curled up in a pleasurable, comfortable chair Finding what I need (p. 523) – on screen reading is goal-directed and strategic. The Phenomology of on-screen reading: University students’ lived experience of digitised text reflects on students making an effort to develop new strategies to adapt to the conditions of on screen reading although when the technology becomes a hindrance then concentration becomes interrupted. However, a concluding comment may give pause to reflect further when it is stated that, ‘It is now possible to foresee a time when, having grown accustomed to accessing texts instantly and scanning them for keywords, we will regard the printed books and papers that defy such possibilities as obstinate, ill-suited to the task of academic research’ (p. 525). This phenomenology research that examined the views of ten university students provides new insights into on screen reading without romancing the printed page but by examining the processes that are used. More recently released research called Marking Extended Essays on Screen: exploring the link between marking processes and comprehension confirms that there is no degradation of comprehension from on screen reading because examiners marking long essays (900 words) through prolonged reading on screen and on paper came to remarkably consistent (89 %) results, and with an adjustment for one coded item, 98 % consistency. However, what Marking Extended Essays on Screen: exploring the link between marking processes and comprehension did report was that examiners made more notes and annotations (eg underlining, circling, highlighting) on paper than they did on screen where navigation of the essays was a key element. These two research papers offer some excellent insights into the on screen reading processes of university students and also examiners required to read prolonged essays. There is a need for in-depth research into the relationships that are formed between the reader and the screen as well as the processes for making meaning from on screen text in order to understand how best to teach on screen reading. The issue has become urgent as the frequency of on screen reading gathers momentum.

Reading was performed based on <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>prints</b> (Scopix, Agfa, Leverkusen, Germany) and on 2  k × 2. 5  k high-resolution monitors (Sun Ultra 60, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, California, USA). Four readers with different levels of experience in mammography categorized the mammograms according to the BI-RADS classification. The comparative study was performed by four readers, and at least 2  months elapsed between the reading sessions. Postprocessing, of course, was available only at the work station (windowing and leveling, zooming, inversion). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were evaluated. Diagnostic accuracy of the evaluation was determined. Sensitivity for malignant lesions in <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> versus soft copy reading was 97 % vs 90 %, 97 % vs 97 %, 93 % vs 97 %, and 76 % vs 76 % for the four readers, respectively.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of modern technology, going viral on virtual {{learning}} (VL) in open and distance learning (ODL) {{is becoming more and}} more popular among the many institutions of higher learning. This article focuses on the shift from learning virtually (LV) to viral VL which might result in unintended consequences such as the exclusion of prospective postgraduate students and staff. Going viral in this context refers to the introduction and spread of online learning until the institution goes wholly online. Data for this article was collected from 12 Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) (Leadership and Management) postgraduate Unisa students who received their mediation experiences through LV modalities augmented by the use of short message services (SMSs). The qualitative exploratory case study investigated, analysed and described the views of public school principals in rural Mpumalanga Province. The results showed that the majority of students prefer the modular LV methodology albeit augmented by the use of SMS to facilitate a quicker channel of communication. In this article, we proffer that the university’s tuition model for postgraduate programmes should not completely be virtual learning as the process might unintentionally exclude a large number of students who experience burdensome costs and connectivity challenges particularly in rural Africa. But the recommendation is that in order for virtual learning to work, it should be blended with paper-based (<b>hard</b> <b>copy)</b> <b>printed</b> materials as is envisaged by ODL practices...|$|R

However, we can now generate various digital geovisualization products that are inherently different from printed maps, such as interactive 3 D city models. Additional visual variables have been proposed for some of these new geovisualizations, however the discussion is still on-going. In this paper, we contribute to this discussion by investigating the relevance of a subset of visual variables for planning informal settlement upgrades in 3 D geovisualizations, and specifically how these variables contribute to the selectiveness of objects. The {{variables were}} systematically evaluated against specific requirements for planning upgrades which were compiled using expert knowledge. We observe that evaluated visual variables, except colour and texture, are not directly transferrable. Furthermore, we propose that; in an interactive 3 D setting, visual variables position, orientation and motion should not be only considered in relation to the objects in a 3 D environment, but also in relation to the camera, and the concept of Level of Detail (LoD) should replace shape. The results contribute towards building design principles of 3 D informal settlement models for planning upgrades...|$|R

This is relevant to librarians {{and those in the}} information studies field who need to be aware that the way young people and future generations read and interact with text differs from that of previous generations, especially among individuals who have been immersed in electronic media from a young age. Emerging research shows that the brain of an individual who has been surrounded by digital media from a young age develops differently than the brain of an individual who does not have an extensive history of online participation. Patterns are also beginning to emerge regarding changing brain structure in "late adopters " of online reading [...] those of pre-Net Generation age who are now immersing themselves in electronic text. Librarians, teachers, and others involved in managing access to digital text and promoting literacy should be aware of these trends in order to address them effectively in their work...|$|R
