40|$|Here {{we present}} a study where human {{participants}} rated the believability of <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations</b> simulated with a hexapod motion platform equipped with a projection screen. Visual <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations</b> were presented together with brief forward surge translations and backwards pitches of the platform, and synchronous random up-down movements of the camera in the visual scene and the platform. The magnitudes {{of all of the}} parameters were varied independently across trials. Even though we found a high variability between participants, most believable simulation occured with strong visual accelerations combined with backwards pitches of the platform which approximately matched the visually simulated acceleration. This was contrary to a previous study, which had found most believable simulation when the platform movements simulated a much smaller acceleration than what was shown visually. Furthermore, surge translations increased believability if they qualitatively matched the magnitude of visual acceleration. The acceleration-deceleration profile of the surge translation and the magnitude and frequency range of the up-down movements had little effect on the believability. When strong visual acceleration cues were given, most participants reported trials as realistic even when the platform tilt rate was above thresholds for the vestibular canals reported in literature. These results can be used to optimize motion cueing algorithms for the simulation of linear accelerations in motion simulators...|$|R

The results were compared to the {{movements of}} blinded goldfish subjected to similar changes of gravitoinertial forces. The results indicate that there is a human correlation with the gravity reference response of fish. During horizontal <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations</b> on the ground the human eyes turn downward and during horizontal backward acceleration the eyes turn upward. The human eye response to g-loads below 1 g and to weightlessness is the reverse of the tilt of the fish. While fish dive down during low g, or loop forward during weightlessness, the eyes of subjects sitting upright in an aircraft which flies at 0 g move upward...|$|R
40|$|Responses of 11 {{young adult}} males, {{initially}} standing, to support surface <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations</b> of 0. 18 g were investigated. In {{response to the}} impending falls this stimulus initiated, body segment motions and myoelectric activities in six muscles were measured. These measurements were then input to 9 or 12 segment whole body biomechanical models and the reaction joint torques needed to produce the motions were calculated. Mean relative joint rotations were as large as 92. 8 [deg] and calculated relative joint angular accelerations as large as 29. 7 rad s- 2. Mean myoelectric signal latencies in the six muscles monitored ranged from 135 ms at the ankles to 176 ms at the shoulders with intermediate values at intermediate joints. Mean values of calculated maximum joint torques ranged to 70 Nm at the ankles, 82 Nm at the knees, 73 Nm at the hips, and 19 Nm at the shoulders...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the step length-frequency relationship in physically active community-dwelling older women {{in order to}} investigate whether {{the relationship between these}} two spatio-temporal gait parameters changes with increasing age. Forty older women in four age groups, i. e. 64 - 69, 70 - 74, 75 - 79 and 80 - 85 year olds, participated in the study. Subjects walked at five different self-selected speeds and while simultaneously performing an additional cognitive and/or upper-extremity motor task. Gait parameters were determined from <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations</b> measured by a tri-axial accelerometer on the lower back. All subjects demonstrated a strong linear relationship between step length and step frequency for walking at different speeds. No evidence for a change in the step length-frequency relationship with age was found, suggesting that there are no differences between physically active older women of different age groups regarding the adoption of a "cautious gait", i. e. a gait pattern characterized by a reduced step length...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how auditory space was represented during linear self-motion. Participants were passively transported forward or backward at constant accelerations by a robotic wheelchair. A short noise burst (30 ms) was presented during self-motion via a loudspeaker aligned {{parallel with the}} traveling direction. In Experiment 1, the participants judged in which direction (incoming or outgoing) the noise burst was presented (ie,, two alternative forced choice task). The auditory stimulus perceived to be aligned with the subjective coronal plane shifted in the traveling direction only during forward self-motion. The amount of shift increased with increasing acceleration. In Experiment 2, we examined the accuracy of sound localization during forward self-motion by employing a pointing method. Whereas the auditory stimulus located on the physical coronal plane was almost accurately perceived, those well located in the incoming space were perceived closer to the participants than the physical positions during forward self-motion. These {{results suggest that the}} representation of auditory space in the traveling direction was compressed during <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Forward</b> <b>acceleration</b> {{anti-squat}} {{is calculated}} {{in a similar}} manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause wheel hop during braking. It is important to note that, while the value of 100% means that all of the weight transfer is being carried through the suspension linkage. However, {{this does not mean that}} the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking or <b>forward</b> <b>acceleration.</b> In other words, no [...] "binding" [...] of the suspension is to be implied.|$|E

For this reason modern computer aided design methodologies seem to be a valid instrument to improve quality of equipments and fulfil the regulations as well. In this paper the authors describe the application of CAD-Multibody techniques to an optimization of a wheelchair for basketball. The target of the investigation is to give to the athlete the possibility to perform quick <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations</b> without rollover tendencies.

40|$|AbstractA novel {{class of}} vivid motion and {{velocity}} illusions for contrast-defined shapes is presented and discussed. The illusions concern a starlike wheel that, physically, rotates with constant velocity between stationary starlike {{inner and outer}} shapes but that, perceptually, shows pulsations, jolts backwards, jolts <b>forwards,</b> and <b>accelerations,</b> each time it aligns with {{the inner and outer}} shapes. These dynamic effects turn from one into another when contrasts in the image change gradually, and seem to be caused by colour assimilation and ambiguous figure-ground segregation...|$|R
50|$|The head-up {{illusion}} {{involves a}} sudden <b>forward</b> linear <b>acceleration</b> during level flight where the pilot perceives {{the illusion that}} {{the nose of the}} aircraft is pitching up. The pilot's response to this illusion would be to push the yoke or the stick forward to pitch the nose of the aircraft down. A night take-off from a well-lit airport into a totally dark sky (black hole) or a catapult take-off from an aircraft carrier can also lead to this illusion, and could result in a crash.|$|R

40|$|Wong amp; Frost (1981) {{showed that}} the onset latency of {{visually}} induced self-rotation illusions (circular vection) can be reduced by concomitant small physical motions (jerks). Here, we tested whether (a) such facilitation also applies for translations, and (b) whether {{the strength of the}} jerk (degree of visuo-vestibular cue conflict) matters. 14 naïve observers rated onset, intensity, and convincingness of forward linear vection induced by photorealistic visual stimuli of a street of houses presented on a projection screen (FOV: 75 °× 58 °). For 2 / 3 of the trials, brief physical <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations</b> (jerks applied using a Stewart motion platform) accompanied the visual motion onset. Adding jerks enhanced vection significantly; Onset latency was reduced by 50, convincingness and intensity ratings increased by more than 60. Effect size was independent of visual acceleration (1. 2 and 12 m/s^ 2) and jerk size (about 0. 8 and 1. 6 m/s^ 2 at participants head for 1 and 3 cm displacement, respectively), and showed no interactions. Thus, quantitative matching between the visual and physical acceleration profiles might not be as critical as often believed as long as they match qualitatively and are temporally synchronized. These findings could be employed for improving the convincingness and effectiveness of low-cost simulators without the need for expensive, large motion platforms...|$|R
40|$|Visually guided finger {{movements}} include online {{feedback of}} current effector position to guide target approach. This visual feedback may be scaled or otherwise distorted by unpredictable perturbations. Although adjustments to visual feedback scaling {{have been studied}} before, the underlying brain activation differences between upscaling (visual feedback larger than real movement) and downscaling (feedback smaller than real movement) are currently unknown. Brain activation differences between upscaling and downscaling might be expected because within-trial adjustments during upscaling require corrective backwards accelerations, whereas correcting for downscaling requires <b>forward</b> <b>accelerations.</b> In this behavioural and fMRI study we investigated adjustments during up- and downscaling in a target-directed finger flexion-extension task with real-time visual feedback. We found that subjects made longer and more complete within-trial corrections for downscaling perturbations than for upscaling perturbations. The finger task activated primary motor (M 1) and somatosensory (S 1) areas, premotor and parietal regions, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. General scaling effects were seen in the right pre-supplementary motor area, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stronger activations for down- than for upscaling were observed in M 1, supplementary motor area (SMA), S 1 and anterior cingulate cortex. We argue that these activation differences may reflect differing online correction for upscaling versus downscaling during finger flexion-extension...|$|R

50|$|In principle, {{velocity}} {{cannot be}} directly perceived by relative cues alone, like {{those from the}} vestibular system. For such a system, flying in space with some constant velocity is not different from sitting in a chair. However, changing the velocity is perceived as acceleration, or force acting on the human body. For the case of constant linear acceleration, {{a substitute for the}} real situation is simple. Since the amplitude of the acceleration is not very well perceived by humans, one can tilt the subject backwards and use the gravity vector as a replacement for correct resulting force from gravity and <b>forward</b> <b>acceleration.</b> In this case, leaning backwards is therefore not perceived differently from being constantly accelerated forwards.|$|E

The grade retard feature was not designed as a low or <b>forward</b> <b>acceleration</b> gear and was meant to be used only on long declines to generate a degree of engine braking.

30|$|For user heading {{estimation}} of PDR using unconstrained smartphones, uDirect approach [19] tends to extract user heading directly {{within a particular}} area, where the <b>forward</b> walking <b>acceleration</b> dominates the horizontal acceleration signals. Unfortunately, such an area is always disturbed by body locomotion. In contrast, our previous proposed rotation matrix and principal component analysis (RMPCA) approach [20] is more robust, because it employs all acceleration samples in the horizontal plane.

50|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of arm swing {{and its potential}} in adjusting {{the momentum of the}} body have been utilized in sports. Sprinters make use of the contribution of arm swing on the linear momentum {{in order to get a}} higher <b>forward</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Racewalkers are also utilizing the arm swing for its energy efficiency. Rather than the rhythmic movements during walking, swinging arms in the right way helps athletic performance in different disciplines. Standing long jump performance is shown to be improved by swinging arms forward during the onset of the jump and back-and-forth during landing since the linear momentum of the body can be adjusted with the help of moving arms. Use of arms in adjusting the rotational and linear momentum is also a common practice in somersaulting and gymnastics.|$|E

Throughout the years, a wide variety of different types of devices and experimental setups have been tested. The force measuring setups have ranged from various load cell devices to ballistic pendulums to multiple torsion arm pendulums, in which movement is actually observed. Those setups have been improved against spurious effects by isolating and canceling thermal transfers, vibration and electromagnetic interference, while getting better current feeds and bearings. Null tests were also conducted.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{when a car}} {{starts from}} a {{standstill}} (zero relative velocity) and travels {{in a straight line}} at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new-direction. In this example, we can call the <b>forward</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the car a [...] "linear acceleration", which passengers in the car might experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. When changing direction, we might call this [...] "non-linear acceleration", which passengers might experience as a sideways force. If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction {{from the direction of the}} vehicle, sometimes called deceleration. Passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them forwards. Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration: both are changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (linear, non-linear, deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and direction) matches that of the car.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a vestibular reflex originating in the otolith organs and other body graviceptors modulates sympathetic activity during changes in posture with regard to gravity. To test this hypothesis, we selectively stimulated otolith and body graviceptors sinusoidally along different head axes in the coronal plane with off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) and recorded sympathetic efferent activity in the peroneal nerve (muscle sympathetic nerve activity, MSNA), blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. All parameters were entrained during OVAR at the frequency of rotation, with MSNA increasing in nose-up positions during <b>forward</b> linear <b>acceleration</b> and decreasing when nose-down. MSNA was correlated closely with blood pressure when subjects were within +/- 90 degrees of nose-down positions with a delay of 1. 4 s, the normal latency of baroreflex-driven changes in MSNA. Thus, in the nose-down position, MSNA was probably driven by baroreflex afferents. In contrast, when subjects were within +/- 45 degrees of the nose-up position, i. e., when positive linear acceleration was maximal along the naso-ocipital axis, MSNA was closely related to gravitational acceleration at a latency of 0. 4 s. This delay is too short for MSNA changes to be mediated by the baroreflex, but it {{is compatible with the}} delay of a response originating in the vestibular system. We postulate that a vestibulosympathetic reflex, probably originating mainly in the otolith organs, contributes to blood pressure maintenance during <b>forward</b> linear <b>acceleration.</b> Because of its short latency, this reflex {{may be one of the}} earliest mechanisms to sustain blood pressure upon standing...|$|R
