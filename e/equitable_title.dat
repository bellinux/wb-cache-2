A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> has not been provided for. In such a case, the law may raise a resulting trust {{for the benefit of the}} grantor (the creator of the trust). In other words, the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> that was not properly provided for in the trust document.|$|E
25|$|In the United states, {{a general}} {{assignment}} or an assignment {{for the benefit}} of creditors is simply a contract whereby the insolvent entity ("Assignor") transfers legal and <b>equitable</b> <b>title,</b> as well as custody and control of its property, to a third party ("Assignee") in trust, to apply the proceeds of sale to the assignor's creditors in accord with priorities established by law.|$|E
25|$|Homestead property, {{which follows}} {{its own set}} of unique rules in states like Florida, must be dealt with {{separately}} from other assets.

40|$|Trusts in Australia are {{typically}} created by nominal settlors. Substantial trust property is contributed later and by different persons. For both conceptual and practical reasons, {{the practice is}} an affront to equity jurisprudence {{and should not be}} allowed. Anglo-Australian trusts law knows no category of &# 039;adding&# 039; property to existing trusts. Legal and <b>equitable</b> <b>titles</b> in respect of the added property are arguably not &# 039;split&# 039; so as to generate trust relations. Practically, the use of nominal settlors has distorted taxation law and trust-law doctrines such as sham characterisation, rectification and document discovery.

500|$|For {{equitable}} tracing to be valid, {{several things}} must be demonstrated. First, the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> must exist; {{it can be}} brought into existence by the courts, such as in Constructive trusts. Secondly, {{there must be some}} kind of fiduciary relationship between the claimant and the defendant. If the property was transferred through breach of trust, it will not be necessary to establish such a relationship, because it already exists. In addition, property transferred through breach of trust may be traced to any third party (other than a purchaser in good faith), even if they did not previously have a fiduciary relationship with the claimant. Historically, the courts have been willing to be [...] "generous in finding that the necessary fiduciary relationship existed", even {{going so far as to}} recognise relationships that did not exist at the time of the transfer.|$|E
2500|$|Automatic {{resulting}} trusts {{arise from}} a [...] "gap" [...] in the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed; {{it is against}} principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. Automatic resulting trusts occur where an express trust fails. This includes where there is no valid declaration of trust, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Whatever the reason, when a trust fails the property must be passed to someone. This is an application of the equitable maxim that [...] "equity abhors a vacuum".|$|E

They further contended that <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> came from the United States starting in 1803, that the United States had made no attempt to claim the land itself, and that the previous holding in the 1836 equity suit by John Deane estopped the plaintiffs from now trying to claim the land.|$|E
2500|$|Resulting trusts in English law are trusts created where {{property}} is not properly disposed of. It {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to spring back, and was defined by Megarry VC as [...] "essentially a property concept; any property that a man does not effectually dispose of remains his own". These trusts come in two forms: [...] automatic resulting trusts, and presumed resulting trusts. Automatic resulting trusts arise from a [...] "gap" [...] in the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed: it is against principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. They occur in one of four situations: where there is no declaration of trust, where an express trust fails, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Rules differ depending on the situation and the type of original trust under dispute; failed charitable trusts, for example, have the property reapplied in a different way from other forms of trust.|$|E

50|$|Equitable {{conversion}} is {{a doctrine}} {{of the law of}} real property under which a purchaser of real property becomes the <b>equitable</b> owner of <b>title</b> to the property at the time he/she signs a contract binding him/her to purchase the land at a later date. The seller retains legal title of the property prior to the date of conveyance, but this land interest is considered personal property (a right to the payment of money, rather than a right to the property). The risk of loss is then transferred to the buyerif a house on the property burns down after the contract has been signed, but before the deed is conveyed, the buyer will nevertheless have to pay the agreed-upon purchase price for the land. Such issues can and should be avoided by parties by stipulating in the contract who will bear the loss in such occurrences. The above rule varies by jurisdiction, but is the general rule.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{more states}} are lien-theory states than are title-theory states. In title-theory states, a {{mortgage}} {{continues to be}} a conveyance of legal title to secure a debt, while the mortgagor still retains <b>equitable</b> <b>title.</b> In lien-theory states, mortgages and deeds of trust have been redesigned so that they now impose a non-possessory lien on the title to the mortgaged property, while the mortgagor still holds both legal and <b>equitable</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E

40|$|One {{intervention}} {{intended to}} ameliorate poverty and its subsidiary effects is {{the distribution of}} legal title to land to poor urban dwellers, otherwise known as land titling. Given {{the billions of dollars}} that the World Bank, country-based development agencies, regional development banks, and developing countries themselves have spent on land titling programs, it {{has become one of the}} most important property law issues confronting the developing world. Several countries have undertaken comprehensive urban land titling programs to transform the dwellings of those who live in the squalor of squatter settlements into assets recognized by the formal sector. This Article accepts as a given that land titling programs are moving forward and millions of dollars are being spent on them - the purpose of this Article is to take the next step of evaluating how such programs are best designed. The goal of urban titling programs should be to remove structural barriers that contribute to cycles of poverty by limiting indigent populations 2 ̆ 7 access to opportunity and their long-term ability to succeed. First, this Article reviews the literature regarding land titling to give a sense of how my contributions are situated within the larger academic discussion. Second, I develop a theory of how best to achieve titling mobility, which is a goal attained when the state allocates land title in a manner that eliminates structural barriers that impair poor people 2 ̆ 7 s social mobility and ability to accumulate wealth in the long-term. I argue that favorable location of titled land, and procedures that ensure <b>equitable</b> distribution of <b>title</b> among women and men, are essential. Third, I use the Peruvian, Philippine, and South African land titling programs as models to test my theory of how best to achieve titling mobility, by investigating how each government 2 ̆ 7 s method of allocating land titles affects poor populations. Fourth, I examine the distributional consequences of titling programs by focusing on who benefits from the resources expended and suggest how the Peruvian, Philippine, and South African models should be adjusted to comport with my theory of how best to achieve titling mobility...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, the UTC {{requires}} that a trust {{must not have}} the same person as the sole trustee and sole beneficiary. [...] Under ancient common law principles, a trust could not exist unless there was at least some [...] "title split"that is, the same person cannot generally hold all legal and all <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> at the same time. If the legal and <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> merge in the same person, the trust is considered nonexistent under the so-called merger doctrine.|$|E
50|$|Seisin is the {{important}} understanding that property owned in fee simple consists of two different parts; namely, 1) the naked legal title, and 2) the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> and that these two properties may not be forever separated. Hence in Landlord and Tenant law {{the owner of the}} fee is well seised because he owns both the naked legal title and the <b>equitable</b> <b>title.</b> When the landlord rents his property the Lessee is vested with <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> and the peaceable enjoyment of the property during his or her tenure. When the Lessee moves out, the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> is joined with the naked legal title and the gap in seisin is closed and the owner regains fee simple title. Commonly when trusts are created the trust owns the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> administered that is administered by a trustee who owes a fiduciary duty to the beneficiary(ies). On the termination of the trust, the <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> either passes to the beneficiaries or reverts to the Trustor/Settlor/Grantor and again the gap in seisin ends. The Merrill Lynch Ready Asset Trust, the first of the money market accounts when established in the 1970s, named a newly born son of one of the Merrill Lynch executives by whom to measure the duration as 21 years beyond the demise of that child. At the end of the period the assets of the trust then are to be distributed to the beneficiaries and the trust extinguished. Common English practice was to create a trust whose term ended upon the demise of the last living heir of her Britannic Majesty Queen Victoria whose descendants are well known but even that practice is discouraged. But the Southland Royalty Trust was created to endure until the demise of the last living descendant of signors of the Declaration of Independence, who are unknown thereby creating an entity that likely violates the rule against perpetuities because it can never end hence the gap in seisin never can close.|$|E

5000|$|Deeds {{of trust}} differ from {{mortgages}} in that deeds of trust always involve {{at least three}} parties, where the third party holds the legal title, while {{in the context of}} mortgages, the mortgagor gives legal title directly to the mortgagee. [...] In either case, <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> remains with the borrower. Both mortgages and deeds of trust are essentially security instruments in the form of conveyances; that is, they appear to provide on their face for absolute conveyances of legal title, but it is implicitly understood that the borrower is retaining <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> and the conveyance is intended to merely create a security interest. This confusing situation is a legacy of the archaic (and now-obsolete) common law requirement of livery of seisin, under which English common law courts had refused to enforce shifting fees or springing freehold interests (that is, a gage for years that was supposed to automatically expand to fee simple title if the underlying debt was not repaid).|$|E

5000|$|The case {{presents}} no {{elements of}} <b>equitable</b> <b>title</b> or of breach of trust.
