Exactly when the zoonosis occurred is not known. Some molecular dating studies suggest that HIV-1 group M had its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) (that is, started to spread in the human population) in the early 20th century, probably between 1915 and 1941. A study published in 2008, analyzing viral sequences recovered from a recently discovered biopsy made in Kinshasa, in 1960, along with previously known sequences, suggested a common ancestor between 1873 and 1933 (with central estimates varying between 1902 and 1921). Genetic recombination had earlier been thought to [...] "seriously confound" [...] such phylogenetic analysis, but later [...] "work has suggested that recombination {{is not likely to}} systematically bias results", although recombination is [...] "expected to increase variance". The results of a 2008 phylogenetics study support the later work and indicate that HIV evolves [...] "fairly reliably". Further research was hindered due to the primates being critically endangered. Sample analyses resulted in little data due to the rarity of experimental material. The researchers, however, were able to hypothesize a phylogeny from the gathered data. They were also able to use the molecular clock of a specific strain of HIV to determine the initial <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> which is estimated to be around 1915-1931.|$|E

Among the many pro- cesses necessary to validate calculated aerodynamic models, real time pressure measurements are made on the wings during test flights. Such measurements are currently performed using wired sensors, with all the cost and weight problems it causes. Advances in wireless sensor network performances and improvement of attainable bit rates allow research on such measurement systems using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, current WSN synchronization protocols do not reach performances required for a reliable correlation of data collected by all the sensors. In this paper, we present a solution to overcome this difficulty to reach sub-microsecond synchronization based on cross-layered design. Specific algorithms are implanted into the MAC and physical layers and form a cross-layered synchronization protocol for deterministic Wireless Sensor Networks named WiDeCS (Wireless Deterministic Clock Synchronization). This protocol propagates master time reference to nodes of a cluster tree network. WiDeCS Cross layered scheme is possible thanks to flag signals in the physical layer. These signals capture precise <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> and reception. Hardware level simulations show a synchronization precision of 100 ns.

These processes are complex and highly regulated, reflecting their importance in normal brain functioning and homeostasis. Sustaining synaptic transmission depends on the continuing cycle of synaptic vesicle formation, release, and endocytosis, which requires proteins such as dynamin, syndapin, synapsin, and synaptic vesicle protein 2 A. Synaptic transmission is regulated by diverse mechanisms, including presynaptic modulators of synaptic vesicle formation and release, postsynaptic receptors and signaling, and modulators of neurotransmission. Neurotransmitters released presynaptically can bind to their postsynaptic receptors, the inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic receptors or the excitatory glutamate receptors. Once released, glutamate activates a variety of postsynaptic receptors including α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate, and metabotropic receptors. The activation of the receptors triggers downstream signaling cascades generating {{a vast array of}} effects, which can be modulated by a numerous auxiliary regulatory subunits. Moreover, different neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), somatostatin, ghrelin, and galanin, act as regulators of diverse synaptic functions and along with the classic neurotransmitters.

One is the Retention of Breath (Pās-i Anfās) and another is the Translation of Gorakh (Tarjumah-i Gorakh). Despite the different titles, different translation styles, omissions, and additions, they are supposed to have been based on almost identical texts or oral tradition that contain the same number of verses as the longer version. Thus far, the examination of Persian translations has clarified that the source text may have been some kind of compendium of Nātha doctrines.

I present a simple spreadsheet-based method that uses multiple contact dates to calculate the possible incubation periods of SARS. The appearance and rapid spread of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS), caused by a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1 – 3), has already had a notable economic and social impact (4, 5). SARS has no definitive cure, although hospitalized patients have been empirically treated with combinations of antibiotics, steroids, antiviral drugs (typically ribavirin and oseltamivir), and mechanical ventilation (6, 7). No known drug can be used prophylactically, nor is does a vaccine exist. Thus, {{to stop the spread of}} the disease, public health officials have to rely almost completely on placing those who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV under quarantine and isolating those with suspected, probable, and confirmed SARS cases. To make quarantine and isolation as effective as possible, knowing the range of the possible incubation period of SARS is essential. Mathematical modelers also need to know the characteristics of the incubation period to provide estimates of possible spread and model the potential impact of interventions. Many SARS patients often report more than one possible <b>date</b> <b>of</b> contact with another known SARS patient (6, 7), however, which results in multiple <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>transmission</b> and infection (Table).

The rate of nucleotide substitutions and time to the most recent common ancestors (tMRCA) of genotype 5 a isolates were estimated. The divergence of all the French HCV genotype 5 a strains included in this study was dated to 1939 [95 % HPD: 1921 - 1956], and the tMRCA of isolates from central France was dated to 1954 [1942 - 1967], which is in agreement with epidemiological data.

Aphids host the obligatory endosymbiont Buchnera, which is required for reproduction, together with facultative symbionts whose frequencies vary across aphid populations. These maternally transmitted secondary symbionts have been particularly studied in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, which harbors at least 8 distinct bacterial species (not counting Buchnera) having environmentally dependent effects on host fitness. In particular, these symbiont species are associated with pea aphid populations feeding on specific plants. Although they are maternally inherited, these bacteria are occasionally transferred across insect lineages. One mechanism of such nonmaternal transfer is paternal transmission to the progeny during sexual reproduction.

To better characterize this process, we investigated inheritance patterns of 7 symbiont species during sexual reproduction of pea aphids through a crossing experiment involving 49 clones belonging to 9 host-specialized biotypes, and 117 crosses. Symbiont species in the progeny were detected with diagnostic qualitative PCR at the fundatrix stage hatching from eggs and in later parthenogenetic generations. We found no confirmed case <b>of</b> paternal <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> symbionts to the progeny, and we observed that maternal <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> a particular symbiont species (Serratia symbiotica) was quite inefficient. We discuss these observations in respect to the ecology of the pea aphid...|$|R

25|$|The {{significance}} of 52 rests both upon its proposed early dating and upon its geographic dispersal from the presumed site of authorship, traditionally {{thought to have}} been Ephesus. As the fragment is removed from the autograph by at least one step <b>of</b> <b>transmission,</b> the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> authorship for the Gospel of John must be at least a few years prior to the writing of 52, whenever that may have been. The location of the fragment in Egypt extends that time even further, allowing for the dispersal of the documents from the point <b>of</b> authorship and <b>transmission</b> to the point of discovery. The Gospel of John is perhaps quoted by Justin Martyr, and hence is highly likely to have been written before c. 160 CE; but 20th century New Testament scholars, most influentially Kurt Aland and Bruce Metzger, have argued from the proposed <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> 52 prior to this, that the latest possible date for the composition of the Gospel should be pushed back into {{the early decades of the}} second century; some scholars indeed arguing that the discovery of 52 implies a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> composition for the Gospel no later than the traditionally accepted <b>date</b> <b>of</b> c. 90 CE, or even earlier.|$|R
40|$|Background An {{understanding}} of the risk and timing <b>of</b> mother-to-child <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> HIV- 1 in the postnatal period {{is important for the}} development of public-health strategies. We aimed to estimate the rate and timing <b>of</b> late postnatal <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> HIV- 1 [...] 1 * Methods We did an international multicentre pooled analysis of individual data from prospective cohort studies of children followed-up from birth born to HIV- 1 -infected mothers. We enrolled all uninfected children confirmed by HIV- 1 -DNA PCR, HIV- 1 serology, or both. Late postnatal transmission was taken to have occurred if a child later became infected. We calculated duration of follow-up for non-infected children from the time of negative diagnosis to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the last laboratory follow-up, or for infected children to the mid-point between the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> last negative and first positive results. We stratified the analysis for breastfeeding. Findings Less than 5 % of the 2807 children in four studie...|$|R
40|$|A virtual {{channels}} scheduling algorithm {{with broad}} applicability based on movable boundary is proposed. According to the types <b>of</b> <b>date</b> sources, <b>transmission</b> time slots {{are divided into}} synchronous ones and asynchronous ones with a movable boundary between them. During the synchronous time slots, the virtual channels are scheduled with a polling algorithm; during the asynchronous time slots, the virtual channels are scheduled with an algorithm based on virtual channel urgency and frame urgency. If there are no valid frames in the corresponding VC at a certain synchronous time slot, a frame of the other synchronous VCs or asynchronous VCs will be transmitted through the physical channel. Only {{when there are no}} valid frames in all VCs would an idle frame be generated and transmitted. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm yields much lower scheduling delay and higher channel utilization ratio than those based on unmovable boundary or virtual channel urgency in many kinds of sources. Therefore, broad applicability can be achieved by the proposed algorithm...|$|R
