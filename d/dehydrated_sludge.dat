In the present work, concentrations of these organic compounds in sludge samples from Cluj-Napoca wastewater treatment plant are reported. The objective was to investigate PAHs in sludge from wastewater treatment plant and to assess their potential for land application. Primary sludge, fermented sludge, fermented concentrated sludge, anaerobic-digested <b>dehydrated</b> <b>sludge</b> and rejection water samples were collected monthly from December 2012. Ultrasonic assisted extraction with hexane was used, being followed by filtration and concentration to dryness in a rotary evaporator; the obtained residue was redisolved in acetonitrile. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis was achieved using an Agilent 1100 system consisting in a solvent degasser, a quaternary pumping system, an autosampler, a column oven, a diode-array detector and a fluorescence detector. Separations were accomplished using an Envirosep PP column with acetonitrile:water as mobile phase (45 : 55 v/v). Detection limit was 0. 001 g / kg, with good linearities for all PAHs, with correlation coefficients higher than 0. 998.

40|$|A {{direct result}} of the growing number of {{municipal}} wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) has been an increase in the generation of large amounts of sewage sludge that requires environmentally acceptable final destination. To decrease the volume of sludge, a common technique is drying the sludge at a low temperature in rotary kilns. The result of this process is a granulated material consisting of <b>dehydrated</b> <b>sludge</b> pellets. After this treatment, this pelletized material becomes easier to manipulate, but it also becomes a more toxic waste, containing dangerous substances, mostly of the lipid type. At its final stage, this material is usually incinerated, used as a comburent material, used as an agricultural fertilizer, or used in the cement industry. Each application has its own problems and requires remediation measures from the safety and environmental viewpoints. In this study, we looked beyond these possible applications and analyzed the transformation of sewage sludge through a ceramization process into a material similar to expanded clays; we subsequently explored its uses in the building industry or in the agriculture industry, among others. Both the properties of the product material and the production method were characterized, and an environmental analysis was conducted. The new, lightweight material had a microstructure with open porosity and low thermal conductivity. Environmental characterization such as the leaching test revealed that undetectable amounts of hazardous metals from the sludge were present in the leachate after the sludge went through a thermal treatment, despite their initial presence (with the exception of vanadium, which could pose some restrictions on some of the proposed uses for the final product). Toxicity tests also showed negative results. The study of gaseous emissions during production revealed emissions factors similar to those during the production of conventional clay ceramics, although with higher organic emissions. As for conventional clay ceramics, industrial production would require the implementation of some type of air-depuration system. The results showed that the ceramization of sludge pellets is a promising valorization technique worth considering from both the economic and technological perspectives.

40|$|Goal, Scope and Background. Polycyclic Musks (PCMs) {{enter the}} {{environment}} via the waste water system. Because of their persistence, they can accumulate in different matrices like sewage sludge or biota. By {{the use of}} sewage sludge as a fertilizer, PCMs are transferred to agricultural soils. Therefore, in Part 1 of the study, screening tests were performed to investigate the occurrence of PCMs in sewage sludge. For a preliminary risk assessment, further information is needed about their behaviour in the terrestrial environment. Hence, Part 2 of the study examined the adsorption of PCMs to soil, their dissipation and leaching in soil, and their uptake by plants. Methods. In the screening study, samples of activated sewage sludge were taken both in summer and in winter at 21 treatment plants. In order to get {{an overview of the}} contamination situation, sampling covered different types of treatment plants (in rural, urban, industrial areas). Analytical methods for the determination of HHCB, AHTN, ADBI, ATTN, AHDI and ATII in the sludge samples were developed and applied. Results. The analytical screening of PCMs showed their presence in activated and dried sewage sludge samples. HHCB and AHTN represented about 95 % of the PCMs investigated. Their concentrations in the activated sludge samples varied between 2. 9 and 10. 4 mg/kg dry mass (dm) and 1. 1 to 4. 2 mg/kd dm, respectively. Although different types of sewage treatment plants were investigated, similar PCM levels were found, showing the widespread input of these compounds into domestic waste water. Discussion. PCM concentrations in activated sludge varied widely. The variation drops substantially when concentrations are related to the varying dry mass. In <b>dehydrated</b> <b>sludge,</b> PCM concentrations were up to 24 mg/kg dm for HHCB and up to 6. 9 mg/kg dm for AHTN. These high values are comparable to those obtained in other investigations analysing PCMs. If the degradation of organic mass during anaerobic decomposition is included in the evaluation, the figures obtained are comparable to those for activated sludge. Elimination in sewage sludge was higher in summer than in winter. Therefore, the contamination of the sludges in winter reached higher levels compared to the summer. Conclusions. The results show that PCMs are widespread contaminants in sewage sludge. Recommendations and Perspectives. PCM should be considered in a risk assessment as potential contaminants of sewage sludge destined for agricultural use. Due to the high PCM levels in sewage sludge, further investigations into the degradation and elimination behaviour in sewage sludge have to be carried out, including that involving PCM metabolites such as lactone derivatives...|$|E

Attention {{was focused on}} the effect of the SS content on the gasification performance and on the environmental impact of the process. The results showed {{that it is possible to}} co-gasify SS with wood pellets (WPs) in updraft fixed-bed gasification installations. However, at high content of sewage sludge the gasification process can become instable because of the very high ash content and low ash fusion temperatures of SS. At an equivalent ratio of 0. 25, compared with wood pellets gasification, the addition of sewage sludge led to a reduction of gas yield in favor of an increase of condensate production with consequent cold gas efficiency decrease. Low concentrations of dioxins/furans and PAHs were measured in the gas produced by SS gasification, well below the limiting values for the exhaust gaseous emissions. NH 3, HCl and HF contents were very low because most of these compounds were retained in the wet scrubber systems. On the other hand, high H 2 S levels were measured due to high sulfur content of SS. Heavy metals supplied with the feedstocks were mostly retained in gasification solid residues. The leachability tests performed according to European regulations showed that metals leachability was within the limits for landfilling inert residues. On the other hand, sulfate and chloride releases were found to comply with the limits for non-hazardous residues...|$|R

For anaerobic digestion of different substrates and determination of biomethane potential, Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS II) device was used. AMPTS II is an analytical laboratory scale device used in measurements of ultra low speed production of biomethane produced during the anaerobic digestion of biodegradable substrates. Although biogas yields of biogas plants arelimited to the specific substrates, methane yields are difficult to generalize from the collected data in published literature due to different modifications of substrates, including particle size reduction or chemical pretreatment all affecting their properties and energy recovery. Therefore, for biogas plant decision making the data need {{to be derived from}} inoculum of concrete biogas plant and substrates in such a condition as to be dosed in anaerobic reactors on real industrial scale. By upgrading commercial system AMPTS II from 0. 5 liters to 5 liters, a pilot scale device was developed and validated for such real-scale experiments mirroring anaerobic reactors at the biogas plant. On 5 liter pilot scale biomethane yield of 24 substrates in solid or liquid form was assessed and compared with existing published data. By adding a variety of additives in the form of enzymes and micro-organisms in the process of anaerobic digestion, the impact on the production of methane and enhancement of the production of methane was evaluated.

Starting from {{an analysis of}} typical sewage sludge characteristics as found in literature, the most promising disposal options are presented. A focus on incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) follows. Most of the authors agree on considering pyrolysis and gasification as the most viable treatments for sludge in the near future. For this reason, the last two chapters offer {{a brief description of}} these two processes and their products. Sewage sludge Characteristics Sewage sludge is a kind of waste coming from municipal wastewater treatment plants. In these facilities, high quantities of water are treated every day to eliminate bacteria, viruses and pollutants. As main output, these plants produce treated water and sewage sludge. A qualitative example in Fig. 1 shows the main steps of the process followed by municipal wastewater treatment plants in Bologna district (Italy). The calculations refer to 100 cubic meters of wastewater entering the municipal treatment plant. Sludge, which constitutes 1 % of wastewater entering the plant, is digested anaerobically and <b>dehydrated.</b> Sewage <b>sludge,</b> at the outlet after mechanical drying, is made of approximately 80 % moisture and 20 % dry matter. The management of this product has become a serious problem in Europe over the last years because of legislation and environmental issues. Typical destinations for sewage sludge were agriculture, forestry, incineration, land building or landfills, but most of them have been banned or limited by recent EU and local laws. Sludge constituents are organic and inorganic compounds, including traces of heavy metals such as chromium, zinc, mercury, lead, nickel, cadmium and copper. These elements restrict the use of sludge in agriculture, because their accumulation is harmful to the environment and particularly to the food chain...|$|R
40|$|Current {{wastewater}} treatment processes {{are not able}} to completely remove many organic pollutants. The increasing use of the sludge derived from {{wastewater treatment}} plants (WWTP) in agricultural lands therefore becomes a source for micropollutants to enter the environment. An eco-friendly biotechnological treatment which employs the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor was assessed to remove several groups of pharmaceuticals at pre-existent concentrations from sewage sludge. First, two different strategies were applied in sterile conditions to demonstrate the colonization and degrading ability of the fungus: solidphase systems with <b>dehydrated</b> <b>sludge</b> and a lignocellulosic substrate, and slurry bioreactors with sludge from the outlet of an anaerobic digester, all from the same WWTP. Fungal colonization and activity were monitored with ergosterol content, laccase activity and a degradation test (ND 24). The solid phase biopile treatment resulted in the complete removal of seven out of 14 detected pharmaceuticals, and between 42 - 80 % for the remaining compounds. Meanwhile, the bioslurry reactor produced a complete elimination of eight out of 24 pharmaceutical agents detected, and 26 - 92 % for the others. However, for the same compounds, in most of the cases the solid-phase treatment showed higher removal efficiency, plus better results in terms of reducing the toxicity of the sludge after the treatment. Next step consisted in applying T. versicolor in non-sterile sludge, which was assessed in solid-phase biopiles, considering the better fungal performance on these systems. Success in the fungal bioaugmentation was monitored by community analyses, which compared the bioaugmented (TVB) and non-bioaugmented (NB) systems. DGGE profiles revealed some inhibition caused by the fungus over bacterial community and also the predominance of T. versicolor in the TVB-systems up to 21 -d (half-treatment), to later disappear {{by the end of the}} process and being replaced by other fungi. Results permitted to find the relationship of the fungal survival with the degradation of pharmaceuticals on time. Results include the identification of the most abundant bacterial/fungal taxons present in the sludge biopiles. After 42 -d of treatment, removals over 50 % for eight out of the nine therapeutic agents detected were obtained; only carbamazepine could not be removed at all, contrary to sterile conditions. Overall results suggest that mycoremediation is a potential strategy for the degradation of emerging pollutants from sludge.

40|$|Glycol based fluids {{are used}} to deice and {{anti-ice}} aircraft surfaces before takeoff of airplanes. It is strictly for security purposes that large volumes of aircraft deicers are used at airports. Hundreds of thousands of liters are used every year at small airports and millions of liters {{in the case of}} major airports. During deicing or anti-icing activities, an appreciable amount of deicing fluids mix with airport runoffs and finds its way into nearby streams and lakes. The objectives of this research is (1) to determine the role of temperature and initial concentration of deicers on biodegradation process, (2) to evaluate the conditions of biodegradation of deicers in a municipal biological treatment plant, and (3) to study the toxicity of deicers for different aquatic species. Results of the experiments indicate that the biodegradation rate of deicers depends on temperature and the ratio of initial concentration of deicers to microorganisms (C[subscript i]/X[subscript i]). The rate of removal of the deicing chemical follows a first-order model. Degradation rate coefficient (κ) at 20 ± 2 °C varies from 1. 6 d[superscript - 1] for C[subscript i]/X[subscript i] = 0. 7 to 0. 07 d[superscript - 1] when C[subscript i]/X[subscript i] = 19. 5. At a temperature of 10 ± 1 °C, κ decreases to 0. 72 when C[subscript i]/X[subscript i] = 0. 7. No materially different k values κ values (0. 05 d[superscript - 1]) were recorded for the experiments at 4 ± 1 °C when C[subscript i]/X[subscript i] increased from 1. 8 to 3. 2. The results obtained suggest that biodegradation of deicers will take place in segments of the streams located far downward the discharge point. However, high concentrations at the discharge point {{could turn out to be}} toxic to aquatic biota. It is possible to treat deicing fluids at a municipal biological treatment plant. Biotest shows that deicers were slightly toxic to the microorganisms of activated sludge. The toxic deicer concentration responsible for a 50 % reduction of the respiration rate is about 30 % in volume. The addition of deicing fluids did not have any impact on the pH of the treatment plant effluent; however it exerts an additional oxygen demand. The presence of deicing fluids in the bioreactor could delay nitrification and, increases the filamentous growth. The injection of deicing fluids did not impair the treatment plant efficiency for BOD[subscript 5], COD and SS removal. Also, values of BOD[subscript 5], SS and phosphorus of the effluent were within the range usually recorded at the treatment plant. Chemical analyses demonstrate that deicing fluids did not have an impact on the <b>dehydrated</b> <b>sludge.</b> Deicers and especially anti-icers are more toxic than pure glycol. Green algae Selenastrum capricornutum turns out to be more sensitive than marine bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum. Inhibitory concentration IC[subscript 50]- 30 min of pure ethylene glycol for Photobacterium phosphoreum is estimated to 84 780 mg/L while IC[subscript 50]- 30 min of de-icing fluid UCAR XL 54 and anti-icing fluid UC 5. 1 are 25 752 mg/L and 5 425 mg/L respectively. In the case of Selenastrum capricornutum, IC[subscript 50]- 96 h of pure ethylene glycol is estimated to 5 412 mg/L. This result is presently used by Environment Canada in the derivation of the water quality guideline on ethylene glycol. Inhibitory concentration IC[subscript 50]- 96 h of de-icing fluid UCAR XL 54 and anti-icing fluids UCAR ULTRA and UC 5. 1 are 2 575 mg/L, 2 785 mg/L and 41 mg/L respectively...|$|E
40|$|Sewage sludge is {{the residue}} {{produced}} by the domestic or industrial wastewaters treatment plants. According {{to the principles of}} sustainability, several restrictions have been imposed on the conventional methods currently adopted for its disposal. The consequent need to develop alternative processes for the use of sewage sludge for energy purposes such as gasification requires experimental tests in order to quantify the potential energy recover from this waste, as well as to evaluate the optimum conditions for its gasification. In the present study, the gasification with air of <b>dehydrated</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> (20 wt. % moisture) mixed with conventional woody biomass was performed in a pilot scale updraft fixed-bed gasifier operating at atmospheric pressure. Attention was focused on the effect of the sewage sludge content and the equivalent ratio (ratio between the amount of air used and the stoichiometric air needed for combustion) on the product yields, gas composition and cold gas efficiency. The results obtained showed {{that it is possible to}} cogasify sewage sludge with wood pellets in pre-existing updraft fixed-bed gasification installations. However, at high sewage sludge content (P 70 w/w%) slagging and an excessive clinker formation may occur in the oxidation zone because of the high ash content and low ash fusion temperatures of the sludge making the gasification process unstable. In addition, the formation of an ash layer on the grate requires persistent ash discharge that introduces instabilities in the gasifier operating conditions. The rise in the equivalent ratio led to higher gas and carbon yields and cold gas efficiencies. At the optimal equivalent ratio of 0. 25, compared with wood pellets gasification, the addition of sewage sludge with 20 wt. % moisture up to 70 w/w% gave rise to decreasing the dry gas yield from 1. 56 to 1. 07 Nm 3 /kg of feedstock due to the higher moisture and ash content of sewage sludge and to moderate reductions of the gas lower heating value and cold gas efficiency from 5. 8 to 4. 9 MJ/Nm 3 dry and from 60 % to 55 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the degree of municipal wastewater contamination with intestinal parasite eggs of the genera Ascaris, Toxocara, and Trichuris at individual stages of treatment, and indication of potentially weak points in the hygienisation of sewage sludge. The study was conducted in 17 municipal mechanical-biological wastewater treatment plants which, to a slight degree, differed in the technological process of wastewater treatment and the method of hygienisation of sewage sludge. The selected treatment plants, located in seven regions, included five classified as large agglomerations (population equivalent - PE > 100 000), ten as medium-size (PE 15 000 - 100 000), and two as smaller size with PE 10 000 - 5000. The largest number of viable eggs of Ascaris spp., Toxocara spp., and Trichuris spp. was found in the sewage sludge collected from the primary settling tank. A slightly lower number of the eggs were found in the samples of excess sludge, which indicates that the sedimentation process in the primary settling tank is not sufficiently long to effectively separate parasites’ eggs from the sewage treated. The number of eggs of Ascaris spp. and Toxocara spp. in the fermented sludge was nearly 3 times lower than that in the raw sludge. The effectiveness of hygienisation of <b>dehydrated</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> by means of quicklime was confirmed in two wastewater treatment plants, with respect to Ascaris spp. eggs, in three plants with respect to Toxocara spp. eggs, and in one plant with respect to Trichuris spp. eggs. The mean reduction of the number of eggs was 65 %, 61 %, and 100 %, respectively. In one wastewater treatment plant, a reduction in the number of viable eggs of Ascaris and Trichuris species was also noted as a result of composting sludge by 85 % and 75 %, respectively. In the remaining treatment plants, no effect of hygienisation of sewage sludge was observed on the contents of viable eggs of these nematodes...|$|R

Two aerobic incubations were performed with mixtures of sludge and the top layer of a Haplic Pdzol, at a rate equivalent to 10 ton dry matter ha- 1. During 140 days, the CO 2 -C emissions and the mineral N in soil were periodically measured. At the end of the incubation period, several soil properties were evaluated. The higher CO 2 -C emission was found in the mixed sludges while the anaerobic sludge presented the lower value. The treatment of anaerobic sludge with lime led to an increase of CO 2 -C emission and nitrogen mineralization from the sludge, indicating that lime treatment promoted more favorable conditions to sludge mineralization. At the end of the incubation period, sludge-amended soil had higher pH, more evident on the lime-treated sludge, and higher amounts of available nutrients, namely, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium. The balance between applied carbon and C-CO 2 emission, proved that sewage sludge increases carbon accumulation in soil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{thesis is}} based on the target of the <b>sludge</b> which was <b>dehydrated</b> and percolated by sewage {{treatment}} plant. It conducts the feasibility analysis for the agricultural usage of sludge in cities, and carries out composting experiment of <b>dehydrated</b> and filtered <b>sludge</b> which lasts for about fifteen days. This thesis also does some research on the techniques of composting and parameters of sludge. This thesis has some researches on the temperature of sludge, moisture, organic matter, pH, total phosphorus content of nitrogen, heavy metals content and forms, the germination rate index (GI), and other changes during the process of composting. The results show that, after the composting, there has a significant decline in moisture content of the sludge and the organic matters; pH remains neutral; nitrogen has declined; total phosphorus increased. Composting can make majority of heavy metals reduced which was absorbed by the plant that means the decline of unstable heavy metal content. After the composting, germinations rate index (GI) is more than 50 percent, which shows that the composting products have no toxicity and indicates the maturity of composting. Through the analysis of the organic matter of the sludge plant, PH, plant nutrients (N, P,) content, heavy metal content and its forms of distribution and germination rate index (GI), it shows that the sludge of this plant has a good agricultural prospect...|$|R
40|$|Poster presentado en la European Geosciences Union General Assembly celebrada en Viena del 7 al 12 de abril de 2013 The re-use {{of sewage}} {{treatment}} plant (STP) effluents is currently {{one of the most}} employed strategies in several countries to deal with the water shortage problem. Some pesticides are bio-accumulative and due to their toxicity they can affect non-target organisms, especially in the aquatic ecosystems, threating their ecological status. Despite these facts, and to our knowledge, there are few peer-reviewed articles that report concentrations of pesticides in Spanish STPs. This work presents the results of an extensive survey that was carried out in October of 2010 in 15 of the STPs of Ebro, Guadalquivir, Jucar and Llobregat rivers in Spain. Forty-three currently used pesticides, belonging to anilide, neonicotinoid, thiocarbamate, acaricide, juvenile hormone mimic, insect growth regulator, urea, azole, carbamate, chloroacetanilide, triazine and organophosphorus, have been monitored. Integrated samples of influent and effluent, and <b>dehydrated,</b> lyophilized <b>sludge</b> from 15 STPs located along the rivers were analyzed for pesticide residues. With these data, removal efficiencies are also calculated. Extraction of water samples was performed through Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) and sludge samples were extracted using the QuEchERS method. Pesticide determination was carried out using Liquid Chromatograph ¿ tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Recoveries ranged from 48 % to 70 %, in water samples, and from 40 to 105 %, in sludge samples. The limits of quantification were 0. 01 - 5 ng L- 1 for the former, and 0. 1 - 5. 0 ng g- 1 for the latter. In terms of frequency of detection, 31 analytes were detected in influent, 29 in effluent and 11 in sludge samples. Organophosphorus pesticides were the most frequently detected in all wastewater samples, but azole, urea, triazine, neonicotinoid and the insect growth regulator were also commonly found. Imazalil revealed the maximum concentration in wastewater samples from all rivers except the Guadalquivir, in which diuron presented the maximum one. Eleven pesticides including five organophosphorus, two azoles, one triazine, one chloroacetanilide, one juvenile hormone mimic and one acaricide were detected in the sludge samples. Accordingly, organophosphorus were the most frequently detected pesticides in the sludge samples, but the highest concentration was observed for imazalil. The higher concentration of this azole in the influent and their possible stronger adsorption may be the reason for their higher concentration in the sludge samples. The removal efficiency of pesticides was calculated from the analyte concentration in influent (Cin) and effluent (Cef) : [(Cin-Cef) /Cin] x 100 %. The removal of organophosporus ranged from - 810, 47 to 93, 11 %, meanwhile azoles and ureas were not removed in the STPs. The poor elimination of pesticides by {{sewage treatment plant}}s presented in this study could be related to the treatment process used, hydraulic and solid retention times, besides the dilution and temperature of the raw sewage and the plant¿s configuration. These poor efficiencies are responsible of the high pesticides concentration (e. g. diuron) found in some effluents, which may endanger water quality of the ecosystem when they are re-used or directly discharged into the river. In fact, with respect to the Maximum Allowable Concentrations (MAC) stipulated by the Directive 2008 / 105 /EC for pesticides in inland and other surface waters (Council of the European Communities, 2008), diuron exceeded these limits. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that, even though, the pesticides concentrations measured were relatively low (according to directives); this study analysed just some of them. A wide variety of other compounds, including other pesticides and pesticides transformation products, may contribute to the bad quality of the water ecosystems.
