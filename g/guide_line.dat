40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{experience}} of last five years, during which 24 guide liens about the most important aspects of Occupational Physician activity have been produced, the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene (SIMLII) delegated a specific working group for updating the methodology to be adopted for <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> and other instruments for improving and standardizing the current activity in our professional field. SIMLII produced {{in the context of the}} specific Education and Accreditation Programme for occupational physicians prepared from 2002 25 <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> or other informative instruments on the most important and controversial themes in which our discipline is involved. They were considered and treated to meet the need to improve and standardise activities and to modify the current approach of occupational physicians and aimed not only at improving the effectiveness of preventive actions but also at constantly adopting rigorous methodologies based where possible on evidence based or on consensus procedures. The Directive of SIMLII was firmly convinced about the opportunity-necessity to critically evaluate the experience carried out during the last years, at the light of the National Program for <b>Guide</b> <b>Lines</b> edited By Italian National Health Institute since 2002 and which concerns preparation, dissemination, updating, implementation of <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> in Medicine. The <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> were defined as rational critical effective aid addressed to professionals and patients for health services organization. Relevant was the new Framework Act for the occupational safety and health (Decreto legislativo 81 / 08) too signed by the President of the Italian Republic on April 9, 2008, which for the first time includes and defines in a legislative act the different possible instruments (technical normative, good practices, <b>guide</b> <b>lines).</b> In this paper we present the new methodology defined by our Society for producing the different kind of instruments such as <b>guide</b> <b>lines,</b> consensus conference reports, technology assessments, good practices statements <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> focusing as the main aspects those related to definitions, argument choice, working group and coordinator identification, producing methods, evidence evaluation, grading, quality evaluation using AGREE method, dissemination procedure, the conflict of interest and the possible use for distance formation procedure focusing the recommendations that take a practical-applicative approach...|$|R
25|$|The {{ability to}} {{navigate}} in total darkness using the guideline {{to find the}} way out is a safety critical emergency skill. Line management skills required for cave diving include laying and recovering guide lines using a reel, tie-offs, {{the use of a}} jump line to cross gaps or find a lost <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> in silted out conditions, identifying the direction along the guideline leading to the exit, and the skills of dealing with a break in a guideline.|$|E
25|$|In {{all three}} of these situations, a <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> or {{lifeline}} from the exit to the diver is the standard method of reducing the risk of being unable to find the way out. A lifeline fixed to the diver is more reliable as {{it is not easy to}} lose, and is often used when diving under ice, where the line is unlikely to snag and the distance is reasonably short, and can be tended by a person at the surface. Static guidelines are more suitable when a lifeline is likely to snag on the environment or on other divers in the group, and may be left in situ to be used for other dives, or recovered on the way out by winding back onto the reel. Guide lines may be very much longer than lifelines, and may be branched and marked. They are used as standard practice for cave diving and wreck penetration.|$|E

2500|$|Guide line: A {{continuous}} <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> {{is maintained}} {{at all times}} between {{the leader of a}} dive team and a fixed point selected outside the cave entrance in open water. Often this line is tied off a second time as a backup directly inside the cavern zone. As the dive leader lays the guideline he takes great care to ensure there is appropriate tension on the line. and that it does not go into line traps. Other team members remain between the lead diver and the exit, in easy reach of the line at all times. If a silt out occurs, divers can find the line and follow it back to the cave entrance. Failure to use a continuous <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> to open water is cited as the most frequent cause of fatality among untrained, non-certified divers who venture into caves.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, {{the mass}} media renewed long-dormant public {{attention}} to the 1955 theft of an even more spectacular Jenny specimen. [...] This was a block of four (positions 65, 66, 75, 76) with a vertical red guide-line through its center, owned by the collector Ethel McCoy, which {{was stolen from a}} stamp show at a Norfolk hotel where it was being exhibited. [...] The top right stamp from this block has never been found; the two left stamps surfaced in the 1970s as single copies offered in auction catalogues and were recovered by the FBI, although they had been camouflaged by minor mutilation: the portions of the right-edge perforations on which parts of the <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> were originally visible had been trimmed off or abraded to remove the red ink. [...] Mrs. McCoy’s will had made the American Philatelic Research Library the legal owner of all four stamps in the block. [...] In 2014 Donald Sundman of the Mystic Stamp Company offered $100,000 in reward money—$50,000 for the two stamps that were still missing—to anyone who could bring them to their rightful owner.
