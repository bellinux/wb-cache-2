5|$|As {{the months}} passed, and the privations in Constantinople increased, the pro-Kantakouzenos faction {{in the capital}} grew as the Empress refused even to {{consider}} negotiations. Twice agents were sent to assassinate Kantakouzenos, but they failed. The Empress eventually fell out with Patriarch John Kalekas, who was deposed in a synod on 2 February 1347. On the same night, supporters of Kantakouzenos opened the disused Golden Gate, and Kantakouzenos entered the city with 1,000 men. Meeting no resistance, his troops surrounded the Palace of Blachernae, the imperial residence, the next morning, but the Empress refused to surrender for several days, still fearful of the <b>fate</b> <b>that</b> awaited her. Kantakouzenos' men grew impatient and stormed part of the palace complex, and John V persuaded his mother to accept a settlement.|$|E

25|$|Pfeiffer {{was born}} in Augsburg on September 20, 1889. His parents were Carl Pfeiffer, the {{proprietor}} of a print-shop, and Elise (née Naegele). The boy's grandfather Jakob, also a printer, had purchased {{the house of the}} humanist Konrad Peutinger, and Pfeiffer would later consider it a special stroke of <b>fate</b> <b>that</b> he had been born and bred in the former home of a central figure from the golden age of humanism in Augsburg. He studied at the Gymnasium of the Benedictine St. Stephen's Abbey, where he was a pupil of P. Beda Grundl, a follower of Wilamowitz. Pfeiffer spent his leisure time with Beda Grundl reading Homer {{and a host of other}} Greek authors.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{in desperation}} {{he used his}} hands. Miaoshan, {{realising}} the <b>fate</b> <b>that</b> the executioner would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave the executioner for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt the executioner generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand the suffering and horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, {{under the}} terms of Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's Secret protocol, Western Volhynia was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR. Part of the local {{population}} viewed it, at least initially, as a form of liberation from Polish rule. However the Soviet governments' anti-religious stance became the new source of oppression, although the Ukrainian form of this persecution was somewhat less rigid than in that of the Russian lands in the early 1920s. The Lavra self-transferred to the Moscow Patriarchy, during this time thousands of Orthodox pilgrims, from all over the USSR, at their own risk, took the chance to pay a visit to the cloister that they feared would share the <b>fate</b> <b>that</b> of all others in the USSR. It was not to be, although the Lavra was thoroughly searched, the monastic livestock, orphanage and other communal services which it provided to the local community were promptly confiscated, the sheer numbers of visitors prevented the Soviets taking immediate action against a place that once again had become a refuge for Orthodoxy.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, {{in a deal}} {{brokered}} by the Obama administration, Italian automaker Fiat {{initiated a}} white knight takeover of Chrysler to save the struggling automaker from liquidation. The deal was immediately compared to the AMC-Renault deal; Some commentators noted the irony in that Chrysler now faced the same <b>fate</b> <b>that</b> AMC faced 30 years earlier, while others expressed skepticism of whether the Italian firm could save Chrysler, given how the Renault deal failed. However, there have been key differences between the two; Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne became CEO of Chrysler {{as part of the}} deal and immediately began globally integrating Fiat and Chrysler's assets and product lines; The Fiat-Chrysler merger doesn't face the political opposition the AMC-Renault deal did since Fiat is entirely private and independent and the US Government supported the merger; Most importantly, while AMC proved to be a continuous money-loser for Renault, Chrysler returned to profitability fairly quickly and has since become an important source of revenue and profits for Fiat, which has been struggling to maintain volume and profitability amid the European debt crisis. The two firms would later fully merge to create Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 5,000 Estonian Jews. About 50% of Estonia's Jewish community, {{aware of the}} <b>fate</b> <b>that</b> otherwise awaited them following the Nazi invasion, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; virtually all those remaining were forced to wear badges identifying them as Jews, stripped of their property, and eventually killed by Einsatzgruppe A and local collaborators {{before the end of}} 1941. With the invasion of the Baltics, the Nazi government found willing volunteers to assist the Einsatzgruppen and auxiliary police from this region, which incidentally enabled them carry-out mass genocide in this region. Right-wing Estonian units, known as the Omakaitse were among those who aided the Einsatzgruppen in killing Jews. At the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, Estonia was reported to be Jew-free. Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated—as was the case for 7,130 Jews sent to Estonia in September 1943, where just a few months later, they were murdered. During the winter of 1941–1942, Einsatzgruppe A operating in Ostland and the Army Group Rear, reported having killed 2,000 Jews in Estonia. An estimated 20,000 Jews were sent to labor camps in Estonia from elsewhere in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Around December 1240 {{news came}} that the Mongols were {{advancing}} towards Hungary. King Bela then installed front line defenses at the Carpathian Mountains, {{after which he}} returned to Buda and called a council of war and ordered unity against the Mongols. The opposite happened, however, {{as many of the}} barons were hostile towards the Cumans. The Hungarian barons noted that there were Cumans in the Mongol armies, but they didn't realize that this was because they were conscripted into it and had no say in the matter. In particular the barons didn't trust Koten, {{despite the fact that the}} Mongols had attacked his people for nearly 20 years. This chaos pushed Bela into a corner; feeling he needed to show his strength and keep the rebellious barons onside, he ordered Koten to be placed under house arrest. This did not placate the barons and had an opposite effect of erroneously seeming to admit that the King harboured doubts about Koten, too. This angered the Cumans, who were far from happy about the actions taken against them, and who had done nothing to invite such actions and hated the Mongols. News arrived on 10 March that the Mongols had attacked the Hungarian defenses at the Carpathian passes. This prompted Bela to send a letter to Duke Frederick of Austria asking for help. Frederick had previously wanted Bela's throne, but Bela responded by amassing a vast army and marching to the gates of Vienna, which forced Frederick to step back. On March 14 news had arrived that the Carpathian defense forces were defeated by the Mongols. Ironically, given the suspicion of the Cumans, they were the only ones who seemed willing to fight the Mongols, the memory of the <b>fate</b> <b>that</b> had befallen them on the steppes still being fresh in their minds. At the time the Hungarian forces were cowered behind the walls of Sibiu. By this time Bela had lost control of his army and many towns were destroyed. Soon thereafter Frederick arrived, and, wishing to harm the country's defense (in revenge to Bela), he stirred up further feelings against the Cumans.|$|E
