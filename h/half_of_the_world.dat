500|$|Long ago, {{there was}} a great world war ended by the efforts of the Avalon Empire, which became the {{dominant}} power in the land. The story begins with Sol, Diana, Glaive and Aigis being sent by the King of Lux to investigate a powerful crystal linked to the balance of the world. Simultaneously, Nacht, Alba, Dusk and Sarah are sent by the Avalon Empire to break their treaty with Lux by stealing the same crystal. On the way to the crystal's shrine, Sol's party aids a mysterious man called Elgo, who agrees to accompany them to the temple. When the two groups meet within the crystal shrine, the crystal's guardian spirit attacks them. Upon its guardian's defeat, the crystal shatters and splits the world into two halves: the [...] "World of Light", ever in daylight, and the [...] "World of Darkness" [...] in which day never rises. Sol, Aigis, Dusk, and Sarah remain in the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and become the [...] "Warriors of Light", with Elgo accompanying them. Nacht, Alba, Diana and Glaive find themselves in the other half and become the [...] "Warriors of Darkness". Both groups of Warriors travel the split world in search of each other. As they travel, they retrieve the fragments of the crystal, which grant them new abilities and gradually cause the world to reform. They also encounter the Avalon Empire and their four Generals: Vata, Baugauven, Asmodai, and Styx. All four generals are defeated except for Vata, who decides to aid the Warriors for reasons unknown. In the battle between the Warriors of Light and Baugauven aboard an Avalon ship, Elgo seemingly sacrifices himself to save the Warriors of Light.|$|E

2500|$|Its exorbitant price {{during the}} Middle Ages—and the {{monopoly}} on the trade held by Italy—was one of the inducements that led the Portuguese to seek a sea route to India. In 1498, Vasco da Gama became {{the first person to}} reach India by sailing around Africa (see Age of Discovery); asked by Arabs in Calicut (who spoke Spanish and Italian) why they had come, his representative replied, [...] "we seek Christians and spices". Though this first trip to India by way of the southern tip of Africa was only a modest success, the Portuguese quickly returned in greater numbers and eventually gained much greater control of trade on the Arabian sea.

2500|$|Propionic acid {{inhibits}} {{the growth}} of mold and some bacteria at the levels between 0.1 and 1% by weight. [...] As a result, most propionic acid produced is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. For animal feed, it is used either directly or as its ammonium salt. The antibiotic Monensin is added to cattle feed to favor propionibacteria over acetic acid producers in the rumen; this produces less carbon dioxide and feed conversion is better. This application accounts for about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> production of propionic acid. Another major application is as a preservative in baked goods, which use the sodium and calcium salts. As a food additive, it is approved {{for use in the}} EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand.

2500|$|The {{treaty was}} {{historically}} important in dividing Latin America, {{as well as}} establishing Spain in the western Pacific until 1898. [...] However, it quickly became obsolete in North America, and later in Asia and Africa, where it affected colonization. [...] It was ignored by other European nations, and with the decline of Spanish and Portuguese power, the home countries were unable to hold many of their claims, much less expand them into poorly explored areas. [...] Thus, with sufficient backing, it became possible for any European state to colonize open territories, or those weakly held by Lisbon or Madrid. [...] With the fall of Malacca to the Dutch, the VOC (Dutch East India Company) took control of Portuguese possessions in Indonesia, claiming Western New Guinea and Western Australia, as New Holland. Eastern Australia remained in the Spanish <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> until claimed for Britain by James Cook in 1770.
