40|$|Acquisition {{research}} (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy) A {{fundamental problem}} in reaping {{the benefits of}} using an Open Architecture (OA) approach to developing integrated warfare systems (IWS) is the requirement for the multiple parties involved to collaborate. This was {{less of a problem}} when single vendors managed the entire acquisition life cycle. To take advantage of the potential of OA to use common off the shelf software modules, multiple vendors, greater access and involvement of the acquisition professional and future users of the IWS, collaborative information technology is a necessary ingredient. And, to make collaborative tools useful in the IWS acquisition life cycle, users must leverage their competence with the collaborative tools. To shed light on this requirement, this paper introduces the construct of 'Collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>Tools</b> Leveraging Competence' as the ability of various OA work groups involved in the IWS acquisition life cycle to effectively leverage collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> to enhance their group performance. Collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>Tools</b> Leveraging Competence is conceptualized as a second-order construct formed by the group's effective use of the following six key IT functionalities: workspace sharing, conferencing, file sharing, scheduling, chat, and email. Collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>Tools</b> Leveraging Competence is hypothesized to facilitate group performance (process efficiency, project effectiveness, and situational awareness), particularly in intense work environments such as OA acquisition contexts. To enhance an OA work group's ability to effectively leverage collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>tools,</b> the study proposes a set of enabling factors: customization of the collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>tools,</b> group habits in using collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>tools,</b> the group's perceived usefulness and ease of use of collaborative <b>IT</b> <b>tools,</b> the group member's mutual trust, and the degree of environmental intensity.

50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} specific emission scenario documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an <b>IT</b> <b>tool</b> supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the Technical Guidance Document for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal active substance is allowed onto the list of approved active substances, its specifications become a reference source of that active substance (so called 'reference active substance'). Thus, when an alternative source of that active substance appears (e.g. from a company that have not participated in the Review Programme of active substances) or when a change appears in the manufacturing location and/or manufacturing process of a reference active substance, then a technical equivalence between these different sources needs to be established with regard to the chemical composition and hazard profile. This is to check if the level of hazard posed to health and environment by the active substance from the secondary source is comparable to the initial assessed active substance.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays a high {{variety of}} <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> is {{available}} for communication purposes in design processes on individual and group level. Despite this, the exchange and sharing of design documents collectively in design and engineering teams might be limited mainly, due to habits, preferences, working methods and rivalry between the collective use of <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> in such product development. Changes in habits and preferences for collective use of <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> might be realized by training and management power. However, adoption of collectively to be used tools, like project websites, is depending heavenly on the attractiveness for users in daily work.

Applying a framework for analyzing and categorizing of the frequency of use of <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> for team communication, the authors explain the appearance of rivalry between tools, limiting the effectiveness in daily work and not affecting team communication and performance.

40|$|Human, Organisation and Technology (HOT) are all {{important}} components of IS. However, organisations look to technology {{as the main}} tool of change that can help them achieve their goals. This change usually concerns {{the needs of the}} organisation, and not the needs of its human resources, despite it being the latter that is the principal actor that any organisation depends upon to achieve its goals. The aim of this research is to develop an <b>IT</b> <b>tool</b> that itself can satisfy the workforce humanistic needs. In order to develop this <b>IT</b> <b>tool,</b> a theoretical investigation and practical experimentations were conducted in a series of case studies involving government organisations in Qatar. Based on the theoretical investigation, an approach was proposed based on Socio-Technical Theory (STT), supported by learning from the ETHICS application of STT concepts and Client-Led Information systems Creation (CLIC) application of Soft System Methodology (SSM) principles. This approach was used to guide the development of the <b>IT</b> <b>tool</b> which was then used in actual organisational work environments to assess its impact on the Qatari workforce's motivation and capabilities. Empirical results from this research show that an IT itself cannot be used to improve workforce motivation and capabilities in the case of Qatar. However, IT can do this by supporting a work environment enabled by necessary managerial practises and work environment requirements. Based on the proposed approach, this requires firstly, an understanding of the needs of the social subsystem of the organisation to improve workforce motivation and capability; then these needs should be developed into functions that are enabled by the work environment and supported by the <b>IT</b> <b>tool.</b> Lastly, the new <b>IT</b> <b>tool</b> needs to be integrated into the existing technical subsystem of the organisation. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications. They contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the role of IT in improving the workforce's motivation and capabilities. They extend the application of STT principles in the area of developing human-focused IS by finding an alternative to the participatory approach via learning from SSM principles. They also provide specific understanding of how to develop an <b>IT</b> <b>tool</b> as well as what the work environment needs to provide to enable the application of the <b>IT</b> <b>tool,</b> to improve workforce motivation and capabilities. This PhD research also has social implications for the way IT is utilised in organisations. It can affect areas of IS utilisation and workforce well-being, as well as the role of leadership in maximising the value of IS from a human-focused perspective and the area of utilising IT in a virtual team to consider their humanistic needs. ...|$|E

40|$|Gathering and {{managing}} requirements from stakeholders {{is an essential}} task for the successful development of <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> for any application domain. However, specifying stakeholders’ requirements for a collaborative research and development project in the urban management domain is especially challenging. The {{reason for this is}} that stakeholders are drawn from different professional, scientific and national backgrounds and contexts, and therefore have various and differing research, technological and application domain-specific objectives. These challenges make it difficult to identify commonalities in requirements that can result in the development of generic <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> which can be applied in other cities. These various challenges make it highly desirable therefore to identify and apply a coherent methodological approach to the management of the requirements gathering process and stakeholder engagement more generally. In this paper, we introduce a coherent methodology and a generic requirements engineering process, namely – ‘CoReS – Collaborative Requirements Engineering and Stakeholder engagement’. This process is applied to the UrbanAPI-project - a collaborative research project, in which eleven partners from six European countries are collaborating to develop <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> to support policy making, urban planning and participatory governance at different urban scales. The CoReS method results in the identification of commonalities in stakeholder requirements from four major cities located in different EU member states with the objective to develop generic <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> and applications. More specifically, this paper reports on the urban planning issues and needs for generic <b>IT</b> <b>tools.</b> In addition, <b>it</b> presents strengths and weaknesses of the CoReS method applied in the UrbanAPI project.

40|$|Abstract The {{judgment}} of global production networks is facing three major challenges. The complexity, measurable through the huge solution space, {{as well as}} the time-consuming preparation of a decision in line with the limited amount of time of the final decision makers – CEOs and upper management. The experience from several industry projects showed the demand to transfer and apply the concept of gamification in a cyber-physical environment to decision-making in Global Footprint Design. Smart IT tools, which support the intuition and practical knowledge of the decision maker but do not finally make the decision for them, are needed. Based on general criteria for successful gamified IT tools three specific requirements for judging global production networks are derived: value creation, ludic goal orientation and autonomous discovery. The major challenges and these specified principles of gamification are addressed within the scope of an <b>IT</b> <b>tool</b> which simplifies and improves complex global footprint decisions by employing elements of gamification.

One view of geotechnical engineering is that Information Technology (<b>IT)</b> <b>tools</b> may replace many of the functions that geotechnical engineers now perform. This view can be framed to argue that the right <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> will even replace the need for engineering judgment. Since geotechnical engineers rely heavily on their engineering judgment to formulate and defend their arguments, this view would mean a major change in the way we do geotechnical engineering. This paper looks at geotechnical engineering in today’s IT dominated world and considers ways that geotechnical engineering may change as the <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> become increasingly powerful and pervasive. The paper’s aim is to stimulate people’s thinking about how we can make more effective use of <b>IT</b> <b>tools</b> in our future work.
