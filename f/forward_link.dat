60|$|The canal {{was busy}} enough. Every {{now and then}} we met or overtook {{a long string of}} boats, with great green tillers; high sterns with a window {{on either side of the}} rudder, and perhaps a jug or a flower- pot in one of the windows; a dinghy {{following}} behind; a woman busied about the day's dinner, and a handful of children. These barges were all tied one behind the other with tow ropes, to the number of twenty-five or thirty; and the line was headed and kept in motion by a steamer of strange construction. It had neither paddle-wheel nor screw; but by some gear not rightly comprehensible to the unmechanical mind, it fetched up over its bow a small bright chain which lay along the bottom of the canal, and paying it out again over the stern, dragged itself <b>forward,</b> <b>link</b> by link, with its whole retinue of loaded skows. Until one had found out the key to the enigma, there was something solemn and uncomfortable in the progress of one of these trains, as it moved gently along the water with nothing to mark its advance but an eddy alongside dying away into the wake.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{contents}} of web pages from radiation oncology centers in Turkey were evaluated. Accessibility {{of the web}} pages through search engines was also assessed. METHODS: A search was made {{for the presence of}} web sites for radiation oncology centers of 44 hospitals and for the accessibility of these sites through actively <b>forwarding</b> <b>links</b> using the “Google” search engine. RESULTS: All centers had web sites. Twenty-nine centers had actively <b>forwarding</b> <b>links.</b> Web pages from 23 centers included information concerning available treatment options. Web pages from 26 centers included information concerning medical staff. Web pages from 26 centers included information concerning research conducted by the medical staff. Of all web pages, information concerning radiation oncology was available in seven. Using the “Google” search engine, actively <b>forwarding</b> <b>links</b> were found for 21 centers using “radiation oncology” keyword.

In this paper, channel training overhead and estimation error are rigorously accounted for while determining the net system throughput. First, we consider the case with training on the reverse link only. We study a precoding method which {{is a combination of}} two schemes: selection of users with largest estimated gains and zero-forcing to selected users. Next, we consider the case with training on both reverse and <b>forward</b> <b>links.</b> We obtain a lower bound on the weighted-sum capacity, and propose an algorithm to determine an efficient precoding matrix.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{percentage of}} links in wireless networks, especially low-power ones, is asymmetric. For the low-quality direction of asymmetric links, we observe based on testbed experiments that {{the reliability of}} synchronous acknowledgments is considerably {{higher than that of}} asynchronous messages. Thus the norm of estimating link quality in both directions via asynchronous beacons such as in ETX-based routing potentially underestimates the link reliability of asymmetric links. This leads us to investigate how to exploit asymmetric links in order to improve network functions such as convergecast routing in sensor networks via one-way link estimation. We propose a new one-way link metric ETF (for the expected number of transmissions over <b>forward</b> <b>links)</b> and present a local procedure for its estimation. We use ETF to identify high reliability <b>forward</b> <b>links</b> and use dynamic retransmission thresholding for error control and observe an improvement in convergecast routing over ETX. This is quantified with experimental testbed results with respect to reliability, number of transmissions per packet, latency, duplicates and average hops.

40|$|Link {{asymmetry}} {{is one of}} {{the characteristic}} challenges that wireless sensor networks pose in the design of network protocols. We observe, based on testbed experiments, that a substantial percentage of links are asymmetric, many are even unidirectional. We also find that the reliability of synchronous acknowledgments is considerably higher than that of asynchronous messages. Thus the norm of estimating link quality bidirectionally via asynchronous beacons underestimates the link reliability of asymmetric links. This leads us to investigate how to exploit asymmetric links in order to improve network functions such as convergecast routing in sensor networks via oneway link estimation. We propose a new one-way link metric ETF (for the expected number of transmissions over <b>forward</b> <b>links)</b> and present a local procedure for its estimation. We use ETF to identify reliable <b>forward</b> <b>links,</b> and we use dynamic retransmission thresholding for error control. Via experiments on testbeds of CC 1000 radios and CC 2420 radios (an IEEE 802. 15. 4 -compliant radio), we quantify the performance improvement in ETF as compared with ETX.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{establish}} a rate duality between the <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>links</b> of MIMO interference channel, where the reverse links are obtained by exchanging {{the roles of}} transmitters and receivers in the <b>forward</b> <b>links,</b> and the corresponding channel matrices are conjugate transpose of the forward channel matrices. Since the capacity region for general interference channel is unknown, we show that the <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>links</b> have the same achievable rate region by treating interference as noise under some sum power constraint. The explicit expression of the corresponding input covariance matrix transformation is provided. We discuss {{the connection between the}} proposed transformation and the MAC-BC transformations in the previous works. As an application, a duality based iterative algorithm is proposed to maximize the sum rate of MIMO interference channel under sum power constraint. We also extend the algorithm to individual power constraint. The proposed algorithms are shown to be effective by simulation...|$|R
