5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (<b>head</b> <b>tube)</b> act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the <b>head</b> <b>tube,</b> top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{operating}} temperature {{and efficiency of}} solar-powered Stirling engines can be improved by adding a heat transport system to more uniformly supply heat to the heater <b>head</b> <b>tubes.</b> One heat transport system with favorable characteristics is an alkali metal pool boiler. An alkali metal pool boiler heat transport system was designed for a 25 -kW advanced Stirling conversion system (ASCS). Solar energy concentrated on the absorber dome boils a eutectic mixture of sodium and potassium. The alkali metal vapors condense on the heater <b>head</b> <b>tubes,</b> supplying the Stirling engine with a uniform heat flux at a constant temperature. Boiling stability is achieved {{with the use of}} an enhanced boiling surface and noncondensible gas...|$|R

25|$|Due {{to front}} fork suspension, modern {{mountain}} bikes - {{as opposed to}} road bikes - tend to have slacker <b>head</b> <b>tube</b> angles, generally around 70° although they can be as low as 62° (depending on frame geometry setting).|$|E
25|$|The diamond frame {{consists}} of two triangles, a main triangle and a paired rear triangle. The main triangle {{consists of}} the <b>head</b> <b>tube,</b> top tube, down tube and seat tube. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube, and paired chain stays and seat stays.|$|E
50|$|Campagnolo Standard: 45/45. (often {{referred}} as Campagnolo standard) This {{is common in}} BMX frames, BMX-derived dirt jump frames (like the Transition Trail-Or-Park). They are also common on road bikes. Three most common manufacturers are Campagnolo, FSA and Cane Creek. <b>Head</b> <b>tubes</b> with this standard have a 42.0mm inner diameter.|$|R
40|$|The heater <b>head</b> <b>tubes</b> {{of current}} {{prototype}} automotive Stirling engines are fabricated from alloy N- 155, an alloy which contains 20 percent cobalt. Because the United States imports over 90 {{percent of the}} cobalt used {{in this country and}} resource supplies could not meet the demand imposed by automotive applications of cobalt in the heater <b>head</b> (<b>tubes</b> plus cylinders and regenerator housings), it is imperative that substitute alloys free of cobalt be identified. The research described herein focused on the heater <b>head</b> <b>tubes.</b> Sixteen alloys (15 potential substitutes plus the 20 percent Co N- 155 alloy) were evaluated in the form of thin wall tubing in the NASA Lewis Research Center Stirling simulator materials diesel fuel fired test rigs. Tubes filled with either hydrogen doped with 1 percent CO 2 or with helium at a gas pressure of 15 MPa and a temperature of 820 C were cyclic endurance tested for times up to 3500 hr. Results showed that two iron-nickel base superalloys, CG- 27 and Pyromet 901 survived the 3500 hr endurance test. The remaining alloys failed by creep-rupture at times less than 3000 hr, however, several other alloys had superior lives to N- 155. Results further showed that doping the hydrogen working fluid with 1 vol % CO 2 is an effective means of reducing hydrogen permeability through all the alloy tubes investigated...|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of joint implantation of straight silicon <b>tube</b> and spherical <b>headed</b> silicon <b>tube</b> in treatment of post-operative patients with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis. METHODS:Forty-nine patients(50 eyes) with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis who had treated with straight silicon <b>tube</b> or spherical <b>headed</b> silicon <b>tube</b> were implanted with straight silicon tube combined with spherical <b>headed</b> silicon <b>tube.</b> Patients were followed up for 1 a {{to observe the}} curative effect. RESULTS:The operation was invalid in 5 cases(5 eyes) as their rigation of lacrimal passage was failure. The remaining 45 eyes in 44 cases were cured with no epiphora. The cure rate was 90 % at 1 a after the tubes were extracted. CONCLUSION:The joint implantation of straight silicon <b>tube</b> and spherical <b>headed</b> silicon <b>tube</b> is an effective and safe technique in treatment of post-operative patients with recurrent chronic dacryadeitis,and worthy of widely use in patients with chronic dacryadeitis {{who have never been}} treated with surgeries...|$|R
25|$|In a {{cantilever}} {{bicycle frame}} the seat stays continue past the seat post and curve downwards {{to meet with}} the down tube. Cantilever frames are popular on the cruiser bicycle, the lowrider bicycle, and the wheelie bike.

25|$|The {{steering}} axis angle, also called caster angle or head angle, is the angle that the {{steering axis}} makes with the horizontal or vertical, depending on convention.

25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a truncated cone. The head joint is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and <b>head</b> <b>tube),</b> chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|E

It also had a bit more power, increased from [...] @ 9,500rpm. Sub-variants of the Sports Cub were the C111, absent the pillion seat, and C110D, also called C114, which had a low exhaust pipe. Early versions of the Sport Cub had a 3 speed gearbox but later this was changed to 4 speed. The C102 stayed in production for six model years, through 1965, and the C110 Sports Cub through 1966.|$|E

40|$|Metal {{spinning}} {{can be used}} {{to produce}} hollow, axially symmetric sheet metal parts with low tooling and production costs, high flexibility, and low waste. Spinning parameters determine the quality of the spinned parts and are of interest for enabling the spinning of thick sheet metals. In this study, conventional metal spinning was conducted on a 6 mm thick low carbon steel with process below its recrystallization temperature to fabricate <b>tube</b> <b>head,</b> requiring maximum deflection of about 90 º at its edge. Spinning parameters varied were temperature (at room temperature and 300 °C), feed (2 mm and 5 mm), and spinning speed (200 rpm and 250 rpm). Evaluation was made on the resulted surface morphology, thickness variation, and further analysis on hardness and microstructure of the spinned <b>tube</b> <b>head.</b> The resulted <b>tube</b> <b>heads</b> were of acceptable quality in terms of surface morphology and thickness variation, while hardness and microstructure analysis showed that inner parts of the workpiece were not affected by the spinning process...|$|R
