5|$|Nauru had {{residents}} as of July , {{making it}} the second smallest sovereign state after Vatican City. The population was previously larger, but in 2006 1,500people left the island during a repatriation of <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by wide-scale reductions-in-force in the phosphate mining industry. It is the least-populated country in Oceania.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2001 census, 96% of the {{population}} was White British, and 2.1% non-white (mainly of British Asian origin). Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland; though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> from the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to other regions of the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> in the Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to}} two years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to nationalise AESC and develop Leigh Creek {{proved to be}} prescient. In early 1947, mines in New South Wales were again crippled by strikes. The worst strike came in 1949, forcing Chifley to send {{in the armed forces}} to extract coal. While the other states had to suffer industrial power rationing and thus reduced manufacturing output and more unemployment, South Australia managed to escape as the miners at Leigh Creek worked around the clock. Within four years the mine was operating at a surplus and the town was further rewarded with federal funding. From 1947 until the end of Playford's leadership in 1965, the output of the mine increased tenfold to almost two million tons a year. Transport infrastructure was improved, European <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> were recruited, and twin power plants at Port Augusta were completed in 1960 and named after the premier. The new plants exclusively used Leigh Creek coal and by 1970, the whole state was self-sufficient for electricity. ETSA and the mine were generating enough revenue to maintain the town—sometimes dubbed Uncle Tom's Baby—and mine of Leigh Creek and making a profit as well. From 1946 to 1965, the proportion of South Australians connected to electricity increased from 70 to 96%.|$|E

25|$|Even when undocumented {{individuals}} are employed, their positions are often precarious. Approximately 40% of <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> in low-wage jobs are undocumented. A lack of formal documentation means {{that many of}} these individuals must find work in the informal economy where {{there is a lack of}} protection for worker rights. Undocumented workers may have difficulty obtaining justice in cases of mistreatment since employers can easily threaten them with deportation. This leaves these <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> vulnerable to exploitation. Exploitation may take many forms, one of these being wage theft. While there are regulations to protect the rights of workers, such as laws that cover private domestic work, these policies are often underutilized since workers may be unaware of their existence. Individuals who lack formal documentation may also feel less empowered to seek legal recourse because of fear of having their undocumented status made known.|$|E
