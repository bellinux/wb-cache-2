5000|$|A B-2 {{crashed on}} 23 February 2008 shortly after takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The {{investigation}} stated the B-2 crashed after [...] "heavy, lashing rains" [...] caused water to enter skin-flush air-data sensors, which <b>feed</b> <b>angle</b> of attack and yaw {{data to the}} computerized flight-control system. The water distorted pre-flight readings {{in three of the}} plane's 24 sensors, causing the flight-control system to send an erroneous correction to the B-2 on takeoff. The B-2 quickly stalled, became unrecoverable, and crashed. The sensors measure environmental factors including air pressure and density, for data to calculate airspeed, altitude and attitude. Because of the faulty readings, the flight computers determined inaccurate airspeed readings and incorrectly indicated a downward angle for the aircraft, which contributed to an early rotation and an un-commanded 30-degree pitch up and left yaw, resulting in the stall.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{problems}} {{stemmed from}} the Sten's magazine, which was a direct copy of the one used in the German MP-38, originally {{in order to facilitate}} the use of German 9 mm magazines. Unfortunately, this decision necessarily incorporated the Erma magazine's faults in the process. The magazine had two columns of 9 mm cartridges in a staggered arrangement, merging at the top to form a single column. While other staggered magazines, such as the Thompson, fed from both the left and right side alternately (double-column, double feed), the Sten magazine, like the MP38, required the cartridges to gradually merge {{at the top of the}} magazine to form a single column (double column, single feed). As a consequence, any dirt or foreign matter in this taper area could cause feed malfunctions. Additionally, the walls of the magazine lip had to endure the full stresses of the rounds being pushed in by the spring. This, along with rough handling could result in deformation of the magazine lips (which required a precise 8° <b>feed</b> <b>angle</b> to operate), resulting in misfeeding and a failure to fire.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePermeating air {{is known}} to have a {{negative}} impact on the roller compaction process, because the feed is destabilized by the flow of escaping gas, causing pressure to build-up and potentially damage compacts at release. Airflow during powder roller compaction and its effect on the rolling process are investigated in the rolling direction (1 D), using an extension of the Johanson model for the solid. Fluid transport obeys Darcy's law, with permeability being a function of both material density and particle size, through the Kozeny-Carman relationship. In this modeling, the effect of the air pressure on the solid is neglected in the compaction zone. Assuming air at atmospheric pressure at the <b>feeding</b> <b>angle</b> and ignoring airflow through the gap, predictions of air pressure as a function of the rolling angle for bentonite material powder are presented and discussed. Results suggest the existence of two different stability zones within the operating conditions, where industrial systems could function without being affected by airflow effects. The model highlights the importance of the permeability/rotation speed ratio, which governs the proportion of air trapped in the compacts to the portion evacuated through the feed. We also investigate the effect of particle fragmentation during the rolling process. Finally, we provide guidelines for the scale-up of roller presses subjected to air flow issues, through a study of the effect of the system dimensions and rotation speed on the elimination of air. In spite of the lack of available experimental data, this model allows for a better understanding of how air escapes by diffusing through the material during the rolling process, and opens interesting perspectives for the mitigation of its effect on the process...|$|R

Background The original work of Darnell and Mol [1] formulates the basic motion and force balances for solids conveying. Constant friction factors are utilized and the flow is isothermal. Tadmor and Klein [2] improved the basics with different barrel and screw friction factors. Tadmor and Broyer [3, 4] introduced heat transfer and power consumption into the equations for solids conveying and were able to account for the variation in friction factor with temperature. Chung, Hennessey and Tusim [5] added the approach of independently measuring surface stress for calculating feed flow. Hyun, Spalding, and Hinton [6] utilized the surface stress technique with a new model using two torque balances. They provide flow data from a special feed section analysis extruder with controlled temperature and pressure conditions [7]. Campbell and Dontula [8] develop a model and neglect any torque balance equation by assuming the solid bed to be an elastic fluid. The model presented here in cylindrical coordinates progressively describes the kinematics, force, torque, and energy balances to provide pressure and temperature as a function of given flow rate.
