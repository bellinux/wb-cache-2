5|$|To {{service clients}} without {{ready access to}} {{low-cost}} financing, the IFC relies on structured or securitized financial products such as partial credit guarantees, portfolio risk transfers, and Islamic finance. The IFC committed $797 million {{in the form of}} structured and securitized financing in 2010. For companies that face difficulty in obtaining financing due to a perception of high credit risk, the IFC securitizes assets with predictable cash flows, such as mortgages, credit cards, loans, corporate <b>debt</b> <b>instruments,</b> and revenue streams, in an effort to enhance those companies' credit.|$|E
50|$|Notwithstanding {{the senior}} {{status of a}} loan or other <b>debt</b> <b>instrument,</b> another <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> (whether senior or otherwise) may benefit from {{security}} that effectively renders that other instrument {{more likely to be}} repaid in an insolvency than unsecured senior debt. Lenders of a secured <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> (regardless of ranking) receive the benefit of the security for that instrument until they are repaid in full, without having to share the benefit of that security with any other lenders. If the value of the security is insufficient to repay the secured debt, the residual unpaid claim will rank according to its documentation (whether senior or otherwise), and will receive pro rata treatment with other unsecured debts of such rank.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, a {{newly elected}} {{government}} in Greece revealed the falsification of its national budget data, {{and that its}} fiscal deficit for the year was 12.7% of GDP {{as opposed to the}} 3.7% espoused by the previous administration. This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece's deficit exceeded the eurozone's maximum of 3% outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union's Stability and Growth Pact. Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds. Given Greece's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency, it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness, as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight. The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal, Italy, and Spain (together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS). Ratings agencies downgraded these countries' <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> in 2010 which further increased the costliness of refinancing or repaying their national debts. The crisis continued to spread and soon grew into a European sovereign debt crisis which threatened economic recovery {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession. In tandem with the IMF, the European Union members assembled a €750 billion bailout for Greece and other afflicted nations. Additionally, the ECB pledged to purchase bonds from troubled eurozone nations in an effort to mitigate the risk of a banking system panic. The crisis is recognized by economists as highlighting the depth of financial integration in Europe, contrasted with the lack of fiscal integration and political unification necessary to prevent or decisively respond to crises. During the initial waves of the crisis, the public speculated that the turmoil could result in a disintegration of the eurozone and an abandonment of the euro. German Federal Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble called for the expulsion of offending countries from the eurozone. Now commonly referred to as the Eurozone crisis, it has been ongoing since 2009 and most recently began encompassing the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis.|$|E

This paper tests how macroeconomic fundamentals a#ect the choice of international <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> available to emerging market borrowers.

25|$|The 1980s {{ended with}} high and {{accelerating}} inflation and a stagnant economy, which never recovered after {{the demise of}} the Cruzado Plan.

25|$|A {{credit rating}} agency (CRA, also called a ratings service) {{is a company}} that assigns credit ratings, which rate a debtor's ability to pay back debt by making timely {{interest}} payments and the likelihood of default. An agency may rate the creditworthiness of issuers of debt obligations, of <b>debt</b> <b>instruments,</b> and in some cases, of the servicers of the underlying debt, but not of individual consumers.|$|E

5000|$|Judicial practices: Some [...] {{argue that}} much of the problem arises from a {{tendency}} of the courts to favor lenders, and to shift the burden of proof of compliance with the terms of the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> to the debtor. According to this argument, it should not be the duty of the borrower to make sure his payments are getting to the current note-owner, but to make evidence that all payments were made to the last known agent for collection sufficient to block or reverse repossession or foreclosure, and eviction, and to cancel the debt if the current note owner cannot prove he is the [...] "holder in due course" [...] by producing the actual original <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> in court.|$|R
25|$|This is {{referred}} to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> (including government issued bonds).|$|R
25|$|Sharia forbids {{both the}} trading of {{short-term}} <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> except at face value, and the drawing upon the established interbank money markets (both {{being seen as}} transactions involve interest and excessive uncertainty (Gharar)).

A QSCB holder receives a Federal tax credit in lieu of an interest payment. The tax credits may be stripped from QSCB bonds and sold separately. QSCBs were created by Section 1521 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Internal Revenue Code Section 54F also addresses QSCBs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{floating}} interest rate, {{also known}} as a variable or adjustable rate, refers to any type of <b>debt</b> <b>instrument,</b> such as a loan, bond, mortgage, or credit, that does not have a fixed rate of interest {{over the life of the}} instrument.|$|R
50|$|The {{yield of}} a <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> is {{generally}} {{linked to the}} credit worthiness and default probability of the issuer.

2500|$|An {{investor}} or speculator may “buy protection” {{to hedge}} {{the risk of}} default on a bond or other <b>debt</b> <b>instrument,</b> regardless of whether such investor or speculator holds an interest in or bears any risk of loss relating to such bond or <b>debt</b> <b>instrument.</b> In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDS {{are not subject to}} regulations governing traditional insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without owning debt of the reference entity. These [...] "naked credit default swaps" [...] allow traders to speculate on the creditworthiness of reference entities. CDSs can be used to create synthetic long and short positions in the reference entity. [...] Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS. [...] In addition, CDSs can also be used in capital structure arbitrage.|$|R
500|$|In Rhode Island, matters were {{resolved}} without violence {{because the}} [...] "country party" [...] {{gained control of}} the legislature in 1786 and enacted measures forcing its merchant elites to trade <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> for devalued currency.

2500|$|The United States Secret Service, mostly {{known for}} its guarding-of-officials task, [...] was {{initially}} organized primarily to combat the counterfeiting of American money.

2500|$|Another observer, Salman Ali, {{found that}} many of the sukuk {{structures}} [...] "do not conform to the Shariah". According to Ali, while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain [...] "within Shariah bounds", they [...] "replicate conventional debt instruments". They often combine more than one contract, [...] "which individually may be Shariah-compliant" [...] but when combined [...] "may defeat the objective of the shariah". Furthermore, the sukuk rate of return is often [...] "tied" [...] to the Libor (London interbank offered rate) or Euribor (euro interbank offered rate) interest rate [...] "rather than to the underlying business" [...] that the sukuk is financing. This makes the sukuk [...] "so similar to conventional <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> {{that it is difficult to}} tell one from the other". Ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as Standard & Poors and Moody's apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional <b>debt</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Until 1999, Japan {{imposed a}} {{transaction}} tax {{on a variety}} of financial instruments, including <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> and equity instruments, but at differential rates.
