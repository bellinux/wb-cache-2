5|$|Monotype has <b>digitised</b> Ehrhardt {{into the}} TrueType and OpenType font formats. It {{is sold in}} {{standard}} and professional releases, some releases including text figures and small caps (in the roman style only). Like several other Monotype typefaces <b>digitised</b> in the early period of computerised publishing, it is sold under two releases credited both to Monotype itself and to Adobe, the latter only in the standard version without small caps. Fleet Titling and the Initial Teaching Alphabet version have not been <b>digitised.</b>|$|E
5|$|A silver jubilee {{event was}} held on 7 October 2014 in Hyderabad, where Nagarjuna {{announced}} that Siva <b>digitised</b> version would be released on 17 October 2014 on nearly 100 screens. In April 2015, Varma told Indo-Asian News Service that the <b>digitised</b> release was postponed until 15 May because of restoration delays. In September Nagarjuna said that a sequel to Siva would be {{a viable alternative to}} a <b>digitised</b> version, and proposed a film about Siva, Asha, and their two sons. Advising Varma to develop a script, he asked the director to cast Amala, Naga Chaitanya and Akhil Akkineni. The sequel would reportedly be produced by Annapurna Studios.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} dubbed in Telugu as Karna, {{and also in}} Hindi as Dhaan Veer Karna. Karnan was {{released}} on 14 January 1964, during the festival occasion of Pongal, and received critical acclaim, with Ganesan and Rama Rao's performances being widely lauded. Despite this, it became a commercial failure, but ran for over 100 days in some theatres. The film also won the Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film at the 11th National Film Awards. A <b>digitised</b> version of Karnan was released in March 2012 to critical and commercial success, eventually establishing a trend of re-releasing <b>digitised</b> versions of old films in Tamil cinema.|$|E
5|$|Brooks was {{the first}} and the longest-serving of the British war photographers, and took more than 4,400 images. This was the most of any {{individual}} photographer, and represented more than 10% of all the official photographs. A large collection of his photographs is now held by the Imperial War Museum, and a second collection is held by the National Library of Scotland as part of Earl Haig's papers; both have been <b>digitised.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} several {{techniques}} for {{the elaboration of}} landslides databases are compared. The used techniques are the <b>digitising</b> on ortophotographies, the <b>digitising</b> on aerial photographs and geometrical correction, and, finally, the stereoplotting using digital photogrammetry. The landslide scarps databases derived from the different methodologies have been compared by several indexes such as the displacement between crown lines of scarps, the lengths of scarps, and the adjustment of scarps to a DTM. The analysis shows lower or higher discrepancies between the databases, with displacements between 8 and 45 meters, depending on the compared methodologies and landslides typologies. The best results are obtained with the methodology of digital stereoplotting whose scarps database is well adjusted to the DTM. Among the rest of methodologies, the <b>digitising</b> on orthophotography presents the lower differences with the previous one, while the methodology of the <b>digitising</b> on photogram presents the worst results, with a certain spatial pattern related with the relief displacement. The conclusion is to recommend {{the use of the}} digital stereoplotting to elaborate landslides databases and as possible alternatives the <b>digitising</b> on ortophotography (especially if they are derived from the stereoscopic pairs used in the interpretation), being dissuaded the <b>digitising</b> on the photogram, at least in zones with a strong relief. 1...|$|R

5|$|In March 2015, Raj Television Network {{announced}} that they would release a digital 5.1 surround sound version of the film in collaboration with Sai Ganesh Films, on an unspecified date in April, though it was eventually released on 21 August 2015. Murali B. V., coordinator of Sai Ganesh Films, which helped in the restoration and digitisation of the film's original prints, told The New Indian Express that it took nine months to clean the film prints and completely restore them for digitisation from the original 35 mm film prints with mono sound. The <b>digitised</b> version collected 553,000 in its opening weekend from 39 shows in Chennai, and emerged a commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Son of God {{consists}} of a single series of three episodes. Each episode lasts approximately 50 minutes and documents a different stage of Jesus's life. The episodes take the format of Bowen visiting significant locations {{from the life of}} Jesus, talking head interviews with 21 historians and Biblical experts, and reenactments of Jesus's life featuring Israeli actor Liron Levo. Locations from Jesus's time—such as Caesarea, Yatta and Sepphoris—were recreated by archaeologists using evidence from buildings and street plans, and were then <b>digitised</b> into computer graphics by Red Vision.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Monotype's current {{digitisation}} of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants, {{including some}} of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight (once an option in metal type) which had been <b>digitised</b> for Grazia. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed 'Medium'. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill's work, as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill's serif design Joanna. One addition was italic swash caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture warping found in early 3D games. Jitter and warping were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, <b>digitised</b> screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights of 14Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Pathala Bhairavi, to release their digitally re-mastered versions in colour. After {{the success of}} the <b>digitised</b> and colourised version of Mayabazar released in January 2010, its makers announced that Pathala Bhairavi would be the next film to be remastered and re-released in colour. However Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films including Pathala Bhairavi, saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them, adding that there were also a lot of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own.|$|E
5|$|The National Archives of Malta, {{like its}} {{counterparts}} {{in other areas}} of the world, has been moving to increase the availability of its services on the Internet. A number of items in its collection have been, or are in the process of being, <b>digitised,</b> and a catalogue listing search, along with a short description of each item, is available online on the Archives' web site. The Archives releases many of its publications, including periodical newsletters, its annual report and the State of the Archives report, on its web site, and maintains an 'e-shop' to facilitate the sale of copies of some of its text and image holdings to interested members of the public. It is also possible to search the holdings of Malta's National Memory Project, a memory of those who have contributed to the history of Malta, through the Archives' web site.|$|E

5|$|To help Eurocom authentically {{recreate}} the environments of the film, the film makers provided Eurocom with original production material, including concept drawings, blueprints, {{and photographs of}} the film's sets. Although the game closely follows {{the plot of the}} film, the developers added new elements to help the game design. For example, the London Underground level, where the player must rescue several hostages, {{is not part of the}} film. However, the boat chase scene is not playable in the game due to limitations in the Nintendo 64 cartridge size. According to the game's producer Bill Beacham, vehicle-based gameplay would require the creation of a separate engine that would possibly compromise the game's base first-person engine. All the characters' faces were <b>digitised</b> from the film's actors, but impersonators provided voiced dialogue. One exception was English actor John Cleese, who reprised his role as R.|$|E
5|$|Following a major {{expansion}} in 2003, {{a suite of}} rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, {{was added to the}} museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The museum, the development of which cost a further £6 million raised from private fundraising, makes extensive use of audiovisual technology. The centrepiece is a 15-metre interactive table that enables visitors to access <b>digitised</b> material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. The Churchill Museum won the 2006 Council of Europe Museum Prize. During 2009-2011 the museum received over 300,000 visitors a year. In May 2010 the name of the museum was shortened to Churchill War Rooms.|$|E
5|$|Before Little's purchase, the punchbowl {{had been}} the {{property}} of Sir Timothy Augustine Coghlan, New South Wales Agent-General in London, who bought the bowl for ₤40 in 1923 from one Miss Hall for his own collection. The bowl was subsequently {{in the possession of}} Francis Edwards Ltd before Coghlan's unexpected death in London on 30April 1926. Coghlan had personally collected the bowl from a Miss Hall at 'Highfield', 63 Seabrook Rd, Hythe (Kent), England, a few months after she had decided to offer the bowl to the New South Wales Government for ₤50. Earlier, a visit to Miss Hall by a Sydney schoolteacher, Jessie Stead, on 6August 1923, resulted in the proposal that the bowl ought to be the property of the City of Sydney. Jessie Stead later indicated that she was informed by Miss Hall that her father had acquired the bowl in the late 1840s – the earliest dating for the punchbowls' provenance – and that Miss Hall believed the bowl was commissioned for William Bligh, New South Wales's fourth Governor (in office 1806–1808). In 2002, the State Library of New South Wales <b>digitised</b> the punchbowl images {{with the support of the}} Nelson Meers Foundation, a philanthropic foundation supporting Australian arts, and the bowl became one of the 100 extraordinary library objects to be exhibited as part of Mitchell Library's centenary celebrations in 2010.|$|E
