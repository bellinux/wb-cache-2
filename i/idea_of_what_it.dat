Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> will look like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E

Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{submissions}} began almost immediately, as did {{short story}} submissions with lesbian themes. Book reviews of current paperbacks were regular features, including a heated exchange in print between contributors to The Ladder and author Marijane Meaker as Ann Aldrich from 1957 to 1963. Meaker {{had written the}} immensely successful Spring Fire in 1952 under the name Vin Packer and was known to the Daughters of Bilitis. Meaker's books We Walk Alone from 1955 and We, Too, Must Love from 1958 were her version of Donald Webster Cory's The Homosexual in America, a nonfiction account published in 1951 {{about what it was}} like to live as a gay man in the US. Meaker's books, published by Gold Medal Books, were distributed all over the US, and gave people in remote places an <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like to live as a lesbian. The books, however, were not particularly sympathetic to lesbians, and Del Martin and Barbara Grier took issue with Meaker's portrayals. They began to criticize the books in The Ladder and suggest that Meaker was expressing self-hatred in the books. Del Martin wrote to Meaker personally in 1958, giving her a free subscription to the magazine. Meaker's reach to women was much broader through the distribution of her books, and she received so much mail from women asking for resources and support that she was unable to respond to all of it, so she referred the letter writers to the Daughters of Bilitis. However, in print, Meaker responded to the open letters to her in The Ladder in her next book Carol in a Thousand Cities in 1960, by skewering the magazine's amateurish homemade appearance, fiction and poetry she did not appreciate, and the ideas presented in the magazine. Again, The Ladder responded, once more calling Meaker's loyalties into question. However negative Carol in a Thousand Cities was to The Ladder, it was major advertising for the DOB and letters poured in for them from all over the U.S.|$|E

Nicole Paitsel, Lisa Deaderick, and Joe Atkinson from Daily Press each rated the roller coaster for its vomiting and scream factors. Nicole and Lisa rated the vomiting factor a one (out of five) for the roller coaster's smoothness; Joe gave a four as he began feeling ill after his second ride. For the scream factor Nicole gave a five, Lisa gave a ten, and Joe gave a four. Mike from NewsPlusNotes praised the first drop for its freefall experience.|$|E
500|$|Gene Siskel {{described}} it as the [...] "finest contemporary war film I've seen, supplanting Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan from earlier this year, or even Oliver Stone's Platoon from 1986." [...] A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, [...] "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is about), but doesn't make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating {{a sense of the}} geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, {{the ways in which the}} American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established".|$|E

A memorable incident occurred, to that end, as Peckinpah's crew were consulting him on the [...] "gunfire" [...] effects {{to be used in the}} film. Not satisfied with the results from the squibs his crew had brought for him, Peckinpah became exasperated; he finally hollered: [...] "That's not what I want! That's not what I want!" [...] He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: [...] "THAT'S the effect I want!!" [...] He also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted on each different type of firearm having its own specific sound effect when fired.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the political {{significance of the}} construction of national identity in José Donoso's La desesperanza. Although much contemporary criticism has regarded this work as a realist novel, this analysis examines its staging of the discursive conflict between competíng <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be Chilean. The central argument is that the novel's critical force derives from its ironic exploration of the values of the Chilean middle classes which are unconsciously based on a racism that is closely linked to the class prejudices that have structured Chilean society since colonial times...|$|R
500|$|In {{the debate}} over {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "redskin", team {{supporters}} frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: [...] "It is not up to non-Indians to define an idealized image of what it is to a Native American." [...] The [...] "positive" [...] stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is [...] "...forcing your <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is to honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." ...|$|E

2500|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{meant to}} be noble went through a radical {{transformation}} from the 16th to the 17th centuries. [...] Through contact with the Italian Renaissance and their concept of the perfect courtier (Baldassare Castiglione), the rude warrior class was remodeled into what the 17th century would come to call l'honnête homme ('the honest or upright man'), among whose chief virtues were eloquent speech, skill at dance, refinement of manners, appreciation of the arts, intellectual curiosity, wit, a spiritual or platonic attitude in love, {{and the ability to}} write poetry. [...] Most notable of noble values are the aristocratic obsession with [...] "glory" [...] (la gloire) and majesty (la grandeur) and the spectacle of power, prestige, and luxury. [...] For example, Pierre Corneille's noble heroes have been criticised by modern readers who have seen their actions as vainglorious, criminal, or hubristic; aristocratic spectators of the period would have seen many of these same actions as representative of their noble station.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Matthews of Legacy Effects, {{successor}} to Stan Winston Studios, {{was hired to}} turn production designer Tom Meyer's robot designs into practical animatronic props. He said, [...] "We have 26-and-a-half total live-action robots that were made for this film. They all have hydraulic neck controls. Atom has RC [...] hands as well." [...] According to Jackman, executive producer Spielberg [...] "actually said to Shawn, 'You should really have real elements where you can.' ... Basically if they're not walking or fighting, that's a real robot." [...] Levy added that Spielberg gave the example of Jurassic Park, where Winston's animatronic dinosaurs [...] "got a better performance from the actors, as they were seeing something real, and gave the visual effects team an <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would look like." [...] As Real Steel was not based on a toy, Meyer said that [...] "there was no guideline" [...] for the robots, and each was designed from scratch, with an attempt to put [...] "different personality and aesthetics," [...] according to Levy. In Atom's case, it tried {{to have a more}} humanizing design to be an [...] "everyman" [...] who could attract the audience's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer, with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show [...] "his identity was a bit hidden, so you have to work harder to get to see him." [...] Executive producer Robert Zemeckis added that the mask [...] "became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom's face." [...] Damage was added to the robots' decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles.|$|E

Instead of being preoccupied with the pioneering experience and the prairie landscape, as established criticism holds that prairie novels do, Paterson's novels have urban settings and her characters experience {{the city as a}} frontier...|$|R
