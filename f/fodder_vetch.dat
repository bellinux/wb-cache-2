50|$|Vicia villosa, {{known as}} the hairy vetch, <b>fodder</b> <b>vetch</b> or winter vetch, is a plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure.|$|E
50|$|The bitter vetch, too, {{is grown}} {{extensively}} for forage and fodder, as are hairy vetch (V. villosa, also called <b>fodder</b> <b>vetch),</b> bard vetch (V. articulata), French vetch (V. serratifolia) and Narbon bean (V. narbonensis). V. benghalensis and Hungarian vetch (V. pannonica) are cultivated for forage and green manure.|$|E

40|$|Perennial grass-clover leys promote wireworms. For this reason, a {{perennial}} cultivation of grass-clover ley {{should be avoided}} {{if there is any}} indication of wireworm infestation. •	After ploughing the meadows or the perennial grass-clover ley, wait until the third or, if possible, even fourth year to plant susceptible crops like potatoes, carrots, onions or salad. •	In general, a diverse crop rotation promotes various beneficial organisms and lowers the infestation of wireworms. •	No cultivation of potatoes in strongly affected areas! •	Rye, <b>fodder</b> radish and <b>vetch</b> are a possible green manure for overwintering. A low infestation of wireworms was observed in crop rotations with peas and lupines. •	The cultivation of legumes (peas, field beans, bush beans) and Brassicas (white cabbage, fodder radish, mustards) can reduce damage from wireworms. •	Grain legumes but also cereals are ideal preceding crops for potatoes. •	Keep the soil moist whilst allowing the potatoes to mature. •	Harvest the potatoes on time because the longer the tubers are in the soil, the more risk of an infestation increases •	Control couch grass (Elymus repens) because its roots can promote the metamorphosis of the wireworm larvae...|$|R
40|$|Field and {{glasshouse}} investigations {{were conducted}} on the responses of two legumes (field pea and <b>fodder</b> <b>vetch)</b> and three non-leguminous crops (maize, wheat and rapeseed) to the heavy metals Cd, Cr, Zn, Pb, Cu and Mn in soil with multiple metal contamination. In general, {{the results indicate that}} the two legumes and wheat were more susceptible to soil metals than were rapeseed and maize. The dry matter yields of field pea, wheat, <b>fodder</b> <b>vetch,</b> rapeseed and maize decreased by up to 169, 123, 113, 93 and 68 %, respectively, in metal-contaminated soil. Among the crops, maize had the highest concentrations of Mn, Zn and Cd, rapeseed had the highest concentrations of Cr, the concentration of Cu was highest in <b>fodder</b> <b>vetch,</b> and wheat was the highest accumulator of Pb. The bioconcentration factors (BCF) of the metals decreased as the soil metal loading rates increased except for Cr in <b>fodder</b> <b>vetch</b> and Cd in wheat, whose BCF increased as the metal loading rate increased. Significant linear correlations were found between plant and soil metal concentrations. Patterns of metal distribution in plant parts varied with different crops and metals, with more Cd and Cu accumulating in the grain of wheat than of maize, suggesting that growing wheat would represent a higher risk of food contamination than growing maize in Cd- or Cu-contaminated soil. The results suggest that on sites with multiple metal contamination, growing maize and rapeseed would be safer than growing wheat or legumes. However, maize could perhaps be used for phytoremediation of lightly contaminated soils, providing that the crop residues were safely disposed of...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of cover crops in the intercrop period {{may provide a}} broad range of ecosystem services derived from the multiple functions they can perform, such as erosion control, recycling of nutrients or forage source. However, the achievement of these services in a particular agrosystem is not always required at the same time or to the same degree. Thus, species selection and definition of targeted objectives is critical when growing cover crops. The goal of the current work was to describe the traits that determine the suitability of five species (barley, rye, triticale, mustard and vetch) for cover cropping. A field trial was established during two seasons (October to April) in Madrid (central Spain). Ground cover and biomass were monitored at regular intervals during each growing season. A Gompertz model characterized ground cover until the decay observed after frosts, while biomass was fitted to Gompertz, logistic and linear-exponential equations. At the end of the experiment, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and fibre (neutral detergent, acid and lignin) contents, and the N fixed by the legume were determined. The grasses reached the highest ground cover (83 – 99 %) and biomass (1226 – 1928 g/m 2) {{at the end of the}} experiment. With the highest C:N ratio (27 – 39) and dietary fibre (527 – 600 mg/g) and the lowest residue quality (~ 680 mg/g), grasses were suitable for erosion control, catch crop and <b>fodder.</b> The <b>vetch</b> presented the lowest N uptake (2 · 4 and 0 · 7 g N/m 2) due to N fixation (9 · 8 and 1 · 6 g N/m 2) and low biomass accumulation. The mustard presented high N uptake in the warm year and could act as a catch crop, but low fodder capability in both years. The thermal time before reaching 30 % ground cover was a good indicator of early coverage species. Variable quantification allowed finding variability among the species and provided information for further decisions involving cover crop selection and management...|$|R
40|$|In {{southern}} Brazil {{several small}} farmers developed an innovative organic conservation tillage system (OCT) {{that does not}} depend on herbicides for weed control but relies instead on the use of cover crop mixtures (including various combinations of rye, vetch and raphanus) that leave a thick residue mulch layer on which traditional grain crops are directly planted, suffering very little weed interference during the growing season and reaching agronomically acceptable yield levels. Our research showed that the rye, <b>fodder</b> radish and <b>vetch</b> mixture effectively suppressed emergence of summer annual weeds in OCT systems. Because of the allelopathic effect of phytotoxins associated with the cover crops residues, farmers avoid toxic effects by placing crop seeds below the toxic layer (allelopathic zone) formed by the phytotoxins leached a short distance (5 - 10 cm) from the mulch into the soil. In addition to weed suppression, residues also have positive effects on subsequent crops from increased soil quality parameters, improved crop nutrition, and in some cases suppression of soil-borne pathogens. Yields in most cases are 5 - 10 % lower in OCT systems when compared to CT systems, but such differences are easily offset by the lower costs of production and the environmental benefits of OCT systems. In our trials the combination of grass and legumes enhanced biomass production and therefore mulch thickness, weed suppression, and organic matter inputs...|$|R
40|$|A quantidade e a distribuição de tamanho dos sedimentos transportados pela enxurrada são influenciadas pelo manejo, cobertura e cultivo do solo e pela chuva, entre outros fatores, constituindo-se em aspecto importante no planejamento conservacionista do solo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi quantificar os sedimentos transportados pela enxurrada e relacioná-los com a velocidade de enxurrada, durante o cultivo da soja, em um experimento de chuva simulada sobre um Nitossolo Háplico alumínico típico, nos sistemas de manejo do solo conduzido desde 1998 : semeadura direta em solo nunca preparado e com resíduos queimados (SQ); e uma aração e duas gradagens (AG). Nesses tratamentos, cultivaram-se aveia, soja, ervilhaca, milho, aveia, feijão, nabo forrageiro, soja, ervilhaca, milho e soja, nesta sequência, durante cinco anos e meio. Estudou-se um tratamento adicional, em que o solo foi mantido sem cultivo, porém preparado com uma aração e duas gradagens na mesma época de semeadura das culturas nos demais tratamentos (SC). No último cultivo da soja, cinco testes de chuva simulada foram aplicados sobre os tratamentos, com intensidade variando de 63 a 67 mm h- 1 e duração de uma hora, 24 h após ter sido aplicada uma chuva (molhamento) com intensidade de 65 mm h- 1 e duração suficiente para iniciar a enxurrada. Os sedimentos foram quantificados em amostras de enxurrada coletadas 10 min antes do término de cada chuva simulada. O tamanho de sedimentos foi influenciado pelo sistema de manejo do solo e pela quantidade de chuva: na condição sem cultivo do solo, houve maior quantidade de sedimentos de maior diâmetro do que na condição em que o solo foi cultivado; na condição de solo cultivado, a quantidade de sedimentos de menor diâmetro foi maior do que no solo sem cultivo; e houve tendência de aumentar a quantidade de sedimentos na enxurrada com o aumento do número de chuva simulada, nas diversas condições de manejo do solo e de tamanhos de sedimento. O modelo exponencial ajustou-se aos dados de quantidade e tamanho dos sedimentos e aos de velocidade da enxurrada e cobertura do solo; a quantidade de sedimentos diminuiu com a redução de tamanho destes, e a velocidade da enxurrada diminuiu com o aumento da cobertura do solo. O modelo potencial ajustou-se aos dados de D 50 e velocidade da enxurrada, tendo o D 50 aumentado com o aumento da velocidade. Quantity {{and size}} {{distribution}} of sediments transported by runoff {{are influenced by}} soil management, cover and crop systems, and by rainfall, among other factors, representing an important aspect in soil conservation planning. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify runoff sediments and relate them with runoff velocity, during soybean growth, in a simulated rainfall experiment initiated in 1998 on a typical Hapludox, under the following soil management systems: conventional tillage with one plowing plus two diskings (CT) and no-tillage on a never tilled soil with burned residues (NT). In these treatments, the rotation crop systems consisted of oat, soybean, vetch, corn, oats, bean, <b>fodder</b> radish, soybean, <b>vetch,</b> corn, and soybean. An additional treatment with bare soil with one plowing plus two diskings (BS) was also studied. Five simulated rainfall tests were applied to the treatments in the last soybean crop cycle, with an intensity of 63 - 67 mm h- 1 for one hour, 24 h after a pre-wetting rainfall, with an intensity of 65 mm h- 1 and long enough to initiate runoff. The sediments were quantified in runoff samples collected 10 minutes before the end of each simulated rainfall test, and were related with the runoff velocity. The sediment size in the runoff was influenced by soil management systems and the rainfall quantity. In the treatment without soil cover (BS), the quantity of coarse sediments was higher than in the treatments with cultivated soil, whereas in CT and NT treatments the quantity of fine-sized sediments was higher than in the BS treatment. More sediments tended to be transported in the runoff with the application of more rainfall events. The sediment quantity transported by runoff was related with the sediment size, fitting to a positive exponential model, while runoff velocity decreased exponentially with increased soil cover. The D 50 index was related with other variables, fitting to the potential model and increasing with runoff velocity...|$|R
