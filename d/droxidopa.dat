The BP profile of <b>droxidopa</b> in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension patients (n =  18) was investigated using ambulatory BP monitoring. Following dose optimization and a washout period, 24 -hour “off-drug” data were collected. “On-drug” assessment was conducted after 4 – 5  weeks of <b>droxidopa</b> treatment (mean dose, 444  mg, three times daily). Ambulatory monitoring off drug revealed that 90 % of patients already had abnormalities in the circadian BP profile and did not meet criteria for normal nocturnal BP dipping. On treatment, both overall mean 24 -hour systolic and diastolic BPs were higher compared to off drug (137 / 81  mm Hg vs. 129 / 76  mm Hg; P = . 017 /. 002).

Symptoms of OH are highly variable, ranging from mild light-headedness to recurrent syncope. OH occurs due to dysfunction of one or more components of various complex mechanisms that interplay closely to maintain BP in a normal range during various physiological and associated disease states. Various biochemical and electrophysiological studies are often undertaken to assess the severity and etiology of OH. In addition to the lifestyle modifications, various medications that stimulate the adrenergic receptors or increase central blood volume are used in patients with OH. <b>Droxidopa</b> is a newer agent that increases the levels of norepinephrine in postganglionic sympathetic neurons.

40|$|Autonomic failure, like Parkinson’s disease, is a {{neurotransmitter}} disorder. While Parkinson’s {{disease is}} a disorder of dopamine neurotransmission, auto-nomic failure is a disorder of norepinephrine neuro-transmission. The idea that deficient dopamine neurotransmission in Parkinson’s disease could be overcome by treatment with oral levodopa, the amino acid precursor of dopamine, led to the most suc-cessful therapeutic intervention in 20 th century neu-rology. Although levodopa is the amino acid precursor of both dopamine and norepinephrine, treatment with levodopa leads {{to an increase in}} dopamine but not to a significant increase in norepinephrine levels. Nor-epinephrine is synthesized from levodopa in two steps (Fig. 1). The first step is the decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine by the enzyme L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. The second step, catalyzed by the enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase, is the hydroxylation of dopamine to norepinephrine.

40|$|Summary: Orthostatic {{hypotension}} (OH) is {{a frequent}} non-motor symptom in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) affecting between 22. 9 and 38. 4 % of patients. OH is related in PD to increased risk of falls and possibly to cognitive dysfunction and increased mortality. These data {{emphasizes the importance of}} its prompt recognition and treatment. OH is related to pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic adrenergic denervation, but other factors such as drugs, heat, meals or alcohol intake might also induce or aggravate it. Evidence about the efficacy and safety of pharmacological or non-pharmacological strategies for OH treatment in PD is weak. Non-pharmacological measures include liberal addition of salt to the diet, exercise, compression stocking or physical maneuvers. Severe cases may be treated with midodrine or fludrocortisone. Some results suggest that <b>droxidopa</b> and fipamezole might be effective treatments. We finish this review article by discussing the most important unanswered questions about PD-related OH, which might be the focus of future researc...|$|E
40|$|Introducción: Autonomic dysfunction, {{including}} orthostatic hypotension (OH), sialorrhea, sexual dysfunction, urinary dysfunction and constipation is {{a common}} feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Even though its treatment has been recognized as a major unmet need in PD, there is a paucity of clinical trials to assess their treatment. Areas covered: Evidence about the efficacy and safety of available treatments for autonomic dysfunction is summarized. Potential targets for upcoming therapies are then discussed {{in light of what}} is currently known about the physiopathology of each disorder in PD. Proof-of-concept trials and circumstantial evidence about treatments for autonomic dysfunction as well as upcoming clinical trials are discussed. Finally, critical aspects of clinical trials design are considered. Expert opinion: Botulinum toxin (BTX) or glycopyrrolate might be used for sialorrhea whereas macrogol could be useful in constipation. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that fludrocortisone, domperidone, <b>droxidopa</b> or fipamezole may be effective for the treatment of OH. Tropicamide, clonidine or radiotherapy are under development for sialorrhea. Sildenafil may be effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction; BTX or behavioral therapy for urinary incontinence and lubiprostone and probiotics for constipation. Sound clinical trials are needed in order to allow firm evidence-based recommendations about these treatment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} whether restoring descending noradrenergic inhibitory tone can attenuate pain in a PD rat model, {{which was established}} by stereotaxic infusion of 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) into the bilateral striatum (CPu). PD rats developed thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity at the 4 th week after surgery. HPLC analysis showed that NE content, but not dopamine or 5 -HT, significantly decreased in lumbar spinal cord in PD rats. Additional noradrenergic depletion by injection of N-(2 -chloroethyl) -N-ethyl- 2 -bromobenzylamine (DSP- 4) aggravated pain hypersensitivity in PD rats. At the 5 th week after injection of 6 -OHDA, systemic treatment with pharmacological norepinephrine (NE) precursor <b>droxidopa</b> (L-DOPS) or α 2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine significantly attenuated thermal and mechanical pain hypersensitivity in PD rats. Furthermore, application of norepinephrine (NE) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) reuptake inhibitors duloxetine, but not 5 -HT selective reuptake inhibitors sertraline, significantly inhibited thermal and mechanical pain hypersensitivity in PD rats. Systemic administration of Madopar (L-DOPA) or the D 2 /D 3 agonist pramipexole slightly inhibited the thermal, but not mechanical, hypersensitivity in PD rats. Thus, our study revealed that impairment of descending noradrenergic system may {{play a key role}} in PD-associated pain and restoring spinal noradrenergic inhibitory tone may serve as a novel strategy to manage PD-associated pain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Orthostatic {{hypotension}} (OH) is {{a frequent}} comorbidity affecting between 23 and 38 % of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Several pieces of evidence suggest that OH is related to faster cognitive decline and more frequent falls, and has been also connected to increased mortality. OH can be arbitrarily defined as a drop of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure of 20 or 10 mmHg or more {{in the first three}} minutes after passing from decubitus to an upright position. Till test appears to be the most reliable tool for assessing the orthostatic response. On the other hand, the standing test and evaluation of orthostatic symptoms should be regarded as screening tests. The key physiopathological aspect of OH is an altered baroreflex function resulting from cardiac and vascular sympathetic denervation. Nonetheless, OH can be aggravated by heat, alcohol consumption or by drug treatments, such as antihypertensives, dopamine agonists or amantadine. Treatment should begin with re‐considering drug treatments. After treatment is optimized, nonpharmacological measures may be employed. Drugs treatment should be reserved for patients in whom other strategies have failed. Midodrine and fludrocortisone are the most frequently used treatments, even though evidence about their efficacy and safety is weak. Midodrine has a shorter duration of action and thus avoidance of evening dosing may help keep nocturnal blood pressure dipping intact. Promising alternatives may include <b>droxidopa</b> and fipamezol...|$|E
40|$|Stuart H Isaacson, Julia Skettini Parkinson&# 39;s Disease and Movement Disorders Center of Boca Raton, Boca Raton, FL, USA Abstract: Neurogenic orthostatic {{hypotension}} (nOH) is due {{to failure}} of the autonomic nervous system to regulate blood pressure in response to postural changes due to an inadequate release of norepinephrine, leading to orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. nOH is common in Parkinson&# 39;s disease (PD). Prevalence varies {{throughout the course of}} PD, ranging from 40 % to 60 %, and resulting in symptomatic nOH in approximately half. Symptomatic nOH, including lightheadedness, can limit daily activities and lead to falls. Symptomatic nOH can also limit therapeutic options for treating PD motor symptoms. Clinical evaluation should routinely include symptom assessment and blood pressure measurement of supine, sitting, and 3 -minute standing; 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can also be helpful. Non-pharmacological management of symptomatic nOH involves education, physical maneuvers, and adequate hydration. Current pharmacological treatment of symptomatic nOH includes salt supplement, fludrocortisone, midodrine, pyridostigmine, and other empiric medications. Despite these options, treatment of symptomatic nOH remains suboptimal, often limited by severe increases in supine blood pressure. <b>Droxidopa,</b> an oral prodrug converted by decarboxylation to norepinephrine, is a promising therapeutic option for symptomatic nOH in PD, improving symptoms of nOH, daily activities, falls, and standing systolic blood pressure in several recent trials. These trials demonstrated short-term efficacy and tolerability, with comparable increases in standing and supine blood pressures. Longer-term studies are ongoing to confirm durability of treatment effect. Keywords: (pre) syncope, norepinephrine, autonomic, lightheadedness, treatment, fall...|$|E
