50|$|Women's {{subsistence}} technology includes carrying baskets {{made from}} whole palm leaves with tumplines for carrying, wooden digging sticks, and digging sticks with <b>steel</b> <b>tips.</b> Women may include synthetic feed sacks for carrying plant foods (especially {{for the collection}} of feral mangos and manioc), or cloth sacks or clothing as additional carrying additional resources. Most gathering of root foods involves only the use of traditional palm leaf baskets. Wet season collection of wild tubers uses untipped wooden digging sticks, because the primary tubers (Dracontium margaretae) {{are close to the}} ground surface. <b>Steel</b> <b>tipped</b> digging sticks are primarily used for collection of deeper-growing tubers (mostly Myrossma cannifolia), late in the wet season and during parts of the dry season. Women use these same technologies in gardening. Both men and women also use small shovels and machetes for garden work and harvesting.|$|R

5000|$|For a long time, {{javelins}} {{were made}} of solid wood, typically birch, with a <b>steel</b> <b>tip.</b> The hollow, highly aerodynamic Held javelin, invented by American thrower Bud Held and developed and manufactured by his brother Dick, {{was introduced in the}} 1950s; the first Held javelins were also wooden with <b>steel</b> <b>tips,</b> but later models were made entirely of metal. These new javelins flew further, but were also less likely to land neatly point first; {{as a response to the}} increasingly frequent flat or ambiguously flat landings, experiments with modified javelins started in the early 1980s. The resulting designs, which made flat landings much less common and reduced the distances thrown, became official for men starting in April 1986 and for women in April 1999, and the world records (then 104.80 m by Uwe Hohn, and 80.00 m by Petra Felke) were reset. The current (...) men's world record is held by Jan Železný at 98.48 m (1996); Barbora Špotáková holds the women's world record at 72.28 m (2008).|$|R

5000|$|In modern construction, {{scabbling}} is {{a mechanical}} process of removing {{a thin layer}} of concrete from a structure, typically achieved by compressed air powered machines. A typical scabbling machine uses several heads, each with several carbide or <b>steel</b> <b>tips</b> that peck at the concrete. It operates by pounding a number of tipped rods down onto the concrete surface in rapid succession. It takes several passes with the machine to achieve the desired depth.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} is to analyse (with the help of scanning electron microscopes) {{the quality of the}} dental root surface and the appearance of dental cracks after performing apical preparations using two diffe- rent types of ultrasonic tips. Study design: We used 32 single-rooted teeth that underwent a root canal and apical resection. Afterwards, the teeth were divided into 4 groups of 8 teeth each, with preparations of the apical cavities in the following manner: Group 1 : stainless <b>steel</b> ultrasonic <b>tip</b> at 33 KHz. Group 2 : stainless <b>steel</b> ultrasonic <b>tip</b> at 30 KHz. Group 3 : diamond ultrasonic tip at 30 KHz. Group 4 : diamond ultrasonic tip at 33 KHz. The quality of the root surface and the presence of cracks were evaluated by one single observer using a scanning electron microscope. Results: All of the teeth in our study had cracks after the apical preparations. The mean number of cracks per tooth ranged between 6. 1 ± 1. 9 (group 1) and 3. 5 ± 2. 4 (group 4), with a significantly higher number found in the groups that used stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tips</b> (P=. 03). The types of cracks produced involved: 8 complete cracks (4. 5 %), 167 incomplete cracks (94. 4 %), and 2 intradentinal cracks (1. 1 %), with no significant differences observed between the different frequencies used for each group. Conclusions: Stainless <b>steel</b> ultrasonic <b>tips</b> provoked a larger number of cracks than diamond tips. The frequency of vibration used did not have any effect on the number of cracks found...|$|R

50|$|The {{exhaust system}} for the vehicle {{consists}} of 2.25 in steel tubing, which is run first through the catalytic converter, then through two resonators. The exhaust then splits into two separate sections of piping, exiting through two 3.75 in stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tips</b> {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. The exhaust system is unique in that there is no muffler, instead relying on the turbocharger and resonators to reduce the exhaust volume. The end result is a very distinctive and audible exhaust note, specific only to the SRT-4.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new {{pneumatic}} {{end effector}} system for micro/nano fluidic handling, nanomanufacturing, and micro/nano manipulation is presented. The new micro pneumatic end-effector system {{consists of a}} DC micro-diaphragm pump and compressor, one region of flexible latex tube, a Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) sensor for in-situ measurement of micro force, and a micro <b>steel</b> <b>tip.</b> The micro <b>steel</b> <b>tip</b> of the new pneumatic end effector system has an internal diameter (ID) of 20 μm used for handling nano entities such as carbon nanotubes, DNA, micro/nano particles {{as well as for}} microfluidic handling and droplet control. The DC micro-diaphragm pump is automatically controlled via a voltage driver interfaced with a computer in order to effectively and efficiently control suction force and pressure during microfluidic handling and droplet control in nano maufacturing. The new pneumatic end effector system with force sensing can significantly improve the success rate for handling/depositing micro/nano entities in the case of carbon nanotubes. The experimental results show the success rate of placing carbon nantubes between electrodes can reach close to 80 %. Ultimately, the technology will provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated manufacturing process for batch assembly of micro devices, manufacturing of nano devices, microfluidic droplet control, and drug delivery. © 2006 IEEE.

5000|$|Exhaust — To {{extract the}} maximum amount of power from the Cobra's powerplant, Ford {{engineers}} used tuned mufflers with lower restriction (as compared to the GT). While the factory headers and H-pipe remained the same, the tailpipes were similar to that of a Mustang LX 5.0L (Sport) model in that they had straight stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tips</b> (instead of turn-down tips on the GT). This is because the Cobra had a revised rear fascia, allowing (unlike the GT) for an exposed dual exhaust.

40|$|Abstract. An {{ultrasonic}} sandwich type transducer {{was designed}} for preventing and cleaning the undesired calcarous depositions on the inner walls of heat exchanger and pipes. It uses as active elements two piezoceramic rings sandwiched between a cylindrical back end part of stainless steel and a front end piece of duraluminum, terminated with a convex shaped stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tip.</b> The whole construction is clamped by a hardened steel bolt at a prestressed pressure of about 25 MPa. The transducer works in immerse regime being tightly screwed in a flange of the heat exchanger. The ring shaped piezoceramic active elements are made of a special lead titanate zirconate material, whose main piezoelectric properties do not change significantly up to temperatures of 200 o C, so that the transducer can be effectively used in hot water with high efficiency. The ultrasonic vibrations produced by the piezoactive elements, when excited by an electric signal from a high frequency high power generator, are transmmited and amplified by the front end cap and diffused within the water by the convex shaped stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tip,</b> so that one prevents, to a high percentage, any undesired deposition on the metallic wall because both water and walls are in permanent vibration. The transducer can be easy used with any type of heat exchanger just by changing and adapting the screwed part of the front end piece...|$|R
