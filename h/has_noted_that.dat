5|$|Glatter <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the episode}} exemplifies {{the themes of}} longing and desire which she feels {{characterize}} the series; she has also called to attention its careful balance between tragic and comic elements. Exterior scenes in the episode were filmed in California's Angeles National Forest and blended with stock footage of Washington to enhance the setting.|$|E
5|$|To {{create a}} sense of realism, Scott and Washington interviewed {{numerous}} men and women whose real-life occupations pertained to positions in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Washington <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> he and Scott conducted similar research during the productions of Man on Fire and Crimson Tide.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{industry}} {{has been criticized for}} lacking in racial diversity. For example, critics <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> there are few Asian plus size models. Others <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> there are few black plus-size models with darker skin tones.|$|R

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> there are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|Kishimoto <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{he likes}} Shikamaru {{due to his}} easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.|$|E

5|$|Klaus Dodds <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} a geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played {{against the backdrop of}} Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{local and}} {{upcoming}} weather of Kamloops is observed at this airport's weather station, {{referred to as}} the Kamloops Airport Weather Station. Nav Canada <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> most of the aircraft winds near the Kamloops Airport blow east and west. It has been classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency. An aircraft at this airport may handle no more than 30 passengers. Skydiving can be performed at the airport through Skydive Kamloops. Passengers may also board a courtesy shuttle to other nearby municipalities, such as Blue River, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help {{people all over the country}} to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E
5|$|Detractors {{have raised}} {{concerns}} over Lichtenstein's appropriation, {{in that he}} directly references imagery from other sources in Whaam! and other works of the period. Some have denigrated it as mere copying, to which others have countered that Lichtenstein altered his sources in significant, creative ways. In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> publishers have never sued for copyright infringement, and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals {{in the case of}} Whaam!, as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, guest stars included actor and comedian Patrick Bristow, animator, executive producer, animation director, storyboard artist and producer Butch Hartman (who played Mr. Weed, Peter's boss, and various other characters), writer Gary Janetti who played the Demon and Riff), actor John O'Hurley (who played the Cult Leader), and Waylon Jennings (who played himself). Recurring cast members included Mike Henry who played Cleveland Brown and Lori Alan who played Dianne Simons. This is the first episode Seth MacFarlane's sister, Rachael MacFarlane guest starred in the episode {{as the voice of}} Jennifer. In future episodes she would become a recurring voice actor for the series. Rachel <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> she was asked by Seth to lend her voice for the show, but she did have to audition for the role.|$|E
50|$|The Empire {{entered into}} {{subsequent}} loans, partly to finance railway construction and partly to finance deficits between revenues and the lavish expenditure of the Imperial court. Some financial commentators <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the terms of}} these loans were exceptionally favourable to the French and British banks which facilitated them, whereas others <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the terms reflected the imperial administration's willingness to constantly refinance its debts.|$|R

5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> a number of the villains or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear fuel rod.|$|E
5|$|McLachlan found {{success on}} the Fox {{television}} series Millennium, earning several awards {{for his work on}} the show. He was head-hunted for the series by its creator Chris Carter, who had seen his work on the series Strange Luck. McLachlan was initially offered a position shooting Carter's other active series, The X-Files, then in its third season, but was unable to start work in time. He developed a distinctive style for the series, shooting it with desaturated colours and lighting scenes as though they were to be filmed in black and white; he also made use of high-intensity strobe lighting usually employed for advertising and macro cinematography. McLachlan <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this style briefly became popular after the series' broadcast but that other cinematographers had difficulty adjusting to it.|$|E
5|$|Peyton <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters {{meant that he}} considered some of them {{much more difficult to}} convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly tricky to write for, as the character had an idiosyncratic view of the world which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy and smart, and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E

5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that,</b> because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{oral traditions}} about the castle survive. One of these {{involves}} a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing {{the key to}} her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres on a man called Gallon who was left {{in charge of the}} castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the Gallon of this story.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{renumbering}} in 2003, {{portions of}} US491 in New Mexico have been upgraded to a four-lane divided highway, with grade separations at the busiest interchanges. The New Mexico Department of Transportation <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that,</b> as sections are upgraded, fatality rates improve on the four-lane portions, but remain {{high on the}} two-lane portions. As construction has proceeded, the most dangerous portions of the highway have moved to points where the four-lane portion ends, and traffic merges to two lanes. This has caused the department to coordinate the phases of the upgrades to minimize the number of two-lane/four-lane transitions. Construction on the final phase was originally scheduled to begin January 2008, however the state applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to finish the project and completion was delayed until 2012.|$|E
