50|$|Research {{has shown}} that Pantoea agglomerans {{can serve as a}} plant {{pathogen}} competitor for the management of plant diseases. Fire blight, a plant disease caused by bacterium <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora,</b> is commonly found in pear and apple crops. After coming in contact with <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora,</b> Pantoea agglomerans produces antibiotic properties that are toxic to the fire blight-inducing bacterium. It has been identified that it is possible that habitat modification or exclusion may also {{play a role in the}} effectiveness of the antibiosis of the fire blight biological control.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Jonathan Burrill (April 25, 1839 - April 14, 1916) was an American {{botanist}} {{and plant}} pathologist who first discovered bacterial causes for plant disease. He introduced <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> (called by him Micrococcus amylovorus) as the causal agent of pear fire blight.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology the regulator of motility and amylovoran A (RmaA) gene is a bacterial non-coding RNA. It {{was discovered in}} genome-wide identification of Hfq binding sRNAs in plant pathogen <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora.</b> Together with Hfq it positively controls motility and negatively controls the production of acidic exopolysaccharide amylovoran in E. amylovora.|$|E
50|$|The causal {{pathogen}} is <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora,</b> a Gram-negative bacterium in {{the family}} Enterobacteriaceae. Pears are the most susceptible, but apples, loquat, crabapples, quinces, hawthorn, cotoneaster, pyracantha, raspberry and some other rosaceous plants are also vulnerable. The disease {{is believed to be}} indigenous to North America, from where it spread to {{most of the rest of}} the world.|$|E
50|$|In a study, the {{presence}} of non-protein amino acids 2-amino-3-cyclopropylbutanoic acid and 2-amino-5-chloro-4-pentenoic acid was revealed. The former acid {{was found to be}} toxic to the fungus Cercospora kikuchii, the arthropod Oncopeltus fasciatus and the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens, <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora,</b> and Xanthomonas campestris. The toxicity for bacteria could be eliminated by adding isoleucine to the medium. The other acid did not prove toxic.|$|E
50|$|Glycopeptides are {{produced}} {{by a number of}} bacteria and have been indicated in disease development. A glycopeptide from Corynebacterium sepedonicum causes rapid wilt and marginal necrosis. A toxin from Corynebacterium insidiosum causes plugging of the plant stem interfering with water movement between cells. Amylovorin is a polysaccharide from <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> and causes wilting in rosaceous plants. A polysaccharide from Xanthomonas campestris obstructs water flow through phloem causing black rot in cabbage.|$|E
50|$|Although immunogold {{labeling}} {{is typically}} used for transmission electron microscopy, when the gold is 'silver-enhanced' {{it can be}} seen using brightfield microscopy. The silver enhancement increases the particle size, also making scanning electron microscopy possible. In order to produce the silver-enhanced gold particles, colloidal gold particles are placed in an acidic enhancing solution containing silver ions. Gold particles then act as a nucleation site and silver is deposited onto the particle. An example of the application of silver-enhanced immunogold labeling (IGSS) was in the identification of the pathogen <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Harovin Sundown pear (Pyrus communis L.) is an {{attractive}} late-season fresh market pear with good storage capability. It is highly productive with no biennial bearing. The tree has excellent resistance to fire blight (a bacterial disease incited by <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora).</b> This new cultivar, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) at its Research Centers in Harrow and Vineland Station, Ontario, Canada, is recommended by the Ontario Tender Fruit Producers' Marketing Board for general planting in Ontario. It is protected under Canadian Plant Breeders Rights legislation (application number 08-6315).|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Gouk was {{appointed}} {{as a foundation}} Plant Pathologist with the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, based at Ruakura Research Centre, Hamilton, to establish plant pathology capabilities. She led research to improve understanding of the ecology, epidemiology and management of fungal and bacterial diseases of horticultural crops including pome fruit, stonefruit and kiwifruit. Her work on prediction of fire blight (<b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora)</b> has helped pomefruit growers to reduce application of antibiotic sprays. She then held the roles of project leader and program leader with the Horticulture and Food Crown Research Institute, New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|ArcZ {{has been}} shown to {{strongly}} bind the global post-transcriptional regulator protein Hfq. In Salmonella it {{has been shown}} to repress the expression of protein coding genes sdaCB (involved in serine uptake) and tpx (involved in oxidative stress) genes, and of the horizontally acquired gene methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP). Both sdaCB and STM3216 are regulated by ArcZ binding the ribosome binding site, the tpx mRNA is targeted in the coding sequence (CDS).ArcZ positively stimulates expression of RpoS stationary phase sigma factor. In plant pathogen <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> ArcZ was shown to positively control the type III secretion system (T3SS), amylovoran exopolysaccahride production, biofilm formation, and bacterial motility, but it negatively regulates bacterial attachment.|$|E
5000|$|An Hfq binding sRNA is an sRNA {{that binds}} the {{bacterial}} RNA binding protein called Hfq. A number of bacterial small RNAs {{which have been}} shown to bind to Hfq have been characterised (see list).Many of these RNAs share a similar structure composed of three stem-loops. [...] Several studies have expanded this list, and experimentally validated a total of 64 Hfq binding sRNA in Salmonella Typhimurium. A transcriptome wide study on Hfq binding sites in Salmonella mapped 126 Hfq binding sites within sRNAs. Genomic SELEX has been used to show that Hfq binding RNAs are enriched in the sequence motif 5'-AAYAAYAA-3'. Genome-wide study identified 40 candidate Hfq-dependent sRNAs in plant pathogen <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora.</b> 12 of them were confirmed by Northern blot.|$|E
5000|$|Collar rot is a symptomatically {{described}} {{disease that}} is usually caused by any one of various fungal and oomycete plant pathogens. It is present where the pathogen causes a lesion localized at or about the collet between the stem and the root. The lesions develop around the stem eventually forming a [...] "collar". Observationally, collar rot grades into [...] "basal stem rot", and with some pathogens is {{the first phase of}} [...] "basal stem rot" [...] often followed by [...] "root rot". Collar rot is most often observed in seedings grown in infected soil. The pathogens that cause collar rot may be species or genera specific. But generalist pathogens such as Athelia rolfsii (aka Sclerotium rolfsii) are known to attack over 200 different species. While bacteria caused collar rot is not common, trees infected with Fire blight (<b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora)</b> may develop collar rot. Non-parasitic collar rot may be caused by winter damage.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of apples, in which {{research}} is being carried out {{in order to develop}} resistance to diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), orchard fireblight (<b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora),</b> woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) and collar rot (Phytophthora cactorum), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are major gene resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species Malus floribunda. Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. Major gene resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar Northern Spy has a long-standing reputation for its major gene resistance to woolly apple aphid. Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop woolly aphid resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793. Much later it was shown that the cultivar was also very resistant to collar rot and a useful breeding parent for this resistance.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} and recently, trunk {{injection}} of pesticides and plant resistance activators has been investigated in agriculture for control of pathogens and insect pests on fruit tree crops and grapevines. The most investigated are diseases and pests of avocado, apple, and grapevine, such as Phytophthora root rot of avocado Phytophthora cinnamomi and avocado thrips Scirtothrips perseae, fire blight <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> and apple scab Venturia inaequalis, oblique banded leaf roller Choristoneura rosaceana and codling moth Cydia pomonella, and grapevine downy mildew Plasmopara viticola and powdery mildew Uncinula necator. Apple trees are especially interesting as a research model in agriculture since {{it is known that}} apple production requires intensive spray schedules for control of pathogenic fungus V. inaequalis with as many as 15-22 sprays of fungicides per season in humid climate. Hence, trunk injection of pesticides is considered as an option for precise compound delivery which will reduce the negative impact of drift-driven pesticide losses in the environment, that occur after each spraying. Besides negative consequences of frequent pesticide applications in the environment, stem injection of grapevines is investigated in viticulture for control of pathogens with difficult biologies which infect and destroy woody tissues and that cannot be controlled efficiently by canopy spray applications of fungicides. To increase the efficiency of injected compounds in trees and vines, important considerations are plant anatomy, weather and soil conditions, tree physiology processes, spatial and temporal distribution of injected compound, and the chemical properties of injected compound and formulation.|$|E
50|$|Tissues {{affected}} by the symptoms of <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> include blossoms, fruits, shoots, and branches of apple (Pomoideae), pear, and many other rosaceous plants. All symptoms are above ground and are typically easy to recognize. Symptoms on blossoms include water soaking of the floral receptacle, ovary, and peduncles. This results in a dull, gray-green appearance at 1-2 weeks after petal fall, and eventually tissues will shrivel and turn black. The base of the blossom and young fruit show similar symptoms as infection spreads. Opaque white or amber colored droplets of bacterial ooze {{can be seen on}} the infected tissue when the environment is high in humidity. Shoots show similar symptoms but develop much more rapidly. A “Shepherd's Crook,” can be seen when the tip of the shoot wilts, diseased shoot leaves typically have blackening along the mid-vein and then die. In number, diseased shoots give the tree a blighted appearance. Initial infection of blossoms and shoots can spread to larger tree limbs. Branches will darken and become water soaked. Advanced infection develops cracks in bark and a sunken surface. Wood under the bark will become streaked with black discoloration. Immature fruit forms water-soaked lesions and later turned black. Bacterial ooze can be found on these lesions. Severe infections result in fruit turning entirely black and shriveling.A primary inoculum of this disease is typically from cankers formed the season before. The factors that determine whether or not cankers become active are not well known, but it is thought that cankers found on larger tree limbs are more likely to become active. It is also thought that age may be a factor.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the sites of overwintering of <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> (Burrill) Winslow et al. outside of living tissue in Utah. Bacterial isolates were taken from the surfaces of blighted twigs and mummified fruits remaining on the tree; also from internal dead tissue of blighted twigs and mummies, and from soil beneath blighted trees. Each isolate was tested for agglutination with antiserum specific for Erwina amylovora, susceptibility to <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> bacteriophage, production of symptoms in pear seedlings and development of bacterial ooze on green pears. Both virulent and avirulent isolates were taken from all sites tested. There was also a slight {{increase in the number of}} <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> isolates taken as spring approached. There was no apparent difference in apple or pear trees as overwintering hosts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> is phytopathogenic {{bacterium}} {{which causes}} serious plant disease Fire Blight on pome-fruit and surrounding 200 Rosaceae species. Today this disease is spreading across Europe, the Near East, the Mediterranean, New Zealand, the United States {{and many other}} countries. Fire Blight is a very destructive disease. Among the symptoms are scorched leaves, necrosis, cankers, secretion of ooze from fruit and other affected location and watering from fruits. Insects like bees can transport bacterium cells into other blossoms and trees. Due to this fact Fire Blight can spread very quickly and destroy harvests, damage trees and even destroy orchards. There is no protection in Europe except resistence breeding, quarantine arrangement, or using antagnonistic bacterium. Early recogntion of Fire Blight symptoms is a key step {{in the prevention of}} more severe consequences. There are many tools in diagnosing <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> including the observation of symptoms, cultivation methods, serological or molecular biological techniques among others. In this paper I demonstrate some of these detection techniques. As the quick detection of <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> is important, I summarize the molecular detection technique LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification), which is a quick, low-cost and very sensitive technique besides other methods because of the isothermal conditions for amplification. Because of this, LAMP may be a suitable diagnostic tool for the detection of <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pear {{trees on}} their own roots are tested in {{comparison}} to grafted trees in growth and yield characteristics and with special regard to the tolerance to diseases, above all fire blight (<b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora).</b> In spring 2004 15 randomized trees of the cultivar 'Williams' from three variants (self rooted in vitro, self rooted long cuttings, grafted on Quince A) were planted in a pear orchard, which was heavily infected with fire blight (<b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora)</b> the previous years. The trees were left untreated. Growth and yield characteristics, plant diseases and tree losses were observed. After four years the in vitro self rooted trees were significantly more vigorous in growth than those grafted on quince A. The self rooted long cuttings were comparable in growth with grafts on quince, but showed high tree losses probably due to frost damages in the first winter one year after planting. However no infections with <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> could be observed so far.

40|$|<b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> (Burrill, Winslow et al.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pathogens of pear and apple and subject to strict quarantine regulations worldwide. Fire blight disease causes serious damages in pear orchards in Hungary. The aim of our experiment was to test the susceptibility of pear cultivars to Hungarian E. amylovora isolates under laboratory conditions. For inoculation test isolates were chosen from different host plants, areas and years. Seven traditional pear cultivars were chosen for testing. Fruit infection was rated according to the diameter of spots produced by the pathogen around the inoculation puncture. Cultivars and isolates were assigned to five susceptibility groups (symptomless, low susceptibility, moderate susceptibility, susceptible and very susceptible). The Hungarian <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> isolates showed different results. We found different susceptibility of traditional pear cultivars. The cultivars Alexander Lucas and Stössel tábornok represented the less susceptible category. Eldorado, Serres Olivér, Diel vajkörte were moderately susceptible. Thus, the most susceptible cultivars were Téli esperes and Drouard elnök. In conclusion, these results can be used for the classification of <b>Erwinia</b> <b>amylovora</b> isolates and in future breeding programmes for resistance...|$|E
