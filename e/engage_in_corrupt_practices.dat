40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine how the {{institutional}} environment impacts the nature of corruption affecting entrepreneurship in transition economies. Drawing on a survey and in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs in Montenegro, the paper finds that corruption is a pervasive presence which has not been ameliorated despite economic reforms. Montenegro is a transition economy which has made significant strides in terms of creating a more open market economy. However, reforms have often overlooked corruption which remains prevalent, and the institutional environment has left space for officials and entrepreneurs to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices.</b> The paper shows that although it takes different forms, corruption can be viewed as a cultural impediment even if the majority of entrepreneurs are not exposed to it...|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between corruption and firm performance in Greece using firm level data. Corruption is overall negatively associated with firm size and growth at the firm level. We focus {{on the effect of}} ‘administrative corruption’, whereby firms <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices</b> and bribery of government officials. We contrast the firm experience of corruption and the contextual experience of corruption at the sectoral level and find that the latter, contextual corruption is more important. The contextual effect of corruption identifies the magnitude of systemic corruption in Greece, indicating the need for reforms in an institutional environment that allows corrupt practices. Furthermore, firms of different size appear differently affected by corruption. This suggests that firm engagement in corruption is heterogeneous. Using quantile regressions, small and medium firms display a higher engagement in corrupt practices. However, their performance is less correlated with corruption than that of large firms...|$|E
40|$|Does {{corporate}} lobbying simply {{add value}} by allowing firms to communicate expert information to policy makers, {{or does it}} also add value by facilitating potentially illegal quid pro quo arrangements, where lawmakers receive private benefits in exchange for favorable policy decisions? Using the corruption scandal involving the top Washington D. C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff as an exogenous negative shock {{to the ability of}} firms to lobby, we first examine whether lobbying affects the market value of firms, and second, whether some of this added market value can be attributed to illegal lobbying practices. The results suggest that firms that lobby more experience a significant decrease in market value following the guilty plea by Mr. Abramoff to bribery and corruption. A firm that spent $ 100, 000 more on lobbying prior to the event year experiences an average decrease of $ 1. 4 million in value in a 3 -day event window around the guilty plea, suggesting that lobbying activity increases shareholder value. To examine whether corrupt lobbying practices add value, we use corporate social responsibility rankings to capture a firm’s propensity to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices,</b> and find that lobbying firms with a poor reputation experience a greater decrease in value following the scandal. We also find that legislation aimed at curbing corrupt lobbying practices significantly reduces firm value. A firm tha...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} incidents of collapse of reinforced concrete buildings in Nigeria. Many research works, suspecting the quality of concrete produced in Nigeria, have focused on concrete with few attention on steel, perhaps because its production is usually in a more controlled environment. Over the years, many clients of building construction projects or their representatives have shown preference for imported steel bars over the locally-produced steel bars. This research work sets out to investigate the quality of steel reinforcement produced locally and compare them with imported steel bars. The diameter of the two classes of bars available in the open market at Ilorin, Nigeria were measured and their deviations from their manufacturer’s designated diameter were determined. Also, their response to the application of load and deterioration in different environments, simulated by their immersion in water, hydrochloric acid (HCL) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), were studied. Locally-produced bars deviated more from their designated diameter than the imported bars. The imported steel bars have higher strength and experienced lower strain compared to the locally produced steel. They also showed better corrosion resistance, when immersed in distilled water and HCL, than the locally-produced steel bars. The preference for imported steel by clients of building projects is justified. There {{is a need for}} regulatory bodies, such as the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON), to strictly monitor and penalize local steel manufacturers that <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices</b> leading to significant dimensional and strength deviations from specification. This has the potential of minimizing the incidence of building collapse in Nigeria...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to examine {{if there is a}} significant relationship between organizational culture and tolerance of corrupt practices among the Non-Governmental Organizations located in Kenya. Despite the fact that NGOs have been attributed with a strong organizational culture, previous literature indicates that there is a connection between the organizational culture and decisions to <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices.</b> Another purpose is to investigate tolerance of corrupt practices and determine the dominant organizational culture among NGOs. The study applied the competing values framework, which describes four dimensions of organizational culture. Mixed methods techniques were used to collect data from a sample of 185 participants selected from 30 organizations in Nairobi. The organizational culture data was collected using the organizational culture assessment instrument while tolerance of corruption was collected using ten scenarios in the first phase. The qualitative data was collected through telephone interviews with six participants. Statistical analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics to test for the most dominant culture and tolerance of corrupt practices. Clan dimension was the most dominant dimension, while some of the practices were perceived as less corrupt and likely to occur. Bivariate correlations revealed the number of years working in an organization was associated with the acceptance variable, while clan culture was correlated to corrupt variable. The three propositions were not supported by the multivariate analysis of variance. However, the second proposition could not be tested due to lack of adequate data to compare. In sum, the study did not find a significant relationship between the dimensions of organizational culture and the tolerance of corrupt practices. The study has helped in exposing some of the areas requiring further strengthening and is also useful in setting the agenda for future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the motivational value of rewards {{in the world of}} work is interesting but difficult to understand. Variations in research reports and inadequate comprehension of the efficiency and motivational value of rewards have brought about confusions, controversies and contradictions among authors, researchers, consultants and practitioners in the field of Industrial and Organisational Psychology (Mangham, 2007; Muula, 2006; Muula & Maseko, 2005; Palmer, 2006; World Bank, 2004). As a consequence, organisations are applying theories and models of motivation selectively depending on their beliefs, ideological framework of values and assumptions (Dzimbiri, 2009). The study was therefore carried out as a positive contribution to the existing knowledge and debate on the motivational value of rewards for health professionals in the public health sectors of the developing countries. Through a systematic sampling method, 571 health professionals were sampled for the study. Data were collected {{through the use of a}} self-administered questionnaire which was composed based on the data collected from desk research/literature review, focus group discussions and interviews. The findings of the study revealed that the Malawi‟s Ministry of Health (MoH) is failing to attract, motivate and retain health professionals; there is perception of inequity of the rewards among the health professionals; health professionals develop coping strategies to supplement their monthly financial rewards; health professionals <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices</b> to supplement their monthly financial rewards; and there is erosion of industrial democracy in the Malawi‟s Public Health Sector. While the statistical testing of the hypothesized model proved a lack of fit between the variables, the statistical testing of the re-specified model suggests that there is a positive relationship between financial rewards and reward-related problems being faced by health professionals in the Malawi‟s MoH. Through the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) exercise, an inverse (negative) relationship between financial and non-financial rewards was deduced, and scientifically and graphically demonstrated. Both the re-specified and graphical models symbolize a pragmatic departure from the theoretical model whose authors (Franco, Bennett, Kanfer & Stubblebine, 2004) are largely inclined to the use of non-financial rewards and suggest that financial rewards should be used with caution. These findings also reject the Herzberg‟s two factor theory (Herzberg, 1960) which claims that financial rewards (salaries) are not a motivator. The major recommendations of the study are that the Franco et al. ‟s (2004) model should be adopted and adapted in the Malawi‟s MoH with the view that the value of both financial and non-financial rewards (as motivators) varies from individual to individual due to individual differences and prevailing factors/forces in both the work environment and wider society in which the MoH operates; a hybrid reward system combining the strengths of time-based, performance-based and competence-based reward systems should be developed and implemented; the results of scientifically testing the re-specified model and the inverse (causal) relationship established between financial and non-financial rewards (as demonstrated in a graphic model) should be re-tested with other samples in the public health sectors of the developing countries; and the motivational value of non-financial rewards should be scientifically established and compared with the motivational value of financial rewards used independent of each other in business organisations to make an objective conclusion on the rewards-motivation debate...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{a small part of}} the author’s PhD study. While {{in-depth}} interviews were conducted, these are not utilized in this paper given the memorandum of agreement signed with the HR Manager of the case study of a government commercial company, namely Post Fiji Limited. Respecting this, this paper is based only on various relevant publicly available archival data of annual reports, business magazines, newspaper articles and staff newsletters. These past data relates much to the episode under investigation which is during the period the first CEO (at that time the title was Managing Director-MD) held office at the subject case study and thereafter. Not only is this entity one of the best performing government commercial companies in Fiji, it is also one of the very few profitable government owned postal operations worldwide. The paper details and analyses the top-management and certain Board member actions, revealed corrupt by an audit. Post the departure of the said MD from the entity, he was alleged to have accepted payments not entitled to. A few other executives were exposed as those <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices</b> as well. The paper used the theoretical debate between Agency and Structure to give an empirical backing on which of the two holds in a real life institutional setting. The paper concludes that even when all looks well in a good performing government entity from afar, there are gaps for supposed corruption at the highest levels. Nonetheless, hats off to those who conduct the audit and do a good job of revealing all who <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> suspected <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices</b> which may remain undetected in successful entities if otherwise. In terms of Agency versus Structure theoretical arguments, this paper agrees with Cockerham (2005) who elaborates that while agency can allow individuals to reject or modify their lifestyle patterns and to carry out self benefiting activities, structure can cut back and restrict the behaviour options that are available to individuals (Cockerham, 2005) ...|$|R
50|$|Until 2010, few {{corruption}} {{cases have}} been prosecuted against the Austrian police. There have been a low number of indictments relating to corruption. This is supported by Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index which ranks Austria among the 16 countries with the lowest corruption levels with 7.8 points. The general public support these statistics further as only 25% believe that bribe offering and bribe acceptance is widespread amongst Austrian police officers. Whilst this figure may still appear to be high, it is still {{much lower than the}} average for the EU (34%). The success, in comparison to many other nations, can be in part attributed to the stable economic performance of the state, which allows the Austrian police force to receive appropriate salaries. As a result, the likelihood that a significant number of Austrian police officers would consider <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices</b> as a way of making a living is minimal, and rather acts of police corruption tend to be committed episodically. It must also be noted that Austria is a gateway to the European Union from the Eastern European countries, which creates additional corruption opportunities. Despite this, studies illustrate that officers and supervisors tend to be knowledgeable about the boundaries of the police culture, especially with regards to the types of behaviours permitted and prohibited.|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} literature {{exists on}} the adverse effects of corruption on inward FDI and the impact this may have on economic development but the reverse causality has not been fully explored. Legislation in the US and the EU prohibits firms from <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices</b> <b>in</b> foreign countries and this suggests that foreign-owned firms might {{be less likely to}} pay bribes. However, such legislation may be ineffective because foreign firms have to adapt to local market conditions or risk being uncompetitive. Using firmlevel data for 41 emerging countries, a probit model estimates the probability that a firm pays bribes. To allow for possible endogeneity this probit analysis is repeated with an instrument to proxy for endogenous foreign ownership. Then, a propensity score matching technique tests for differences in the propensity to pay bribes by domestic and foreign firms. The paper finds no difference in the behavior of foreignowned and domestic firms with respect to <b>corrupt</b> <b>practices.</b> Results are robust to different levels of foreign ownership and support the view that foreign-owned firms adapt to local practices and are neither more nor less likely to pay bribes than comparable domestic firms. The paper finds that other variables including bureaucracy, government contracts, and perceived difficulties with civil society (legal and political) do have statistically significant effects on increasing bribery and that some others, such as per capita GDP, tend to reduce bribery. The study concludes that {{there is no evidence that}} foreign ownership, after investment has occurred, tends to reduce bribery but it does support the view that foreignowned firms adopt local behavioral norms...|$|R
