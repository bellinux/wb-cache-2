40|$|A {{cheap and}} easy to handle {{methodology}} was adapted to achieve the measurement of CO 2 diffusivity within solid food matrices. This methodology was tested on real food products with different composition (cooked ham, butter and <b>processed</b> <b>cheese).</b> Local distribution profiles, measured using a customized chemical titration, permitted {{in the same time}} to determine CO 2 solubility and identify diffusivity values within the different kinds of food studied. Values of solubility were found of 2. 09 ± 0. 10 × 10 − 7 mol kg− 1 Pa− 1 for cooked ham, 3. 52 ± 0. 09 × 10 − 7 mol kg− 1 Pa− 1 <b>for</b> <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> and 3. 81 ± 0. 15 × 10 − 7 mol kg− 1 Pa− 1 for butter, at 22 °C.

40|$|The United States cheese {{consumption}} {{has grown}} considerably over the years. Using Nielsen Homescan panel data for calendar years 2005 and 2006, this dissertation examines {{the effect of}} economic and socio-demographic factors on the demand for disaggregated cheese varieties and on the cheese industry in general. In the first essay, we estimated the censored demand for 14 cheese varieties and identified the respective own-price and cross-price elasticities. Also, non-price factors were determined affecting the purchase of each variety {{as well as the}} impact of generic dairy advertising. Results revealed that most of the natural cheese varieties have an elastic demand while the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> products exhibited inelastic demands. Strong substitution and complementarity relationships were identified as well, and a two quarter carry-over effect of advertising was observed for most of cheese demands. Results also showed that household demographics affected the demands differently, depending {{on the nature of the}} cheese varieties. The second essay examined the impact of retail promotion on the decision to purchase private label <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> products using a probit model. A strong negative relationship was found between national brand manufacturer couponing activity and the private label purchase decision. Therefore, national brand couponing appears to be an effective strategy for manufacturers to deter private label growth. This analysis also shows that the decision of purchasing a private label cheese product is influenced by socio-demographic characteristics of the household, namely household income and size, age and education level of the household head, race, ethnicity, and location. In the third study, the feasibility of fortifying <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> with omega- 3 is investigated. This ex-ante analysis took into account the market conditions and evaluates the increase in the demand <b>for</b> <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> needed to offset the costs of fortification in order to maintain the profitability of manufacturers like Kraft. Initially, the censored demand <b>for</b> <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> products is estimated using panel data; subsequently, the profitability of manufacturing such product is determined.

The control sample of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> was made using the sodium chloride (NaCl) only. The <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> samples were analyzed for chemical (fat, moisture, protein, salt, pH, and meltability), physical (hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness and gumminess), microbiological (total plate, coliform, yeast, and mold counts), and sensory (color, texture, and saltiness) characteristics. The results of fat content, moisture content, pH and meltability in T 1 and T 2 were not significantly different than the control, but in the microbial results, the control had the lowest number of microbial counts followed by T 1 and T 2.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the risk of}} Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) foodborne illness from natural and <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses.</b> Microbial risk assessment {{in this study was}} conducted according to four steps: hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. The hazard identification of C. perfringens on cheese was identified through literature, and dose response models were utilized for hazard characterization of the pathogen. For exposure assessment, the prevalence of C. perfringens, storage temperatures, storage time, and annual amounts of cheese consumption were surveyed. Eventually, a simulation model was developed using the collected data and the simulation result was used to estimate the probability of C. perfringens foodborne illness by cheese consumption with @RISK. C. perfringens was determined to be low risk on cheese based on hazard identification, and the exponential model (r = 1. 82 × 10 − 11) was deemed appropriate for hazard characterization. Annual amounts of natural and <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> consumption were 12. 40 ± 19. 43 g and 19. 46 ± 14. 39 g, respectively. Since the contamination levels of C. perfringens on natural (0. 30 Log CFU/g) and <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses</b> (0. 45 Log CFU/g) were below the detection limit, the initial contamination levels of natural and <b>processed</b> <b>cheeses</b> were estimated by beta distribution (α 1 = 1, α 2 = 91; α 1 = 1, α 2 = 309) ×uniform distribution (a = 0, b = 2; a = 0, b = 2. 8) to be − 2. 35 and − 2. 73 Log CFU/g, respectively. Moreover, no growth of C. perfringens was observed for exposure assessment to simulated conditions of distribution and storage.

40|$|Fundamental {{rheological}} properties of {{two types of}} <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> slices, Individually Wrapped Slices (IWS) and Slice On Slice (SOS), produced under different process conditions, were determined. Shear creep, shear stress relaxation, dynamic impulse measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy {{were used to determine}} the {{rheological properties}} and the texture of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> slices. The shear creep, the shear stress relaxation and the dynamic impulse halfsquare measurements were carried out using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. A Texture Analyser TA. HD was used for the shear stress relaxation measurements. Comparison of shear stress relaxation results between the two instruments showed agreement. The shear creep compliance of IWS cheese show higher values than that of SOS cheese at 21 °C. On the other hand, the shear stress relaxation moduli indicated lower values for IWS cheese than SOS cheese at 21 °C. This indicated that IWS cheese was more liquid-like than SOS cheese though there are no significant compositional differences. Higher shear creep compliance is related to less resistance of the cheese to deformation while lower shear stress relaxation modulus indicates less resistance to deformation. These results are also in agreement. The melting properties of the two types of slices were studied with dynamic impulse measurements. IWS cheese melted at a lower temperature (50 °C) than SOS cheese (60 °C). Microscopic structure indicates more protein-protein interaction in SOS cheese than IWS cheese, which had smaller fat globules evenly distributed within the protein network, thereby reducing the protein-protein interaction and making the network integrity weak, thus confirming the shear creep and shear stress relaxation findings. The rheological and textural differences between the two cheeses were attributed to different process conditions used during the cheese manufacture. These different process conditions are the heating temperature and time combination and the cooling rate. The comparison of static measurements, the dynamic measurements using small deformations and the microstructure to determine the properties of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> is a useful tool {{to determine the effects of}} different process conditions.

40|$|Several polysaccharides are of {{interest}} in dairy products because {{of their ability to}} bind water and other components of the food systems, often leading to major changes in their functional properties. This work aimed to measure and understand the effects of specific polysaccharides in cheeses on the rheological properties related to functionality. The following polysaccharide−cheese systems were used: the microbial polysaccharides xanthan gum (xanthan), high acyl gellan gum (Gellan-H) and low acyl gellan gum (Gellan-L) in <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> and an exopolysaccharide (EPS) from a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in very low fat Mozzarella cheese. Locust bean gum (LBG) was also used with xanthan. Model <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> using rennet casein and soya oil was developed on a small scale (30 g) using a controlled temperature, stirrer speed and time of mixing. Initially, lactose content, moisture losses and sample preparation were standardised to lower the variability in rheological measurements. The effects of xanthan, xanthan+LBG, Gellan-H and Gellan-L on the rheology of the <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> were studied. As the polysaccharide concentration increased from 0. 0 to 2. 0 % (wt/wt), the fracture stress (firmness) increased whereas the fracture strain (longness) decreased for gellan gum and the effect depended on the polysaccharide. The crossover temperature (where G' = G''), an indicator of viscoelasticity, was increased dramatically by these polysaccharides. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed polysaccharide clusters in the protein matrix for Gellan-H, xanthan and xanthan+LBG but not very distinct clusters for Gellan- L. The effect of Gellan-H and Gellan-L on the water mobility and spreading properties of model <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> was investigated. Spreading properties were measured by elongational viscosity, and water mobility was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry. The NMR data revealed that both polysaccharides significantly reduced the water mobility in the cheese but that the reduction was greater for Gellan-H. The rheology data showed that the addition of polysaccharide increased the elongational viscosity <b>for</b> <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> containing both Gellan-H and Gellan-L. In situ exopolysaccharide (EPS) -producing cultures are widely used to improve moisture retention and texture in low fat cheese manufacture but are limited by a low level of EPS production. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an “all-dairy” ingredient with an increased content of EPS and greater functionality of the EPS for dairy applications such as Mozzarella cheese. An EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus was chosen and its growth was optimised for the development of the bioingredient. The fermented biomass was harvested at the end of the exponential phase and freeze dried. The reduced viable cell count and the retention of ropiness of the powder from the drying process enabled a higher level of EPS inoculation in a preliminary Mozzarella cheese manufacturing trial. Pilot-scale very low fat model Mozzarella cheese was manufactured with and without added EPS powder and in situ EPS culture (EPS-C). Large strain rheology, elongational viscosity, melt and NMR relaxometry were used to determine the effects of the in situ and added EPS on the functionality of the cheeses. Cheeses made with the EPS ingredient (EPS-P) retained the highest moisture content (66. 0 %) without any visible serum exudation. The cheeses made with non-EPS-producing cultures (CTR) and EPS-C had lower moisture contents of 57. 5 and 60. 2 % respectively. Such higher moisture retention of the cheeses made with EPS-P was reflected in the rheological properties of the final cheeses. The cheeses made with EPS-P exhibited greater meltability, lower elongational viscosity and lower modulus of deformability (stiffness) and fracture stress than those made with EPS-C and CTR. Future work to develop this area of the functional effects of the addition of polysaccharides to cheese would include protein−polysaccharide interactions and better definition of the water affinity of polysaccharide compared with that of protein...|$|R
