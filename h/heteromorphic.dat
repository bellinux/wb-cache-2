25|$|A {{distinct}} SI mechanism {{exists in}} heterostylous flowers, termed <b>heteromorphic</b> self-incompatibility. This mechanism {{is probably not}} evolutionarily related to the more familiar mechanisms, which are differentially defined as homomorphic self-incompatibility.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a botanical genetic {{polymorphism}} is heterostyly, in which flowers occur in different forms with different arrangements of the pistils and the stamens. The system is called <b>heteromorphic</b> self-incompatibility, and the general 'strategy' of stamens separated from pistils is known as herkogamy.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{cladogram}} {{derived from}} Kenrick and Crane's studies {{and its implications}} for the evolution of land plants have been questioned by others. A 2008 review by Gensel notes that recently discovered fossil spores suggest that tracheophytes were present earlier than previously thought; perhaps earlier than supposed stem group members. Spore diversity suggests that there were many plant groups, of which no other remains are known. Some early plants may have had <b>heteromorphic</b> alternation of generations, with later acquisition of isomorphic gametophytes in certain lineages.|$|E
25|$|Dispersal {{of cells}} from the biofilm colony is an {{essential}} stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the biofilm extracellular matrix, such as dispersin B and deoxyribonuclease, {{may play a role}} in biofilm dispersal. Biofilm matrix degrading enzymes may be useful as anti-biofilm agents. Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, cis-2-decenoic acid, is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies. Secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, this compound induces cyclo <b>heteromorphic</b> cells in several species of bacteria and the yeast Candida albicans.|$|E
25|$|Almost all heterostylous taxa feature SI to some extent. The loci {{responsible}} for SI in heterostylous flowers, are strongly {{linked to the}} loci {{responsible for}} flower polymorphism, and these traits are inherited together. Distyly is determined by a single locus, which has two alleles; tristyly is determined by two loci, each with two alleles. <b>Heteromorphic</b> SI is sporophytic, i.e. both alleles in the male plant, determine the SI response in the pollen. SI loci always contain only two alleles in the population, {{one of which is}} dominant over the other, in both pollen and pistil. Variance in SI alleles parallels the variance in flower morphs, thus pollen from one morph can fertilize only pistils from the other morph. In tristylous flowers, each flower contains two types of stamens; each stamen produces pollen capable of fertilizing only one flower morph, out of the three existing morphs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} either homomorphic, all with one form, or <b>heteromorphic,</b> with {{different}} forms on one plant. Homomorphic leaves are always simple and entire. Plants with <b>heteromorphic</b> leaves generally have pinnately divided basal leaves with either filiform (feather-like) or linear segments, and undivided leaves {{higher on the}} stem.|$|E

5000|$|In {{plants with}} <b>heteromorphic</b> gametophytes, {{there are two}} {{distinct}} kinds of gametophytes. Because the two gametophytes differ in form and function, they are termed <b>heteromorphic,</b> from hetero- [...] "different" [...] and morph [...] "form". The egg producing gametophyte {{is known as a}} megagametophyte, because it is typically larger, and the sperm producing gametophyte is known as a microgametophyte. Gametophytes which produce egg and sperm on separate plants are termed Dioicous.|$|E
50|$|Some Sculpin may be sperm <b>heteromorphic.</b> Their ejaculates {{appear to}} contain fertile sperm {{as well as}} disc-shaped, {{infertile}} sperm.|$|E

50|$|The formation's thin shelled <b>heteromorphic</b> ammonites {{probably}} {{lived at}} depths of 36-183 m. The formation's ammonites generally suggest that its rock were of Turonian age.|$|E
50|$|In land plants, {{anisogamy}} is universal. As in animals, {{female and}} male gametes are called, respectively, eggs and sperm. Either the sporophyte or the gametophyte may be reduced (<b>heteromorphic).</b>|$|E

50|$|Macrocystis integrifolia {{alternates}} <b>heteromorphic</b> phases from a macroscopic sporophyte to dioecious microscopic gametophytes. It {{has been}} studied as a plant fertilizer, increasing bean yields up to 24% and chemical studies indicate presence of phytohormone-like substances.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{morphological}} {{distinction between}} the Acrioceratidae and Ancycloceratidae is that the Acrioceratidae generally lack the tubercles and spines characteristic of the ancyloceratids. They differ from the ancestral Crioceratidae in that, like the Ancyloceratidae, they are truly <b>heteromorphic</b> (crioceratids aren't) with distinct growth phases.|$|E
5000|$|Ancyloceratidae is {{a family}} of <b>heteromorphic</b> ammonites that lived during the Early Cretaceous. Their shells begin as a loose spiral with whorls not {{touching}} which then turns into a straight shaft that ends in a J-shape hook or bend at end. Coarse ribbing and spines are common.|$|E
50|$|Some organisms {{currently}} {{classified in the}} clade Rhizaria {{and thus}} not plants in the sense used here, exhibit alternation of generations. Foraminifera undergo a <b>heteromorphic</b> alternation of generations between haploid gamont and diploid agamont forms. The single-celled haploid organism is typically {{much larger than the}} diploid organism.|$|E
5000|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{alternation}} of generations in a species which is <b>heteromorphic,</b> sporophytic, oogametic, dioicous, heterosporic and dioecious. A seed plant example might be a willow tree (most species of the genus Salix are dioecious). Starting in {{the centre of the}} diagram, the processes involved are: ...|$|E
50|$|Muramotoceras was {{an unusual}} genus of <b>heteromorphic</b> ammonite. It was known only from Japan until {{researchers}} reported in 2001 that the genus was present in Alaska's Matanuska Formation as well. Its remains likely date to the middle Turonian (from 89.8 to 93.9 million years ago) in both areas.|$|E
50|$|The non-fertilising morph(s) have no function, and {{are simply}} {{developmental}} errors. This {{is thought to}} be unlikely in many sperm <b>heteromorphic</b> species because the production of infertile sperm may be highly regulated, and infertile sperm can make up >90% of the total sperm in some Lepidoptera and Drosophila.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: This diagram {{illustrates}} the different gene combinations that can {{appear on the}} Y chromosome of Silene latifolia. Each combination of genes leads to a distinct sexual expression. Adapted from [...] "Silene latifolia : The Classical Model to Study <b>Heteromorphic</b> Sex Chromosomes" [...] by E. Kejnovsky and B. Vyskot.|$|E
50|$|Although {{distinct}} {{in character}} and not truly <b>heteromorphic</b> the Crioceratidae {{were included in}} the American TreatisePart L, 1957, in the Ancyloceratidae as the subfamily Crioceratinae. It is now considered a distinct family as originally proposed by Wright 1952 with the Acrioceratidae, proposed by Vermeulen (2004), a transition between the two.|$|E
5000|$|Leaves alternate, spiral to distichous, penninerved, brochidodromous, simple or imparipinate, {{herbaceous}} or coriaceous, sometimes very large, {{with simple}} dentate edges, sometimes <b>heteromorphic,</b> often {{the base of}} the stalk is woody and {{the base of the}} foliole is pulvinulate, lacking stipules, vernation conduplicate, often dotted with red glands. Stomata anomocytic or paracytic, usually hypostomatic.|$|E
50|$|Like E. latifolia, E. bulbosa has a basic {{chromosome}} number of x=6 (2n=12); {{it also has}} a similar bimodal karyotype, which is distinctive to this plant tribe (Tigridieae); all other genera of the tribe have x=7. Usually, E. bulbosa has a <b>heteromorphic</b> long chromosome pair, the result of a pericentric inversion in one of the long chromosomes, which makes it sexually sterile.|$|E
50|$|Only {{when the}} {{recording}} and viewing situations {{have the same}} r value, i.e., only when ac/zc = ao/zo will the depth/width ratios of the actual structure and its view be identical. This particular condition has been termed homeomorphic by Moritz von Rohr and was contrasted by him with the <b>heteromorphic</b> {{one in which the}} r values of the stereoscopic and actual views differ.|$|E
50|$|The zoospores are 1.2-1.8 {{micrometers}} {{in diameter}} and possess two flagellae - an anterior (transverse) one and a shorter posterior one. They also possess alveoli, a refractile body, a mitochondrion with tubular cristae, micronemes, rhoptries and a pseudoconoid. They also have a <b>heteromorphic</b> pair of central microtubules in the anterior axoneme. The micronemes have bulbous posterior ends and {{are associated with the}} pseudoconoid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{question}} of whether <b>heteromorphic</b> sex chromosomes are indeed present is most conveniently answered if such chromosomes were clearly visible in a karyotype. Cannabis {{was one of the}} first plant species to be karyotyped; however, this was in a period when karyotype preparation was primitive by modern standards (see History of Cytogenetics). <b>Heteromorphic</b> sex chromosomes were reported to occur in staminate individuals of dioecious [...] "Kentucky" [...] hemp, but were not found in pistillate individuals of the same variety. Dioecious [...] "Kentucky" [...] hemp was assumed to use an XY mechanism. Heterosomes were not observed in analyzed individuals of monoecious [...] "Kentucky" [...] hemp, nor in an unidentified German cultivar. These varieties were assumed to have sex chromosome composition XX. According to other researchers, no modern karyotype of Cannabis had been published as of 1996. Proponents of the XY system state that Y chromosome is slightly larger than the X, but difficult to differentiate cytologically.|$|E
50|$|Scaphites {{generally}} have a chambered, boat-shaped shell. The initial part (juvenile stage) {{of the shell}} is generally more or less involute (tightly-coiled) and compressed, giving no hint of the <b>heteromorphic</b> shell form yet to come. The terminal part (adult stage) is much shorter, erect, and bends over the older shell like a hook. They have transverse, branching ribs with tubercles (small bumps) along the venter.|$|E
50|$|In heterosporous plants (water ferns, some lycophytes, {{as well as}} all {{gymnosperms}} and angiosperms), {{there are}} two distinct sporangia, each of which produces a single kind of spore and single kind of gametophyte. However, not all <b>heteromorphic</b> gametophytes come from heterosporous plants. That is, some plants have distinct egg-producing and sperm-producing gametophytes, but these gametophytes develop from the same kind of spore inside the same sporangium; Sphaerocarpos is an example of such a plant.|$|E
50|$|Turrilitoidea is {{a diverse}} {{superfamily}} of Cretaceous ammonites generally considered as <b>heteromorphic</b> and commonly {{included in the}} suborder Ancyloceratina. Shells of this diverse group do not coil planospirally, as typical for most ammonites, but rather take {{on a variety of}} unique forms. Separation of Turrilitoidea along with Ptychoceratoidea and Scaphatoidea into a different suborder, Turrilitina, was proposed by Beznosov and Mikhailova in 1983 however this view is not accepted by most authors.|$|E
50|$|Species of Bangia {{undergo a}} <b>heteromorphic</b> {{alternation}} of generation life cycle {{in which the}} haploid generation is dominant. Reproduction can be either sexual or asexual; sexual plants occur mainly during the cold season of the year, while at other times the thalli often bear monosporangia only. Bangia, like all Rhodophytes, lack motile sperm and so depend upon water currents to transport their gametes to the trichogyne (receptive area of the female gamete or carpogonium).|$|E
50|$|Drosophila (fruit-flies): the D. obscura {{group of}} species in the genus Drosophila is sperm <b>heteromorphic.</b> As with the Lepidoptera, there is a long, fertile type and a short, {{infertile}} type. However, the infertile type has a nucleus with a normal, haploid chromosome complement. It is not known why the shorter sperm are infertile, though {{it has been suggested}} that the slightly wider head of the infertile type might prevent it from entering the micropyle of the egg.|$|E
50|$|Aprasia parapulchella {{cells have}} 42 {{chromosomes}} in the diploid state. Males {{of the species}} have a <b>heteromorphic</b> pair of chromosomes (a pair of two different ones), termed XY, and the females have a pair of same XX chromosomes. The microsatellite (AGAT)8 is strongly repeated near the Y chromosome centromere. The Y chromosome also contains the (AC)15 motif, whereas the X chromosome does not. (AC)15 also shows up on another two pairs of small and large chromosomes.|$|E
5000|$|This species spends its “life in the rocks”. Spawning occurs {{from late}} April to May {{and it seems}} to occur only once during this time; however, no nests have been found to date. Ova counts from ripe females range up to 48 mature eggs, but average 16 eggs per female. Age of sexual {{maturity}} is yet to be determined and {{little is known about the}} Caddo madtom's reproduction. It is the only madtom with <b>heteromorphic</b> sex chromosomes.|$|E
