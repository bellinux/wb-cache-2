40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{contributions to}} fuel-efficient control of vehicle speed and constrained control with applications to aircraft.  In {{the first part}} of this dissertation a stochastic approach to fuel-efficient vehicle speed control is developed. This approach encompasses stochastic modeling of road grade and traffic speed and uses the application of stochastic dynamic programming to generate vehicle speed control policies that are optimized for the trade-off between fuel consumption and travel time. It is shown that the policies lead to the emergence of time-varying vehicle speed patterns, often referred to as pulse and glide (PnG). Through simulations and experiments it is confirmed that these time-varying vehicle speed profiles are more <b>fuel-efficient</b> than <b>driving</b> at a comparable constant speed. A practical implementation strategy of these patterns is then developed and demonstrated. Also, several additional contributions are made to approaches for stochastic modeling of road grade and vehicle speed that include the use of Kullback-Liebler divergence and divergence rate and a stochastic jump-like model for the behavior of the road grade. In the second part of the dissertation, contributions to constrained control with applications to aircraft are described. Recoverable sets and integral safe sets of initial states of constrained closed-loop systems are introduced first and computational procedures of such sets based on linear discrete-time models are given. An approach to constrained flight planning based on chaining recoverable sets or integral safe sets is described and illustrated with a simulation example. Finally, two control schemes that exploit integral safe sets are proposed. The first scheme, referred to as the controller state governor (CSG), resets the controller state (typically an integrator) to enforce the constraints and enlarge the set of plant states that can be recovered without constraint violation. The second scheme, referred to as the controller state and reference governor (CSRG), combines the controller state governor with the reference governor control architecture and provides the capability of simultaneously modifying the reference command and the controller state to enforce the constraints. Theoretical results that characterize the response properties of both schemes are presented. Examples are reported that illustrate the operation of these schemes...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} the possible safety benefits from driving {{in a manner}} that results in lower fuel consumption and emissions. It attempts to assess the potential of promoting additional motivations to drive safely – better fuel economy and other environmental outcomes, and reduced running costs. Reducing speeding, lower speed limits and modifying driving style were found to improve fuel economy and other environmental outcomes in addition to improving safety. Community attitude surveys suggest that there will be greater support for measures that aim to improve fuel economy than for those measures that attempt to reduce vehicle travel. In addition, reducing fuel consumption rate without requiring a change in vehicle choice may be more acceptable and more easily implemented in the short-term. Programs such as these that result in reduced fuel consumption in addition to safety {{are more likely to be}} implemented because the benefits (in terms of fuel cost savings) flow directly to the vehicle owner. The case study found that the fuel consumption rate of crash-involved vehicles was higher than that of vehicles not involved in crashes and demonstrated the feasibility of this method. Comparisons before and after training in driving to reduce fuel consumption and analytical studies based on fleet data are recommended as measures of the safety effects of <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving.</b> Studies of the effects of instructions in driving style have the potential to provide useful information about the best ways in which to bring about <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving.</b> Key Words...|$|E

However, the benefits of such in-vehicle systems should be achieved without impairing driver safety.

Hill driving scenarios with variable traffic density were used to test drivers’ prioritization of safe and <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving.</b> A visual, second-order display and a haptic force feedback gas pedal created the smallest errors in gas pedal usage and so maximized fuel efficiency. The visual display increased time spent looking away from the road, implying reduced driver safety. Participants were worse at eco-driving in more demanding, high traffic conditions. Drivers appeared to prioritize safety over eco-driving, however safety margins were shorter in the high density traffic condition, despite the degradation in eco-driving performance. The findings suggest which modality could be most appropriate for presenting in-vehicle eco-driving guidance, and hint that these systems should advise drivers based on the prevailing traffic conditions...|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{driving is}} {{inherently}} a safety-critical task, awareness of <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> techniques has gained popularity {{in both the}} public and commercial domains. Green driving, whether motivated by financial or environmental savings, has the potential to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by a significant amount. This paper focusses on the interaction between the driver and their vehicle – what type of eco-driving information is easy to use and learn whilst not compromising safety. A simulator study evaluated both visual and haptic eco-driving feedback systems in the context of hill driving. The ability of drivers to accurately follow the advice, as well as their propensity to prioritise it over safe driving was investigated. We found that any type of eco-driving advice improved performance and whilst continuous real-time visual feedback proved to be the most effective, this modality obviously reduces attention to the forward view and increases subjective workload. On the other hand, the haptic force system had little effect on reported workload, but was less effective that the visual system.

40|$|Freight {{transport}} is a fast increasing transportation mode due to {{the economic}} growth in the world. Heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) have considerably greater fuel consumption, thus making them a suitable target when new policies in road transport emphasize increased energy efficiency and mitigated emission impacts. Intelligent transportation systems, based on emerging V 2 X communication technology, open new possibilities for developing <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> support functions considering real traffic information. This indicates a large potential of fuel saving and emission reduction for freight transport. This paper studies a dynamic programming-based optimal speed planning considering a maximum acceleration model for HDVs. The optimal speed control is applied for the deceleration case of HDV platoons due to received information on traffic speed reduction ahead. The control can optimize fuel consumption as well as travel time, and theoretical results for the two cases are presented. For maximal fuel saving, a microscopic traffic simulation study is performed for single HDVs and HDV platoons running in real traffic conditions. The results show a decrease in fuel consumption of more than 80 % compared to simulations without applying optimal control, while the fuel consumption of other vehicles in the simulation is not significantly affected.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategies for heavy-duty vehicles driving on highways with varying topography. A method for reducing the fuel consumption of single trucks and platoons consisting of several trucks is described and evaluated both in simulation and in real trucks. The method, referred to as speed profile optimization (SPO), uses a genetic algorithm to find fuel-efficient speed profiles. Using SPO, the fuel consumption of a single truck was reduced by 11. 5 % (on average) relative to standard cruise control. The method’s extension to platooning (P-SPO), reduced the fuel consumption by 15. 8 % to 17. 4 % for homogeneous and heterogeneous platoons (with different mass configurations), respectively, relative to the combination of cruise control and adaptive cruise control, when applied to road profiles of 10 km length. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the results obtained in the simulations are sufficiently accurate {{to be transferred to}} real trucks. The SPO and P-SPO methods also outperform the commonly used MPC- based methods by a few percentage points: For single trucks, SPO outper- formed an MPC-based approach by 3 percentage points, in a case with iden- tical roads and similar experimental settings.

30|$|Similarly to the {{literature}} about green logistics, the technical and more transport-related practices are quite well covered on the home pages, by both LSPs and shippers. More specifically, the general environmental practices mode choice and intermodal transports, vehicle technologies, fuels, efficient buildings as well as behavioural aspects are identified from the home pages, indicating that these practices are important to show to stakeholders visiting the pages. They can therefore be viewed as potential parts of offerings from LSPs or requirements from shippers, placing them in category number 1 in Fig.  2. In addition, one shipper in the home page scan clearly stated that LSPs were required to both comply with engine class requirements and with requirements for driver training for <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving,</b> {{which suggests that the}} practices fuels and behavioural aspects also fall into category 2. As the home pages are directed towards a diversity of stakeholders, {{it is interesting to note}} that also contractually related arguments are used. In particular, it is interesting that the shippers state their supplier requirements on their home pages, whereas suppliers according to Kirchoff et al. [24] as well as Post et al. [45] are not primary stakeholders. This can be explained whether the shippers’ customers actually are supposed to care for how their provider of goods manages its supply chain, including the transport and logistics providers.|$|E
40|$|A smart {{driving system}} (providing both safety and <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> advice {{in real time}} in the vehicle) was {{evaluated}} in real-world on-road driving trials {{to see if any}} measurable beneficial changes in driving performance would be observed. Forty participants drove an instrumented vehicle over a 50 -min mixed-route driving scenario. Two conditions were adopted: one is a control with no smart driving feedback offered and the other is with advice being presented to the driver via a smartphone in the vehicle. Key findings from the study showed a 4. 1 % improvement in fuel efficiency when using the smart driving aid, importantly with no increase in journey time or reduction in average speed. Primarily, these efficiency savings were enabled by limiting the use of lower gears (facilitated by planning ahead to avoid unnecessary stops) and an increase {{in the use of the}} fifth gear (as advised by the in-vehicle system). Significant and important changes in driving safety behaviors were also observed, with an increase in mean headway to 2. 3 s and an almost threefold reduction in time spent traveling closer than 1. 5 s to the vehicle in front. This paper has shown that an in-vehicle smart driving system specifically developed and designed with the drivers' information requirements in mind can lead to significant improvements in driving behaviors in the real world on real roads with real users...|$|E

Department of Energy's (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Program (VTP), Clean Cities is a government-industry partnership that reduces petroleum {{consumption in the}} transportation sector. Clean Cities contributes to the energy, environmental, and economic security of the United States by supporting local decisions to reduce our dependence on imported petroleum. Established in 1993 {{in response to the}} Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, the partnership provides tools and resources for voluntary, community-centered programs to reduce consumption of petroleum-based fuels. In nearly 100 coalitions, government agencies and private companies voluntarily come together under the umbrella of Clean Cities. The partnership helps all parties identify mutual interests and meet the objectives of reducing the use of petroleum, developing regional economic opportunities, and improving air quality. Clean Cities deploys technologies and practices developed by VTP. These include idle-reduction equipment, electric-drive vehicles, fuel economy measures, and renewable and alternative fuels, such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (propane), electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, and biogas. Idle-reduction equipment is targeted primarily to buses and heavy-duty trucks, which use more than 2 billion gallons of fuel every year in the United States while idling.

The application was tested for 10 days on a specified test course for evaluation. The results of the study showed that while the application has a good ability to assess users’ eco-driving per-formance and that eco-driving performance improved significantly in several areas, {{there was no evidence that}} using the application will lead to a change in long-term fuel consumption. This was caused by the fact that while the test subject improved in most areas, a decreased performance was seen in parameters that are highly affective on fuel consumption.

40|$|Eco driving {{assistant}} {{systems can}} substantially help drivers to adapt a more <b>fuel-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> style, {{which would have}} a positive impact on the emissions caused by motorised traffic. Such systems try to influence drivers in everyday situations that are mostly determined by habits, time and money. The assessment of motivating and discouraging factors, which encourage regular usage, is therefore of crucial interest. This paper presents results of a survey that has been conducted simultaneously in eleven European countries in 2010 with over 5000 participants. The survey aimed to collect needs and requirements for future eco driving systems. It mainly assessed the acceptance of so-called cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS) applications which aim to influence the drivers route choice, their vehicle miles travelled, improve their behaviour towards a more economic driving style and to optimise the total traffic network to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The objective of this paper is to: 1. Investigate motivating and discouraging factors as well as the perceived usefulness of Green ITS by drivers in Europe 2. Describe regional differences within Europe to analyse their market potential. To assess user needs and requirements for future eco driving assistant systems, a standardised questionnaire study was selected as the most suitable method. This method can help to generate answers to identify desired functionalities and analyse motivating factors and barriers for vehicle drivers - information that help to design products according to the actual user needs. Furthermore, the approach allows analysing regional differences within Europe. The questionnaire was structured in three parts: The first and the second part included questions about the participants profile like their personal data (e. g. age, gender, sex.), their habits (e. g. annual mileage, driving purposes.) and information about their car(s). The third part, which represented the main part of the survey, addressed the acceptance of different eco driving assistant systems. Respondents were confronted with seven virtual eco driving applications that all aim to challenge inefficiencies either pre-trip, on-trip or post-trip. Additionally, illustrations of different driving situations were shown. Afterwards, the respondents had to valuate the usefulness of the eco driving systems with respect to the driving situations. The results of the survey show that all of the assessed applications were considered useful enhancements by the respondents. However, differences in the rating of the applications are negligible, especially between on-trip and post-trip applications. All application types show comprehensible direct benefits for the drivers, who mostly also stated that they would be willing to use eco driving assistant systems, especially if benefits would be less subtle, e. g. by showing monetised values. The latter finding becomes more evident as the results also show that even though users' acceptance of eco driving systems is very high, willingness to pay is not...|$|E
