5|$|In her 15th {{professional}} bout, Kentikian {{fought for}} her first world championship in Cologne, Germany, on February 16, 2007; it was also her first time headlining a fight card. She won by a ninth round technical knockout against Carolina Alvarez of Venezuela, thereby winning the vacant WBA Flyweight title. Alvarez took unanswered punches {{in most of the}} rounds and was bleeding heavily from <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> the referee eventually stopped the fight in round nine in concern for Alvarez's health. Six weeks later, on March 30, 2007, Kentikian made her first title defense. Before a crowd of 19,500 in the Kölnarena, she fought on the undercard of the popular exhibition bout between German comedian Stefan Raab and WIBF World Champion Regina Halmich. Kentikian beat María José Núñez from Uruguay with a third round technical knockout. Núñez was knocked down in round two and Kentikian finished the fight one round later with a right cross followed up by combinations that left Núñez defenseless on the ropes, causing the referee to step in.|$|E
25|$|She {{then made}} her way to the United States and competed for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) once again. Debuting as an {{associate}} of Luna Vachon, Nakano competed against the WWF Women's Champion, Alundra Blayze in August 1994 at SummerSlam, but failed to win the title. Nakano eventually defeated Blayze for the title on November 20, 1994 in Tokyo at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event. Nakano held the title for approximately five months, until losing it back to Blayze on the April 3, 1995 episode of Raw. The WWF had planned on bringing in Bertha Faye to feud with Nakano while Blayze got plastic surgery on <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> breasts, but Nakano was found in possession of cocaine and quickly fired from the company.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{technicians}} preparing the capsule before final liftoff stated that [...] "after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> wished her bon voyage, {{knowing that she}} would not survive the flight." ...|$|E

500|$|Barbara {{is shown}} {{wearing a red}} dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, {{indicating}} her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, the bridge of <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been [...] "comely and of erect bearing". However, {{by the time of}} this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the [...] imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.|$|E
500|$|House {{is often}} filmed using the [...] "walk and talk" [...] filming technique, popularized on {{television}} by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing. The technique {{involves the use}} of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's [...] "cool, Fantastic Voyage–like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping." [...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> inside her brain and leg". Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.|$|E
2500|$|Ratcliff {{has been}} {{critical}} of her character. In a 1987 interview she commented, [...] "Sue really annoys me sometimes because she's got no guts. I'd love to liven her up a bit, dress her in some of Angie's clothes, {{get her out of}} that cafe, set her up in a business of her own and allow her to make something of her life." [...] Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: [...] "I was under the impression she'd become more assertive. I had visions of a bunch of feminists walking into the cafe one day {{right in the middle of}} a typical Sue and Ali fight, and them asking her why she puts up with him. No doubt Sue would screw up <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> ask: 'What do you mean?' But she'd think about it, want to hear more and gradually begin to change her ways to become stronger, more independent! I get cheesed off with Sue. She isn't me at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|University of Florida {{professor}} and human identification laboratory director Michael Warren was {{brought on by}} the prosecution to present a computer animation of the way duct tape could have been used in the death of the child, which the defense objected to hearing. Judge Perry, after a short recess to review, ruled that the video could be shown to the jury. The animation featured a picture of Caylee Anthony taken alongside Casey Anthony, superimposed with an image of Caylee's decomposed skull, and another with a strip of duct tape that was recovered with her remains. The images were slowly brought together showing that the duct tape could have covered <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> mouth. Baez stated, [...] "This disgusting superimposition {{is nothing more than a}} fantasy ...They're throwing things against the wall and seeing if it sticks." [...] Jurors were seen taking notes of the imagery, and Warren testified that it was his opinion that the duct tape found with Caylee's skull was placed there before her body began decomposing.|$|E
2500|$|The Girl {{with the}} Dragon Tattoo began {{shooting}} in Sweden in September 2010. Mara {{did not consider}} the film to be a remake, but another interpretation of the novel. [...] "I plan on giving my interpretation of the character," [...] she stated to Variety. Mara's long brown hair was cut short and dyed black, in a style reminiscent of 1970s punk and 1980s goth fashions. She also had each of her ears pierced four times, and had her brow and right nipple pierced for the role. <b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> lip piercings were fake. She kept the nipple piercing {{so that it would}} not need to be re-pierced for a sequel. Mara's eyebrows were bleached, and she wore a temporary dragon tattoo. She began preparing for the role by starting to skateboard and kickbox, and underwent dialect and computer training. She also visited Stockholm, the setting of the novel. The film was released on December 20, 2011. Mara received universal critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance. On January 24, 2012, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.|$|E
2500|$|Lowell {{married the}} novelist and short-story writer Jean Stafford in 1940. Before their marriage, in 1938, Lowell and Stafford {{got into a}} serious car accident, in which Lowell was at the wheel, that left Stafford {{permanently}} scarred, while Lowell walked away unscathed. The accident crushed <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> one of her cheekbones and required her to undergo multiple reconstructive surgeries. The couple had a tumultuous marriage that ended in 1948. The poet Anthony Hecht characterized the marriage as [...] "a tormented and tormenting one." [...] Then, shortly thereafter, in 1949 Lowell married the writer Elizabeth Hardwick {{with whom he had}} a daughter, Harriet, in 1957. After Hardwick's death in 2007, The New York Times would characterize the marriage as [...] "restless and emotionally harrowing," [...] reflecting the very public portrait of their marriage and divorce as Lowell captured it in his books For Lizzie and Harriet and The Dolphin. After 23 years of marriage to Elizabeth Hardwick, in 1970, Lowell left her for Caroline Blackwood. Blackwood and Lowell were married in 1972 in England where they decided to settle and where they raised their son, Sheridan. Lowell also became the stepfather to Blackwood's young daughter, Ivana, for whom he would write the sonnet [...] "Ivana," [...] published in his book The Dolphin.|$|E

6000|$|Kate here {{put up a}} long-handled eyeglass to {{her fine}} gray eyes, fitted it ostentatiously over <b>her</b> aquiline <b>nose,</b> <b>and</b> then said, in a voice of {{simulated}} horror, [...] "Aunt Huldy,--this revelation is shocking!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Police {{physician}} Thomas Bond, {{disagreed with}} Brown's {{assessment of the}} killer's skill level. Bond's report to police stated: [...] "In each case the mutilation was inflicted by {{a person who had}} no scientific nor anatomical knowledge. In my opinion he does not even possess the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer or any person accustomed to cut up dead animals." [...] Local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, who was the first doctor at the scene, and City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy, also thought that the killer lacked anatomical skill and did not seek particular organs. In addition to the abdominal wounds, the murderer had cut Eddowes' face: across the bridge of the nose, on both cheeks, and through the eyelids of both eyes. The tip of <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>and</b> part of one ear had been cut off. The Royal London Hospital on Whitechapel Road preserves some crime scene drawings and plans of the Mitre Square murder by the City Surveyor Frederick Foster; they were first brought to public attention in 1966 by Francis Camps, Professor of Forensic Medicine at London University. Based on his analysis of the surviving documents, Camps concluded that [...] "the cuts shown on the body could not have been done by an expert." ...|$|E
