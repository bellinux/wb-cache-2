In tribute to their achievement, he wrote: [...] "I do not know <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> except that they had to — three men of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration with 50feet of rope between them — and a carpenter's adze".|$|E
500|$|The Age of Plastic {{lasts for}} a total length of 36 minutes and 24 seconds. Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records {{released}} in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn [...] "figured that if I couldn't get records to sound like Elton John, which I couldn't because I couldn't figure out <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it." [...] He had also wanted to [...] "perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow {{me to do that}} was available. So I had to pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds." [...] Audio noted the album's sound to be reminiscent of duo Godley & Creme's debut album Consequences.|$|E

Individuals are sometimes {{given an opportunity}} to announce their clean time to the group. In some meetings, and for certain anniversaries, key tags, and medallions which denote various amounts of clean time are distributed to those who have achieved those milestones. In some areas, the addict who is celebrating a [...] "clean anniversary" [...] will be able to have support group members read the readings for the meeting and he or she will have a speaker carry the NA message. Then the addict celebrating will have his or her sponsor or a friend or family member, give them a medallion at which time the friend will share some of the celebrating addict's achievements during the last year, or from during the entire course of his or her recovery. Then the addict celebrating can share his or her experience, strength, and hope with the group on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

6000|$|I {{was anxious}} {{to know how they}} bored these long barrels, which seemed {{perfectly}} true and are said to shoot admirably; and, on asking the Gusti, received the enigmatical answer: [...] "We use a basket full of stones." [...] Being utterly unable to imagine what he could mean, I asked if I could see <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and one of the dozen little boys around us was sent to fetch the basket. He soon returned with this most extraordinary boring-machine, the mode of using which the Gusti then explained to me. It was simply a strong bamboo basket, through the bottom of which was stuck upright a pole about three feet long, kept in its place by a few sticks tied across the top with rattans.|$|E
