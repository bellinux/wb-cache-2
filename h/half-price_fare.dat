50|$|The popular revolt {{which started}} the Free Fare Movement {{happened}} in Salvador, {{capital of the}} state of Bahia. In 2003, thousands of Brazilian young people, students, and workers closed the public roads, protesting against a raise in transport fares. Over the course of 10 days, the city was effectively paralyzed. The event was so significant that it became a documentary, called “A Revolta do Buzu”. The demonstrations came to an end when traditional student groups (such as the UNE and the UJS) set themselves up as leaders of the revolt they had not started, and went to negotiate with the government behind closed doors. These groups presented 10 demands, of which 9 were met, including half-price fares for postgraduate students and the right to <b>half-price</b> <b>fare</b> for all students during the weekends. The main complaint of the street demonstrations was not met: the demonstrations increased in force.
