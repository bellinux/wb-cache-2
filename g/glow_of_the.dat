5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E

25|$|The phase {{function}} of the giant planet is also a {{function of}} its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planet properties, such as the size distribution of atmospheric particles. When a planet is found transiting and its size is known, the phase variations curve helps calculate or constrain the planet's albedo. It is more difficult with very hot planets as the <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet can interfere when trying to calculate albedo. In theory, albedo {{can also be found}} in non-transiting planets when observing the light variations with multiple wavelengths. This allows scientists to find the size of the planet even if the planet is not transiting the star.|$|E

500|$|Counterillumination {{has rarely}} been used for {{military}} purposes. [...] "Diffused lighting camouflage" [...] was trialled by Canada's National Research Council during the Second World War. It involved projecting light on {{to the sides of}} ships to match the faint <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night sky, requiring awkward external platforms to support the lamps. The Canadian concept was refined in the American Yehudi lights project, and trialled in aircraft including B-24 Liberators and naval Avengers. The planes were fitted with forward-pointing lamps automatically adjusted to match the brightness of the night sky. This enabled them to approach much closer to a target – within 3,000yards (2,700metres) – before being seen. Counterillumination was made obsolete by radar, and neither diffused lighting camouflage nor Yehudi lights entered active service.|$|E

Shadows cast by the cathedral can be seen across the choir steps and near aisle. Their angle is rendered in an unusually realistic manner for early 15th century, and the detail is such that their description is likely based on observation of the actual behaviour of light, a further innovation in 15th-century art. Yet while the light is portrayed as it might appear in nature, its source is not. Panofsky notes that the sunlight enters from the north windows, but contemporary churches normally had east-facing choirs, so the light should enter from the south. He suggests the light {{is not intended to}} be natural, but rather to represent the divine, and hence subject to [...] "the laws of symbolism and not those of nature." ...|$|E

500|$|After a {{few days}} delay caused by heavy snowfalls, the attack {{commenced}} at 02:45 on 12 February. During the approach march {{to the foot of}} the Cuklahöhe, some men disappeared up to their neck in snow due to the many snow-filled depressions and the depth of the snow. This meant that the march to the bottom of the channel took two hours instead of the thirty minutes Mikl had estimated. When they reached the bottom of the channel, they had to climb a [...] high smooth ice wall to enter the gutter, which even highly experienced climbers were unable to scale. Around 06:00, the whole company had assembled at the bottom of the channel, but dawn was beginning to break, threatening to expose the assembled force to flanking Italian positions. Schlatte then came forward, carrying the trunk of an alpenrose, a shrub that grows just above the tree-line in the Alps. He used the trunk to reach the channel ledge, and the troops were able to enter the gutter with his help. The troops could now see the <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> candles in the Italian position. The assault took the Italians completely by surprise, and three officers and 84 soldiers surrendered, for the loss of four dead, including one officer, and four wounded. The Italian response was to concentrate all available artillery fire on the position. The dugout was exposed to direct Italian fire, and was therefore unusable. The Austrians were in an exposed position in deep snow and with extremely cold winds at an altitude of , and during the first day Mikl's company lost 20 dead and 60 seriously wounded. On the night of 15 February, the Italians commenced two days of unsuccessful counterattacks, some carried out in four or five consecutive waves. For several weeks starting on 17 February, Benito Mussolini, then a member of the Italian 11th Bersaglieri Regiment, was on the front line near the Cuklahöhe, and described some of his experiences in his diary. On 5 March, prior to the withdrawal of his company from the Cuklahöhe, Mikl was wounded in the face by an Italian hand grenade. When his company was relieved on the Cuklahöhe on 12 April, it had shrunk to just 44 men. For his leadership of the assault on the Cuklahöhe, Mikl was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown 3rd Class. On 10 May, the Cuklahöhe was retaken by the Italians from three companies of Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry, who lost 250 men. The assault force, consisting of four battalions of the Italian 24th Infantry Division lost 18 officers and 516 men.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{thermoluminescence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{ceramic material}} {{appears to be}} <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> damage to <b>the</b> crystal lattice by the radiation coming from the radioactive elements contained in the material. When the ceramic materials are heated up to <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> 400 or 500 ゜C, trapping electrons are ejected from their traps and fall back to their ground states with emission <b>of</b> light. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> light is a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dose and <b>the</b> light efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample.

2500|$|It {{was this}} Hellenization which {{eventually}} led to the Seleucid-Jewish conflict of the 2nd century BCE. What begun as tensions between hellenized and observant Jews, in 166 BCE erupted into an open revolt against the Seleucid Empire. Cities that had been thoroughly hellenized, such as Yavne (Iamnia) and Yavne-Yam, suffered the brunt of the Maccabean Revolt. According to 2 Maccabees, Judas Maccabeus, first leader of the revolt, [...] "attacked the people of Jamnia by night and set fire to the harbor and the fleet, so that the <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light was seen in Jerusalem, thirty miles distant." [...] Discoveries at the site and elsewhere, however, cast doubt on this account. During a preliminary survey conducted in December 1986, a fragmentary Greek inscription was found in Yavne-Yam, documenting correspondence between Seleucid king Antiochus V Eupator and the local Sidonian community. Dated to the summer of 163 BCE, it reveals the longstanding cooperation of the town with Seleucid authorities, at a time when inland Yavne was known as a base for operations against the rebels. Furthermore, the discovery on Delos of altars erected by the citizens of Iamnia and the persistence of Greek ware in the archaeological record have led archaeologists to believe Yavne-Yam had in fact resisted Maccabean attacks and remained a free Greek city for decades after the rebellion. It was eventually sacked and incorporated into the Hasmonean state in the late 2nd century BCE, during the rule of John Hyrcanus or Alexander Jannaeus.|$|E

He also drew comparisons between Houston's influence and other big names' on 1980s pop:She was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential {{than they were in the}} years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston’s voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.|$|E
