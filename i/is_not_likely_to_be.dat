5|$|Guepinia helvelloides has {{a rather}} unusual appearance, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mistaken for other fungi. However, the red {{chanterelle}} species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G.helvelloides, however, {{it does not}} have a rubbery and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium is {{predicted}} {{to be the first}} element of an unprecedentedly long transition series, called the superactinides in analogy to the earlier actinides. While its behaviour <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very distinct from its lighter congeners in group 3, it is likely to pose a limit to the applicability of the periodic law; after element 121, the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p1/2 orbitals are expected to fill up together due to their very close energies, and around the elements in the late 150s and 160s the 9s, 9p1/2, and 8p3/2 subshells join in, so that the chemistry of the elements just beyond 121 and 122 (the last for which complete calculations have been conducted) is expected to be so similar that their position in the periodic table would be purely a formal matter. Like its lighter congeners, unbiunium could be considered to begin the 7d series of elements, which would be the fifth row of transition metals.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the battle {{is a matter of}} dispute. English Heritage considers the location to be what is now arable land within parkland at Boconnoc that was common grazing land in 1643.

25|$|Despite {{two centuries}} of mining, about 16 billion short tons of {{resources}} remain, with the largest remaining block in southwestern Pennsylvania and adjacent areas of West Virginia.

25|$|However, if {{the river}} floods beyond a safe limit for the canal, then the gates are closed (and an extra lock created) until the river drops again. Since {{this is a}} true lock it is {{possible}} for boats to leave the canal for the flooded river despite the difference in water levels (though this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wise) or (more sensibly) to allow boats caught out on the flood to gain refuge in the canal.|$|E
25|$|The airport {{purchased}} {{land from}} the Tasmanian Government {{in the southern part}} of the airport for future development of operational facilities. This additional area would allow for a short runway for general aviation aircraft, either parallel to the main runway along the southern end of the eastern boundary of the airport, or a cross runway towards the southern end of the main runway. The alternative second runway would provide an opportunity to improve the operational management of the lighter categories of aircraft. However, the second runway <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed any time soon, because the existing runway is under-utilised.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{frontier of}} this age was also explained in Kojiki as the legend of Shido Shogun's (四道将軍: Shoguns to four ways) expedition. Out of four shoguns, Ōbiko set northward to Koshi and his son Take Nunakawawake set to eastern states. The father moved east from northern Koshi while the son moved north on his way, and they finally met at Aizu (current western Fukushima). Although the legend itself <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a historical fact, Aizu is rather close to southern Tōhoku, where {{the north end of}} keyhole kofun culture as of the late 4th century is located.|$|E

25|$|UNICA, a Brazilian ethanol {{producers}} association, {{welcomed the}} ruling and commented {{that they hope}} the classification of Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an advanced biofuel will contribute to influence {{those who seek to}} lift the trade barriers imposed against clean energy, both in the U.S. {{and the rest of the}} world. EPA's final ruling is expected to benefit Brazilian producers, as the blending mandate requires an increasing quota of advanced biofuels, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fulfill with cellulosic ethanol, and then it would force blenders to import more Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, despite the existing 54¢ per gallon tariff on ethanol imported directly from Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Red {{pondweed}} is {{a reasonably}} distinctive plant and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confused {{with any other}} pondweed. Early in the growing season it could be confused with P. polygonifolius, but the submerged leaves of the latter have petioles and are relatively longer. P. praelongus is generally greener with noticeably white, zig-zagged stems that generally branch, never produces floating leaves, and its submerged leaves clasp the stem. Fresh specimens often, but not always, show a reddish tint, but this becomes much more obvious in dried material. Despite its name it is neither restricted to alpine regions or unique among pondweeds in having a reddish colouration.|$|E
25|$|A {{flash drive}} {{consists}} of a small printed circuit board carrying the circuit elements and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or rubberised case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting {{into the body of}} the drive, although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist. USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a portable media player with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go.|$|E

25|$|The {{taxonomy}} set out by Bouchet & Rocroi is {{an attempt}} to get one step closer to representing this part of the evolutionary history of the phylum Mollusca. Bouchet & Rocroi's classification system is a hybrid of the pre-existing, more traditional Linnaean taxonomy along with some more recent far-reaching revisions which are based on molecular work and use clades as taxa, (see cladistics). In the past, the taxonomy of gastropods was largely based on the morphological characters of the taxa, such as the shell characteristics (including the protoconch) in shelled species, and the internal anatomy, including the structure of the radula and details of the reproductive system. Recent advances are based more on the molecular characteristics of the DNA and RNA. This shift in emphasis has meant that the newer taxa and their hierarchy are subject to debate, a debate that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved soon.|$|E

500|$|Some users add a {{subwoofer}} because {{high levels}} of low bass are desired, even beyond {{what is in the}} original recording, {{as in the case of}} house music enthusiasts. Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some floor standing tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and [...] "satellite" [...] speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since sub-bass frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation 'modes'), the best position for the subwoofer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> where the [...] "satellite" [...] speakers are located.|$|E
