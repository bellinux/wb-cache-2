5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} <b>done</b> in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is <b>done</b> when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be <b>done</b> in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be <b>done</b> in this zone.|$|E
5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons.

For others, circumcision might be <b>done</b> for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is <b>done</b> for reasons of tradition, it is often <b>done</b> in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
