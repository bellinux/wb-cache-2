5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> French policy {{away from the}} Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the power politics of domination.|$|E

She dies during the ensuing battle. The U.S. troops drive out the North Korean forces and the cheering people wave South Korean and American flags. The film proper ends with MacArthur reciting the Lord's Prayer; after this scene, a newsreel of MacArthur is shown.|$|E
5000|$|... 17 {{cautions}} {{occurred during}} the race. The first was on lap 4, when Joe Nemechek and Todd Bodine crashed <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 2. On lap 14, Brendan Gaughan, Marlin, and Mayfield were involved in an accident <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 4, with Jimmy Spencer becoming the beneficiary and gain back a lap. On lap 21, Rudd spun out <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 2, allowing Shelmerdine to gain back a spot. On lap 66, Robby Gordon crashed <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 4, allowing Mario Gosselin to be the beneficiary.

On lap 184, Kyle Petty spun <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 2, permitting Nemechek to gain back a lap. On lap 292, Carl Edwards spun <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 2, with Jeff Gordon being the beneficiary. The first caution for debris was flown on lap 322, with Robby Gordon becoming the beneficiary. Bobby Labonte, Jeff Green, and Ken Schrader crashed <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 4 on lap 355, Rudd winning a lap back. Ward Burton spun <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 2 on lap 372, {{though there was no}} beneficiary. On lap 410, Jarrett spun out <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 3, with Petty gaining a lap back.

Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Petty crashed <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 2 on lap 468, with Sadler getting a lap back. However, on lap 477, Sadler would be involved in a crash <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 2 with Nemechek, allowing Scott Riggs to gain back a lap. The final caution occurred on lap 490, with Edwards and Robby Gordon crashing <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> 3, with Kvapil being the beneficiary again.|$|R

5|$|In the {{resulting}} battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> back {{attempts by the}} Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented {{the majority of the}} Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor.|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for NÃ¼rnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E

5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, {{the attack on the}} Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading his group, he found that the 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although he would have been justified <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> back, Johnson led his group in through thick smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way home, they had to fight off Me109 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight at}} P'ohang-dong {{was the final}} {{breaking}} point for North Korean units already {{on the verge of}} exhaustion from continuous combat. North Korean supply lines were overextended to the point of breaking down, causing a collapse in resupply that is seen as a primary factor <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> the tide of the battle. Moreover, U.S. air superiority was also crucial to the engagement, since repeated bombing runs by U.S. aircraft prevented North Korean ground forces from reaching and holding their objectives.|$|E
5|$|Though the Yankees {{continued}} {{to struggle with}} postseason failures, Jeter remained a consistent contributor. During the 2007 season, Jeter was third in the AL with 203 hits, his third consecutive season and sixth overall, with at least 200 hits. He also finished ninth in batting average (.322). He was selected for his eighth All-Star appearance. In the field, he was involved <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> a career-high 104 double plays. He struggled during the 2007 ALDS, batting 3-for-17 (.176) with one RBI, as the Indians defeated the Yankees.|$|E

5|$|After her {{engagement}} to Day ended, Sabrina {{spent eight years}} at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met {{and went on to}} marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E
5|$|As GÃ©nÃ©reux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of GÃ©nÃ©reux. Despite the collapsed wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn GÃ©nÃ©reux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing GÃ©nÃ©reux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> and slowing.|$|E

5|$|The ship's crew {{consisted}} of ten officers and 122 enlisted men. She carried {{a number of}} smaller boats, including two pinnaces, two cutters, and one dinghy. Arminius was not a particularly successful design; she suffered from severe, fast rolling, especially in heavier seas. She also shipped {{a great deal of}} water over the bow and was unbalanced in steering. The ship turned rapidly to starboard but was sluggish <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> to port. Indeed, the ship was required to have the rudder at 15degrees to port in order to remain on a straight course. It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power.|$|E

5|$|When Gaveston without {{permission}} returned from exile later the same year, a Baronial council entrusted Pembroke and The Earl of Surrey, {{with the task}} of taking him into custody. This they did on 19 May 1312, but not long after Thomas of Lancaster, acting with the Earls of Warwick, Hereford and Arundel, seized Gaveston and executed him on 19 June. This criminal act had the effect of garnering support for the King, and marginalising the rebellious earls. As far as Pembroke is concerned, the seizing and execution of a prisoner in his custody was a breach of the most fundamental chivalric codes, and a serious affront to his honour. The event must therefore be seen as pivotal <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> his sympathies away from the rebels and towards the King.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as fast as}} he {{had been}} on the {{previous}} tour, Constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling. However, the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics, and Constantine took one for 55; England's captain Douglas Jardine, who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia, batted for five hours to score his only Test century. The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> English attitudes against Bodyline, something Constantine considered hypocritical. In the West Indies' second innings Constantine's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn. Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test, with Essex all-rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine's substitute for the club team. When Jardine heard, he convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test, the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play. Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain. In all first-class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20.11 and took 14 wickets at 22.14.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton began lapping fastest, {{recording}} a 1:32.869 on lap38, {{more than a}} second faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen finished in ninthposition, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.|$|E
