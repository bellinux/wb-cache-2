The southern feature, double like the Yellala, shows an upper and a lower break, separated by two miles, the rapids being formed as usual by sunken ledges of rock. Two days' paddling lead to the northern or highest Sangalla, which obstructs the stream for 22 miles: Tuckey (p. 184) makes his Songo Sangalla contain three rapids; Prof. Smith, whose topography is painfully vague, doubles the number, {{at the same time he}} makes Sanga Jalala (p. 327) the [...] "uppermost fall but one and the highest."

DESIGNProspective cohort study. SETTINGTwo tertiary care hospitals. PARTICIPANTSConvenience sample of 39 patient rooms from which a patient infected or colonized with 1 of the 3 targeted pathogens had been discharged. INTERVENTIONEnvironmental sites were cultured before and after use of an automated UV-C-emitting device in targeted rooms but before standard terminal room disinfection by environmental services. RESULTSIn total, 142 samples were obtained from 27 rooms of patients who were colonized or infected with VRE, 77 samples were obtained from 10 rooms of patients with C. difficile infection, and 10 samples were obtained from 2 rooms of patients with infections due to Acinetobacter. Use of an automated UV-C-emitting device led to {{a significant decrease in}} the total number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of any type of organism (1. 07 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001), CFUs of target pathogens (1. 35 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001), VRE CFUs (1. 68 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001), and C. difficile CFUs (1. 16 log 10 reduction; P <. 0001). CFUs of Acinetobacter also decreased (1. 71 log 10 reduction), but the trend was not statistically significant (P =. 25). CFUs were reduced at all 9 of the environmental sites tested.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of human evolution usually involves {{the evaluation of}} changes in gross and molecular morphology or changes in artifact assemblages. In contrast, stable isotope analysis is an <b>indirect</b> <b>line</b> of investigation. Understanding the human evolutionary sequence requires information on nutritional, biobehavioral, and gen-eral ecology. These {{are the kinds of}} information that stable isotope analysis can provide. Such studies may not identify the mechanisms for change, but their appli-cation serves to elucidate the situations under which change occurred. Stable isotope analysis has been coopted from other sciences. Its theo-retical base is in physics and its early applications were in geochemistry. Consequently, it melds aspects of an historical science (geology) with as-pects of an experimental science (chemistry) and a more theoretical science (physics). Such cooption is common in the study of human evolu-tion because its historical nature re-quires scholars to compile observations and to develop and apply new meth-ods of investigation. The purpose here is to introduce the reader to those areas of bioarcheology and paleoanthropology that have made use of stable isotope analyses. ’- 7 Although there have been recent appli-cations to the earlier part of the re-cord, the majority of stable isotope studies have focused on the latter por-tion of human evolution and thus have been restricted to the bioarcheological and archeological literature. First, however, it is necessary to include an introduction to the processes through which isotopic inferences are made. Margaret J. Schoeninger is professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. She has published extensively on aspects of nutritional ecology, with particular attention to dietary change among prehistoric human populations in North America, Europe, and Africa.

Previous measurements of dorsoventral retinoic acid levels, however, showed only minor differences. By a combination of microdissection and bioassay techniques, we compared retinoic acid levels with retinaldehyde dehydrogenase levels along spinal cords from early embryonic to postnatal mice. Both parameters vary in parallel, indicating that the principal reason for regional retinoic acid differences in the developing spinal cord is different levels of retinoic acid-generating enzyme. Consistent with previous reports, we observed overall quite high synthesis, decreasing with age, and no dorsoventral difference throughout much of the spinal cord length. In two locations, however, ventral synthesis exceeds dorsal synthesis by several orders of magnitude. These hot spots colocalize with the origins of the limb innervations. They are highest during early stages of limb innervation and disappear slowly postnatally. The synthesis hot spots are likely to create local retinoic acid diffusion halos, which may influence the survival of neurons in the limb regions of the spinal cord and which probably promote innervation of the developing limbs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} root {{inundation}} on the leaf emissions of ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid was investigated with 2 ? 3 years old tree seedlings of four Amazonian floodplain species by applying dynamic cuvette systems under greenhouse conditions. Emissions were monitored {{over a period}} of several days of inundation using a combination of Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and conventional techniques (HPLC, ion chromatography). Under non-flooded conditions, none of the species exhibited significant emissions of any of the compounds. A slight deposition of acetaldehyde and acetic acid was mainly observed, instead. Tree species specific variations in deposition velocities were largely due to variations in stomatal conductance. Flooding of the roots resulted in leaf emissions of ethanol and acetaldehyde by all species, while emissions of acetic acid occurred only by the species exhibiting the highest ethanol and acetaldehyde emission rates. All three compounds showed a similar diurnal emission profile, each displaying an emission burst in the morning, followed by a decline in the evening. This concurrent behavior supports the conclusion, that all three compounds emitted by the leaves are derived from ethanol produced in the roots by alcoholic fermentation, transported to the leaves with the transpiration stream and finally partly converted to acetaldehyde and acetic acid by enzymatic processes. Co-emissions and peaking in the early morning confirmed that root ethanol, after transportation with the transpiration stream to the leaves and enzymatic oxidation to acetaldehyde and acetate, is the metabolic precursor for all compounds emitted. Emission rates substantially varied among tree species, with maxima differing by up to two orders of magnitude (3 ? 200 nmol m ? 2 min ? 1 for ethanol and 5 ? 500 nmol m ? 2 min ? 1 for acetaldehyde). Acetic acid emissions reached 12 nmol m ? 2 min ? 1. The observed differences in emission rates between the tree species are discussed with respect to their root adaptive strategies to tolerate long term flooding, providing an <b>indirect</b> <b>line</b> of evidence that the root ethanol production is a major factor determining the foliar emissions.

It {{was built in the}} late 19th century {{for the purposes of the}} textile industry and is still in use.|$|R

However, several <b>indirect</b> <b>lines</b> of evidence suggest that interstitial or intraepithelial lymphocytes are the effector or thyroid autoantibody-producing lymphocytes in Graves' disease. This {{has not been}} investigated in vivo. Changes of nuclear volume of endocrine cells have previously {{been shown to be}} a reliable parameter of functional stimulation of endocrine glands. Therefore we investigated this parameter near and off lymphocytic aggregates, loosely distributed plasma cells and memory T cells in paraffine sections of Graves' disease thyroid glands. In 21 Graves' disease thyroid glands we found significant increases of thyroid epithelial cell nuclear volume near plasma cells (198. 4 μm 3) as well as near lymphocytic aggregates (219. 1 μm 3) compared with thyroid epithelial cell nuclear volume one microscopic field away (160. 1 and 137. 7 μm 3 respectively). Similar nuclear volume differences were observed after propanolol and thiourelene antithyroid drug treatment. These nuclear volume differences could not be observed in 10 control thyroid glands and around CD 45 R 0 -positive memory T cells in Graves' disease thyroid glands. These direct in vivo investigations of regional functional stimulation of thyroid epithelial cells in Graves' disease show local stimulation near lymphocytic aggregates and diffusely distributed plasma cells. Therefore our in vivo data do not permit to identify stimulatory lymphocytes only interstitially or intraepithelially as previously suggested. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacology}} of the spinal, supraspinal and peripheral adenosine receptor subtypes (A 1, A 2) {{and their}} influence on the volume-evoked micturition reflex (VEMR) was studied in a chronic unanesthetised rat model by cystometrography after intrathecal (i. t.), intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) and intravenous (i. v.) injection. Intrathecally administered A 1 adenosine agonist: N 6 -(L- 2 -phenylisopropyl) adenosine (R-PIA) and A 2 adenosine agonist: 5 '-(N-ethylcarboxamido) adenosine (NECA) were equally active with 1. 0 nmol reliably producing {{an increase in the}} volume necessary to induce the VEMR. At a higher dose (3 nmol), a long-lasting blockade of the VEMR was produced by both agonists. These effects were reversed following intraperitoneal injection of caffeine, an adenosine antagonist. This inhibition of the VEMR outlasted the spinal antinociceptive action which we have previously reported for these two agonists. Contrary to the spinal effect of these agonists, i. c. v. (0. 3 - 3 nmol) and i. v. (100 - 1000 nmol) injections of R-PIA and NECA resulted in a significant decrease in the volume required to evoke the VEMR. We conclude that at the spinal level a xanthine-sensitive adenosine receptor(s) inhibits the VEMR. Based on several <b>indirect</b> <b>lines</b> of evidence, we speculate that these effects are not mediated by an action on primary afferent input or directly on preganglionic neurons, but on an excitatory interneuronal link.
