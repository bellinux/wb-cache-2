50|$|In practice, modern turbine designs {{use both}} {{reaction}} and impulse concepts {{to varying degrees}} whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or <b>impulse</b> <b>blading</b> at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs {{similar to those used}} in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in pressure. Under these conditions, blading becomes strictly a reaction type design with the base of the blade solely impulse. The reason is due to the effect of the rotation speed for each blade. As the volume increases, the blade height increases, and the base of the blade spins at a slower speed relative to the tip. This change in speed forces a designer to change from impulse at the base, to a high reaction style tip.|$|E

40|$|From {{consideration}} of available information on boundary-layer behavior, a relation among profile thickness, maximum surface velocity, Reynolds number, velocity diagram, and solidity is established for {{a cascade of}} airfoils immersed in a two-dimensional incompressible fluid flow. Several cascades are computed to show the effect of various cascade design parameters on minimum required cascade solidity. Comparisons with experimentally determined blade performance show that the derived blade loadings are equal or higher for moderate flow deceleration and somewhat lower for large deceleration. Blades with completely laminar flow appear practical for <b>impulse</b> or reaction <b>blading...</b>|$|R

40|$|Turbomachinery blade {{profiles}} {{in use today}} were all derived out of conventional methods. For example an <b>impulse</b> <b>blading</b> of a turbine is derived out of multi circular arcs of different radii for, suction surface and pressure surface with a suitable leading and trailing edge radii. The reaction bladings were designed purely out of empirism based {{on the amount of}} acceleration or Gulf factor i. e., the ratio of throat opening to pitch (Ref-l),where as compressor blade profiles were derived by imposing a suitable c r on a known base profile with a chosen thickness distribution. The performance of these profiles were assessed by conducting series of experiments which involves the measurement of surface velocity distribution and profile loss. From the experimental results each profile can be given a tag of operating range. Selection of blade profile for a given velocity distribution involves the complete scanning of experimental results, which becomes tedious and time consuming. Now a days many theoretical methods are available to evaluate the performance of the blade profile. These methods were extensively used to update the blade profiles originated during the early decades. ...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{applications}} for turbines require units {{with a large}} work output per stage. The whole of the expansion takes place across the nozzles and at inlet to the turbine blades the gas velocity is supersonic. <b>Impulse</b> <b>blading</b> is usually employed with flow turning angles ranging from 90 " to 160 ". However, advancing steam conditions suggest that the first stages of turbines presently designed with subsonic blading may have to accept increasing heat drops to reduce the steam temperature to the first moving row and to reduce gland losses. Under these conditions blading designed to accept supersonic velocities could be employed. This paper, which deals with blading designed specifically for supersonic flow, {{is divided into two}} pai-ts, the first of which outlines the theory and design of the blading. The second part describes tests run on cascades of these blades and discusses the results. In Part I a design method based on inviscid isentropic supersonic vortex flow theory is evolved in which the uniform flow ahead of the blade is transformed into a vortex flow, turned through the required angle and then converted back to uniform flow again at the exit. The blades thus obtained are cusped and a design method has been developed t...|$|E
