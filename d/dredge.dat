5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to tear up Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold <b>dredge</b> placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the <b>dredge</b> tailings along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe sand <b>dredging</b> {{activities}} may cause various physical and environmental {{changes such as}} beach erosion, evolution of beach profile, change in current and wave field. To evaluate the relationship among the volume of sand <b>dredging,</b> method of sand <b>dredging,</b> time of sand <b>dredging,</b> shoreline retreat and evolution of beach profile, some experiments were conducted and a two-dimensional numerical model was used. The effect of sand <b>dredging</b> volume on shoreline retreat was investigated by <b>dredging</b> various amounts of sand at one time under the same regular wave condition. The {{results showed that the}} relationship between shoreline retreat and <b>dredging</b> volume is nonlinear. In the other considerations, sand bar was <b>dredged</b> as different methods i. e. periodic sand <b>dredging</b> method under the same regular wave condition as well as one time <b>dredging</b> under different regular wave conditions. The final shoreline retreat in the last two methods was nearly equal to the first method, however, the progress of shoreline retreat was slower.

5|$|Sussex {{began their}} run-chase well; Barclay and Gehan Mendis scored 93 runs together, {{surviving}} a spell of attacking fast bowling from Garner and <b>Dredge</b> early on. Mendis had broken his thumb {{shortly before the}} final, and in the third over, it was fractured again, but he continued to bat. When Somerset did make a breakthrough, after 24 overs, they collected four wickets for the addition of seventeen runs. Mendis was the first man out, caught by Marks off the bowling of Graham Burgess, followed by Barclay who was caught hooking a delivery from Botham. Miandad was dismissed without scoring, and shortly thereafter, Imran was caught and bowled by Botham for three. Rose then chose to replace his bowlers, and against the less incisive bowling of Keith Jennings and Burgess, Parker and Paul Phillipson were able to establish a 97-run partnership, which brought Sussex to within five runs of their winning target, before Phillipson was by caught by the wicket-keeper, Derek Taylor off the bowling of <b>Dredge.</b> Woodcock thought that Botham in particular bowled too short against Phillipson, who he suggested would have been susceptible to a yorker. In Wisden, Eric Hill opined that Botham's short-pitched bowling, which was a feature of his play late in the season, was due to him being overused by England and Somerset through the year. Parker scored the winning runs to secure a five-wicket victory for Sussex with 41 deliveries remaining.|$|E

The port was previously only connected to the mainland by Port Boulevard, which is accessed by crossing U.S. Route 1 (Biscayne Boulevard) and traveling through downtown. The project also includes roadway improvements to the connection between I-395 and State Road 836, {{also known as the}} Dolphin Expressway, at Interstate 95. The tunnel will allow heavy trucks to bypass the congested Downtown Miami area, which is considered to be especially crucial with the large increase in trade traffic expected to be created by the Deep <b>Dredge</b> Project and the enlargement of the Panama Canal. Projected to eventually carry 26,000 vehicles a day under Government Cut through its twin two-lane tunnels, the top of the tunnels lie over 60 feet (18.3 m) below the seabed. The project created nearly 1,000 jobs as of 2011, with 70% reported as local; project executives promised that many of the construction jobs would go to local contractors. Along with the related Deep <b>Dredge</b> and Panama Canal Expansion, over 30,000 jobs are expected to be created in the long run.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve navigational safety and {{operational}} efficiency of vessels and to cater for larger ships with deeper draughts, the Port of Townsville conducts capital <b>dredging.</b> The port's capital <b>dredging</b> campaigns over the last 40 years has enabled deepening and widening of the existing inner harbor basin and approach channels, beside development of outer harbor. To determine the technical parameters of quantity, quality and types of materials to be <b>dredged,</b> the Port of Townsville undertakes hydrographic survey; offshore geophysical and geotechnical investigations that define <b>dredging</b> projects. While necessary to support the economic growth of the region, major port development works such as capital <b>dredging</b> have the potential significantly impact on the natural environment.

5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to <b>dredge</b> channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
