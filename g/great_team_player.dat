He started in central defence {{alongside}} Jérôme Boateng in the Champions League final in Munich, which Bayern lost to Chelsea on penalties. Before the final, Heynckes said, [...] "Tymoshchuk is a <b>great</b> <b>team</b> <b>player.</b> He's really important for us, and in situation, when three players are disqualified, his experience and ability to play in different positions is really useful for us." [...] Because Tymoshchuk played a bigger role under Heynckes than under Van Gaal, he became {{an important part of the}} team. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said of Tymoshchuk, [...] "For me the main job – not to let goals in. As a result, I love partners who have the same job. Anatoliy – is quite an aggressive footballer, but it's a smart aggression. He knows perfectly, when to choose the right position, to stop the attack of the opponent, and when to use such a move, like taking the ball harshly. No doubt, Tymoshchuk is doing a great job at Bayern!".|$|E

This shift to a more layered, heavier rock sound with occasional electronica influences {{can be attributed to the}} addition of long-time touring member Jerome Fontamillas as a full-time band member. Contributing more to the recording process by filling in with his added instrumental versatility prompted Foreman to note, [...] "I feel like Jerome is a <b>great</b> <b>team</b> <b>player.</b> I mean the same thing where live he just kind of fills in, is the same thing on the album.

[...] "This was also the most prepared we'd ever been for a record," [...] bassist Tim Foreman has commented. The album brings together an eclectic sound as it gathers inspiration from the previous ten years of contemporary rock. The song [...] "This Is Your Life" [...] features a more subtle pop jam while the up-beat, light-hearted [...] "Gone" [...] brings the album to an entirely different place musically, exemplifying the band's musical versatility.|$|E
