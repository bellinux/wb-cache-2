The graphics engine is being modified by Avatar Reality, and features {{not part of}} a combat game but needed for a virtual world are being added. Content can be created on many 3rd party 3D and graphics programs so long as they can output a COLLADA interchange file format 3D model or TIFF or Direct <b>Draw</b> <b>Surface</b> image formats. They are then converted to CryEngine native [...]cgf and [...]dds formats as needed via the provided development tools ...|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{minor variant}} of the Lightwave {{computer}} model as the main differences from the original revolve around the texture map being used. For example, the nozzle heads {{on the front and}} rear of the main thrusters appear dark and smooth. On others such as the heavy fighter they appear striated. In fact, they too are also smooth. To create the impression of model detailing, Thornton would use a palette of only 128 colours to <b>draw</b> <b>surface</b> details, such as panelling, onto the texture map rather than build it. Lightwave would then dither the maps, and with the rendering software they looked as good as 24 bit colour images. This is one of the techniques Foundation Imaging used to keep things like the polygon count to a minimum in order to produce the ground breaking animations with the limited amount of RAM that the Amiga Computers held.|$|E

In all settings, the designers'uses of a <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> were noted. Many similar <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> activities occurred in all design settings even though the settings did not each allow for the same sharing and interaction with the <b>drawing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Observations suggest {{that the process of}} creating drawings may be as important to the design process as the drawings themselves. These preliminary results raise issues for further study, particularly with respect to computer support for collaborative <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> use. ...|$|R

In the listing shown in the example, which uses CSS to set the canvas element’s size, the size of the element is 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels high, but the size of the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> remains {{unchanged}} at the default value of 300 pixels × 150 pixels. When a canvas element’s size does not match the size of its <b>drawing</b> <b>surface,</b> the browser scales the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> to fit the element (which may result in surprising and unwanted effects).|$|R
50|$|A canvas {{actually}} has two sizes: {{the size of}} the element itself and {{the size of the}} element’s <b>drawing</b> <b>surface.</b> Setting the element's width and height attributes sets both of these sizes; CSS attributes affect only the element’s size and not the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Powdered {{charcoal}} {{is often}} used to [...] "tone" [...] or cover large sections of a <b>drawing</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Drawing</b> over the toned areas darkens it further, but the artist can also lighten (or completely erase) within the toned area to create lighter tones.|$|R
5000|$|A simple, {{so-called}} [...] "lateral" [...] harmonograph uses two pendulums {{to control}} the movement of a pen relative to a <b>drawing</b> <b>surface.</b> One pendulum moves the pen back and forth along one axis and the other pendulum moves the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> back and forth along a perpendicular axis. By varying the frequency and phase of the pendulums relative to one another, different patterns are created. Even a simple harmonograph as described can create ellipses, spirals, [...] and other Lissajous figures.|$|R
50|$|When {{it is not}} {{feasible}} to set each pixel only once, double buffering can be used. The method involves creating an off-screen <b>drawing</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>drawing</b> to it, and then copying {{it all at once}} to the screen.

40|$|We {{have written}} several {{multi-user}} graphical editors in the RENDEZVOUS* system. In {{our approach to}} building these editors, the applications are first written as single-user editors. When multiple users wish to share a <b>drawing</b> <b>surface,</b> the <b>drawing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of their individual editors are attached using the Abstraction-Link-View (ALV) architecture. RLinksS communicate the editing operations and and {{are designed to be}} invisible to the applications they are attached to, allowing the interface for each user to be highly customized. Links can also attach editors to the interface of a running application, allowing the interface to be edited as the application is being used...|$|R
50|$|The basic {{tools are}} a drawing board or table, pencil {{sharpener}} and eraser, and for ink drawing, blotting paper. Other tools used are circle compass, ruler, and set square. Fixative {{is used to}} prevent pencil and crayon marks from smudging. Drafting tape is used to secure paper to <b>drawing</b> <b>surface,</b> and also to mask an area to keep it free of accidental marks, such as sprayed or spattered materials and washes. An easel or slanted table is used to keep the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> in a suitable position, which is generally more horizontal than the position used in painting.|$|R
50|$|While similar {{effects can}} be {{produced}} by smudging with one's fingers, this deposits oil from the skin onto the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface,</b> making the surface less receptive to the charcoal or other drawing medium.|$|R

50|$|In the {{simplest}} form of camera lucida, the artist {{looks down at}} the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> through a half-silvered mirror tilted at 45 degrees. This superimposes a direct view of the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> beneath, and a reflected view of a scene horizontally in front of the artist. This design produces an inverted image which is right-left reversed when turned the right way up. Also, light is lost in the imperfect reflection. Wollaston's design used a prism with four optical faces to produce two successive reflections (see illustration), thus producing an image that is not inverted or reversed. Angles ABC and ADC are 67.5° and BCD is 135°. Hence, the reflections occur through total internal reflection, so very little light is lost. It is not possible to see straight through the prism, so it is necessary to look at the very edge to see the paper. The instrument often includes a weak negative lens, creating a virtual image of the scene at about the same distance as the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface,</b> so that both can be viewed in good focus simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|Traditionally {{the notion}} of drawing in-situ has {{suggested}} the physical presence of the artist in the environment under scrutiny. The assumption here of enhanced connectivity, however, is hasty {{in light of the}} idea that situation implies a relative spatial value determined by the interplay of subject and location, where the possibility of not being “in-situ” is problematic. The fact that traditional drawing in-situ, such as the rendering of landscape, requires a framing of the world “out there” suggests a distance between the perceived object of representation and the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface.</b> Rather than suggesting that some drawing is situated and other sorts of drawing are not, however, I argue that situation or site is variously extended and intensified depending on the nature of mediation between surface and environment. The suggestion here is that site {{is not so much a}} precondition as a performative function, developed in the act of drawing and always implicating the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface.</b> In my discussion I focus on specific works by Toba Khedoori and Cameron Robbins. As well, in using my own recent drawing practice as a case study, I argue that the geography of site is delimited neither by horizon nor the boundaries of the paper. Rather, I propose that site and <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> coincide in variously intensive and extensive ways...|$|R

50|$|Several Wacom models, {{including}} the Intuos4 and Bamboo, were criticized for the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface's</b> roughness, which caused the small pressure-sensitive 'nib' to wear down, and become slanted or scratchy {{in the same}} way as pencil lead, albeit more slowly. This could also cause the surface to become smoother where it is used more, resulting in uneven slick and non-slick areas. As the nibs were only short lengths of plastic, it was possible for a user wanting a more durable nib to improvise a replacement from a short length of nylon 'wire' (approx 0.065 inches or 1.7mm diameter) like that found in grass trimmer or 'weed-eater' refills, suitably straightened by hand and smoothed (rounded off) at one end with abrasive paper. Additionally, a thin sheet of glass or acetate can be placed over the <b>drawing</b> <b>surface</b> to avert surface or nib damage {{in the same way}} as screen protectors are used on phones, although in the case of glass this may induce a—usually modest—parallax error when tracing.|$|R
