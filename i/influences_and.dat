40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} young children’s possibility to participation <b>and</b> <b>influence</b> in preschool settings. The specific questions were:  If and how do preschool teachers work with young children's <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participation? In what way is the preschool teachers approach closely related to young children's opportunity to <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participate? The results show that preschool teachers do work with young children’s <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participation by keeping them involved in the preschool settings and considering their interest when planning the activities. The teachers also interpret the children’s ability to express their wishes and needs through nonvocal communication such as gestures and body language. The teacher's approach was shown as closely connected to the children opportunity to <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participate in consideration to how close the teacher was to the child’s perspective and how they viewed the child. In summary this study concludes that the children’s ability to exert <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participation will increase by endeavouring to come close to the child’s perspective and balancing the routines of the preschool settings as well as taking the child’s individuality into consideration...|$|R

40|$|Purpose/questions: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{highlight}} the eight different educators' perception of the notion of children's <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participation in preschool. We also want to study how educators describe their work with the children's <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> the challenges the work entails. How do the educators in our study understand the notion of child's <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participation? Which opportunities respective barriers do the educators find in their work with child´s influence at their preschool? According to educators, how child's initiative to his/her influence in preschool is made visible? According to educators, do all the children have equal opportunities to influence their everyday life in preschool? Methodology: To carry out our study, we have used a qualitative method and have interviewed 8 educators in 5 different preschools. Theories: We have used Foucault’s theory of power, governmentality and discourse to analyze the results we get from the educators’ interviews. Conclusions: It was obvious in our interview with the preschool educators that they are in favor of children’s <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participation. We {{have come to the conclusion}} based on our educators’s statement that the children’s opportunity to <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participate in preschool is governed by educators. Governance results in that all children get equal opportunity to <b>influence</b> <b>and</b> participate and it also minimizes that younger and children with less verbal communication abilities are excluded...|$|R
