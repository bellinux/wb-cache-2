5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family <b>history</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E

25|$|The Munger Fort, {{located at}} Munger (also spelt as Monghyr during the British Raj), {{in the state}} of Bihar, India, is built on a rocky hillock on the south bank of the Ganges River.

The Munger town where the fort is situated was under the control of Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi (1325-1351 AD). The fort has two prominent hills called the Karnachaura or Karanchaura, and the other a built up rectangular mound deduced to be the location of a citadel of the fort with historical links. The Fort had a succession of Muslim rulers (Khaljis, Tughlaqs, Lodis, Nawabs of Bengal, followed by Mughal rulers, till it was finally acceded to the British by Mir Quasim (1760–72), after unseating his father-in-aw Mīr Jafar on the grounds of old age, for a monetary reward negotiated by Vansittart. This deal involved payment by the East India Company’s merchants of an ad valorem duty of 9 percent, against an Indian merchant’s duty of 40%. The fort became a place of considerable importance to the British in Bengal till 1947 (India'a independence).|$|E
