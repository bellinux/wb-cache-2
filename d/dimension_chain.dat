For larger chains, at low filler concentrations, an increase in <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> relative to the unfilled <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> is observed.

40|$|A direct {{probe of}} the single chain {{conformation}} in associating low polarity model telechelic ionomer solutions has been obtained using small-angle neutron scattering. A contrast matching technique was employed utilizing a solution of hydrogenated and deuterated ionomer chains {{in a mixture of}} labeled and unlabeled solvent molecules. The scattering data at all concentrations and ionic levels examined show an excellent fit to the wormlike chain model. Single chain scattering patterns were obtained for two sodium-neutralized carboxy−telechelic polystyrene ionomers that differ by a factor of 2 in their molecular weight, in a concentration range from the dilute to the concentrated solution regime. The single <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> were found to be influenced by both the ionic interactions and the extent of association. Both ionomer systems showed a contraction of the <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the dilute solution regime which is more pronounced for the lower molecular weight telechelic ionomer. As concentration increases, the single <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> increase until they reach a plateau value in the concentrated solution regime. This plateau value is very close to the <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the ionomer in the bulk, as was found from a previous SANS study on similar ionomer systems. This plateau value <b>chain</b> <b>dimension</b> is also the same as the unperturbed dimension of the nonionic parent polymer in the bulk. The effect of concentration on the ionomer <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> is attributed to the influence of ionic interactions as the nonionic form of the material shows larger <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the concentration regime studied. These results indicate that intramolecular interactions with the formation of self loops prevail in the dilute solution regime. Intermolecular interactions with ionic groups connecting to different chains prevail in the concentrated solution regime, as evidenced by an extension of the <b>chain</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

Classic {{magnetic}} alloys {{based on}} iron and other ferromangetic materials feature metallic bonding, with all atoms essentially bonded to all nearest neighbors in the crystal lattice. Thus, critical temperatures at which point these classical magnets cross over to the ordered magnetic state tend to be high, since interactions between spin centers is strong. Molecule-based magnets, however, have spin bearing units on molecular entities, often with highly directional bonding. In some cases, chemical bonding is restricted to one <b>dimension</b> (<b>chains).</b> Thus, interactions between spin centers are also limited to one-dimension, and ordering temperatures are much lower than metal/alloy-type magnets.
