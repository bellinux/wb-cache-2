40|$|In this work, {{we first}} discuss the image halftoning problem. Halftoning is the {{rendition}} of continuous-tone pictures on displays that {{are capable of}} producing only two levels. There are several well-known algorithms for <b>half</b> <b>toning.</b> The dot diffusion method for digital <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> has the advantage of pixel-level parallelism unlike the error diffusion method, which is a popular <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> method. The image quality offered by error diffusion is still regarded as superior to most of the other known methods. We show how the image quality obtained using the dot diffusion method can be improved by optimization of the so-called class matrix. By taking the human visual characteristics into account we show that such optimization consistently results in images comparable to error diffusion, without sacrificing the pixel-level parallelism. The dot diffusion algorithm will be discussed and by modifying the algorithm, embedded multiresolution property will be added. Later, we introduce LUT (Look Up Table) based <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> and tree-structured LUT (TLUT) halftoning. We demonstrate how error diffusion characteristics can be achieved with this method. Afterwards, our algorithm will be trained on halftones obtained by Direct Binary Search (DBS) which is an algorithm with high computational complexity. The complexity of TLUT halftoning is higher than that of error diffusion but much lower than that of the DBS algorithm. Thus, halftone image quality between that of error diffusion and DBS will be achieved {{depending on the size of}} tree structure in TLUT algorithm. We also discuss the inverse halftoning problem. Inverse halftoning is the reconstruction of a continuous tone image from its halftoned version. We propose two methods for inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> of dot diffused images. The first one uses Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) and the second one uses wavelets. We then propose a novel and fast method for inverse halftoning called the Look Up Table (LUT) Method. The LUT for inverse halftoning is obtained from the histogram gathered from a few sample halftone images and the corresponding original images. For each pixel, the algorithm looks at the pixel's neighborhood (template) and depending upon the distribution of pixels in the template, it assigns a contone value from a precomputed LUT. The method is extremely fast (no filtering is required) and the image quality achieved is comparable to the best methods known for inverse halftoning. The LUT inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> method does not depend on the specific properties of the <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> method, and can be applied to any method. An algorithm for template selection for LUT inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> is introduced. We also extend LUT inverse halftoning to color halftones. The next topic is image watermarking and effects of halftoning on watermarked images. Watermarking is the process of embedding a secret signal into a host signal in order to verify ownership or authenticity. We discuss the effects of applying inverse <b>half</b> <b>toning</b> before detection of watermark in <b>half</b> <b>toned</b> images and offer methods to improve watermark detection from halftoned images. Finally, we consider the optimal histogram modification with MSE metric and optimal codebook selection problem. Watermarking with histogram modification is one of the few watermarking methods which is robust to rotation and scaling. We formulate histogram modification problem as finding a transformation such that the error between the input and the output signal is minimized and the output signal has the desired histogram. It turns out that this problem is equivalent to the integer linear programming problem. Then, we formulate the problem of finding the optimal code book where the codewords can come from a finite set. The equivalent problem again turns out to be a linear integer programming problem and the solution is guaranteed to be globally optimal...|$|R

2500|$|Prior to {{the live}} session, Miles Davis had already {{established}} {{a reputation as}} one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as [...] "The Jazz Corner of the World", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating [...] "Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [...] For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way : the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a <b>half</b> <b>tone.</b> That was [...] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'" [...] Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.|$|E

This section is in a simple lecture style, and looks at music from a purely mathematical angle, in a theoretical tradition that goes back, through the works of Renaissance theoreticians, to the Ancient Greeks. Fux explains that intervals in exact mathematical proportions result in larger and smaller <b>half</b> <b>tones,</b> and he also mentions that some organists added extra keys (split halves to use smaller and bigger <b>half</b> <b>tones),</b> but that adding extra keys on a keyboard was problematic and for this reason they divided every note in [...] "" [...] (two equal parts), resulting in equal temperament. He continues: The works of Mersenne, Cicero and Aristotle are among the references quoted by Fux in this section.|$|R

50|$|In short, {{lowering}} any note of {{a diminished}} seventh chord a <b>half</b> <b>tone</b> {{leads to a}} dominant seventh chord (or German sixth enharmonically), the lowered note being {{the root of the}} new chord. Raising any note of a diminished seventh chord a <b>half</b> <b>tone</b> leads to a half-diminished seventh chord, the root of which is a whole step above the raised note. This means that any diminished chord can be modulated to eight different chords by simply lowering or raising any of its notes. If also employing enharmonic respelling of the diminished seventh chord, such as that beginning the modulation in the above examples (allowing for three other possible diminished seventh chords in other keys), it quickly becomes apparent the versatility of this combination technique and the wide range of available options in key modulation.|$|E
