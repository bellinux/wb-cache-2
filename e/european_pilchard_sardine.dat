40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the relative importance}} of different prey types of the <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> (<b>European</b> <b>sardine)</b> from the late larval to the adult stage. Two different methodologies for analysing stomach contents were used to describe the trophic dynamics of sardine and the relationship of sardine feeding behaviour with the ontogenetic development of body structures used for feeding, such as gill rakers and pyloric caeca. This information is essential to accurately depict the use of the planktonic resources in the area by sardine and to discuss {{the extent to which the}} sardine population could be affected by environmental changes in the Mediterranean Sea. We showed that cladocerans in summer and diatoms in winter were numerically the most important prey types for both juveniles and adults. However, decapod larvae were the most important prey during all seasons in terms of carbon content. Accordingly, differences in methodology should be considered in the analysis of sardine diets. An analysis of the composition of the plankton showed that small copepods were strongly selected by sardines at all ages and in both seasons. We also observed that the pyloric caeca began to grow when the sardines were approximately 4 - 5 cm standard length (SL) and ended their development when the sardines reached approximately 8 cm SL, whereas the gill rakers appeared to be completely functional when the sardines reached 7 cm SL. Therefore, filter feeding of small particles could be performed with total efficacy beginning at 7 - 8 cm SL. In view of the energetic advantage of filter feeding in a well-adapted filter-feeding species such as sardine, the prospective limited availability of small particles hypothesized by certain authors for the Mediterranean could have negative consequences for sardine. This study demonstrates that sardine populations, given their extremely high dependence on the lower marine trophic levels, could be strongly affected by alterations in the environment and in the planktonic community...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pilchard</b> (<b>sardine)</b> and anchovy are {{the main}} targets of South Africa's pelagic fishery. This fishery is the country's second most {{valuable}} in monetary terms, and produces the highest annual yield in terms of landed mass (in recent years, a combined catch {{of the order of}} 400 000 t). It is the most dynamic of South Africa's main commercial fisheries, because the species targeted are relatively short-lived, often occur in mixed shoals, and experience large fluctuations in abundance. Mixed shoaling causes operational problems for the fishery, because of the inevitability of juvenile pilchard bycatch (of more value as adults for canning) in the anchovy-directed fishery. This operational interaction implies a trade-off between allowable catches for the two species, and hence necessitates that they are managed together. The development of a joint “management procedure” (sensu IWC) for the two species is described. This provides a framework for quantifying this trade-off, subject to the constraint that acceptable levels of risk of “collapse” are not exceeded for either resource.

Factors examined were diet composition, prey importance, season, fish size, feeding strategy and prey orientation in the oesophagus. The stomach contents of 308 specimens were collected and analyzed between March and November 2000. Synodus saurus is common in Azorean water. Though it prefers small gregarious pelagic fish, it also feeds on epibenthic and benthic prey. We found the following prey in its diet: 9 families of teleostean fishes (Carangidae, clupeidae, Cynoglossidae, Gobiidae, Labridae, Myctophidae, Spaidae, Spyraenidae and Synodontidae), two families of crustaceans (Cymothoidae and Scyllaridae) and one of cephalopods (Loliginidae).

Input datawere based on several recurrent scientific surveys, two alternative datasets for fishing data, stock assessment outputs, stomach content analyses and published information. Results showed that the functional groups were organised into five trophic levels with the highest one represented by dolphins, anglerfish, Atlantic bluefin tuna, European hake and <b>European</b> conger. <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> and <b>European</b> anchovy dominated in terms of fish biomass and catch.

Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ 13 C and δ 15 N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e. g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, red bandfish (Cepola macrophthalma) and <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> (Sardina pilchardus).

This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate {{the potential of}} using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from ½-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species.

Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100 -bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources...|$|R
50|$|The Bleeker smoothbelly sardinella, (Amblygaster clupeoides) {{also known}} as blue pilchard, sharp-nosed <b>pilchard,</b> or {{sharpnose}} <b>sardine,</b> is a reef-associated marine species of sardinellas in the herring family Clupeidae. It {{is one of the}} three species of genus Amblygaster. It is found in the marine waters along Indo-West Pacific regions. The fish has 13 to 21 dorsal soft rays and 12 to 23 anal soft rays. It grows up to a maximum length of 21 cm. The flank is gold in fresh fish but becomes black while preservation. Belly is more rounded and scutes are not prominent. The fish feeds on minute organisms like copepods, Mysis and zooplankton. Widely used as bait in the tuna fishery all along the world, both as a live or dead forms.|$|R
50|$|The Chumash {{people and}} Tongva people used sewen plank canoes (Tomols) to travel across and {{fish in the}} seas between the Southwest California Coast and the Channel Islands of California. Some of their chief catches were <b>sardines</b> (<b>pilchards)</b> who were {{mentioned}} several times by the early Spanish explorers. Sardines are small epipelagic fish (surface water fish to 200m) which then migrated along the California coast in large schools at certain times of the year. They are an important forage fish for larger forms of marine life and a major fishery in the California waters till the sardine schools greatly diminished due to ocean current temperature changes and over fishing.

40|$|IV Congress of Marine Sciences, 11 - 13 June 2014, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. [...] 1 pageKnowing {{the feeding}} habits of marine predators is {{essential}} to understand their ecological role in the ecosystem. Moreover, this information is pivotal for an accurate management and conservation strategies of their populations. The Atlantic bonito Sarda sarda is an epipelagic Scombrid distributed throughout the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean and Black Seas. This migratory predator represents an important ﬁshery resource along its range of distribution, {{as well as in}} the NW Mediterranean. However, despite its commercial and ecological importance, accurate information of its trophic habits in the Mediterranean is very scarce. In this study, our main aim is to examine the feeding ecology (diet composition and trophic level) of the Atlantic bonito in the NW Mediterranean Sea by combining stable isotopic and stomach content methodologies at different temporal scales. Also we compare the trophic habits of the Atlantic bonito with information from several species of the same ecosystem to determine its ecological role. Our stable isotopic and stomach content results reveal a clearly importance of small pelagic ﬁsh in the diet of this top predator without seasonal changes in diet during the year. In particular, the diet of the Atlantic bonito includes the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus as the main prey in its diet. Other pelagic species found in its diet are the <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> Sardina pilchardus and the round sardinella Sardinella aurita. These results indicate the position of this species as an important predator within the pelagic food web of the NW Mediterranean Sea and highlight that the Atlantic bonito feeds on pelagic species that are ecologically and commercially very important in the area. In addition, comparing the trophic position of the Atlantic bonito with other species of the study area, we observe that this species shows a similar position as other important predators such as blueﬁn tuna, other tunids, and Audouin’s gullPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Questions {{should be}} {{addressed}} to Joan Giménez (joan. gimenez@csic. es). The ecological role of species can vary among populations depending on local and regional differences in diet. This is particularly true for top predators such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), which exhibits a highly varied diet throughout its distribution range. Local dietary assessments are therefore critical to fully understand the role of this species within marine ecosystems, as well as its interaction with important ecosystem services such as fisheries. Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ 13 C and δ 15 N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e. g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, red bandfish (Cepola macrophthalma) and <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> (Sardina pilchardus). These contrasting results highlight differences in the temporal and taxonomic resolution of each approach, but also point to potential differences between ingested (SCA) and assimilated (SIA) diets. Both approaches provide different insights, e. g. determination of consumed fish biomass for the management of fish stocks (SCA) or identification of important assimilated prey species to the consumer (SIA).

40|$|As {{condition}} {{is a key}} variable in population dynamics (especially for survival, growth and reproduction), the use of well-defined and accurate fish condition indices is capital. In particular, condition indices (morphometric, bioenergetic and biochemical) have never been compared and validated for the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, the <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> Sardina pilchardus and the European sprat Sprattus sprattus. The accuracy of two indirect methods, the morphometric relative condition index Kn and the bioenergetics index determined with the Distell Fish Fatmeter was investigated by comparing with a direct measure of relative lipid content carried out with a thin layer chromatography-flame ionization detector. Estimations from the fatmeter correlated quite well with the relative lipid contents of all species, regardless of the reproductive period (R 2 = 0. 69 for anchovy, R 2 = 0. 75 for sprat and R 2 = 0. 48 for sardine). Kn correlated more poorly with relative lipid content (R 2 = 0. 22 for anchovy and R 2 = 0. 41 for sardine, ns for sprat), especially during the reproductive period, pointing out the difficulty for such an index to precisely reflect changes in fat allocation. During the reproductive period, changes in Kn could reflect other processes, such as changes in protein content. Therefore, these different types of commonly used indices do not reflect exactly {{the same type of}} energy stores. The high repeatability of the fatmeter was brought to light, so that only one measurement on each fish side may be necessary to evaluate the relative lipid content of a small pelagic fish. Finally, fatmeter measurements were not affected by freezing storage up to one month for anchovy (R 2 = 0. 66) and sardine (R 2 = 0. 90), making it possible to use frozen samples of both commercial and scientific survey. In contrast, the freezing storage for sprat should be avoided. Based on this study, the Fatmeter appears to be a suitable indirect method to assess condition and fat content of sardine and anchovy on a large number of individuals...|$|R
