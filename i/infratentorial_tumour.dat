40|$|Haemangioblastomas are {{neoplasms}} of uncertain histogenesis with cellular and reticular variants advocated {{in current}} lore. Herein we describe an intriguing cerebellar specimen with unusual traits including spindle cell morphology and CD 34 positivity. A thirty-nine-year {{old man had}} an <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> discovered incidentally and resected three times. In all the instances, histopathological diagnosis was haemangioblastoma; nonetheless, he had neither physical stigmata nor family history of von Hippel-Lindau disease. By histology, the lesion was composed of areas of conventional stromal cells admixed with territories populated by short-spindled cells packed in lobules, sometimes giving the appearance of gomitoli. Immunoperoxidase-coupled reactions confirmed the expression of inhibin A, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), PS 100, and CD 57 but also revealed focal immunolabeling for CD 34, CD 99, and FXIIIa. This case highlights the potential phenotypical diversity {{that can be found}} within these neoplasms. Rather than uncertain histogenesis, it may in fact reflect multiple lines of differentiation—histomimesis—prone to adopt unusual morpho- and immunophenotypes in a subset of haemangioblastomas...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiology {{of primary}} {{paediatric}} brain tumours {{has been studied}} extensively in developed countries of the west. Such studies are lacking in developing countries especially sub-Saharan Africa. This study seeks to establish the epidemiology of primary brain tumours seen among children that were treated at Chris Hani Baragwanath and Johannesburg Hospitals from April 1995 to April 2005. The records of 252 patients who presented with this condition {{during the study period}} were reviewed, for the following details: ● Demographic details such as age, gender and race ● Diagnosis and the date when it was made ● The follow-up period at the hospital(s) /clinic(s) ● The anatomical location of the tumours; supratentorial or infratentorial ● The treatment that was given which included mainly surgery for tumour removal or biopsy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and others which included ventriculoperitoneal shunt, external ventricular drain insertion. ● The outcome of treatment included: - alive - dead - presumed alive - lost to follow-up It was found: ● That 225 patients had full demographic details of race, gender and age. ● That there was a slight male predominance among children with primary brain tumour. ● That the majority of children with brain tumours were black, followed by whites which is in keeping with the country’s demographics. ● The three most common tumours were astrocytomas, medulloblastomas and brainstem gliomas in the descending order of frequency. ● Medulloblastomas were the commonest tumours in the infratentorial region while craniopharyngiomas were commonest tumours in the supratentorial region. ● More children had infratentorial tumours ● Younger children {{were more likely to have}} infratentorial tumours. ● Majority of patients had surgery either for diagnosis or for diagnosis and treatment. ● Few patients were presumptively diagnosed clinically and by imaging modalities ● Combination therapy of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy had the best survival outcome while chemotherapy as the only form of treatment had the worst outcome. ● The overall 5 year survival rate for all the study participants was much lower than that of their counterparts in the literature. ● Children who had craniopharyngiomas and astrocytomas had better survival. ● Mortality incidence was slightly higher for whites than blacks but that could have been skewed by a high number of blacks that was lost to follow-up. ● A higher <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumour</b> prevalence than in the literature was noted. It was noted that racial prevalence of primary paediatric brain tumours follows population demographics. From the results of this study, there is a need for a better record keeping and improved patients follow-up. There is also a need for a larger epidemiological study in the two hospitals. There is need to establish a specialized paediatric unit which will help start a paediatric team comprising of a paediatric neurosurgeon, paediatric oncologist, paediatric intensivist and neuroradiologist with dedicated neuropaediatric ICU. Such a team given resources will improve survival outcome of children with brain tumours...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study morphological background of neurological disorders in patients with extracerebral intracranial tumours in pre- and postoperative period (after 1 and 2 years after the operation) using morphometric analysis. Materials and methods. 50 patients with extracerebral intracranial tumours (31 patients with supratentorial tumours, 19 — with <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumours)</b> before the operation, and 1 and 2 years after the operation were studied. The patients underwent clinico-neurological examination, brain MRT with measurement of lateral ventricles width, subarachnoid space, and vascular foci. The control group consisted of 30 people without focal cerebral lesions according to MRT findings. Results. The processes of mixed cerebral atrophy both in supratentorial and <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> were stated to become more intense after the operation. The morphometric analysis confirmed {{the progress of the}} stated changes. The second revealed characteristic of MRT-picture in this group of patients in postoperative period was vascular foci formation in white matter...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{value of}} CSF lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate transaminase {{in cases of}} brain tumours (except for CSF AST in the benign tumours), congenital hydrocephalus, and brain abscess is established. Tumour cyst fluids show a higher enzymatic activity than does the CSF. The two enzyme estimations do not help in differentiating the supratentorial from the <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumours.</b> CSF AST is superior to CSF LD in discriminating the malignant and benign tumours, {{in so far as}} the AST is increases selectively in malignancy. Estimates of CSF LD are slightly superior to those of CSF AST, both in incidence of abnormality and the degree of their rise...|$|R
40|$|The {{total number}} of {{children}} under 15 years of age with intracranial tumours in Denmark during the years 1935 - 1959 {{was found to be}} 533. The average incidence was 21 new cases/ 106 children/year during the 25 -year period in question, and 25 / 106 children/year during the first 17 years of Danish cancer registration. The sex ratio (290 boys to 243 girls) was not significantly {{different from that of the}} child population in Denmark. In 219 cases the tumour was located in the supratentorial and in 314 in the infratentorial space. 93 % of the tumours were histologically verified, with the following order of frequency for the most usual types: astrocytomas (all grades), medulloblastomas, ependymomas, and craniopharyngiomas. Follow-up was 100 %. For the 345 children who survived for more than one month after operation or diagnosis, 36 % were alive after 15 years. 119 patients were alive in April 1974 and these were all observed between 15 - 40 years after diagnosis and operation. Of these 44 had tumours in the supratentorial and 75 in the infratentorial space. 66 % of the survivors with supratentorial and 90 % with <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> led a normal life. Most of the survivors had had a cerebellar astrocytoma, a supratentorial astrocytoma, an apendymoma or oligodendroglioma, but other histological diagnoses were also represented, especially in the supratentorial group.

40|$|Eighty-five {{brain tumour}} {{patients}} were examined for further characteristics of brain tumour-associated headache. The overall prevalence of headache {{in this population}} was 60 %, but headache was the sole symptom in only 2 %. Pain was generally dull, of moderate intensity, and not specifically localized. Nearly 40 % met the criteria of tension-type headache. An alteration of the pain with the occurrence of the tumour was experienced by 82. 5 %, implying that the pre-existing and the brain tumour headaches were different. The classic character-istics mentioned in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (worsening {{in the morning or}} during coughing) were not found; this might be explained by the patients not having elevated intracranial pressure. Univariate analysis revealed that a positive family history of headache and the presence of meningiomas are risk factors for tumour-associated headache, and the use of b-blockers is prophylactic. Pre-existing headache was the only risk factor accord-ing to logistic regression, suggesting that patients with pre-existing (primary) headache have a greater predisposition to develop secondary headache. Dull headache occurs significantly more often in patients with glioblastoma multi-forme, and pulsating headache in patients with meningioma. In our study, only <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> were associated with headache location, and predomi-nantly with occipital but rarely frontal pain.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{retrospectively}} {{review the}} patient demographics, disease profile and treatment outcomes of paediatric patients treated for ependymoma at our institution. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 51 eligible patients were treated between 1980 and 2013. The median age at presentation was 6 years. The {{majority of patients}} were male (66, 7 %), had <b>infratentorial</b> <b>tumours</b> (62, 7 %) and had low-grade tumours (70, 6 %). Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 22 patients (43, 1 %). Thirtyeight patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (76, 5 %) and 10 (19, 6 %) received adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The 5 -year overall survival (OS) was 63, 3 % (median follow up of 46 months). The 5 year progression free survival (PFS) was 50, 70 %. Seventeen (33, 3 %) patients experienced treatment failure, of which 13 (76, 5 %) represented local failure. The median time to first relapse was 20 months. The 5 year PFS for children > 3 was 50, 0 % and 27, 7 % for children ≤ 3 years of age (p = 0. 0356). GTR had a superior 5 - year OS of 73, 9 % over subtotal resection with a value of 56, 7 % (p = 0. 0016). Similarly an improved 5 -year PFS of 70, 3 % versus 29, 1 % was observed with GTR over subtotal resection (p = < 0. 0001). Patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) had significantly better outcomes than those in whom RT was not given (p = < 0. 0001, 5 year OS of 69, 7 % versus 37, 5 %). CONCLUSION: This review confirms the finding that GTR is associated with improved outcomes and that adjuvant radiation therapy positively impacts survival. The worse outcomes in the younger age group requires further evaluation and possible change in treatment protocol for this group of patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Brain Single Photon Emission Computerised Tomography (SPECT) {{has been}} {{established}} as a potentially useful tool {{for the assessment of}} recurrent brain tumours. Though brain SPECT is exquisitely sensitive in detecting viable tumour tissue in the supratentorial region, its efficacy has not been evaluated till date in case of <b>infratentorial</b> posterior fossa <b>tumours.</b> AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of brain SPECT in differentiating recurrence of tumour from post-radiation gliosis in the posterior fossa of the brain. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with primary malignant posterior fossa brain tumour were evaluated by brain SPECT with Tc 99 m-Tetrofosmin as the tumour-seeking agent. Clinical behaviour of the tumour observed for a minimum period of one year after the SPECT study was taken as the gold standard. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The Chi-square test has been used to note the significance of the association between the clinical outcome and the SPECT finding. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of brain SPECT were also calculated. RESULT: Brain SPECT in 4 patients revealed increased tracer concentration over the primary tumour bed, which was consistent with recurrent tumour. The clinical course was consistent with tumour recurrence in 13 of the 21 patients, which included 3 patients with positive SPECT study and 10 patients with negative SPECT study. Brain SPECT revealed recurrent tumour in 4 patients whereas clinical follow-up suggested recurrence in 13 patients. The clinical course was consistent with radiation necrosis in the remaining 8 patients. In 1 brain SPECT positive patient the clinical course was consistent with post-radiation gliosis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that brain SPECT is not a sensitive diagnostic modality to differentiate recurrent tumour from post-radiation gliosis in the posterior fossa of the brain...|$|R
