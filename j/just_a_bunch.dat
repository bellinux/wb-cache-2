It's {{good to see}} money going from a bunch of silly buggers to an artist {{who is going to}} make good use of it. What's that saying about a fool and his money...?" [...] John Bellany, on the other hand, said that [...] "The emotional, artistic side of [...] nature... admire the audacity and imagination, challenging art and the art manipulators. The rational side of me asks, is this the most expensive art publicity stunt this century, and for whom?" ...|$|E
500|$|Shearer has {{released}} five solo comedy albums: It Must Have Been Something I Said (1994), Dropping Anchors (2006), Songs Pointed and Pointless (2007), Songs of the Bushmen (2008) and Greed and Fear (2010). His most recent CD, Greed and Fear is mainly about Wall Street economic issues, rather than politics like his previous albums. Shearer {{decided to make}} the album when he"started getting amused by the language of the economic meltdown – when 'toxic assets' suddenly became 'troubled assets,' going from something poisoning the system to <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of delinquent youth with dirty faces that needed not removal from the system but just...understanding." [...] In May 2006, Shearer received an honorary doctorate from Goucher College.|$|E
500|$|Due to Fishman's actions, Academy {{officials}} allowed their {{contractual obligation}} to the series to lapse after the 1965 game. Years later, Bud Thalman, Navy sports information director at the time, said the incident had taken place [...] "when there was still some level of sportsmanship in athletes ... It was so out of character it was stunning. There was no inclination from Navy to seek out a renewal. That untoward act of sportsmanship created a bad taste among people." [...] Navy head coach Wayne Hardin called Fishman's act [...] "a disgrace to college football." [...] Maryland's head coach, Tom Nugent, had a different opinion and said, [...] "Both teams appeared to be <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of red-blooded guys trying to kill each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{observed}} that [...] "here's no better song to kick things off than the masterful 'Angel of Death', {{one of the}} most monumental songs in metal history, where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs, drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded, and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya screams and snarls his tale of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele." [...] When asked why Reign in Blood has retained its popularity, King replied: [...] "If you released Reign in Blood today, no one would give a shit. It was timing; it was a change in sound. In thrash metal at that time, no one had ever heard good production on a record like that. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of things that came together at once." ...|$|E
500|$|Esch {{returned}} for the Symbols album, which {{was released in}} 1997 and featured Abby Travis and Skinny Puppy's Nivek Ogre. Symbols reached No.137 on the Billboard 200. Its first track, [...] "Megalomaniac", was featured in the film , {{and was the first}} song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay. [...] Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on [...] "Anarchy". Looking back on Symbols in 2002, Konietzko said, [...] "I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It told me the story of what went wrong. There were maybe two (good) songs on that album and the others were <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of compromising tug-of-wars. That was something I was not going to do again." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend {{was mixed}} towards the episode. While calling the new formula [...] "a {{breath of fresh}} air," [...] she was not entirely pleased with the final scene {{featuring}} Piz and Veronica's kiss, opining that the location {{and the fact that}} Veronica ran after Piz and kissed him back were not in keeping with Veronica's character. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club was also critical of the case of the week and the episode in general. While admiring the show's decision to address the controversial issue of Islamophobia in the United States, he did not like the show's characterization of Rashad, the father, noting inconsistencies about whether his storyline was one of redemption or not. [...] "There are three seemingly equal interpretations: that Veronica Mars writers believe that the cartoon is worth ruining someone's life over; that Rashad is a complex character who can be petty and vindictive; or, it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of stuff that happens and there is no moral." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Ausiello spoke {{further on}} Katherine Heigl's {{perspective}} on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not {{originally intended to}} be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. [...] "Even though there's {{a part of me}} that would like to go back and do the quick Izzie farewell, [...] " [...] she says, [...] "I also think that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's songs also feature offbeat sounds, improvisational elements, and {{conversational}} vocals {{derived from}} rap. The Revival {{begins with a}} directive from a grave voice: [...] "Play this record as frequently as possible, Then, as it becomes easier for you, play the record once a day, or as needed." [...] The album also features dialogue between an old lady who asks the group {{whether it will be}} like their last album, on which she was also featured; they respond to her question [...] "No, ma'am". [...] "All the Way" [...] has a scrambling beat, whistle sounds, and the rhythmic call and response [...] "What are we, what are we, what are we? ... <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of brothers having a party". The end of [...] "Feels Good" [...] features witty jazz keyboard playing behind a lively voice saying [...] "it feels good ... in the hands, feet, bones, heart, and soul". Ed Hogan of Allmusic writes that [...] "the last part sounds like a Sunday morning testimonial." ...|$|E
500|$|In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a {{film critic}} for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave The Inbetweeners 2 a B+. He said [...] "Don’t expect a deep, {{underlying}} narrative. This is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of horny teenagers doing really dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked me– and that’s not easy given how many movies I watch. It pushes the envelope a lot further than I expected and I'd highly recommend seeing {{the film in}} a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious." [...] Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film {{takes a long time}} to [...] "get going" [...] due to a [...] "silly establishment skit". However, she concluded that [...] "there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "the biggest ribbing since The Simpsons invaded [...] shores". Although opining that the film was [...] "slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide [...] "challenges Caddyshack for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag".|$|E

500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

2500|$|Walter Kirn, in {{a review}} for The New York Times, claims that [...] "Good Old Neon" [...] focuses on [...] "a {{philosophical}} conundrum: {{the question of whether}} human beings can be said to possess authentic selves or whether, like 'David Wallace,' the story's narrator, we are really <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of shabby fakes cut off from our own and others' essential beings by the inadequacy of language." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He told us we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' told us we were great and that they were <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews?

2500|$|Despite the difficulties, Osbourne {{moved on}} after Rhoads' death. Speak of the Devil, {{known in the}} United Kingdom as Talk of the Devil, was {{originally}} planned to consist of live recordings from 1981, primarily from Osbourne's solo work. Under contract to produce a live album, it ended up consisting entirely of Black Sabbath covers recorded with Gillis, bassist Rudy Sarzo, and drummer Tommy Aldridge. Osbourne later commented (inside the cover of [...] "Tribute") [...] "I don't give a fuck about that album. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of bullshit Sabbath covers." ...|$|E
