40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} different criteria for stem measurement sampling and to identify the criterion with best performance for developing individual tree volume equations. Data were collected in eucalyptus stands 58 to 65 months old. Schumacher-Hall model was applied using five sampling criteria with nine variations (45 in total) : 1) number of trees per <b>diameter</b> <b>class,</b> being (a) fixed number, (b) proportional to the <b>diameter</b> <b>class</b> of the sample, or (c) proportional to the standard deviation of the sample; and 2) the width of the <b>diameter</b> <b>class,</b> which ranged from 1. 0 up to 5. 0 cm. We used the equations generated from each of the five sampling criteria to estimate stem volume of trees reserved for validation. This allowed us to obtain standard errors of estimates from this data-set. In addition, residuals of volume estimates were examined by means of statistical tests of bias, autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. Better performances of volume equations occurred when smaller <b>diameter</b> <b>class</b> widths were used, i. e., when the sample size increased. There was no clear trend in increasing/decreasing residual autocorrelation and/or heteroscedasticity. Both methods of sampling proportional to the frequency of <b>diameter</b> <b>class</b> had the best performances, inclusive using only 36 trees. The ones where choice of trees was proportional to the standard deviation had the worst. In conclusion, the selection proportional to the frequency of the <b>diameter</b> <b>class,</b> under the condition that at least two trees per class are sampled, provides models statistically better than all the other criteria...|$|E

40|$|Tree {{of heaven}} (Ailanthus altissima) is {{regarded}} as invasive within urban and natural areas worldwide. Efficient methods to control it are significantly needed {{if we are to}} limit its well-known environmental and economic impacts. Up to now the use of herbicides has proven necessary since following mechanical damage, Ailanthus vigorously resprouts. However, the seasonal response of Ailanthus stems, treated with herbicides, has never been assessed. We compared the control efficacy recorded in autumn, winter and summer in an abandoned suburban citrus grove in Sicily, under Mediterranean-climate conditions. Glyphosate was injected within drill holes made in knee-high cut trees. Tree mortality and the resprouting ability of treated stems were significantly affected by the application timing and by <b>diameter</b> <b>class</b> of stems. Mortality was significantly lower in winter treatments within the smaller <b>diameter</b> <b>class.</b> Within the larger <b>diameter</b> <b>class,</b> only autumn treatments showed a notably higher mortality rate and a significantly lower growth of sprouts.
