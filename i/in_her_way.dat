This aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E

[...] In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the Harry Potter series should be considered in the same light as some New Age practices warned against in the document, Fleetwood stated, [...] "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help children to see the difference between good and evil. And she is very clear on this." [...] He added that Rowling is [...] "Christian by conviction, is Christian in her mode of living, even <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>way</b> of writing." [...] This comment was seized on by the media as an endorsement of the novels from the Catholic Church, and by extension, the Pope at that time, John Paul II, though {{there is no evidence that}} the Pope officially approved of the novels.|$|E
500|$|Chrissie Watts {{was created}} by the {{production}} team to be more the [...] "equal" [...] of her notorious and villainous husband than his long-suffering first wife, Angie (Anita Dobson). The character was described by Oberman as being like Angie [...] "but with 15 more years of feminism behind her", and was hailed by the TV editor of the Evening Standard as [...] "the only strong woman left in Walford". She became well known for her deviousness and [...] "scheming", echoing the traits of her husband, with the official EastEnders website characterising her as [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead" [...] of Den. As part of the Watts family, her story lines centre on her tumultuous marriage to Den, her relationship with his children, and the ongoing feud with the rival Mitchell family. She was involved in numerous clashes with other female characters, Oberman noting that Chrissie had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives", and was constantly scheming against those who got <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>way,</b> earning her the sobriquet of [...] "super-bitch".|$|E

500|$|With Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, {{the door}} opened for Clark, but Welling stated he {{understood}} why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: [...] "There's the cliché that television shows with a main love interest fail once they get it together." [...] After briefly being together {{at the beginning of}} the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>way,</b> but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero. His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as trying}} to take over Lassiter's, Diana also wants to [...] "settle a score with Paul Robinson".

Badler explained that Diana resents Paul as she is not part of his family and knows that she cannot ever be at the top. Further to that, Paul and Diana were once lovers and Diana fell in love with him, but he walked out on her and broke her heart. Stefan Dennis said that Paul and Diana's relationship came at a time when Paul was [...] "a philandering playboy and didn't care." [...] Paul became one of a few men that Diana has ever fallen in love with and because he treated her badly, she decides to bring him down. Badler said that Diana has been keeping an eye on Paul and knows everything about what he has been up to. Following her arrival, Diana begins to make Paul's life [...] "a nightmare" [...] and Badler said [...] "Diana's back to force him {{to fall in love with}} her again, or destroy him – whichever comes first".|$|E
500|$|The player-character, {{a robotic}} maid named Marina, {{journeys}} {{to save her}} kidnapped creator. The story takes place on Planet Clancer, a world {{on the cusp of}} civil war due to the actions of its Emperor and his Imperial forces. The Emperor brainwashes Clancers to kidnap the visiting robotics genius Professor Theo. Theo's creation, the player-character Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, pursues the professor and grabs, throws, and shakes the obstacles <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>way,</b> such as enemies, floating [...] "Clanball" [...] platforms, warp stars, and missiles. Indeed, almost all game objects can be grabbed, which lends towards the shake-based combat system. Marina can shake [...] "grabbed" [...] objects to throw them as projectiles or to find loot. Objects sometimes change functions when shaken, such as items that become homing missiles and guns with multi-directional shots. Some drop red, blue, and green gems, which restore player health. The health gauge {{in the corner of the}} screen shows the amount of damage Marina can take. The player can store up to two additional stock lives. Yellow gems hidden in each level extend the final cutscene's length. Marina can run, jump, and boost (via jetpack) in the eight cardinal and ordinal directions.

[...] During the manga's publication, more of Belldandy's capabilities are discovered, but she probably has many more : Urd notes that Belldandy loves accumulating [...] capabilities [...] but usually doesn't mention them herself.
