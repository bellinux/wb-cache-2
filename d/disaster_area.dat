5|$|The third {{mission was}} begun in 1998. It was a {{search and rescue}} mission {{requiring}} fully autonomous robots to take off, fly to a <b>disaster</b> <b>area</b> and search for survivors and the dead amid raging fires, broken water mains, clouds of toxic gas, and rubble from destroyed buildings. The scenario was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility where the above hazards could be recreated. Because of the realism of the scenario, animatrons were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from the <b>disaster</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because Bonnie hit Florida {{immediately}} before Charley, damage {{between the two}} storms was often difficult to differentiate. President George W. Bush responded to the storm by declaring much of Florida a Federal <b>Disaster</b> <b>Area</b> on August 13, 2004.|$|E

40|$|By {{focusing}} on the impacts of investment in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas</b> for reconstruction on the demand-side effects, {{the purpose of this}} study is to measure the economic impacts and regional spillover effects of investment for reconstruction. After the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, government investment in the <b>disaster</b> stricken <b>areas</b> was provided for reconstruction of capital stock damaged, and dynamic analysis is needed to reveal the long-term effects of investment. On the other hand, government investment for reconstruction results in increased aggregate demand, gross income, and gross production in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas,</b> and has spillover effects on the other prefectures except for the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas,</b> even if the amount of damaged capital stock is given. This study develops a spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) model that consists of 47 prefectures and 20 industrial sectors in Japan. Also, this study assumes two scenarios. First, in order to measure economic damages in Japan, this study assumes a supply constraint by collapsed private capital stocks in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas</b> (Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima and Ibaraki). Second, in order to measure regional redistributive impacts of reconstruction investment, this study assumes that a reconstruction investment that evenly distributes funds to the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas.</b> The findings in this study are shown below. 1) By collapsed private capital stocks due to the earthquake, real GDP was estimated to decrease in 124 trillion dollars per year in total and to decrease in 120 trillion dollars per year in total in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas</b> before the earthquake. Also, welfare was estimated to decrease in 109 trillion dollars per year in total and to decrease in 86 trillion dollars per year in total in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas.</b> 2) After the earthquake, since investment for reconstruction improved real GDP and welfare in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas,</b> this study showed that reconstruction investment contributed significantly to economic recovery in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas.</b> By reconstruction investment, real GDP was estimated to increase in 1. 6 trillion dollars per year in total and to increase in 56. 7 trillion dollars per year in total in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas</b> after the earthquake. Also, welfare was estimated to increase in 360 trillion dollars per year in total and to increase in 121 trillion dollars per year in total in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas.</b> 3) Since investment for reconstruction resulted in welfare increase in 239 trillion dollars per year in total in regions except for the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas,</b> this study showed regional redistributive effect of reconstruction investment. The reason for this effect is that reconstruction investment in the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas</b> increases in demand in regions except for the <b>disaster</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
5|$|In early September 1971, President Richard Nixon {{declared}} {{counties in}} New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania as <b>disaster</b> <b>areas</b> due to heavy rains and flooding. This allowed citizens in <b>disaster</b> <b>areas</b> {{to apply for}} federal assistance.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the disaster, Luis A. Ferré, the Governor of Puerto Rico, {{declared a state of emergency}} over the whole island, asking for $10 million (1970 USD) in federal aid.

The National Guard, the Red Cross, and other volunteer groups helped the displaced persons. In all, the disaster was described as one of the worst in Puerto Rico history. The Governor of the Virgin Islands, Melvin Evans, requested aid similar to Puerto Rico, and that territory was also declared a federal <b>disaster</b> <b>area</b> about a week after the rains ended. The heavy rainfall in the Virgin Islands caused a marked dinoflagellate algal bloom in the days after the rains ended.|$|E
