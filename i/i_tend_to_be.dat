40|$|This study {{examined}} the growth hormone (GH) response to repeated bouts of sprint cycling. Eight healthy men completed three trials consisting of two 30 -s sprints on a cycle ergometer separated by either- 60 min (Trial A) or 240 min (Trial B) of recovery and a single 30 -s sprint carried out the day after Trial B (Trial C). Trials A and B were separated by at least 7 days. Blood samples were obtained at rest and during recovery from each sprint. In Trial A, GH was elevated immediately before sprint 2, {{and there was no}} further increase in GH following the second sprint [area under the curve: 460 (SD 348) vs. 226 min center dot mu g(- 1) center dot l(- 1) (SD 182), P = 0. 05]. Free insulin-like growth factor <b>I</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower immediately before sprint 2 than sprint I (P = 0. 06). Serum free fatty acids were not different immediately before each of the sprints. In Trial B, there was a trend for a smaller GH response to the second sprint [GH area under the curve: 512 (81) 396) vs. 242 min mu g(- 1) center dot l(- 1) (SD 190), P = 0. 091. Free insulin-like growth factor <b>I</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower (P = 0. 06), and serum free fatty acids were higher (P = 0. 01) immediately before sprint 2 than sprint 1. There was no difference in the GH response to sprinting on consecutive days (Trials B and C). In conclusion, repeated bouts of sprint cycling on the same day result in an attenuation or even ablation of the exercise-induced increase in GH, depending on the recovery interval between sprints...|$|R
50|$|In essence Anselin's Moran scatterplot {{presents}} {{the relation of}} the variable in the location i with respect the values of that variable in the neighboring locations. By construction the slope of the line in the scatter plot is equivalent to the Moran's I coefficient. The latter is a well-known statistic that accounts for the Global spatial autocorrelation. If that slope is positive it means that there is positive spatial autocorrelation: high values of the variable in location <b>i</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> clustered with high values of the same variable in locations that are neighbors of i, and vice versa. If the slope in the scatter plot is negative that means that we have a sort of checkerboard pattern or a sort of spatial competition in which high values in a variable in location <b>i</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> co-located with lower values in the neighboring locations.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period Scottish monasticism was dominated by monks called Céli Dé (lit. [...] "vassals of God"), anglicised as culdees. At St Andrews and elsewhere, Céli Dé abbeys are recorded and the round towers at Brechin and Abernethy are evidence of Irish influence. Gaelic monasticism was vibrant and expansionary for much of the period and dozens of monasteries, often called Schottenklöster, were founded by Gaelic monks on the continent. The introduction of the continental type of monasticism <b>to</b> Scotland <b>is</b> associated with Queen Margaret, the wife of Máel Coluim III, although her exact role is unclear. She was in communication with Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he provided a few monks for a new Benedictine abbey at Dunfermline (c. 1070). Subsequent foundations under Margaret's sons, the kings Edgar, Alexander I and particularly David <b>I,</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of the reformed type that followed the lead set by Cluny. These stressed the original Benedictine virtues of poverty, chastity and obedience, but also contemplation and service of the Mass and were followed in various forms by large numbers of reformed Benedictine, Augustinian and Cistercian houses.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} find experts, {{different}} approaches build rankings of people, assuming that they are ranked by level of expertise, and use typical Information Retrieval (IR) measures to evaluate their effectiveness. However, we figured out that expert rankings (<b>i)</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> partially ordered, (ii) incomplete, and (iii) consequently provide more an order rather than absolute ranks, which is not what usual IR measures exploit. To improve this state of the art, we propose to revise the formalism used in IR to design proper measures for comparing expert rankings. In this report, we investigate a first step by providing mitigation procedures for the three issues, and we analyse IR measures {{with the help of}} these procedures to identify interesting revisions and remaining limitations. From this analysis, we see that most of the measures can be exploited for this more generic context because of our mitigation procedures. Moreover, measures based on precision and recall, usually unable to consider the order of the ranked items, are of first interest if we represent a ranking as a set of ordered pairs. Cumulative measures, on the other hand, are specifically designed for considering the order but suffer from a higher complexity, motivating the use of precision/recall measures with the right representation.
