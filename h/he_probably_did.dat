5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Around 1498, Josquin {{most likely}} re-entered {{the service of}} the Sforza family, on the {{evidence}} of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career {{around the turn of the}} 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi ("I have placed my hope in you, Lord"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.|$|E
5|$|Walter's chief {{administrative}} measures were his {{instructions to the}} itinerant justices of 1194 and 1198, his ordinance of 1195, an attempt to increase order in the kingdom, and his plan of 1198 {{for the assessment of}} a land tax. In 1194 the justices were ordered to secure the election of four coroners by each county court. The coroners were to keep, or register, royal pleas, which had previously been a duty of the sheriff. The juries were to be chosen by a committee of four knights, also elected by the county court. This introduction of coroners and constables eventually led to a change in the role of sheriffs, and a lessening of their importance in royal administration. Although <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not take part in the decision to set up a special exchequer for the collection of Richard's ransom, Walter did appoint the two escheators, or guardians of the amounts due, who were Hugh Bardulf in the north of England and William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise in the south. His instructions for the eyre, or circuits of traveling justices, are the first that survive in English history. It was during his tenure of the justiciarship that the judicial role of the Exchequer became separated from the purely financial aspects.|$|E

25|$|Gudea was a ruler (ensi) of {{the state}} of Lagash in Southern Mesopotamia who ruled c. 2144–2124 BC. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not come from the city, but had married Ninalla, {{daughter}} of the ruler Ur-Baba (2164–2144 BC) of Lagash, thus gaining entrance to the royal house of Lagash.

25|$|The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the {{organization}} {{responsible for}} the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by William Hewson, {{who lived in the}} house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school {{at the back of the}} house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.|$|E
25|$|At first, the cartographic {{community}} {{largely ignored}} Peters's foray into cartography. The preceding century had already witnessed many campaigns for new projections with little visible result. Just twenty years earlier, for example, Trystan Edwards described and promoted his own eponymous projection, disparaging the Mercator, and recommending his projection as the solution. Peters's projection differed from Edwards's only in height-to-width ratio. More problematic, Peters's projection was identical {{to one that}} was already over a century old, though <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not realize it. That projection—Gall's orthographic—passed unnoticed {{when it was announced}} in 1855.|$|E

25|$|It {{is still}} debated whether Horn {{committed}} the Nickells murder. Historians including Chip Carlson {{believe he did}} not, while others such as Dean Fenton Krakel believe that he did, but had not realized he was shooting a boy. The consensus is that regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others. Carlson, who extensively researched the Wyoming v. Tom Horn trial, concluded that although Horn could have committed the murder of Willie Nickell, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not. According to Carlson's book, Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon (2001), there was no physical evidence that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day before it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession made it without value as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn's reputation and history made him {{an easy target for}} the prosecution.|$|E

500|$|After George I died on 11 June 1727, Murray {{entered and}} won a {{competition}} to write a Latin poem titled [...] "The Death of the King". His actions were seen as a show {{of support for the}} House of Hanover and the political status quo, something odd considering the strong Jacobite sympathies of his family. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> this because, having no private income, he wished to secure patronage to help him advance politically. Another entrant was William Pitt, who was a constant rival to Murray until Pitt's death in 1778. There is very little information about Murray's time at Oxford; it is known that he studied ancient and modern history, became fluent in French and gained a good understanding of Roman Law. He also became fluent in Latin, translating Cicero's works into English and then back into Latin. He gained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1727, and travelled to London to train as a barrister.|$|E

500|$|To his left, in the center, are the [...] "traitors", {{many of them}} on the Russian payroll, {{and future}} members of the Targowica Confederation. Adam Poniński, marshal of the Sejm, {{pointing}} in red court dress, either demands that Rejtan leaves or points to the armed Russian guards outside the door; he holds a simple wooden walking stick instead of a [...] more elaborate marshall's staff, which Rejtan stole a day earlier. Behind him are bishop Ignacy Massalski and Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk. To his right, Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki hides his face in his hands; which likely was Matejko's solution for a prosaic problem — <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not have access to a likeness of Branicki. Szczęsny Potocki, with the blue sash, looks to the ground, embarrassed. Behind the overturned chair, his father, Franciszek Salezy Potocki, also embarrassed, drops a quill pen and looks away. Between the two Potockis Jacek Małachowski is engaged in discussion with Samuel Korsak, while Karol Radziwiłł simply observes the situation, amused. On the ground, turned over, lies an amchair, with Branicki's hat and a coin purse, from which the coins spill towards Poniński, alluding to the real reason he is intent on concluding the debate.|$|E
500|$|For {{several months}} the Allies had been {{planning}} an attack upon Brest, the French port in the Bay of Biscay. The French had received intelligence alerting them to the imminent assault, enabling Marshal Vauban to strengthen its defences and reinforce the garrison. Inevitably the attack on 18 June led by Thomas Tollemache ended in disaster; most of his men were killed or captured, and Tollemache himself died of his wounds shortly afterwards. Despite lacking evidence, Marlborough's detractors claimed that {{it was he who}} had alerted the enemy. Macaulay states that in a letter on 3 May 1694 Marlborough betrayed the Allied plans to James, thus ensuring that the landing failed and that Tollemache, a talented rival, was killed or discredited as a direct result. Historians such as John Paget and C. T. Atkinson conclude that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> write the letter, but did so only when he knew that it would be received too late for its information to be of any practical use (the plan of the attack on Brest was widely known, and the French had already begun to strengthen their defences in April). To Richard Holmes the evidence linking Marlborough with the Camaret Bay letter (which no longer exists), is slender, concluding, [...] "It is very hard to imagine a man as careful as Marlborough, only recently freed from suspicion of treason, writing a letter which would kill him if it fell into the wrong hands". However, David Chandler surmises that, [...] "the whole episode is so obscure and inconclusive that it is still not possible to make a definite ruling. In sum, perhaps we should award Marlborough the benefit of the doubt".|$|E
2500|$|He is also {{mentioned}} {{as being a}} bookbinder, although <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not bind the books himself. It {{has been suggested that}} Pynson at one time worked as an assistant to William Caxton-–whom he called [...] "my worshipful master" [...] in the introduction to his Canterbury Tales, 1492-–but this is now considered highly unlikely.|$|E
50|$|It has {{recently}} been realized that Titian completed a sacra conversazione by Palma, probably after his death; <b>he</b> had <b>probably</b> <b>done</b> the same for Giorgione after his death.

50|$|George O'Day {{was one of}} America's most {{brilliant}} sailors, having won a Gold Medal in the Olympics. He {{was the first to}} make downwind sailing an art.

She knew what should be her argument if she were determined to oppose her cousin's pleadings; and she knew also,--she thought she knew,--that she did intend to oppose them; {{but there was a}} coldness in the argument to which she was averse.

2500|$|Robert the Bruce {{did change}} sides between the Scots loyalists and the English {{more than once}} in the earlier stages of the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he never betrayed Wallace directly, and <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not fight on the English side at the Battle of Falkirk (although this claim does appear in a few medieval sources). [...] Later, the Battle of Bannockburn was not a {{spontaneous}} battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years. His title before becoming king was Earl of Carrick, not Earl of Bruce.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the pirate}} Gaspar {{is a popular}} figure in Florida folklore, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not exist. No {{contemporaneous}} records about his life or exploits {{have been found in}} Spain or Florida, and no physical artifacts linked to Gaspar have been discovered in the area where he supposedly established his [...] "pirate kingdom". The earliest mention of José Gaspar was in a 1900 promotional brochure for the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad Company, a part of Henry B. Plant's railroad system that ran to Plant's Boca Grande Hotel at Charlotte Harbor, near Gasparilla Island. Subsequent retellings of the legend are based upon this first fanciful account.|$|E
2500|$|Strabo {{says that}} Pytheas gave {{an account of}} [...] "what is beyond the Rhine as far as Scythia", which he, Strabo, thinks is false. In the geographers of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire, such as Ptolemy, Scythia {{stretches}} eastward {{from the mouth of}} the Vistula; thus Pytheas must have described the Germanic coast of the Baltic sea; if the statement is true, there are no other possibilities. As to whether he explored it in person, he said that he explored the entire north in person (see under Thule above). As the periplus was a sort of ship's log, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> reach the Vistula.|$|E

"Ill-natured in him to speak," [...] {{continued}} Mary, [...] "and {{to which}} it would be absurd for me to listen. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> the same to others," [...] she added, being unable in heart to forget that sharpest of her wounds, that flirtation of his with Patience Oriel; [...] "but to me it is almost cruel. Another girl might laugh at him, or listen to him, as she would choose; but I can do neither.

5000|$|Contemporary {{reviews of}} the work were not universally positive. Writing in the American New Republic magazine, George Soule {{expressed}} his disappointment in the book, writing that it [...] "puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory {{turned out to be}} a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly." [...] Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, [...] "It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not know very well".|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} cut of {{the film}} ran for slightly over two hours, and several scenes were cut out, including a scene which depicted an extended scene of Kerry and Rigg examining Troy's trap, where Kerry reveals to Rigg she has had nightmares about Eric, and she blames herself {{for what happened to}} him. Adam had more scenes in the original cut. A scene that showed Jigsaw regretting his actions was also cut. Bell said, [...] "I'm glad they cut that scene. This guy knows exactly what he's doing. Does he start off with a model, then refine it?

[...] When the Greek city of Miletus was sacked by the Persians in 494 BCE and then liberated by Athens in 476 BCE, over the next three centuries it was rebuilt on the grid plan, with Hippodamus [...] often called [...] "the father of European urban planning" [...] as the local originator of the rectilinear grid system for the city's center, a concept <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>did</b> not invent, but had heard about from elsewhere.

40|$|This review essay {{considers}} Jack Balkin’s {{two recent}} books, Living Originalism and Constitutional Redemption. It argues that Balkin’s theoretical contribution is substantial. His reconciliation of originalism and living constitutionalism is correct and should mark a real advance in constitutional theory and scholarship. Political considerations may, however, complicate its reception. Something like political considerations seem also to have complicated Balkin’s theory. He {{suggests that we}} may think of American constitutional history {{as an attempt to}} redeem the promises of the Declaration of Independence. I argue that the Reconstruction Amendments are a much more appropriate focus for redemption and speculate that Balkin chooses the Declaration instead because it has a universal appeal that the Reconstruction Amendments do not. But by making his theory consistent with our national mythology of a successful constitutional experiment—a mythology that slights the Civil War and Reconstriction—Balkin actually accedes to a political program <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>does</b> not endorse...|$|R
