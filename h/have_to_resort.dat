(Captain Joseph Dixon of the river {{batteries}} had been killed the previous day during Carondelets bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson {{would have to be}} carried by the army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck that he might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to a siege.|$|E

Thirty miles to the west, he established a mission at Turtle Mountain to serve as a base for expansion toward the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer should not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to reading summaries on the packaging {{to make sense of}} a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E

5|$|The general {{first degree}} (for Magister) centred on the {{teaching}} of philosophy, theology and Greek under the conservative Scholasticism which gave prime place {{to the authority of}} Aristotle. Although the trivium was now augmented by the quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music), their coverage was neglected in comparison with theology and philosophy and consequently Mercator would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to further study of the first three subjects in years to come. Mercator graduated Magister in 1532.|$|E

25|$|A second work of fiction, {{provisionally}} titled Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago, contains over 10,000 handwritten pages. Written after The Realms, {{it takes}} that epic's major characters—the seven Vivian sisters and their companion/secret brother, Penrod—and places them in Chicago, with the action unfolding {{during the same}} years {{as that of the}} earlier book. Begun in 1939, it is a tale of a house that is possessed by demons and haunted by ghosts, or has an evil consciousness of its own. Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house is clean. They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House.|$|E

25|$|In December 2012, Friedkin {{revealed}} that the film rights were in fact owned by Universal, as the Paramount lease had expired after 25 years. He also added he would meet Warner Bros., which, according to him, wanted a sublease. Additionally, {{he announced that he}} would be having a meeting with the head of Universal Studios Home Entertainment; if its outcome would be negative, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to the legal case. Friedkin also indicated that restoration of Sorcerer would require a considerable amount of work, stating that he does not possess any prints in good quality. Furthermore, he added that Paramount was responsible for creating one between the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, and he was trying to locate it, noting the difficulties related to obtaining the print as the studio no longer possesses an adequate capacity to deal with this matter and off-shore companies involved in the legal matters were now greatly reduced in staff and stated that is the reason why acquiring the film's print is a time-consuming process.|$|E
500|$|Weber, {{like his}} {{colleague}} Werner Sombart, regarded economic calculation {{and especially the}} double-entry bookkeeping method of business accounting, {{as one of the}} most important forms of rationalisation associated with the development of modern capitalism. Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs. Socialist intellectuals like Otto Neurath had realised that in a completely socialised economy, prices would not exist and central planners would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to in-kind (rather than monetary) economic calculation. According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of imputation (i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of capital goods).

500|$|However, {{seven of}} the judges {{endorsed}} the express limitation that a statute extending the life of Parliament beyond five years could not be passed using the Parliament Acts; a further five agreed with Lord Nicholls that the House of Commons could not [...] "do indirectly by two stages what the House [...] do directly in one stage" [...] by using the Parliament Acts to remove the express limitation and then enact legislation extending the life of Parliament, a restriction that was considered necessary to ensure {{the effectiveness of the}} express limitation. Lord Bingham was the only judge to explicitly reject the validity of this implied limitation, arguing that there were no reasons for preventing the alteration of the clause limiting the subject matter of full Acts of Parliament and that [...] "it cannot have been contemplated that if, however improbably, the Houses found themselves in irreconcilable deadlock on this point, the government should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to the creation of peers".|$|E

500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. [...] "On the whole it was voted good" [...] wrote Mawson of the meat, [...] "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters.

When Lewis is wrongly accused of taking some money from The Bistro, he plans to leave Weatherfield. Nicholls told White that Audrey feels awful that she too accused Lewis {{and it is a}} wake up call for her as she does trust him. The actress said Audrey still fancies Lewis and does not want to lose him again. Lewis and Audrey spend the night together and decide to keep their relationship a secret, especially from Audrey's family, as his [...] "past indiscretions still loom over them like a dark cloud". Nicholls said Audrey could be making a mistake, and added, [...] "You read this sort of thing in the papers all the time, women of a certain age being charmed by these men. I'd ask her to think about what she's doing." [...] A writer for Inside Soap said that Audrey and Lewis are very happy as they [...] "bask in the warmth of their revived romance." [...] However, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to sneaky measures to spend time together to avoid upsetting Audrey's family. When Audrey calls in sick at the salon to spend time with Lewis, Gail and David become concerned and check up on her. They see Lewis leaving her house and realise the pair are back together.|$|E

500|$|With {{favourable}} {{trade from}} the Soviet bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that Cuba was entering a [...] "Special Period in Time of Peace". Petrol rations were dramatically reduced, Chinese bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories performing non-essential tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors, firewood began {{being used for}} cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 hours a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open war, and that the country might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to subsistence farming. By 1992, Cuba's economy had declined by over 40% in under two years, with major food shortages, widespread malnutrition {{and a lack of}} basic goods. Castro hoped for a restoration of Marxism–Leninism in the USSR, but refrained from backing the 1991 coup in that country. When Gorbachev regained control, Cuba-Soviet relations deteriorated further and Soviet troops were withdrawn in September 1991. In December, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved as Boris Yeltsin abolished the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and introducing a capitalist multiparty democracy. Yeltsin despised Castro and developed links with the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation. Castro tried improving relations with the capitalist nations. He welcomed Western politicians and investors to Cuba, befriended Manuel Fraga and took a particular interest in Margaret Thatcher's policies in the UK, believing that Cuban socialism could learn from her emphasis on low taxation and personal initiative. He ceased support for foreign militants, refrained from praising FARC on a 1994 visit to Colombia and called for a negotiated settlement between the Zapatistas and Mexican government in 1995. Publicly, he presented himself as a moderate on the world stage.|$|E

He states that as a result, societies should strengthen their democratic institutions to keep these necessary evils from becoming as offensive to freedom and democracy as the threats they are meant to prevent.

Several countries have reportedly shown interest, but none have signed agreements. The cost of buying them would include shipping them out of Afghanistan themselves. If the MRAPs cannot be sold to allies, U.S. forces will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> to destroying the vehicles before they leave the country. The quantities of MRAPs have been ruled as [...] "in excess" [...] {{of the needs of}} the U.S. military and would cost $50,000 per vehicle to ship them out of the country, and they won't be given to the Afghan National Security Forces because they can't maintain them or operate their electronic systems.
