5|$|In AD 40, Caligula {{expanded}} the Roman Empire into Mauretania {{and made a}} significant attempt at expanding into Britannia – even challenging Neptune in his campaign. The conquest of Britannia was fully realized by <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amazings {{reputation}} {{had been}} for formulaic science fiction almost since it began, but White {{was able to bring}} the magazine to a higher standard than any other editor except Cele Goldsmith, and gave Amazing a respectable position in the field. <b>His</b> <b>successors</b> were not able to maintain the level of quality that he achieved.|$|E
5|$|In 1358, the Sakya viceregal regime {{installed}} by the Mongols in Tibet was overthrown in a rebellion by the Phagmodru myriarch Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen (1302–1364). The Mongol Yuan court {{was forced to}} accept him as the new viceroy, and Changchub Gyaltsen and <b>his</b> <b>successors,</b> the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, gained de facto rule over Tibet.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{a weekday}} mid-morning show {{broadcast}} from 09:00–12:00 midday on Today FM until 2014, it competed with RTÉ 2fm's Gerry Ryan (and <b>his</b> <b>successor</b> Ryan Tubridy), RTÉ Radio 1's Pat Kenny (and <b>his</b> <b>successor</b> Sean O'Rourke) and Newstalk's Tom Dunne (and <b>his</b> <b>successor</b> Pat Kenny).|$|R
5000|$|Kagame has not groomed {{anyone to}} be <b>his</b> <b>successor,</b> so there’s nothing that points to who <b>his</b> <b>successor</b> could or should be.|$|R
25|$|His {{retirement}} and {{the appointment of}} <b>his</b> <b>successor</b> were announced on January 14, 2011. Mark Leonard Bartchak, of the Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania, was named <b>his</b> <b>successor.</b>|$|R
5|$|Llywelyn Fawr and <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> {{made the}} church wealthy, giving it land. This {{was taken away}} {{at the time of}} the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 but the church survived. The priory was in decline before 1536 in any event, and had only the Prior and two other members at that time.|$|E
5|$|Practising as a stonemason, he {{also took}} {{on the role of}} architect, {{designing}} as well as building his projects. He {{was one of the last}} masters of Scottish Renaissance architecture, before new styles were imported by <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b> Alongside his professional career, he also served as a soldier and politician. He married three times but had no surviving children.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season saw Primus {{remain a}} regular {{member of the}} Portsmouth team under first Redknapp and then both <b>his</b> <b>successors,</b> Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. He scored his first Premier League goal at Crystal Palace on Boxing Day 2004. He scored again on Boxing Day in 2006, when grabbing two headed goals against West Ham United.|$|E
50|$|Several late-night hosts {{have cited}} Letterman's influence, {{including}} Conan O'Brien (<b>his</b> <b>successor</b> on Late Night), Stephen Colbert (<b>his</b> <b>successor</b> on The Late Show), Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers.|$|R
50|$|In January 2003, an All-Women Shortlist {{was made}} over <b>his</b> <b>successor.</b> <b>His</b> {{youngest}} daughter, Jane, was an firm favourite {{of becoming the}} next MP for Burnley, {{but she did not}} make the shortlist. In February 2004, Kitty Ussher was chosen as <b>his</b> <b>successor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mahmud died in 1075, having {{appointed}} {{his youngest}} son, Shabib, as <b>his</b> <b>successor.</b> However, <b>his</b> oldest son, Nasr, whose {{mother was the}} daughter of the Buyid emir Jalal al-Dawla, was recognised as <b>his</b> <b>successor.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was to have}} been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b> However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.|$|E
5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E
5|$|After his {{election}} to the prestigious bishopric of Glasgow in 1174, Jocelin would continue exerting influence on his home monastery. Jocelin brought one of his monks from the abbey, a man called Michael, who acted as Jocelin's chaplain while Bishop of Glasgow. He did not resign his position as abbot until after his consecration in 1175. Jocelin consecrated <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> as abbot, and continued to {{spend a great deal}} of time there. Moreover, he used his position as bishop to offer the monastery patronage and protection.|$|E
5000|$|His {{position}} as patriarch of Venice was {{unique in the}} fact that both his predecessor and <b>his</b> <b>successor</b> became pope. <b>His</b> <b>successor</b> as patriarch was Albino Luciani, who was elected Pope John Paul I in August 1978.|$|R
50|$|Louis, <b>his</b> <b>successor.</b>|$|R
25|$|Charles {{was overthrown}} by a revolt in 923, and <b>his</b> <b>successor,</b> Robert of Neustria, {{was killed by}} the Vikings in 923. <b>His</b> <b>successor,</b> Ralph, conceded the Bessin and Maine to Rollo shortly afterwards, the chronicler Flodoard tells us.|$|R
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the culmination of the 'Pax Romana'. <b>His</b> <b>successors</b> Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Casimir, who {{formally}} gave up {{his rights}} to several Silesian principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the House of Luxembourg (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the Gniezno Archdiocese by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> did not continue his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. <b>His</b> <b>successors,</b> Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the paucity of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned for only a short time or was never completed.|$|E

5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He {{is dressed in}} sombre colours and rendered in a more compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into the pictorial space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b> Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although {{he appears to be}} resting or asleep.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} {{his days in}} his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b> He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, his damnatio memoriae. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.|$|E
5|$|Justinian and <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> modernized {{frontier}} fortifications {{throughout the}} century. The example at Qasr ibn Wardan (564) {{in the desert}} of eastern Syria is particularly impressive, containing a governor's palace, barracks, and a church built with techniques and to plans possibly imported from Constantinople. The church dome is unusual in that the pendentives sprang from an octagonal drum, rather than the four main arches, and {{in that it was}} made of brick, which was rare in Syria.|$|E

5|$|Long's time as {{governor}} {{was described by}} historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. He proposed a number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women's voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women to sit on state boards. Most of these reforms were not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by <b>his</b> <b>successors.</b> He kept a busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II and <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> {{continued}} to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until {{the demise of}} the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century following World War 1. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had done before, and they {{continued to}} refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (Orthodox Christians) as Rûm. Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Ezra (chapter 6, verses 1 to 11) {{describes}} the decree to continue {{reconstruction of the}} Temple in Jerusalem, specifying financial support and supplies for the temple services. This decree is dated approximately 519 BCE. Between Cyrus and Darius, an exchange of letters with King Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes is described (chapter 4, verse 7), the grandson of Darius I, during whose reign Ezra and Nehemiah came to Jerusalem. The generous funding of the temple gave Darius and <b>his</b> <b>successors</b> {{the support of the}} Jewish priesthood.|$|E
