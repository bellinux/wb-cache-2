40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} pathological changes of photoreceptor layer and retinal pigment epithelium in eyes with <b>drusens</b> using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). Methods: Twenty-nine eyes of 29 patients with (<b>drusens)</b> dry age-related macular degeneration and 43 eyes of 43 controls were included in this study. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examination including SD-OCT. Central foveal thickness (CFT), photoreceptor layer (PRL) thickness and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) thickness were measured and compared between the groups. P value <  0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ranged between 20 / 20 and 20 / 200. RPE (36. 10  ±  5. 48  μm Vs 39. 27  ±  4. 30) and PRL thickness (53. 93  ±  7. 36  μm Vs 61. 20  ±  4. 50  μm) were significantly reduced in patients with <b>drusens</b> compared to controls. Increase in age was a significant risk factor for <b>drusens</b> (OR: 1. 22, p <  0. 001) and increased PRL thickness was a protective factor (OR: 0. 720, p =  0. 002). PRL thickness {{was significantly associated with}} BCVA (p =  0. 019). Conclusion: With an increased resolution of SD-OCT, the involvement of the outer retinal layers was more clearly defined. SD-OCT may allow for the early detection of exudative changes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to investi-gate the pathomorphological and {{functional}} variations of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a Chinese population using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This population-based study enrolled 59 patients (age,> 45 years; eyes, 70) with early and intermediate-stage AMD from Youyi Road Community, Baoshan District, Shanghai, China. Comprehensive standard-ized ophthalmic examinations included visual acuity, anterior segment analysis using a slit lamp, dilated fundus evaluation by direct ophthalmoscopy, 90 D handheld lens analysis, fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and fast optic disk scans using OCT. The macular CNV characteristic profiles in early and intermediate-stage AMD were deter-mined by OCT. Data were obtained on the first visit and the follow-up period ranged between 6 and 24 months, where FFA and OCT outcomes of early and intermediate-stage AMD patients were analyzed. Three profiles of early and interme-diate‑stage AMD were created from the OCT and FFA results, each with a different prognosis. Firstly, <b>drusens</b> with unclear boundaries and evident pigment proliferation, as well as hypofluorescence around the <b>drusens,</b> was observed via FFA. A slight small arch field located in the retinal pigment epithe-lium (RPE) /choriocapillary layer (CCL) was shown on OCT scans, indicating exudative AMD. Secondly, RPE detachments of> 1 pupillary distance, without CNV in the macular area, indicated geographic chorioretinitis atrophy. Finally, <b>drusens</b> with clear boundaries and few pigment proliferations and no certain surrounding fluorescence was observed via FFA, while a clear RPE/CCL band on the OCT scans indicated slow progress. The results {{of the present study}} demonstrated that combined OCT and FFA was the most efficient method for identifying CNV and diagnosing AMD. If the two techniques are not available concurrently, then OCT is a safer and more reliable technique to follow-up early and intermediate-stage AMD patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is {{the leading}} cause of blindness. DR results in retinal {{disorders}} that include: mi-croaneurysms, <b>drusens,</b> hard exudates and intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormalities (IRMA). The early signs of DR are depicted by microaneurysms among other signs. A prompt diagnosis when the disease is at the early stage can help prevent irreversible damages to the diabetic eye. This paper presents a decision support framework for automated screening of early signs of DR and classification schemes for deducing the presence or absence of microaneurysms are developed and tested under a univariate environment. The detection rule is based on binary hypothesis testing problem which simplifies the problem to yes/no decisions. An analysis of the performance of the Bayes optimality criteria is also presented in the paper. I...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drusen,</b> tiny accumulations of {{extracellular}} {{material that}} build {{up on the}} retina. While {{there is a tendency}} for <b>drusen</b> to be blamed for the progressive loss of vision, <b>drusen</b> deposits can be present in the retina without vision loss. Some patients with large deposits of <b>drusen</b> have normal visual acuity. If normal retinal reception and image transmission are sometimes possible in a retina when high concentrations of <b>drusen</b> are present, then, even if <b>drusen</b> can be implicated in the loss of visual function, there must be at least one other factor that accounts for the loss of vision.|$|E
50|$|AMD-like {{pathology}} {{begins with}} small yellow deposits (<b>drusen)</b> in the macula, between the {{retinal pigment epithelium}} and the underlying choroid.

People with <b>drusen</b> {{may or may not}} develop AMD, in fact the majority of people over age 60 have <b>drusen</b> with no negative effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the <b>drusen</b> are large and numerous and associated with disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft <b>drusen</b> are thought to be related to elevated cholesterol deposits.|$|E

40|$|A 69 -year-old lady {{presented}} with complaints of decreased vision in left eye since one month. Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was 6 / 18 in that eye. Fundus examination revealed non-central geographic atrophy and soft <b>drusens</b> at macula in both eyes. Temporal periphery of left eye revealed subretinal exudates with altered sub-RPE hemorrhage mimicking peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy (PEHCR). Fundus Fluorescein Angiogram showed window defects at macula and blocked fluorescence at temporal periphery in left eye. However, Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) revealed active peripheral choroidal polyps. The patient was successfully treated with intravitreal bevacizumab and ICGA-guided laser photocoagulation. 27 months after laser treatment, BCVA improved to 6 / 9. Rationale of consecutive anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment followed by more definitive laser photocoagulation is that anti-VEGF aids in resolution of subretinal fluid, thus making the polyp more amenable to focal laser photocoagulation which stabilizes the choroidal vasculature and prevents further leakage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In retinal image analysis, the {{detection}} of optic disk is of paramount importance. It facilitates the tracking of various anatomical features {{and also in the}} extraction of exudates, <b>drusens</b> etc., present in the retina of human eye. The health of retina crumbles with age in some people during the presence of exudates causing Diabetic Retinopathy. The existence of exudates increases the risk for age related macular Degeneration (AMRD) and it is the leading cause for blindness in people above the age of 50. A prompt diagnosis when the disease is at the early stage can help to prevent irreversible damages to the diabetic eye. Screening to detect diabetic retinopathy helps to prevent the visual loss. The optic disk detection is the rudimentary requirement for the screening. In this paper few methods for optic disk detection were compared which uses both the properties of optic disk and model based approaches. They are uniquely used to give accurate results in the retinal images...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Classification plays a {{major role}} in retinal image {{analysis}} for detecting the various abnormalities in retinal images. Classification refers to one of the mining concepts using supervised or unsupervised learning techniques. Approach: Diabetic retinopathy is one of the common complications of diabetes. Unfortunately, in many cases, the patient is not aware of any symptoms until it is too late for effective treatment. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy results in retinal disorders that include microaneursyms, <b>drusens,</b> hard exudates and intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormalities. Results: Automatic methods to detect various lesions associated with diabetic retinopathy facilitate the opthalmologists in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Abnormal retinal images fall into four different classes namely Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO), Choroidal Neo-Vascularization Membrane (CNVM) and Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR) [...] Conclusion: In this study, we have analysed the various methodologies for detecting the abnormalities in retinal images automatically along with their merits and demerits and proposed the new framework for detection of abnormalities using Cellular Neural Network (CNN) ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Drusen</b> were {{initially}} described by Franciscus Donders who called them [...] "Colloidkugeln" [...] (colloid spheres).

In some cases, <b>drusen</b> develop above the so-called pillars of the choriocapillaris that is the area between two micro vessels; although important variations are observed between different subtypes of AMD.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{automatic}} detection of pathologies in retina digital images offers a promising approach in clinicalapplications. This thesis employs the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to extract six statistical textural features from retina digital images. The statistical features are the mean, standard deviation, smoothness, third moment, uniformity, and entropy. The {{purpose is to}} classify normal and abnormal images. Five different pathologies are considered. They are Artery sheath (Coat’s disease), blot hemorrhage, retinal degeneration (circinates), age-related macular degeneration (<b>drusens),</b> and diabetic retinopathy (microaneurysms and exudates). Four classifiers are employed; including support vector machines (SVM), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), and probabilistic neural networks (PNN). For each experiment, ten random folds are generated to perform cross-validation tests. In order to assess {{the performance of the}} classifiers, the average and standard deviation of the correct recognition rate, sensitivity and specificity are computed for each simulation. The experimental results highlight two main conclusions. First, they show the outstanding performance of EMD over DWT with all classifiers. Second, they demonstrate the superiority of the SVM classifier over QDA, k-NN, and PNN. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed {{to reduce the number of}} features in hope to improve the accuracy of classifiers. We find that there is no general and significant improvement of the performance, however. In sum, the EMD-SVM system provides a promising approach for the detection of pathologies in digital retina...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} profile of age related macular {{degeneration}} Material and Methods In a cross-sectional, prospective study 164 eyes of 100 ARMD patients were taken up for evaluation. Relevant clinical examination and FFA was done. Patients of wet ARMD were taken for OCT. Instruments used were Direct Ophthalmoscope (Heinz) slit lamp biomicroscope (Zeiss), Fundus camera (Zeiss) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (Zeiss). Observation Out of 100 patients 63 were male and 37 were females. 64 patients had bilateral involvement while as 36 patients had unilateral involvement at presentation. 35 patients were in {{the age group of}} 61 to 65 yrs. 95 % of patients presented with the symptom of diminution of vision. 26 % of patients had associated systemic ailments, 29. 88 % of patients had a visual acuity of < 6 / 60. On FFA, 82. 32 % (135 eyes) were having non exudative (dry) ARMD and 17. 68 % (29 eyes) had exudative (wet) ARMD. In dry ARMD 95. 55 % had <b>drusens</b> and only 4. 44 % had geographic atrophy. Out of 29 eyes of wet ARMD,on FFA, 17 eyes 58. 62 % had classic CNV, Two eyes (6. 9 %) had occult CNV and 10 (34. 48 %) had serous PED. OCT findings suggested classic CNV in 17 eyes (58. 62 %), occult CNV in 4 eyes (13. 79 %) and serous PED in 8 eyes (27. 58 %) Conclusion ARMD is usually a bilateral condition affecting mostly in the early 5 th decade. Dry ARMD is commoner than wet ARMD. FFA is the golden tool for screening wet ARMD. OCT is more specific in detecting early sub- retinal neo vascular membrane...|$|R
