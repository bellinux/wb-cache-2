5|$|Mo Tae-bum {{was born}} in Seoul to father Mo Yeong-yeol and mother Jeong Yeon-hwa in 1989. He has one elder sister, Mo Eun-yeong. Mo started skating when his father {{suggested}} it {{while he was in}} third grade at Eunseok Elementary School. His participation in the school skating team led him to win a cup from rival Lila Elementary School, which had dominated the age group at that time. Since then, Mo has been a close friend to Lee Seung-hoon, a fellow speed skater who also won a silver and a gold medal from the 2010 Winter Olympics. As Mo grew older, he almost gave up skating but, after three years of indecision, he decided against giving <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of his mother. Mo and his family currently live in the city of Pocheon, Gyeonggi province.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second-and-nine at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a 20-yard pass to Oxendine for a first down at the Tech 40-yard line. Parker ran for three yards, but Tech was forced to call a timeout before the next play. During the timeout, a light rain began to fall that would last through {{the remainder of the}} game. Coming out of the timeout, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, but made <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next play by rushing for 16 yards, picking up a first down at the 41-yard line of Nebraska. This was followed by another rush by Druckenmiller, this time for nine yards. The two gains were negated on the next play, however, as Virginia Tech committed a penalty that pushed the Hokies back to their 41-yard line. Druckenmiller then threw two incomplete passes, and Tech was forced to punt.|$|E
25|$|Southerton was {{involved}} in an unusual incident during the Surrey County Cricket Club v Marylebone Cricket Club match at the Kennington Oval in 1870. Southerton cut a ball hard to W.G.

Nobody except Southerton thought he was out, but he walked away, and when recalled, refused to come back.|$|E

25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic.

25|$|The Constitution {{was passed}} by the Imperial Parliament, and came into effect on 1 January 1901. However, the High Court was not {{established}} immediately; it was necessary for the new Parliament of Australia to make laws about the structure and procedure of the court. Some {{of the members of the}} First Parliament, including Sir John Quick, then one of the leading legal experts in Australia, opposed legislation to set up the court. Even H. B. Higgins, who was himself later appointed to the court, objected to setting <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that it would be impotent while Privy Council appeals remained, and that in any event there was not enough work for a federal court to make it viable.|$|E
25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting {{at the end of}} the session was also manual, with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the on-hook state and end the call.|$|E

25|$|Graden {{sent the}} film on a VHS to several {{industry}} executives in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the clip and put <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, where it {{became one of}} the very first viral videos. As Jesus vs. Santa became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series. Fox refused to pick up the series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two were initially skeptical of possible television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out successful. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids' show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned the development of the show into a series.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 1918, Lt. Hamilton led {{his flight}} {{on a special}} mission against Varssenaere aerodrome. He dropped four bombs from 200 feet on some {{aeroplane}} hangars, making two direct hits and causing {{a large amount of}} damage. He then machine gunned the German officers' billets and made four circuits of the aerodrome, shooting up various targets. On the first circuit, he destroyed one EA on the ground which burst into flames when he shot <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> third circuit he repeated this performance, setting afire another Fokker biplane. His dash and skill very materially helped in the success of the operation. In addition this officer destroyed a Fokker biplane over Armentières on 7 August 1918. On 12 July he brought down two EA in flames and on two other occasions has driven down out of control enemy machines. He is an excellent patrol leader.|$|E
25|$|Australia now {{had three}} and a half days to set England an {{unreachable}} target and bowl them out. Ken Archer ran a four off Alec Bedser in the first over and Arthur Morris struck two boundaries off Doug Wright when he replaced John Warr in the sixth over. Archer called Morris for a run off Bedser, but they both hesitated in the middle and Morris was run out for 16 by a left-handed throw from David Sheppard. Lindsay Hassett was almost bowled first ball, but survived and Australia were 34/1 at stumps. Archer (32) and Hassett (31) returned in the morning to take the score along to 95/3, but it was Neil Harvey (68), Keith Miller (99) and debutant Jim Burke (101 not out) who put the match beyond doubt. Harvey and Miller ran the bowling ragged and added 99 for the fourth wicket until Harvey was bowled by Brown (1/14) and Miller chopped a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Doug Wright (2/109) and Roy Tattersall (1/116) were heavily punished and Bedser (0/62) was wicketless. Australia ended the fourth day 384 runs ahead and that evening Freddie Brown and Brigadier Green were hospitalised after a car crash returning from dinner with Sir Willoughby Norrie, the Governor of South Australia. A car had pulled out suddenly from a side street and Brown swerved into a post for holding electric tram lines. Brown left the hospital early in the morning, but was unfit to play and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional captain to lead England since Jack Hobbs when Arthur Carr was injured in 1924–25. He was unable to prevent Jim Burke from making a Test century on debut, the ninth Australian to do so (compared to 10 Englishmen at the time). John Warr took his first and only Test wicket when Ian Johnson cut the ball to Evans, who knocked <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first attempt then ran forward to catch it on the rebound. Umpire Cocks took so long to make a decision that Johnson walked (almost unheard in Australia) to give the long-suffering Warr his first Test wicket and a bowling average of 281.00, the highest by an England bowler. The 12th man Sam Loxton was sent out by Hassett to tell Burke that he could take all the time he wanted over his hundred and the dour stock clerk reached his target after 245minutes at the crease. Hassett then declared at 403/8 to give England {{a day and a half}} to make 503 to win.|$|E

25|$|The team's winning ways {{continued}} at Paris–Nice in March. Goss won the field sprint finish to stage 3, after narrowly missing {{a victory in}} stage 2, maneuvering around riders who fell after 's Peter Sagan crashed on the course's final sharp turn. In the mountainous stage 5, Martin finished with the first group {{on the road to}} assume fourth place {{at the end of the}} day, ten seconds down on race leader Andreas Klöden. This was an advantageous position with the stage 6 individual time trial to come; Martin was viewed as a favorite for the time trial. The next day, Martin handily won the time trial, with only five riders finishing within a minute of his winning time. He took the race lead, with a 36-second lead over Klöden in the overall standings. His advantage largely held steady over the last two days, giving him the overall race crown. The team won the flat first stage of the Volta a Catalunya, but not in the manner by which they regularly win flat stages. New acquisition Smukulis made the morning breakaway and had it stick to the finish. Last shedding former teammate Ben Gastauer of , Smukulis soloed to victory 28 seconds ahead of the charging peloton. It was his first professional victory, and he was visibly emotional as he crossed the finish line. He held the race lead for a second day before giving <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high mountain stage 3, as he lost nearly 17 minutes that day. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Albasini won the mountains classification thanks to back-to-back nearly day-long efforts in the breakaways in stages 4 and 5. Also, Martin won the time trial which closed out the event, again besting Klöden, though this time the elder German was the overall race winner. The team was successful on two fronts at the Tour of California. Van Garderen showed solid climbing legs on the race's two summit finishes. Though he was more than a minute back of the stage winner both days, he was well better than the majority of the field, including all his rivals for the youth classification. He won the award at the end of the race by almost six minutes over 's Andrew Talansky. The last stage featured a group sprint finish. Where their leadout train had been outmaneuvered by 's earlier in the race, this time Goss was successfully delivered to the line first. Van Garderen's final overall placing was fifth. Degenkolb and Albasini both found their way into the winner's circle at Bayern-Rundfahrt. First, Degenkolb edged out fellow young German sprinter Marcel Kittel in the finish to stage 2. Albasini won a breakaway sprint the next day, best of a nine-man group. This win gave him the race lead for a day, and he held on to finish on the event's final podium in third place.|$|E

500|$|One well-received {{number was}} [...] "Keep It Gay", a song which in {{rehearsal}} {{had been assigned}} to several different performers before ending with Bob. The song was liked in part due to the novelty of its setting: it begins with Bob singing from the light bridge high above the stage; following a blackout the internal play performers take <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage below, and following another blackout, the performers are seen in their workout clothes, at a rehearsal some weeks later. Hammerstein gave credit for the scene to Mielziner, and suggested that it demonstrated one way in which the book had affected the music.|$|E

On the night of their graduation, they keep their promise and get together to open the [...] "wish box". As they start talking again, they remember their old wishes while burying the box: Mimi wanted to travel to California, Lucy wanted to find the mother she cannot remember, and Kit wanted to get married. Mimi brings up the topic of going to Los Angeles for a record contract audition. Kit and Lucy try to convince Mimi to not {{go all the way to}} Los Angeles due to the fact that she's pregnant and anything dangerous can happen. However the next morning they decide to go together but each doing something separate; Mimi going to the audition, Kit visiting her fiancé and Lucy to see her mother in Tucson, Arizona.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Damon's {{performance}} in the episode. A television reviewer from The Sacramento Bee noted that Damon [...] "did a well-publicized (and very good) gig" [...] on the show. [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented that Damon was [...] "incredibly charming" [...] and funny. Matt Roush of TV Guide, in review of season four, said: [...] "If it weren't for some inspired guest stars — Matt Damon as a straight guy bluffing his way into a gay chorus, Michael Douglas as a gay detective clowning <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dance floor, Glenn Close as a lusty photographer groping both Will and Grace during a shoot — this season would be an awfully sad misfire." [...] Wales on Sundays Wil Marlow called Damon's performance {{one of the most}} memorable guest appearances in the history of the show, and commented that he [...] "held his own well against serial scene-stealer Sean Hayes." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald said the episode [...] "flies with jokes predicated on stereotypes and sexual innuendo", but [...] "Damon is a good sport with all the silliness, though, and seems more at ease here in the sitcom than he has in his last three films." [...] Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, said Damon was [...] "magnificent" [...] in the episode and a [...] "great experience" [...] for the cast of the show. Sean Hayes cites [...] "A Chorus Lie" [...] as one of his favorite episodes. In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Damon's guest spot as their number two most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E
