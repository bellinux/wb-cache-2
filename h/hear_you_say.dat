500|$|R. Kelly, portraying [...] "The Remix Killer", {{released}} an unofficial remix {{of the song}} in April 2008. During most of his section of the song, Kelly sings of shining, drinking and two-stepping in a club, and he promises to kiss any place on Mariah's body she wants: [...] "Girl, if you let me, I'm gonna touch it / But if I touch it, I'm gonna wanna hit it." [...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that want me to touch her body / Touch it / Let me <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> 'I-i-i-i do.'" [...] According to Kelly, the remix is unofficial, and his lyrics are freestyle rap.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has gained}} {{attention}} {{due to its}} explicit lyrics. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker", during the song [...] "a slew of f-bombs" [...] can be heard, and varied graphic descriptions such as: [...] "You got your legs {{up in the sky}} with the devil in your eyes / Let me <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you want it all" [...] and the chorus [...] "You and me, baby, making love like gorillas!". Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor. On September 11, 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that Dannielle Miller, co-founder of Enlighten Education, decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban [...] "Gorilla", due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a short call-and-response audio clip from The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour as Beyoncé asks the crowd [...] "Lemme <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'Hayyy Ms. Carter!'". It then {{transitions}} into what Andrew Hampp of Billboard magazine called the [...] "lady thug anthem" [...] of [...] "Yoncé". Beyoncé delivers half-rapped verses on {{the first half of}} the song, in which the female protagonist teases male subjects in a club as she turns heads. In the first verse, she warns the other women in the club, [...] "Every girl on here gotta look me up and down / All on Instagram cake by the pound". The singer adds on the second verse, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker." [...] "Yoncé" [...] closes with the bridge as Beyoncé sings repeatedly, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor", while an ascending siren echoes over a staccato bass that hits heavily and uniformly in the background.|$|E
500|$|According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyoncé's vocals on {{the song}} are layered, making them sound like [...] "a harem of Beyoncé's {{warbling}} for the affections of some sultan of swing." [...] According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist {{in the song}} sings about her [...] "potential {{to turn on the}} filth." [...] Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This [...] "lustful sexual confidence" [...] is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: [...] "I'm feeling sexy / Wa <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> my name, boy/ If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / I might just take you home with me" [...] and the chorus lines: [...] " [...] Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / I know you want my body." [...] Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I'd love to love you, baby" [...] almost whispering as stated by Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic.|$|E
