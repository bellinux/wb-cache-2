5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E

For example, charitable contributions by trusts, and all <b>deductions</b> <b>of</b> partnerships (and S corporations in the U.S.) are deductible by member beneficiaries or partners (or S corporation shareholders) in a manner appropriate to the deduction and the member, such as itemized deductions for charitable contributions or a component of net business profits for business expenses.|$|R

If the taxpayer has miscellaneous itemized <b>deductions</b> <b>of</b> $5,000, the taxpayer may deduct $3,000 ($5,000-$2,000=$3,000). If the taxpayer has miscellaneous itemized <b>deductions</b> <b>of</b> only $1,000, the taxpayer {{will not be able}} to deduct anything because their deductions do not exceed the $2,000 (2%) floor.|$|R

25|$|A {{common use}} of waveplates—particularly the sensitive-tint (full-wave) and quarter-wave plates—is in optical mineralogy.

25|$|Zero coupon bonds {{were first}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s, {{but they did not}} become popular until the 1980s. The use of these instruments was aided by an anomaly in the US tax system, which allowed for <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> the discount on bonds relative to their par value. This rule ignored the compounding of interest and led to significant tax-savings when the interest is high or the security has long maturity. Although the tax loopholes were closed quickly, the bonds themselves are desirable because of their simplicity.|$|E

25|$|The cap is {{actively}} policed and penalties for clubs {{found to have}} breached the NRL salary cap regulations include fines of lesser of half the amount involved or $500,000 and/or <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> premiership points. For example, six clubs were fined for minor infractions in 2003. These infractions are usually technical in nature, and can sometimes be affected by third-party factors such as loss of sponsorship revenue affecting an allowance. During the 2007 season the NRL implemented ways of creating a fair and more beneficial cap for players and clubs.|$|E

They then received their weapons (and in later years also their uniforms) for which they had to reimburse their captains by a <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> their wages.|$|E

In the tandem passes, the lead driver (in the lead car, Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi), however in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in <b>deduction</b> <b>of</b> points.|$|E
