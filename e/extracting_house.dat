40|$|This paper {{shows that}} housing wealth helps {{alleviate}} credit constraints for potential entrepreneurs by enabling home owners to extract equity from their property and invest {{it in their}} business. Using a large U. S. individual-level survey dataset for the 1996 – 2006 period, we find that a 10 % increase in home equity raises the share of individuals who transition into self-employment each year from 1 % to 1. 07 %. Our results persist when we use proxies for aggregate housing demand shocks and for the topological elasticity of housing supply to generate variation in home equity that is orthogonal to entrepreneurial choice. (JEL G 21, L 26) In this paper, we identify the effect of housing wealth on new business creation by exploiting the exogenous variation in home equity induced by the U. S. housing boom of the late 1990 s and early to mid- 2000 s. Using a uniquely suited individual-level dataset of U. S. home owners and renters, we investigate how changes in home equity affect the probability of becoming an entrepreneur. This allows us to study whether nascent entrepreneurs are deterred by credit constraints and whether the ability to <b>extract</b> <b>housing</b> wealth by increasing their mortgage helps them to overcome these constraints.

40|$|SUMMARY: Specific {{immunotherapy}} (SIT) {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} treatment of allergic diseases. However, the mechanisms by which SIT achieves clinical improvement remained unclear. We decided to study the in vivo kinetics of this therapy, using a nuclear medicine approach (leukocytes labelled with 99 mTc-HMPAO) in patients on maintenance doses of specific immu-notherapy with confirmed clinical efficacy. Material and methods: We studied 13 allergic patients grouped according to different treatment schedules: subcutaneous aqueous allergenic extract (3 latex and 2 hymenoptera venom), subcutaneous depot <b>extract</b> (2 <b>house</b> dust mite and 2 pollens), subcutaneous modified allergens (2 pollens), sublingual <b>extract</b> (2 <b>house</b> dust mites). The control group included two allergic patients submitted to subcutaneous injections of bacterial extract (1 patient- positive control), and aqueous solution (1 patient) At {{the same time that the}} therapeutic allergen was administered subcutaneously, the autologous labelled white cells were injected intravenously in a peripheral vein in the contralateral arm. A thoracic dynamic acquisition of 60 mins, 64 x 64 matrix, 2 frame/min, in anterior view was performed. Static acquisition for 256 x 256 matrix, during 5 mins each at 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 mins after the administration of the radiolabelled leukocytes, in thoracic (anterior and posterior), and abdominal view were performed. During the examination, the local erythema was monitored. A similar procedure was undertaken for sublingual administration of immunotherapy.

CONCLUSIONS: For the subcutaneous route of administration, except for glutaraldehyde-modified allergen, the local inflammatory activity at the allergenic injection site was significantly higher in depth and was time dependent, maintaining activity even after complete disappearance of the erythema and/or wheal.

There are, however, few prospective data in support. We aimed to examine this relationship in a representative cohort of children born in Ashford, Kent (UK). Methods: 625 children (94 % of those eligible) were followed from birth to the age of 5. 5 years at which time 552 underwent skin prick testing to <b>extracts</b> of <b>house</b> dust mite and cat fur allergens. Maternal reports of wheeze in the last year were collected by interview. These outcomes were related to individual domestic concentrations of Der p 1 and Fel d I allergens estimated from dust collection at the age of 8 weeks. Results: 10 % of children were sensitised to house dust mite or cat at age 5. 5 years; 7 % had atopic wheeze. No significant relationships between allergen exposure and either sensitisation or wheeze were found but, on examination, the exposure-response relationships for both allergens and for each outcome rose steeply at low levels of exposure and were attenuated at high levels of exposure. These patterns were modified by paternal atopy and by birth order. Conclusions: There are no linear relationships between early allergen exposure and the induction of childhood respiratory allergy; rather, the risks of IgE sensitisation and asthma rise at very low levels of exposure and are attenuated thereafter.
