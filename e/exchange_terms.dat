5000|$|In 1916, G. N. Lewis {{proposed}} that a chemical bond forms by {{the interaction of}} two shared bonding electrons, with the representation of molecules as Lewis structures. In 1927 the Heitler - London theory was formulated which {{for the first time}} enabled the calculation of bonding properties of the hydrogen molecule H2 based on quantum mechanical considerations. Specifically, Walter Heitler determined how to use Schrödinger's wave equation (1926) to show how two hydrogen atom wavefunctions join together, with plus, minus, and <b>exchange</b> <b>terms,</b> to form a covalent bond. He then called up his associate Fritz London and they worked out the details of the theory {{over the course of the}} night. [...] Later, Linus Pauling used the pair bonding ideas of Lewis together with Heitler-London theory to develop two other key concepts in VB theory: resonance (1928) and orbital hybridization (1930). According to Charles Coulson, author of the noted 1952 book Valence, this period marks the start of [...] "modern valence bond theory", as contrasted with older valence bond theories, which are essentially electronic theories of valence couched in pre-wave-mechanical terms.
