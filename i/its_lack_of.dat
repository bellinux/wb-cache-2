5|$|Critics {{generally}} praised F-Zero X for its fast gameplay, {{abundance of}} courses and vehicles, track design, {{and maintaining a}} high framerate. However, the game has been widely criticized for <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> graphical detail.|$|E

5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. He noted <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence {{argued that it}} was a distinct and separate species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and gave it the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Critchlow {{was also}} commended for the risky {{decision}} to write, draw and publish the comic himself. The comic was compared favourably with professional quality comics, with <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> adverts {{viewed as an}} advantage over those offerings. The high production values were also praised, with the glossy cover and high quality paper used for the inner pages.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argued that}} the {{confusing}} format of The Million Second Quiz, along with <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> drama and technical issues with the show's app during {{the first days of}} the series, caused viewers to lose interest in watching it on air. Although peaking at 6.52 million viewers for its premiere, ratings steadily dropped during the show's run before rising again near the finale.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{critical}} {{or commercial}} success {{in its original}} release, The Wiz became a cult classic, especially because it features Michael Jackson's only starring theatrical film role. With Lena Horne's death in 2010, Diana Ross is the only living cast member of the film.|$|E
5|$|Igman was {{included}} in the Sarajevo bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Despite Sarajevo being the only previous host city to bid, it was largely regarded as the weakest bid, primarily due to <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure after the war.|$|E

5|$|Iridium in bulk {{metallic}} form is not biologically {{important or}} hazardous to health due to <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> reactivity with tissues; {{there are only}} about 20parts per trillion of iridium in human tissue. Like most metals, finely divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.|$|E
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (<b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball {{received}} generally positive reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's transposition of the Metroid series into a pinball video game, but criticized <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> variety.

The Southern Rhodesian parliament unanimously moved to support Britain in the event of war during a special sitting on 28 August 1939.|$|E
5|$|The Dream was {{released}} to mostly positive reception. While the Dream was praised for its solid and robust hardware design, {{the introduction of}} the Android operating system was met with criticism for <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> certain functionality and third-party software in comparison to more established platforms, but was still considered to be innovative due to its open nature, notifications system, and heavy integration with Google's services.|$|E
5|$|The early Spectrum models' {{great success}} as a games {{platform}} came in spite of <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> built-in joystick ports, primitive sound generation, and colour support that was optimised for text display: the hardware limitations of the platform required a particular level of creativity from video game designers.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} a major {{commercial}} failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release. Despite this, it was generally well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. Criticism was leveled against <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity.|$|E
5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and <b>its</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition.
