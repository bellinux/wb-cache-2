Organizational innovation is actually one of the significant factors that can affect the <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality of the organization. This paper describes the development of Innovative <b>Internal</b> <b>Service</b> Quality (IISQ) Model in measuring the influence of organizational innovation (based on its three main determinants) towards <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality (reliability, responsiveness, tangibles, assurance and empathy) in MBKS while gender acts as the moderating factor. The paper examines three main determinants of organizational innovation (innovation leadership, managerial levers and business processes) which can affect the <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality of an organization as well as describes how those three determinants affect the <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality. It will help to provide future researchers with literature in studying the influence of organizational innovation towards <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} examine the {{influence}} of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality (ISQ) on job performance in the public sector. Data was collected from 250 police personnels in PDRM in Kuching using survey method with questionnaire as the main tool. The instrument used to measure <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality was assessed via Kang et al. ’s (2002) 22 -item uni-dimensional measure of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality battery (ISQB). Job performance was measured using an instrument developed by Borman & Motowidlo (1993). Results of the instrument's Cronbach Alpha measurement showed that the score of reliability is above 0. 70 which indicates an acceptable level. The results indicate that <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality is positively correlated with job performance. This study provides insights {{on the relationship between}} <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality and job performance in the public sector. The findings of this study may help the public sector to enhance its <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality and its effect on job performance.

40|$|Measurement {{of quality}} is an {{important}} area within the services sector. To date, most attempts at measurement have focussed on how external clients perceive the quality of services provided by organisations. Although recognising that relationships between providers within a service environment are important, {{little research has been}} conducted into the identification and measurement of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality. This research focuses on the measurement of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality dimensions in the complex service environment of an <b>internal</b> healthcare <b>service</b> chain. The concept of quality in healthcare continues to develop as various provider, patient and client, governmental, and insurance groups maintain an interest in how to 'improve' the quality of healthcare service management and delivery. This research is based in healthcare as a major area within the service sector. The service environment in a large hospital is complex, with multiple interactions occurring internally; health is a significant field of study from both technical and organisational perspectives providing specific prior research that may be used as a basis for, and extension into service quality; and the implications of not getting service delivery right in healthcare in terms of costs to patients, families, community, and the government are significant. There has been considerable debate into the nature, dimensionality, and measurement of service quality. The five dimensions of SERVQUAL (tangibles, assurance, reliability, responsiveness, and empathy) have become a standard for evaluations of service quality in external service encounters, although these have been challenged in the literature. As interest in <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality has grown, a number of researchers have suggested that external service quality dimensions apply to <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality value chains irrespective of industry. However, this transferability has not been proven empirically. This research examines the nature of service quality dimensions in an <b>internal</b> healthcare <b>service</b> network, how these dimensions differ from those used in external service quality evaluations, and how different groups within the <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> network evaluate service quality, using both qualitative and quantitative research. Two studies were undertaken. In the first of these, interviews with staff from four groups within an <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> chain were conducted. Using dimensions established through qualitative analysis of this data, Study Two then tested these dimensions through data collected in a survey of staff in a major hospital. This research confirms the hierarchical, multidirectional, and multidimensional nature of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality. The direct transferability of external quality dimensions to <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality evaluations is only partially supported. Although dimension labels are similar to those used in external studies of service quality, the cross-dimensional nature of a number of these attributes and their interrelationships needs to be considered before adopting external dimensions to measure <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality. Unlike in previous studies, equity has also been identified as an important factor in <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality evaluations. Differences in service expectations between groups in the <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> chain, and differentiation of perceptions of dimensions used to evaluate others from those perceived used in evaluations by others were found. This has implications on formulation of future <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality instruments. For example, the expectations model of service quality is currently the dominant approach to conceptualising and developing service quality instruments. This study identifies a number of problems in developing instruments that consider differences in expectations between internal groups. Difficulty in evaluating the technical quality of <b>services</b> provided in <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> chains is also confirmed. The triadic nature of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality evaluations in <b>internal</b> healthcare <b>service</b> chains and the problems associated with transferring the traditional dyadic measures of service quality are identified. The relationships amongst <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> workers and patients form these triads, with patient outcomes a significant factor in determining overall <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality, independent of technical quality. This thesis assists in supporting the development of measurement tools more suited to <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> chains, and will provide a stronger and clearer focus on overall determinants of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality, with resultant managerial implications for managerial effectiveness...|$|R

This {{is achieved by}} evaluating the perceptions and expectations of the production department {{with regards to the}} service quality provided by the maintenance department of a South African motor vehicle manufacturer.

A positivist approach has been adopted in conducting this research. There are two main hypotheses for this study: the first hypothesis is concerned with the relationship between the overall <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality and the five dimensions of service quality namely: tangibles, empathy, reliability, responsiveness and reliability. The second hypothesis focuses on the relationship between the front line staff segments of the production department and the five dimensions of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality. The results of this research suggest that the perceptions and expectations of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> customer segments {{plays a major role in}} achieving <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study to {{investigate}} <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality (as perceived by employees) and external (customer) perceptions of quality in the context of service profit chain (SPC). Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality on students’ perceptions of quality and to test the significance of a direct link between <b>internal</b> and external <b>service</b> quality. Methods: We measured the perceived service quality using a SERVPERF instrument and the multilevel modeling approach with HLM 7. 01. Results: The empirical findings support a link between perceptions of <b>internal</b> and external <b>service</b> quality. We show that when employees (faculty) perceive university services as being of high quality, it has a positive spill-over effect on students’ overall perceptions of the quality of university <b>services.</b> Perceptions of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality are also positively related to students’ perceptions of reliability, responsiveness and quality assurance. Conclusions: The perceptions of <b>internal</b> <b>service</b> quality by faculty members are positively related to students’ perceptions of quality. Comparing the levels of <b>internal</b> and external <b>service</b> quality will help managers define priorities for allocating resources to improve quality...|$|R
