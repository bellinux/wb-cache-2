5|$|The Chinese company Norinco {{has made}} an effort to {{reproduce}} this firearm. The Norinco 97 is an almost exact copy of the Winchester 1897, produced in both Trench and Riot grades, yet lacking in the <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> of the originals.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of wool {{as a primary}} fabric choice for men's outer garments led to a revolution in tailoring that allowed <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> {{to be of the}} utmost importance as opposed to ornamentation. This revolution allowed for an idealized classical silhouette to be materialized in men's fashion.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Aura also marked a new interior direction for Saturn, moving to a more European-style interior. The design of the {{interior of}} the Aura differed from that of the Ion, which was highly criticized. On the upscale XR model, the interior came with an option for saddle leather and paddle shifters, as well as an option for back seat radio controls. Despite being praised for its design and <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish,</b> the Aura's interior was criticized for using cheap materials.|$|E
50|$|Sporting {{rifles and}} {{shotguns}} were re-manufactured in Russia from surplus rifles after the Mosin-Nagant was adopted into service. These firearms {{can be found}} as ornately engraved, well <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finished</b> custom sporting rifles, intended for the Russian ruling class, or can be just simple unadorned shotguns.|$|R
2500|$|On Tuesday, October 3, 1899, {{the gates}} on the lock were {{installed}} and properly adjusted, the valves in place, and the miter sills (under the lock gates) <b>fitted</b> <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> touches {{placed on the}} lock. [...] Pilings had been driven on the shore end of the permanent dam, {{as well as for}} the revetment to protect the riverbank from erosion above and below the dam. [...] The river was routed through the lock so that work on the permanent dam could be completed.|$|R

25|$|The {{exterior}} <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> of the Heathkit enclosures was {{not always}} quite up {{to the standards of}} factory-built products, but a Heathkit amplifier, for instance, did not look out of place in a living room. The technical characteristics of many Heathkits were good. The ordinary consumer would, of course, buy a factory-built phonograph from the likes of RCA; but an audiophile, who was serious enough to assemble a system from individual components, frequently gave serious consideration to Heathkit products (for example, the AR15 and AR1500 receivers).|$|E
25|$|Ernie Ball Music Man {{improved}} their visibility in the guitar {{market with a}} succession of new guitar models, largely player-endorsed, including the Silhouette (1986), Steve Morse Signature (1987), Eddie Van Halen Signature/Axis model (1990), Albert Lee Signature (1993), Steve Lukather Signature (1993), the John Petrucci 6 & 7-string guitars (1999). They also introduced a series of new electric bass models, including the StingRay 5 (1987), the Sterling Bass (1993) and the Bongo Bass (2003) (the futuristic look of which was designed {{in conjunction with the}} BMW DesignworksUSA team). While none of these could compete against Fender or Gibson on sales figures, Music Man outpaced the competition by making 'players' guitars with quick change pickup assemblies, Teflon coated truss-rods, low noise pickup designs, piezo bridge pickups, 5 and 6 bolt necks, sculpted neck joints, graphite acrylic resin coated body cavities and most importantly, consistently high quality <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{remote control}} version, {{identified}} by the 'NAIT 3R' designation, was released in 1995. The [...] can be upgraded to 'R' specification by adding a separate remote control board. Ian White said its construction, <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> and performance/cost ratio made it a price-point leader.|$|E
50|$|On {{his return}} to racing, Shangamuzo was matched against Buckskin in two races which were {{expected}} to decide {{the identity of the}} best staying horse in Europe. In the Doncaster Cup, Shangamuzo appeared less than fully <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finished</b> third behind Buckskin and Billion. In October, Shangamuzo and Buckskin met for the final time in the Jockey Club Cup at Newmmarket. There appeared to be no excuses for Shangamuzo on this occasion as he proved no match for his rival and was beaten eight lengths into second place.|$|R

It also provides commercial <b>fit</b> out <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> services. In July 2010 the company re-launched the Muralplast brand of coatings <b>and</b> protective <b>finishes.</b> In September 2015 the company opened The Lucas Innovation Centre, a creative space {{making use of}} touch-screen technologies to inspire the design of new <b>fit</b> out <b>and</b> <b>finishing</b> solutions. In February 2017 it launched Lucas Breathe, a protective treatment for stone and concrete surfaces that reacts with sunlight, activating a catalytic reaction with pollutants in the air, turning them into harmless trace elements which disperse naturally.

500|$|For the Lexus LS, the Tahara plant {{developed}} new molds {{and enhanced}} assembly techniques and instituted measures aimed at increasing {{the precision of}} the sedan's <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish.</b> The 1989 LS 400 became the first production automobile to receive extensive laser welding, allowing for seamless steel welds. A large sheet metal press was developed to reduce or eliminate panel gaps by stamping large sections whole instead of singly. Separately installed parts, such as exterior lights, were also spring-loaded for a tighter fit. On the LS 400, engineers reduced door panel gaps in half versus Toyota-brand vehicles, from , with measurements made within on the LS 430, measurement margins were increased tenfold, to [...] When production switched to the LS 460, the number of laser welds was doubled.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{release the}} Pinto was {{received}} with {{both positive and}} negative reviews. [...] Road & Track faulted the suspension and standard drum brakes, calling the latter a [...] "serious deficiency," [...] but praised the proven 1.6L Kent engine, adapted from European Fords. The larger 2300 inline-4 found in the Chevrolet Vega was an innovative, brand new design using an aluminum alloy block and iron head, but needed more development work as initially released. Super Stock Magazine found the <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> to be [...] "superior" [...] and were impressed with the car overall. [...] Car and Driver found the Pinto, when equipped with the larger 2.0L engine and front disc brakes, to be a nimble and powerful commuter car with good visibility and sports-car feel. [...] A review of the 1974 Pinto with an automatic transmission by Car and Driver was not as favorable noting significant decreases in mileage and acceleration.|$|E
500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish,</b> {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} part of the finale, the finalists are given four weeks and $4,000 to create a six-look {{collection}} to show at New York Fashion Week. After three weeks at home the designers return to NYC to be mentored by Tim. Peytie designed for a girl who has “endless stamps on her passport”. Her goal was that each finale piece look like it was purchased in a different place. Maya used hard and soft elements, leather and floral brocade respectively, to convey a “Warrior Princess”. Samantha’s collection was a feminine version of military uniforms. Zachary aimed to showcase a different design side than that shown during the regular season, one with light elements and lighter colors. When the designers returned to NYC a second time they presented two looks to the judges. General feedback was that the designers needed to pay close attention to <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finishes</b> <b>and</b> style their models for a youthful customer.|$|R

5000|$|The {{project would}} feature 700000 sq ft of {{boutique}} retail stores, movie theaters, restaurants, and executive office space. Restaurant space {{would take up}} 125000 sq ft of the project. The property would also include two five-story condominium towers and a 10-story tower {{with a total of}} 340 units, priced from the $600,000 range to over $1 million. The condominium towers were expected to begin construction within 90 days, with a projected opening in 2007. Frank Pankratz, president of Executive Home Builders, wanted the project to portray the elegance and quality of the company's other projects throughout the Las Vegas Valley: [...] "We're big into stonework and granite. You can see the <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finishes</b> here are the same as what we'll be incorporating into our tower, One Queensridge Place." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Mustang's {{interior}} was revised featuring higher quality thermoplastic olefin surfaces, available real aluminium trim, and improved <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish.</b> The new design {{moved away from}} the linear nature of the previous models. [...] Ford SYNC became available as a factory installed option on all trim levels of the Mustang except the base model.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quality of}} the {{fiberglass}} body {{as well as its}} <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> was lacking. Other problems, such as water leaks and doors that could open while the car was driven, were reported with the most severe errors corrected in subsequent units produced, but some shortcomings continued beyond the Corvette's inaugural year. By December 1953, Chevrolet had a newly equipped factory in St. Louis ready to build 10,000 Corvettes annually. However, negative customer reaction in 1953 and early 1954 models caused sales to plummet.|$|E
2500|$|Reception to the Aura has {{generally}} been positive. The Aura {{has been described as}} the best looking sedan to come out of GM in quite a while. The Aura was also praised for its performance. The Aura has been described as [...] "the best Saturn yet", and <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> and ride quality are regarded as greatly improved over previous Saturns. Other improvements include reduced road noise, attributed to the fact that this model doesn't use polymer body panels like its predecessors, in addition to the extensive soundproofing GM added to car, and the triple-pane front windows and windshield. The Aura also garnered praise for its value, as it is noted that an Aura XE loaded up with certain options costs less than the standard MSRP of the Toyota Camry with a V6. The Aura finished fourth out of six places in a Car and Driver comparison test, ahead of the Chrysler Sebring and the Toyota Camry, but fell behind the Honda Accord. Despite this, it was the best performing out of the cars compared. The Aura also got praise for the craftsmanship of its interior and its European flair. The Aura also got a favorable review by Consumer Guide, with it being a recommended pick. It also got more than favorable reviews from actual owners of the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Dunbeath {{began his}} second season in the Heathorn Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in April. He was rumoured {{to be less than}} fully <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finished</b> a length second to the Michael Stoute-trained Shearwalk, to whom he was conceding five pounds in weight. Despite his defeat, the colt {{maintained}} his position {{at the head of the}} betting for the Derby. When he contested the Dante Stakes over ten and a half furlongs on soft ground at York Racecourse in May he was made the 1/2 favourite although his appearance was less impressive than usual as he sweated heavily in the pre-race paddock. After moving up to challenge the leaders early in the straight he began to struggle <b>and</b> faded to <b>finish</b> third behind Hot Touch and Guns of Navarone, beaten more than eleven lengths by the winner. Piggott felt that the colt had failed to stay the distance and Dunbeath did not run in the Derby. On his next appearance he was brought back to one mile for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Ascot in June <b>and</b> <b>finished</b> third of the seven runners behind Horage and Tolomeo.|$|R
60|$|Partly {{because the}} ways {{of these people are}} so childlike and simple in many things, and partly from one's own {{swindling}} tendency to take one's self in (a tendency really fatal to all sincerity of judgment, and incalculably mischievous to such downfallen peoples as have felt the baleful effects of the world's sentimental, impotent sympathy), there is something pathetic in the patient content with which Italians work. They have naturally so large a capacity for enjoyment, that the degree of self- denial involved in labor seems exorbitant, and one feels that these children, so loved of Nature, and so gifted by her, are harshly dealt with by their stepmother Circumstance. No doubt there ought to be truth in the silly old picture, if there is none, and I would willingly make-believe to credit it, if I could. I am glad that they at least work in old-world, awkward, picturesque ways, and not in commonplace, handy, modern fashion. Neither the habits nor the implements of labor are changed since the progress of the Republic ceased, and her heart began to die within her. All sorts of mechanics' tools are clumsy and inconvenient: the turner's lathe moves by broken impulses; door-hinges are made to order, and lift the door from the ground as it opens upon them; all nails and tacks we hand-made; window-sashes are contrived to be glazed without putty, and the panes are put in from the top, so that to repair a broken glass the whole sash is taken apart; cooking-stoves are unknown to the native cooks, who work at an open fire, with crane and dangling pot-hooks; furniture is put together with wooden pegs instead of screws; you do not buy a door-lock at a hardware store,--you get a fabbro to make it, and he comes with a leathern satchel full of tools to <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> it on the door. The wheelbarrow of this civilization is peculiarly wonderful in construction, with a prodigious wooden wheel, and a ponderous, incapable body. The canals are dredged with scoops mounted on long poles, and manned each by three or four Chiozzotti. There never was a pile-driving machine known in Venice; nor a steam-tug in all the channels of the lagoons, through which the largest craft are towed to and from the ports by row-boats. In the model of the sea-going vessels there has apparently been little change from the first. Yet in spite of all this backwardness in invention, the city is full of beautiful workmanship in every branch of artificing, and the Venetians are still the best sailors in the Adriatic.|$|E

60|$|When he awoke, it was broad daylight, and {{the sight}} that met his eyes made him rub them {{again and again to}} assure himself that they were really open and that he was not dreaming. A broad shaft of morning light poured through the open doorway in the ceiling of the room which was about thirty feet square, or roughly square, being {{irregular}} in shape, one side curving outward, another being indented by what might have been the corner of another building jutting into it, another alcoved by three sides of an octagon, while the fourth was serpentine in contour. Two windows let in more daylight, while two doors evidently gave ingress to other rooms. The walls were partially ceiled with thin strips of wood, nicely <b>fitted</b> <b>and</b> <b>finished,</b> partially plastered <b>and</b> the rest covered with a fine, woven cloth. Figures of reptiles and beasts were painted without regard to any uniform scheme here and there upon the walls. A striking feature of the decorations consisted of several engaged columns set into the walls at no regular intervals, the capitals of each supporting a human skull the cranium of which touched the ceiling, as though the latter was supported by these grim reminders either of departed relatives or of some hideous tribal rite--Bradley could not but wonder which.|$|R
