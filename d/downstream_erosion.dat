40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} river bank retreat rates, individual erosion events, and {{the processes}} that drive them in the Upper Severn basin, mid-Wales, UK. Traditional erosion pin networks were used to deliver information on patterns of <b>downstream</b> change in <b>erosion</b> rates. In addition, the novel automatic Photo-Electronic Erosion Pin (PEEP) monitoring system was deployed to generate near-continuous data on the temporal distribution of bank erosion and accretion: this allowed focus on the magnitude and timing of individual erosional and depositional events in relation to specific flow episodes. Erosion dynamics data from throughout the Upper Severn basin are combined with detailed information on bank material properties and spatial change in channel hydraulics derived from direct field survey, to assess the relationships between flow properties and bank erosion rates. Results show that bank erosion rates generally increase downstream, but relate more strongly to discharge than to reach-mean shear stress, which peaks near the basin head. <b>Downstream</b> changes in <b>erosion</b> mechanisms and boundary materials, across the upland/lowland transition (especially the degree of development of composite bank material profiles), are especially significant. Examples of sequences of bank erosion events show how the PEEP system can (a) quantify the impact of individual, rather than aggregated, forcing events, (b) reveal the full complexity of bank response to given driving agents, including delayed erosion events, and (c) establish hypotheses of process-control in bank erosion systems. These findings {{have important implications for}} the way in which bank erosion problems are researched and managed. The complex responses demonstrated have special significance for the way in which bank processes and channel-margin sediment injections should be handled in river dynamics models...|$|R
50|$|Rivers carry {{sediment}} {{down their}} riverbeds, {{allowing for the}} formation of depositional features such as river deltas, alluvial fans, braided rivers, oxbow lakes, levees and coastal shores. The construction of a dam blocks the flow of sediment downstream, leading to <b>downstream</b> <b>erosion</b> of these sedimentary depositional environments, and increased sediment build-up in the reservoir. While the rate of sedimentation varies for each dam and each river, eventually all reservoirs develop a reduced water-storage capacity due to the exchange of storage space for sediment. Diminished storage capacity results in decreased ability to produce hydroelectric power, reduced availability of water for irrigation, and if left unaddressed, may ultimately result in the expiration of the dam and river.|$|E
5000|$|A {{detention}} basin or retarding basin is an excavated area installed on, or adjacent to, tributaries of rivers, streams, lakes or bays {{to protect against}} flooding and, in some cases, <b>downstream</b> <b>erosion</b> by storing water for a limited period of time.

Able to accommodate both a broad floodplain or a narrow channel, they can also handle many different drop heights. Heights of these structures usually range from 1 ft to 10 ft.

These are then cemented together ("grouted") to form the drop structure. Another less common type of drop structure, the sculpted sloping boulder drop, is derived from this.

The vertical hard basin drop consists of a vertical [...] "cutoff wall", usually built of concrete, that is usually laid perpendicular to the stream flow; and an impact basin, not unlike a stream pool, to catch the discharged water. The purpose of the vertical hard basin drop is to force the water into a hydraulic jump (a small standing wave). Though the simplest type of drop structure, it is highest in maintenance needs and less safe, with most problems related to the impact basin.

5000|$|When {{the river}} courses over {{resistant}} bedrock, erosion happens slowly and {{is dominated by}} impacts of water-borne sediment on the rock, while <b>downstream</b> the <b>erosion</b> occurs more rapidly. As the watercourse increases its velocity {{at the edge of}} the waterfall, it may pluck material from the riverbed, if the bed is fractured or otherwise more erodable. Hydraulic jets and hydraulic jumps at the toe of a falls can generate large forces to erode the bed, especially when forces are amplified by water-borne sediment. Horseshoe-shaped falls focus the erosion to a central point, also enhancing riverbed change below a waterfalls. A process known as [...] "potholing" [...] involves local erosion of a potentially deep hole in bedrock due to turbulent whirlpools spinning stones around on the bed, drilling it out. Sand and stones carried by the watercourse therefore increase erosion capacity. This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream, and it will carve deeper into the ridge above it. The rate of retreat for a waterfall can be as high as one and half meters per year.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to develop a}} {{management}} plan to address the City of Alta’s stormwater runoff. Currently, there is no management plan and the city is growing, so there are increased runoff problems from both residential and industrial sources. A large assortment of pollutants flow from these areas, examples include various forms of sediment, paper, plastic, gravel and metal as well as less visible potentially toxic pollution from lawns, streets, gas stations and other commercial and industrial areas. The goal for this project is to construct two infiltration/detention basins to protect water quality and reduce the peak volume of the City of Alta’s urban runoff. Each basin is designed with two functions: Control gully erosion and surface erosion with detention, while incorporating water quality through infiltration. The <b>downstream</b> <b>erosion</b> control provided by detaining runoff will reduce sediment delivery to Powell Creek and protect downstream agricultural land from urban runoff. The infiltration features designed into the basins will capture pollutants commonly associated with urban stormwater runoff such as: sediment, sand, gravel hydrocarbons, particulate matter, heavy metals, and nutrients...|$|E
40|$|The city of Fayetteville, Arkansas has {{experienced}} rapid urbanization throughout {{recent years as}} it continues to grow. Within the city, the University of Arkansas has been constantly expanding, with increased impervious surfaces as more parking lots and facilities are built. This has caused issues including flooding and stream bank erosion, specifically in Mullins Creek, which receives runoff from {{a large part of}} campus. A portion of the creek was restored, but there are still downstream issues. Low Impact Development (LID) is a type of green infrastructure that has been shown to decrease runoff and increase infiltration. EPA SWMM, a hydrologic modeling software, was used to analyze the effectiveness of implementing LID at Lot 56, adjacent to Mullins Creek. Two layouts were developed: the condensed layout with 5 bioretention cells, and the dispersed layout with 29 cells. The results for both layouts showed significant decrease in runoff and increase in infiltration. With the ideology of Volume Based Hydrology, it can be assumed that the decrease in runoff will also cause a decrease in pollutant loads, and a decrease in erosion and flooding downstream. The implementation of LID at Lot 56, combined with LID implementation throughout the drainage area, can be an effective way to combat <b>downstream</b> <b>erosion</b> and flooding issues at Mullins Creek...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the success of}} Green Valley River Restoration Project, specifically assessing sedimentation and channel stability. The major objectives of the restoration were to provide flood control by constructing a two terraced channel, re-plant riparian corridor with native species, and mitigate for 1. 89 acres of seasonal wetland lost to development. We attempted to compare project conditions after a major flow event in 1995 (second year after project completion) {{with those of the}} most recent (2002) surveys. Surveying methods were inconsistent from year to year making direct comparison of surveys difficult. In general, the two-terrace channel has remained relatively stable and successfully conveyed flood waters <b>downstream.</b> <b>Erosion</b> and deposition within the channel are less stable because of excessive sediment loading from upper watershed. Severe sedimentation along Hennessey Creek, a tributary to Green Valley Creek, caused damage to private property within the project reach during flood events. Litigation ensued and one of the outcomes was the development of new watershed scale management strategies. Some of these new strategies included improving farming techniques in the upper watershed to minimize sedimentation, conducting more scientific studies to assess sources of sediment, continuing monitoring creeks throughout the watershed, and consistently revising requirements developers must meet to build within the river corridor. Overall we see Greek Valley Creek as a successful project, one where the shortcomings of the project (sediment transport considerations) will provide useful learning tools for future management...|$|E
50|$|As all dams {{result in}} reduced {{sediment}} load downstream, a dammed river is greatly demanding for sediment {{as it will}} not have enough sediment. This is because the rate of deposition of sediment is greatly reduced since there is less to deposit but the rate of erosion remains nearly constant, the water flow erodes the river shores and riverbed, threatening shoreline ecosystems, deepening the riverbed, and narrowing the river over time. This leads to a compromised water table, reduced water levels, homogenization of the river flow and thus reduced ecosystem variability, reduced support for wildlife, and reduced amount of sediment reaching coastal plains and deltas. This prompts coastal erosion, as beaches are unable to replenish what waves erode without the sediment deposition of supporting river systems. <b>Downstream</b> channel <b>erosion</b> of dammed rivers {{is related to the}} morphology of the riverbed, which is different from directly studying the amounts of sedimentation because it is subject to specific long term conditions for each river system. For example, the eroded channel could create a lower water table level in the affected area, impacting bottomland crops such as alfalfa or corn, and resulting in a smaller supply.In the case of the Three Gorges Dam in China the changes described above now appears to have arrived at a new balance of erosion and sedimentation over a 10-year period in the lower reaches of the river.

40|$|Changes in the Yangtze River level {{induced by}} {{large-scale}} human water regulation have profound implications on the inundation dynamics of surrounding lakes/wetlands {{and the integrity}} of related ecosystems. Using in situ measurements and hydrological simulation, this study reveals an altered Yangtze level regime downstream from the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) to the Yangtze estuary in the East China Sea as a combined result of (i) TGD's flow regulation and (ii) Yangtze channel erosion due to reduced sediment load. During the average annual cycle of TGD's regular flow control in 2009 – 2012, downstream Yangtze level variations were estimated to have been reduced by 3. 9 – 13. 5 % at 15 studied gauging stations, manifested as evident level decrease in fall and increase in winter and spring. The impacts on Yangtze levels generally diminished in a longitudinal direction from the TGD to the estuary, with a total time lag of ~ 9 – 12 days. Chronic Yangtze channel erosion since the TGD closure has lowered water levels in relation to flows at most downstream stations, which in turn counteracts the anticipated level increase by nearly or over 50 % in winter and spring while reinforcing the anticipated level decrease by over 20 % in fall. Continuous <b>downstream</b> channel <b>erosion</b> in the near future may further counteract the benefit of increased Yangtze levels during TGD's water supplement in winter and accelerate the receding of inundation areas/levels of downstream lakes in fall...|$|R
