25|$|Although {{there were}} {{accumulated}} {{in the same}} person the offices of viceroy, governor, captain general {{and president of the}} Audiencia, each of them had different jurisdictional areas. The jurisdiction of the viceregal Audiencia, whose president was the viceroy, ended face up to the jurisdiction of other Audiencias inside the same viceroyalty: as the pretorial Audiencias chaired by a governor-captain general, who had administrative, political and military authority, as the subordinated Audiencias, whose president did not have this administrative, political and military authority. Therefore, as governor, the direct administration of the province where was placed the viceregal capital belonged to the viceroy; nevertheless, with respect to the other governorates of the viceroyalty, his function was mere oversight or <b>general</b> <b>inspection</b> over the management of political affairs. The imprecision in defining the powers of the viceroy and those of the provincial governors allowed the Crown to control their officials.|$|E

2500|$|An {{undercurrent}} of these elections {{was the state}} of regional public finances, with the Azorean public debit exceeding 2300 million Euros as of 31 December 2011, in a report issued by the national Inspeção Geral de Finanças (<b>General</b> <b>Inspection</b> of Finances). The report indicated that this figure resulted from debits of the regional administration (427 million Euros), regional public companies (1500 million Euros) and local authories (327 million Euros). In addition to a warning about the regions [...] "actual risk of budgetary slippage", the report also slighted future annual expenditures which would put in risk {{the state of the}} regions finances. These were, specifically, two public-private partnerships worth 1600 million Euros: the SCUT roadway concession, worth 1300 million Euros annually, and [...] 330 million Euros for the Hospital da Terceira.

2500|$|On 9 December 1971, {{ownership}} of the boat {{was transferred to the}} Oklahoma Maritime Advisory Board. The towing was divided into two phases. Phase one was a direct offshore tow from Orange to the Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans. At the shipyard, Batfish would be raised on steel lifting straps and cradled between two pairs of bare-decked barges, so the submarine's draft would be high enough to make phase two of the tow, [...] upriver, possible. Strike action at the Orange drydock caused the submarine to instead be towed to the Bethlehem Steel drydock in Beaumont, Texas. After a <b>general</b> <b>inspection</b> and clearing of fuel and ballast tanks, Batfish was sealed up and was ready to tow to Avondale on 1 March 1972. At Avondale, {{it was found that the}} four barges were insufficient to reduce the submarine's draft, and a new plan for six [...] barges, ballasted to the outside and linked together by steel cables. On 13 March, Batfish was partially secured to the barges by lifting straps, but no cables had been placed to bind them together. That afternoon, the English tanker Silverman passed through a nearby [...] zone at : the resulting wake sank one barge and seriously damaged several others, although Batfish herself escaped major harm.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} the region's public {{finances}} also influenced continued talk of reinforcing the archipelago's autonomy following a memorandum of understanding signed between the Portuguese and (proposed by) the Azorean Regional Governments, that provided for a 10-year 135 million Euro loan. Among the requirements of this understanding, the loan was dependent on: the guarantee that the Azores followed {{the objectives of the}} Programa de Ajustamento Econónomico e Financeiro (Program for Economic and Financial Adjustment); stabilized public finances; refrain from aggravating public finances (directly or indirectly) through the remuneration of public service employees, the reduction of public servants inline with the objectives of the PAEF; a promise not to create new public-private partnerships that resulted in new financial burdens; an analysis of existing public-partnerships (within three months from the memorandum's signing) as a precondition for funding; regular monthly bulletins on the state of Regional finances, remitted to the Direção-Geral do Orçamento (Directorate-General for the Budget); full cooperation with the Inspecção-Geral de Finanças (<b>General</b> <b>Inspection</b> for Finances); among other details. Many of the parties protested that agreement was equivalent to transferring the control of the Azores to the Ministry of Finances, requesting a debate on the issue in the Regional Assembly. Berta Cabral, leader of the PSD Açores, although aligned with the national government, cited her willingness to alter the terms of the memorandum if her party was elected. This stance was criticized by both the CDS-PP and PS leaders the next day, who cited the legality of the document and the desperation {{on the part of the}} PSD (stating that the understanding did not demand anything more than what was already required by Regional Finance Laws), respectively. Nonetheless, the PS leader used his campaign to criticize the national government for policies that [...] "brought more austerity to the Azores", citing measures by Vitor Gaspar (Minister of Finances) following the fifth intervention by the Troika (a tripartite committee led by the European Commission with the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) delegation.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{inspection}} data {{is important}} for efficient bridge management. Visual inspections {{play a key role}} in providing this information, but the reliability of such data has limitations. A range of techniques addressing these limitations are used in other sectors, but not to assist routine visual bridge inspection. Work has been undertaken investigating the feasibility of performing routine visual bridge inspections based on systematically collected images alone. The requirements of such a system are considered and defined. The research demonstrates that more detail can be seen in images at 1 -pixel-per-mm than can be seen from 3 m, and that images at this resolution can be systematically collected, processed, displayed, and inspected to complete <b>General</b> <b>Inspections</b> with results comparable to traditional routine visual inspections. No existing systems were found to be suitable for routinely providing visual inspection data; consequently a prototype was developed demonstrating the feasibility of the image-based inspection approach. The development considered hardware, image collection methodology, processing, alignment, display and interpretation. Inspectors tested and used the system to perform image-based <b>General</b> <b>Inspections</b> on several bridges. It is concluded that an image­based approach can be used to perform routine visual bridge inspections, with no loss of detail compared to traditional inspections. ...|$|R
