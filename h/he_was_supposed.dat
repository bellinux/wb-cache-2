In fact, {{not only that}} it denied José Ramos-Horta entry in 1997 (when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to give a lecture to the University of the Philippines Diliman), then President-Fidel V. Ramos even included him in the immigration blacklist.|$|E

The guard who was responsible for the inmate was suspended without pay due to the incident.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{faith in}} Johnson {{to balance the}} ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost the Democrats votes in the South, where his {{relationship}} with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner much support from the West, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and war hero. He even failed to deliver {{his home state of}} Kentucky for the Democrats. Regardless, the Democrats still won the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|When Ben Bradley (Ben Richards) daughter, Carly (Sophie Wise), {{is found}} dead, Ben {{initially}} blames Darren as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> {{to drive her}} up to Scotland to a rehab center that day but cancelled the job so he could support Maxine through a dinner party with Patrick.

5|$|When Ruffing was 15 years old, he {{suffered}} an {{accident in the}} mine, where his left foot was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able to save his foot, Red lost four toes. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to begin his professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League that year, but he found himself unable to run {{as fast as he}} previously could. Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career by becoming a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|Willis has {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be a guest. On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit {{in honor of the}} Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E

5|$|Hugh was not {{involved}} in the controversy between King Henry II and Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. The king did suspect Hugh of supporting Henry's heir, Henry the Young King, when the prince rebelled and Hugh was also suspected of aiding the King of Scots, William I, during an invasion of Northern England in 1174. After the accession of Henry's second son Richard as king, Hugh bought the office of Sheriff of Northumberland, as well as the earldom of Northumbria. He also acquired the office of Justiciar, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to share with William de Mandeville, but with Mandeville's death Hugh shared the office with William Longchamp. Longchamp had managed to secure the office for himself by the middle of 1190.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Santos visited {{some friends}} in New York City's Barrio Latino, during this visit Santo's was {{walking through the}} street on a Saturday evening when he fainted and collapsed. He was {{attended}} by some bystanders and residents of the neighborhood who called the New York City Police Department. When the police arrived at the scene they transported him to a local hospital, Santos was released two days after. During this time Santos was also suffering from mental illnesses, including memory loss due to Alzheimer's disease. Despite his health he made final presentations in some of Puerto Rico's municipalities where he received recognitions in San Juan and Ponce. Santos was also {{invited to participate in}} a music festival in Cuba, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to receive a homage, but he was unable to attend.|$|E
5|$|Soon, Granville {{had a full}} {{orchestra}} at his disposal, so {{he convinced}} the management committee {{to allow him to}} give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays. He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers, as well as his own works. As he had difficulty finding time to practice these works, Bantock used afternoon sessions, in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to play dance music, to rehearse his classical pieces. When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute.|$|E

5|$|At the 2006 Royal Rumble, Helms {{participated in}} an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won, {{even though he was}} a Raw superstar and the {{championship}} was defended solely on SmackDown!. As a result, he returned to the SmackDown! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio, Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights. During this time, Helms defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match. The next week, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to defend against Kid Kash, but Kash was away on a family emergency, so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place. Helms defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights. As a result, all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked Helms. It was later announced by SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event, Helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title. Helms was able to retain the championship. Later, Long mandated that Helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights. Helm's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools; Helms retained by cheating.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} {{on the world stage}} at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding {{in the back of a}} van when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.|$|E
5|$|Kunjunni S. Kumar, son of cinematographer S.Kumar, {{was hired}} as Loham's cinematographer. Kunjunni had first worked with Ranjith as an {{associate}} director during the production of Indian Rupee (2011) while his father worked behind the camera. Earlier, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to debut as a cinematographer on Ranjith's Leela in 2012, but the project was shelved ten days before production. In {{an interview with the}} Deccan Chronicle, Kunjunni said that after the script narration, Ranjith told him to avoid gimmicks in framing and shots {{in order to make it}} more realistic. Mythili, who was cast by Ranjith in her debut film, acted in and served as an assistant director for the film which was her debut behind the camera. She also sang a duet song in the film's soundtrack. Sreevalsan J. Menon was selected by Ranjith to compose the film's original music score. Renji Panicker suggested Menon to Ranjith during the film's pre-production stage. C. Rajamani composed the film score.|$|E

5|$|On January 26, 2012, Ross {{finalized}} {{a one-year}} contract with the Boston Red Sox. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit a three-run homer {{in the bottom of}} the second inning off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub {{of several}} major roads {{and became a}} prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as {{necessary}} to their advance. Middleton was in continuous communication with Bradley at 12th Army Group headquarters in Luxembourg, and maintained that though Bastogne could soon be surrounded, it should be held. As the Germans advanced on Bastogne, both Bradley and First Army commander Hodges recognized the threat to Middleton and had him move his headquarters. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to leave Bastogne on 18 December, but spent another night there {{so that he could}} brief his relief force, the 101st Airborne Division. Not only did that division's acting commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, show up ahead of schedule, but so did Colonel William Roberts from the 10th Armored Division Combat Command R (CCR), sent by Patton. Another welcome guest arriving later that evening was Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of XVIII Airborne Corps, en route to his headquarters, but advised by Middleton to stay in Bastogne for the night to avoid capture by the Germans. While Middleton and his guests slept, elements of the 101st Airborne poured into Bastogne all during the night and into the following day.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries were years of {{lawlessness}} on Lundy, {{particularly during the}} ownership of Thomas Benson (1708-1772), a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon, who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> to be deporting. Benson leased Lundy from its owner, John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (1694–1754) (who was an heir of the Grenville family of Bideford and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall), at a rent of £60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia, but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves. Later Benson was involved in an insurance swindle. He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a valuable cargo of pewter and linen. Having cleared the port on the mainland, the ship put into Lundy, where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts, before setting sail again. Some days afterwards, when a homeward-bound vessel was sighted, the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled. The crew were taken off the stricken ship by the other ship, which landed them safely at Clovelly.|$|E
