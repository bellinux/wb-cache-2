The Great Western Steamship Company, which had opened its pioneer Bristol–New York service earlier that year, bid £45,000 for a monthly Bristol–Halifax–New York service using three ships of 450 horsepower. While British American, the other pioneer transatlantic steamship company, did not submit a tender, the St. George Steam Packet Company, owner of Sirius, bid £45,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax service and £65,000 for a monthly Cork–Halifax–New York service.

5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not have to travel any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target <b>early</b> <b>enough</b> that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E

Several tests have been developed, such as mammograms for breast cancer and colonoscopies for colon cancer, but most of these tests are invasive, uncomfortable and are not always able to detect cancer <b>earlier</b> <b>enough</b> to provide a winning scenario for patients. Some cancers are still very difficult to diagnose in the early stage, such as ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and some liver cancers. In our study, we have developed a P-scan instrument to successfully identify and quantify six pteridines in urine samples. The data demonstrated a great correlation between pteridine levels and cancer development. The detailed experimental conditions will be presented at the life science summit. After analysis of over 60 urine samples from cancer patients, we also discovered that two chemical components exist only in the urine of cancer patients but are not present in individuals who do not have cancers...|$|R

5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred <b>early</b> <b>enough</b> in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost <b>early</b> <b>enough,</b> on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E

50|$|Pygmy swordtail males offer {{another example}} of {{alternative}} mating strategies. Some males mature later at a larger size and always use courtship behavior, while other males mature early at a smaller size, sometimes using courtship behavior when alone with a female, but more often using sneaky behavior.

40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} {{topic of}} acute pulmonary embolism {{was chosen to}} increase the knowledge base and provide additional information to assist with moving forward from a registered nurse to an Advance Practicing Nurse. Working as a full-time registered nurse in the emergency department, the working diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism {{is something that is}} ruled out on many patients with complaints of shortness of breath, chest pain, or decrease in pulse oximetry. Since a patient with an acute pulmonary embolism can have both typical and atypical symptoms, the death rate can be very high, if not caught <b>earlier</b> <b>enough.</b> An acute pulmonary embolism has a much higher death rate, then that of a patient with a myocardial infarction. The reason for the higher death rate is that an acute pulmonary embolism may be more difficult to detect, as the patient may not always show specific signs and symptoms for an embolism. By doing further research on this topic, the nurse will be able to provide better care and make better clinical decisions to all patients who come into the emergency room with typical and atypical symptoms of an acute pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary embolism can present itself in many different ways, but {{it is very important to}} rule this out, even if their vital signs are normal and they have other predisposing factors...|$|R
