5|$|Wet {{conditions}} {{caused many}} accidents along roadways in central Virginia. A motorist on Interstate 95 in Richmond {{died when he}} hydroplaned and crashed his car. In Albemarle County, a popular forest boardwalk {{that was part of}} the Monticello property was destroyed by a falling oak tree. Also in Albemarle, two people were killed when their car drove off a road and crashed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> during heavy rainfall. A man in Chesterfield County died when struck by a tree. Three people died when a car in southern Fluvanna County crashed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> The deaths were considered indirectly related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E

5|$|Hill has {{experienced}} only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting {{to tie a}} safety rope, she fell 85ft (25m) <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E
5|$|The design {{architecture}} of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, {{consisting of a}} host, a multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may {{be included in the}} tiers, allowing branching <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to a single host controller. USB devices are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.|$|E

The life of Cesar, shattered, is never the same. To honor his brother's memory, Cesar opens his own small club, which is well received. Delores pays him a visit and asks him to sing Nestor's song for her.|$|E

5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> fracturing his left leg.|$|E

H. Warren's car; both being entered by J. W. H. Dew. A fourth driver, {{in one of the}} White steam cars, succumbed to the same problem, while A. J. Hancock crashed his Vauxhall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> also breaking a wheel. Napier was once again the quickest driver around the circuit, followed by Percy Northey in a Rolls Royce, and Norman Littlejohn in the Vinot-Deguingand.|$|E

Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite, incurring {{the wrath of the}} goddess, by whom was made {{to fall in love with}} her father; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her identity was discovered. Smyrna fled, but her father later caught up with her. Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible, prompting them to turn her <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> which was named the Smyrna. Ten months later the tree cracked and Adonis was born from it.|$|E
5|$|New York Police linked rapper Fabolous to {{a crew of}} robbers who {{targeted}} Judah twice. According {{to police}} reports, the Street Fam Crew, the gang that attempted to rob Judah, {{is made up of}} 20members, all former drug dealers from Fabolous' Brooklyn neighborhood. In 2006, three men tried to rob Judah as he stood next to his Lamborghini on West 27th Street at 10th Avenue in New York City. The three men drove up to Judah in a minivan at about 5am, and came out. One man pulled a handgun on Judah, and told him to put his jewelry on the hood of his car, but Judah ran instead. The muggers followed in their minivan, but crashed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> a block away. All three robbers fled the scene, but one was captured by a Homeland Security agent on his way to work, and another was grabbed by a nearby cab driver.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} crashed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E

5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and {{was not one of}} the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Red {{follows a}} {{familiar}} scent and is reunited with her sister, {{a single mother}} with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey {{in exchange for a}} helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult Utahraptor are stalking a herd of Iguanodon, Red spies a young male Utahraptor that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the Iguanodon, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the tree branches. Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} crash-related fire was {{reported}} in China in May 2012, after a high-speed car crashed into a BYD e6 taxi in Shenzhen. The second reported incident occurred in the United States on October 1, 2013, when a Tesla Model S caught fire after the electric car hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington state, and the debris punctured one of 16 modules within the battery pack. A second reported fire occurred on October 18, 2013 in Merida, Mexico. In this case the vehicle was being driven at high speed through a roundabout and crashed through a wall and <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> On November 6, 2013, a Tesla Model S being driven on Interstate 24 near Murfreesboro, Tennessee caught fire after it struck a tow hitch on the roadway, causing damage beneath the vehicle.|$|E
