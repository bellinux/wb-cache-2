25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

Voices wrote [...] "This year [...] is SpongeBob SquarePants' tenth anniversary, and <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> say it, but SpongeBob {{has really}} been showing his age recently.

500|$|Although Berlin {{initially}} wrote [...] "Oh! How <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> Get Up in the Morning" [...] without commercial intent, {{it eventually}} appeared {{in three different}} Broadway shows, including Ziegfeld Follies of 1918, and the film This Is the Army. [...] More than any other Irving Berlin song, it became the one most associated with Berlin as a performer.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} that inspired Berlin to write [...] "Oh! How <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> Get Up in the Morning" [...] was an occasion when a colonel wanted {{a group of}} buglers to play George M. Cohan's [...] "Over There". The buglers were unable to comply because it exceeded the range of their instruments, so the oblivious officer ordered them to practice Cohan's song. He wrote it as [...] "a thin little sergeant." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Oh! How <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> Get Up in the Morning" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Irving Berlin in 1918 that gives a comic {{perspective}} on military life. Berlin composed the song {{as an expression of}} protest against the indignities of Army routine shortly after being drafted into the United States Army in 1918. [...] The song soon made the rounds of camp and became popular with other soldiers, partly because hatred of reveille was universal.|$|E
500|$|However, in a {{subsequent}} interview with the Los Angeles Times that appeared a month later, Eastwood suggested {{that he would not}} necessarily vote for Trump and instead appeared agnostic regarding the 2016 presidential election. The Times Rebecca Keegan asked, [...] "So when you say you’re not {{on either side of the}} aisle, does that mean you’re not voting for Trump?" [...] Eastwood replied, [...] "I’m totally an enigma. I’m just astounded. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> pick up the paper. I think both individuals and both parties backing the individuals have a certain degree of insanity." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} in soldier revues including 1918's Yip Yip Yaphank, and Ziegfeld Follies of 1918, {{as well as in}} 113 Broadway performances of This Is the Army in 1942. Jack Haley sang [...] "Oh! How <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> Get Up in the Morning" [...] in the 1938 movie Alexander's Ragtime Band and in 1938 Alice Faye and Ethel Merman also sang the song at [...] the Roxy Theatre in New York City.

500|$|The song {{appeared}} in two shows of 1918: Yip Yip Yaphank and Ziegfeld Follies of 1918. Yip Yip Yaphank opened on August 19 and Berlin made his entrance {{late in the}} show, being dragged from a pup tent by two other soldiers as he pretended to be asleep on his feet to sing [...] "Oh! How <b>I</b> <b>Hate</b> <b>to</b> Get Up in the Morning". The song was a centerpiece of the show; both it and Berlin's performance received favorable reviews. According to reviewers, Berlin's voice was thin but his timing was perfect and he presented a hilarious stage persona. 24 years later, the New York Times declared Yip [...] "an immediate hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Speechless" [...] after a water balloon {{fight with}} {{children}} in Germany. It took him 45 minutes. In an interview with [...] Vibe magazine, the musician commented, [...] "I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> say that, because it's such a romantic song." [...] He added, [...] "But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. I felt {{it would be good}} enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity." [...] Jackson would consider [...] "Speechless" [...] to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} gone with the men from Gonzales," [...] said Lieutenant Radbury, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>to</b> leave Ralph home with nobody but Pompey. These are {{certainly}} terrible times. I wonder what Santa Anna will do next?" ...|$|R

500|$|Jeter is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most consistent baseball players of all time. He played fewer than 145 games a season only three times in his career: when he dislocated his left shoulder on Opening Day 2003 (119 games), when he injured his calf in 2011 (131 games), and in 2013 when he struggled with a myriad of injuries (17 games). For his career, he averaged 204 hits, 113 runs scored and 21 stolen bases per 162 games. He is currently 6th on the all-time hits list in Major League Baseball history. Highly competitive, Jeter once said, [...] "If you're going to play at all, you're out to win. Baseball, board games, playing Jeopardy!, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> lose." [...] Seen as one of the best players of his generation, sportswriters believe that Jeter will be inducted on the 1st ballot into the Baseball Hall of Fame following his retirement, and could be a unanimous selection.|$|E
500|$|Urlacher dislocated {{his wrist}} in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He {{underwent}} surgery, {{and went on}} to miss the remainder of the season. [...] Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy is a winner, and that formula worked for us. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> say it, but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E
500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone {{called the}} Nuremberg trials a fraud.

2500|$|The Wrath of Khan had {{its first}} public {{screening}} at a science-fiction convention in Overland Park, Kansas on May 8, 1982, {{almost a month}} before general release. Although Paramount executives were concerned that Spock's death would set fans against the movie, the audience actually applauded after Spock's death scene. [...] "It was sensational. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> be given to superlatives but it absolutely reached everything we wanted it to. I couldn't ask for anything better," [...] said co-producer Robert Sallin of the advance audience's reaction.|$|E
