30|$|A storm {{recovery}} {{due to the}} <b>flow-out</b> {{effect can}} be explained mostly by the rate of plasma sheet density change and the drift speed of energetic ions. A density change determines how much the magnetic field magnitude changes, and the ion drift speed determines the time scale of the magnetic field change. The ion drift is mostly controlled by E × B drift for both ion injections and <b>flow-out.</b> The Carrington event consists of the rapid main phase and rapid recovery phase, {{both of which have}} comparable time constants (approximately 1 h). This feature indicates that ion transport during the rapid recovery is controlled by a process that dominates ion transport during the main phase, namely, the E × B drift. We thus hypothesize that the ion <b>flow-out</b> effect is a plausible process that causes the rapid recovery.|$|E

In order to catch the phenomena of cold air seeping-out in calm conditions, several sonic anemometers were set along the green space boundary. In a clear calm night, <b>flow-out</b> wind directions from green spaces to surrounding built-up areas were discerned at all measuring points.

We prove that, under a mild genericity condition, such a ring is a free S(g ∗) −module, with generators given by Thom classes of <b>flow-outs</b> of the vertices. We also show that many interesting notions and results in symplectic geometry, including symplectic reduction, blow-up, symplectic cutting and the ABBV localization theorem, have correspondents {{in the theory of}} one-skeletons...|$|R
30|$|The <b>flow-out</b> {{process is}} {{effective}} in decaying the ring current when (1) plasma sheet ions injecting into the inner magnetosphere are more tenuous than ring current ions and (2) drift trajectories encounter the dayside magnetopause. These conditions require (i) a decrease in plasma sheet density and (ii) strong and prolonged E × B convection. Since plasma sheet density is correlated with solar wind density (Terasawa et al. 1997; Borovsky et al. 1998; Ebihara and Ejiri 2000), a decrease in solar wind density is needed. For the continuous E × B drift, the dawn-dusk convection electric field needs to remain strong, and thus, solar wind speed needs to keep fast and/or the IMF southward component remains large. In summary, the <b>flow-out</b> effect is significant when solar wind density decreases {{during a period of}} fast solar wind and/or southward IMF.|$|E
40|$|We {{implemented}} {{an experimental}} model of asymmetrical compression loading of the vertebral end plate (VEP) in vivo. The macroscopic permeability of the VEP was measured. We hypothesized that static asymmetrical loading on vertebrae altered the macroscopic permeability of the VEP. In scoliosis, solute transport {{to and from}} the disc is dramatically decreased especially at the apical intervertebral disc. The decrease in permeability could be induced by mechanical stress. Nine skeletally immature pigs were instrumented with left pedicle screws and compression rod at the T 5 /T 6 and L 1 /L 2 levels. After 3  months, three cylindrical specimens of the VEP were obtained from each of the tethered levels. A previously validated method for measuring permeability, based on the relaxation pressure due to a transient-flow rate was used. A pistoning device generated a fluid flow that fully saturated the cylindrical specimen. The decrease in upstream pressure was measured using a pressure transducer, which allowed the macroscopic permeability to be derived. A microscopic study completed the approach. Overall macroscopic permeability was lower for the tethered VEPs than for the VEPs of the control group, respectively − 47 % for flow-in (p =  0. 0001) and − 46 % for <b>flow-out</b> (p =  0. 0001). In the tethered group, macroscopic permeability of the specimens from the tethered side was lower than macroscopic permeability of those from the non-tethered side, − 39 % for <b>flow-out</b> (p =  0. 024) and − 47 % for flow-in (p =  0. 13). In the control group, the macroscopic permeability was greater {{in the center of the}} VEP than in its lateral parts for <b>flow-out</b> (p =  0. 004). Macroscopic permeability of the center of the VEPs was greater for <b>flow-out</b> than for flow-in (p =  0. 02). There was no significant difference between thoracic and lumbar. This study demonstrated that compression loading applied to a growing spine results in decreased permeability of the VEP. This result could be explained by local remodeling, such as calcification of the cartilage end plate or sclerosis of the underlying bone...|$|E

The change does not affect the densities of both injected and outflowing ions but the energy of outflowing ions, because the magnetic field strength adjacent to the dayside magnetopause changes.|$|E
30|$|We {{examined}} intense geomagnetic {{storms in}} order to address an open question: why did the Carrington storm recover very rapidly (> 800 nT in a few hours)? We tested a hypothesis that the rapid recovery is due to the <b>flow-out</b> of energetic ions that generate the westward ring current, by extending Burton’s model. We added a new term representing variations of solar wind density which is correlated with plasma sheet density. We then applied the extended model to previously observed intense magnetic storms. Plasma sheet density variations make the <b>flow-out</b> process effective under the condition where the convection electric field remains strong. When the density drops, energetic ions contributing to the ring current flow out through the dayside magnetopause and are replaced by low-density plasma transported from a tenuous plasma sheet. We compared the time profile of the observed SYM-H (SYM-Hxobs) with that derived from our extended model (SYM-Hext). We performed forward modeling to find the best fit of SYM-Hext to SYM-Hobs. The best fit SYM-Hext displayed more rapid recovery than SYM-H based on the original Burton’s model. Furthermore, our model reproduced a two-step recovery, a rapid initial recovery followed by a slow one. We also applied the best fit parameters to the Carrington event, utilizing solar wind data used by Li et al. (2006). Our model produced rapid recovery similar to the Carrington event recovery when the solar wind density increases up to approximately 100 cm− 3 and suddenly drops under a condition of continuous southward IMF of 65 nT and solar wind speed of 1, 500 km/s. Such a solar wind density enhancement, as well as the IMF strength and the solar wind speed, is not beyond the observed limit. We conclude that the <b>flow-out</b> effect plays {{a significant role in the}} rapid recovery of the Carrington storm.|$|E
30|$|The {{geomagnetic}} storm during the Carrington event, which occurred on 2 September 1859, displayed extremely rapid recovery. The geomagnetic field increased by approximately 650 nT/h at Bombay, India, and by > 300 nT/h in 1 -h averaged data. Although the rapid recovery is considered {{due to a}} sudden increase in the magnetopause current, a sudden decrease of the ring current, or/and a sudden enhancement of the ionospheric currents, this study focuses on the ring current decay. The Carrington rapid recovery had a time constant (approximately 1 h) comparable to the storm development (i.e., decrease in the geomagnetic field), indicating that energy loss from the ring current region is predominantly controlled by E × B convection transport which is responsible for energy input during the storm main phase. This feature has led us to a hypothesis that the <b>flow-out</b> of dense ring current ions and injections of tenuous plasma sheet ions caused the rapid decay of the ring current and in turn the storm rapid recovery. This study examines whether the Carrington rapid recovery {{can be explained by the}} <b>flow-out</b> effect. We extend the empirical Burton’s model to a model that takes into consideration a sudden change in solar wind density which is correlated with plasma sheet density. We first apply the extended Burton’s model to previously observed four intense magnetic storms (Dst minimum < − 200 nT) for which solar wind data are available. Using the best fit parameters found by forward modeling, the extended model estimates the recovery of the Carrington storm. The estimate indicates that a solar wind structure with a density bump by approximately 100 cm− 3 (and southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) of 65 nT and solar wind speed of 1, 500 km/s) can cause the rapid recovery under a continuous southward IMF condition. We conclude that the <b>flow-out</b> effect plays a significant role in producing the rapid recovery of the Carrington storm.|$|E

This study {{is the first step}} to incorporate the <b>flow-out</b> effect associated with solar wind density variations into Burton’s model.

30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} whether the Carrington rapid {{recovery}} {{can be explained}} by the <b>flow-out</b> effect associated with changes in the plasma sheet density (i.e., leakage of denser ions and injections of more tenuous ions), by extending Burton’s model and applying it to previously observed intense storms. There have been a large number of modeling studies that demonstrated a significant role of plasma sheet density in variations of the ring current intensity and the storm magnitude. A dense plasma sheet during a period of enhanced convection results in higher ion pressure in the inner magnetosphere and in turn stronger ring current (e.g., Chen et al. 1994; Kozyra et al. 1998 b; Ebihara and Ejiri 2000; Ebihara et al. 2005).|$|E

We chose a constant value of τ for our model in this study to focus on evaluating whether the <b>flow-out</b> effect due to solar wind density decrease contributes to ring current rapid decay. We used a typical loss time scale of the most general, best accepted ring current ion loss process, charge exchange with the geocorona at L = 3 to 4.

The major processes that could contribute most to the rapid recovery are (1) charge exchange loss of singly charged oxygen ions (O+) (e.g., Hamilton et al. 1988; Daglis et al. 1999); (2) <b>flow-out</b> of ring current ions through the dayside magnetopause, under the conditions of continued/weakened convection where newly injected ions from the plasma sheet are more tenuous than those leaking out into the magnetosheath (e.g., Liemohn 1999, 2001; O’Brien et al. 2002; Keika et al. 2005); (3) pitch angle scattering of ring current ions in the stretched near-Earth magnetotail with small curvature and consequent precipitation into the atmosphere (e.g., Ebihara et al. 2011); and (4) pitch angle scattering of ring current ions through resonant interactions with electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves and consequent precipitation into the atmosphere (e.g., Cornwall et al. 1970; Kozyra et al. 1998 a; Jordanova et al. 2001).

The aim {{of this study is to}} confirm the efficiency and accuracy of MHF by comparing it with FEM, and to discuss optimum elemental shapes and modeling. MHF, unlike FEM, evaluates the velocity potential and the flux on the element boundaries not at the element nodes; consequently, the material or mass balance of each element due to flow-in and <b>flow-out</b> through the boundaries can be strictly estimated. The flow velocity within an element, however, should be interpolated by those values on the boundaries, and a distinctive shape function, known as the Raviart-Thomas shape function, becomes necessary. The authors established the MHF formulation for arbitrary shaped elements with 3 and 4 boundaries, and numerically investigated its efficiency and accuracy with various shapes of elements. Through this study, it was confirmed that MHF can evaluate accurate flow velocity with a fewer number of elements than those of FEM.

The influence of location, tissue maturity, and fluid flow direction was quantified. Objective. We hypothesized that the macroscopic permeability of vertebral endplate may decrease with maturity of the vertebral segment. of Background Data. The alternation of loading induced by the diurnal cycle generates convective flux into the vertebral segment with the dominant flow path through the vertebral endplates. The alteration of mass transport at the disc-vertebrae interface may interrupt the mechanobiologic balance, and have an effect such as degenerative changes or scoliosis. Methods. A previously validated method for measuring permeability, based on the relaxation pressure caused by a transient-flow rate was used. Three specimens were extracted from each L 1 to L 5 endplate. Seventy-one specimens were frozen, and 64 were stored fresh in a standard culture media. A microscopic analysis completed the biomechanical analysis. Results. At 2, 4, and 6 months, the mean permeability (10 - 14 m 4 /N *s, flow-in/flow-out) of the central zone was respectively: 1. 23 / 1. 66, 1. 03 / 1. 29, and 0. 792 / 1. 00.

40|$|Among many {{ironmaking}} devices, {{the blast}} furnace still dominates {{over the past}} centuries. In this research area, {{the understanding of the}} blast furnace hearth is relatively insu&# 64259;cient because of its complicated environment from which all the accumulated &# 64257;nal products are removed. The removal of the liquid iron and slag from the hearth is usually called drainage, tapping, or casting. The drainage in the hearth has been appreciated crucial in avoiding over&# 64258;ood- ing or gas leak, which can either cause damage or disturbance to the blast furnace operation. For example, a <b>Flow-out</b> coe&# 64259;cient (FL) was derived from the Fluid Dynamics theories to qualitatively predict the drainage behaviour, followed by a series of modi&# 64257;cations to tweak this number for di&# 64256;erent tapping conditions. However, the physical approaches do not provide su&# 64259;cient &# 64258;ow details for a better understanding of this phenomenon. Instead, to track the slag-gas surface during the drainage, Pinczewski et al. used the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to establish a two-dimensional numerical model. More numerical models were developed afterwards with more advanced discretisation and surface track methods. However, while modelling the tapping process, the dripping pattern has been constantly assumed uniform and even neglected particularly in evaluating the drainage e&# 64259;ciency. Even though, it was proven that gas drag can signi&# 64257;cantly bias the dripping pattern. In order to understand the e&# 64256;ects of the descending slag on the drainage behaviour, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was created within acommercial software package. Then, it was used to validate a latest modi&# 64257;cation of FL. Secondly, the current study extensively investigated the in&# 64258;uences of various dripping patterns on the slag-gas interface and the slag &# 64258;ow in the hearth. In agreement with the previous assumption that the uniform dripping pattern has limited e&# 64256;ects on the drainage behaviour, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that a wall-biased dripping pattern can e&# 64256;ectively reduce the residual ratio by 25 % and the accompanying changes in the slag &# 64258;ow.

30|$|In {{space science}} and solar physics, {{detailed}} {{dynamics of the}} severe space weather events are still poorly understood. In addition, because GICs have societal implications, {{it is important to}} know the frequency of occurrence of severe space weather events. Therefore, we need to investigate the properties of large solar eruptions that can trigger extreme space weather events and can also transport of high-energy solar particles to the Earth. Nine papers discuss these topics. First, four papers discuss the physical processes associated with extreme magnetospheric disturbances such as the Carrington storm of September 1859 (the largest magnetic storm on record) (Keika et al. 2015), the March 13 – 14, 1989 magnetic storm (Nagatsuma et al. 2015), and the sudden commencement (SC) in 1940 (the largest SC since 1868) (Araki 2014). Keika et al. (2015) discuss the rapid recovery of the Carrington storm that may have been caused by the <b>flow-out</b> of the ring current associated with fast magnetospheric plasma convection. Nagatsuma et al. (2015) describe magnetospheric processes such as a long duration of the geosynchronous magnetopause crossing during the March 1989 storm, which lacks interplanetary data. They estimate interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz of about − 50  nT and solar wind speed of about 960  km/s. Similar to the large SC study by Araki (2014), Kubota et al. (2015) study characteristics of large SCs modeled with a global magnetosphere–ionosphere coupled MHD simulation. Next, three papers deal with statistical studies of the magnetospheric disturbances. Nakamura et al. (2015) study the auroral electrojets, and Minamoto et al. (2015) address the magnetic storms and SCs observed by the Kakioka Magnetic Observatory. The frequencies of occurrence of severe space weather are useful not only to the scientists but also to society. Hayakawa et al. (2015) present the historical records of auroras observed during the Chinese dynasty (Song) in tenth–thirteenth centuries. The last two papers report the characteristics of extreme solar flares and associated interplanetary transport of the energetic solar particles. Maehara et al.

The solution of this problem {{is one of the}} challenges in ICE design. At the first stage a three-dimensional model of the small-sized ICE was created in the modern SolidWorks package for designing. Then an internal volume of the engine flow path was designed by means subtraction operations of volumes. The flow path of the engine was cut into nine volumes according to authors’ developed technique to prepare three-dimensional models for imposing the grid elements. Design of grid based on the Workbench platform was created in the ANSYS Meshing grid generator. When specifying the grid parameters the choice was as follows: a range of grid element sizes within 0. 5 – 1. 5 mm, a growth gradient of grid elements equal to 1. 05, and a type of the final element is tetrahedron. For correctly working option of layer-by-layer update of grid, the grid element of 0. 5 mm in size and the type of the final element being a hexahedron were specified for calculating the cylinder and sub-piston area in volume. Boundary surfaces of inlet to the flow path and working <b>flow-out</b> of it were defined as well. Names and boundary conditions of permeability (Interface) are automatically appropriated to coinciding surfaces of various volumes. To ensure desirable accuracy of calculations the model of turbulence k-εwas chosen, which is relevant to this task. In menu of entering the boundary conditions, desirable parameters at the model borders were specified. Further, grid intersection zones were adjusted. This adjustment is necessary to have a moving grid and adjust a permeability of borders between the predicted zones. Adjusting the moving grid parameters and specifying a dynamic model of the moving grid and its key parameters were performed too. Options gave parameters for a scheme of the moving grid. Rotation of the engine shaft was set by the user function (UDF function). Distribution fields of key parameters in the flow path of the small-sized ICE, such as pressure, temperature, speed, and structure of composition of working medium were resulted from calculations. As a result of modelling, values of power and fuel efficiency of the smallsized engine were calculated. Calculation results were stored as an animation of distribution fields of appropriate thermodynamic parameters and in the table format as a dependence of average parameters of pressure and temperature on the angle of rotation of the engine shaft. Due to complexity of indexing performance at the test bench of the small-sized piston engine, a decision was made to carry out a verification of calculation results for engine capacity. Verification of the numerical research results conducted according to given technique has shown that a maximum error of calculated power under various operating conditions is 8. 5 % at most (averagely, 6. 2 %), that is quite acceptable when solving the problems of this class. </p...|$|E
