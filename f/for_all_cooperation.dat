40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse {{academic}} discourse from a supranational perspective, i. e. to investigate how the EU promotes its commitment in Education and Training through the Erasmus Programme which is meant to help “Europe’s universities and other institutions to work together towards modernising curricula, funding and governance of higher education”. The Programme also includes discourses covering different areas. For instance, a legal dimension can be found in the Erasmus University Charter, which provides the general framework <b>for</b> <b>all</b> European <b>cooperation</b> activities and sets out the fundamental principles and the minimum requirements with which the higher education institution must comply when implementing its activities.

40|$|Abstract—In {{tasks such}} as pursuit and evasion, {{multiple}} agents need to coordinate their behavior to achieve a common goal. An interesting question is, how can such behavior be best evolved? A powerful approach is to control the agents with neural networks, coevolve them in separate subpopulations, and test them together in the common task. In this paper, such a method, called Multia-gent Enforced SubPopulations (Multiagent ESP), is proposed and demonstrated in a prey-capture task. First, the approach is shown to be more efficient than evolving a single central controller <b>for</b> <b>all</b> agents. Second, <b>cooperation</b> {{is found to be}} most efficient through stigmergy, i. e., through role-based responses to the environment, rather than communication between the agents.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a cooperative, distributed form of MPC for linear systems subject to persistent, bounded disturbances. The distributed control agents make decisions locally and communicate plans with each other. Cooperation is promoted by consideration {{of a greater}} portion of the system-wide objective by each local agent; specifically, a local agent designs hypothetical plans for other agents, sacrificing local performance {{for the benefit of}} system-wide performance. These hypothetical plans are never communicated and no negotiation takes place. The method guarantees robust feasibility by permitting only one agent to optimize per time step, while 'freezing' the plans of others, and sufficient conditions are given for robust stability. These properties hold <b>for</b> <b>all</b> structures of <b>cooperation</b> between agents. Thus, a key feature is that coupled constraint satisfaction is compatible with inter-agent cooperation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{principles}} that NASA upholds is to cooperate with other nations to advance science, exploration, and discovery <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> Effective <b>cooperation</b> across cultures, however, requires {{a certain level of}} skill. A construct called cross-cultural competency (CCC) emphasizes that individuals are capable of acquiring skills that facilitate positive and cooperative interaction with people of another culture. While some aspects of CCC stem from stable individual traits such as personality (i. e., extraversion, tolerance for ambiguity), most components can be learned and strengthened over time (i. e., empathy, mindfulness, trust). Because CCC is such a vital part of international cooperation, this summer we will design a training program to cultivate these skills between student interns, their mentors, and the Ames community as a whole. First, we will research what specific competencies are valuable for anyone to have when working in an international setting. We will then design a series of activities, events, workshops, and discussions that target and strengthen those skills. Finally, we will use both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods to measure the success of the pilot program. This summer, the current international student interns will serve as our trial population for the program, while our goal is to launch the full program in Fall 2017. Overall, we hope to contribute to NASAs mission of optimizing international collaboration for everyone involved...|$|R

Although the process of transborder cooperation of towns exists also {{in other parts of the}} world, the roots of that complex form of cooperation appeared rather early in Western Europe. The area of Central Europe, especially the politically unstable southeastern part of the continent, are considerably late in this process. Serbia, especially its western and southern parts, is even more late in transborder regional cooperation of towns. The paper emphasizes that towns of Serbia, as development carriers with their intellectual potentials, have to express the ideas on starting the international actions. The possibilities are extensive: activation of neglected cooperation relations, improvement of technological and economical development, modernization of infrastructural systems, cooperation in culture, education, sports and recreation, environmental protection, etc. Towns need to find the ways <b>for</b> <b>all</b> kinds of <b>cooperation</b> with surrounding towns, if such cooperation gives the results which are favourable for both parties.

Currently there are about 4500 practitioners of this art affiliated in the national federation. Several have already produced excellent results not only in national but also in international competitions, recognized by the International Olympic Com-mittee of Portugal, Taekwondo European Union and the World Taekwondo Feder-ation (WTF). This work is a joint project between the University of Minho, Sporting Club de Braga Taekwondo section and the National Technical Team of the Portu-guese Federation of Taekwondo. It is aimed at developing a system to analyse, mon-itor and quantify the athlete performance in real time. The developed system should be able to help the athlete improve his/her technique and performance by monitoring his/her heart rate, analyzing and identifying the technical movements in the training by comparing the various movements performed, as well as quantifying variables related to the athlete’s performance. Visual cues for the heart rate and performance are indicated by LEDs. With this system, we propose a contribution to innovation and development in Taekwondo training.
