50|$|The unified {{numbering}} system (UNS) is an alloy designation system widely accepted in North America. It {{consists of a}} prefix letter and five digits designating a material composition. For example, a prefix of S indicates stainless steel alloys, C indicates copper, brass, or bronze alloys, T indicates tool steels, and so on. The first 3 digits often match older 3-digit {{numbering system}}s, while the last 2 digits indicate more modern variations. For example, Copper Alloy No. 377 (forging brass) in the original 3-digit system became C37700 in the UNS System. The UNS is managed jointly by the ASTM International and SAE International.

50|$|When {{performing}} a fracture toughness test, {{the most common}} test specimen configurations are the single edge notch bend (SENB or three-point bend), and the compact tension (CT) specimens. From the above discussion, {{it is clear that}} an accurate determination of the plane-strain fracture toughness requires a specimen whose thickness exceeds some critical thickness (B). Testing has shown that plane-strain conditions generally prevail when:When a material of unknown fracture toughness is tested, a specimen of <b>full</b> <b>material</b> section thickness is tested or the specimen is sized based on a prediction of the fracture toughness. If the fracture toughness value resulting from the test does not satisfy the requirement of the above equation, the test must be repeated using a thicker specimen. In addition to this thickness calculation, test specifications have several other requirements that must be met (such as the size of the shear lips) before a test can be said to have resulted in a KIC value.|$|E
40|$|A phase-field based {{topology}} optimization approach is {{considered for the}} maximum stiffness or minimum compliance problem.

In the present contribution, an additional term representing the cost of interfaces at external boundaries is added to the functional subject to minimization.

The method is implemented in a finite element setting and numerical simulations of typical structures are considered.

40|$|Input-Output {{models of}} various types of prices. Prices are derived as {{characteristic}} vectors of certain kinds of matrices and price parameters as their characteristic roots. The most general are the three-channel prices that are characteristic vectors of the linear combination of matrices of the <b>full</b> <b>material</b> input coefficients, full capital-output coefficients and full workers consumption coefficients. From the general three-channel prices two types of two-channel prices are derived. The special 'extreme' cases or the 'singe-channel' prices are the labor- value prices that are proportional to full labor costs, the N-income prices that are proportional to <b>full</b> <b>material</b> costs and the F-income prices that are proportional to full capital-output ratios. The special intermediate cases are the cost-prices and the production-prices.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} using different material testing approaches to determine material properties of timber utility poles from two hardwood tree species, i. e. Spotted Gum and Tallowwood. The material properties investigated are the Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), the Modulus of Rupture (MOR) and the compression strength (CS) in longitudinal direction as well as radial and tangential directions of the {{cross section of the}} poles. These material properties are needed for the accurate modelling of timber poles using Finite Element Method (FEM) for the study of stress wave propagation and damage detection in timber utility poles. In open literatures, for most timber species such comprehensive material property data are scarce to find. Typically, material properties available are only in the longitudinal direction. Furthermore, most international standards cover only details on material testing in longitudinal direction and no coherent nor comprehensive guidelines are given for the testing of the full orthotropic material properties of timber. Hence, an extensive study is deemed necessary to investigate a suitable approach to determine <b>full</b> <b>material</b> properties of timber. Two hardwood timber species, namely Spotted Gum and Tallowwood are selected for this investigation. Beside <b>full</b> <b>material</b> properties, the investigation is extended to examine different material testing approaches (bending, compression and tension testing) for the determination of the same material properties. The presented material testing is conducted on numerous small clear specimens as well as on four full scale 5 m long timber pole specimens of the two mentioned hardwood tree species...|$|E

Since finite strains {{is considered the}} definition of the stiffness is not unique. In the present contribution, the objective of the optimization is minimization of the end-displacement for a given amount of material. The problem is regularized using the phase-field approach which leads to that the optimality criterion is defined by a second order partial differential equation. Both the elastic boundary value problem and the optimality criterion is solved using the finite element method. To approach the optimal state a steepest descent approach is utilized. The interfaces between void and <b>full</b> <b>material</b> are resolved using an adaptive finite element scheme.

Those scale models are built in order to qualify or quantify, under real or artificial skies, the daylight penetration and distribution in buildings. The essential photometric and colorimetric parameters that influence the light reflection and transmission of building materials were identified and several methods, for the qualitative and the quantitative evaluation of these parameters were studied. As a result of this study, the web tool proposes two input possibilities.
