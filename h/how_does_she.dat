[...] In 2010, Game Informer included her among the palette swap characters not wanted by {{them in the future}} Mortal Kombat games, later describing her in the 2011 game as being [...] "as creepy as ever." [...] When American radio host Howard Stern mocked a Mortal Kombat fan who admitted that he masturbates to Mileena, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer called the latter [...] "insane" [...] as [...] "onanism and Mileena should not mix."

[...] GameDaily praised the [...] "superb fashion sense" [...] of Soulcaliburs Taki by contrasting her with Mileena. Writing about [...] "outdated and cringe-worthy representations of women in video games" [...] in 2012, MMGN's Nathan Misa stated: [...] "Look, I like Lara Croft's booty shorts or Mileena's two...deadly sais as much as every other guy, but why not have more than virtual polygons to ogle at?"

60|$|Elma {{glanced back}} in his face, and {{wondered}} to herself, too. Now she came to think of it, <b>HOW</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> know that handsome young man, with the charming features, and the expressive eyes, and the neatly-cut brown beard, and the attractive manner, was an artist at all, or anything like it? And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> know the snake was his model? For the life of her, she couldn't have answered those questions herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And she--what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> say? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> bear it?" [...] asked Jean, {{feeling in}} her own woman's heart how deeply Lucia's must have been wounded by that avowal.|$|R

6000|$|... “Now, honestly,” Lon said, {{with one}} of his {{lightning}} changes, “you’ve seen her, {{what do you think of}} her—of her looks, I mean? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> strike your beauty sense?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Babie? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> look? I am {{ashamed of}} it; but I can't help {{thinking}} more about seeing her than this new cousin. I can fancy her—-handsome, composed, and serene." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God! {{then there}} is one honest chap among the owners. And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> behave? Had you any trouble with the pirates?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{excellent}} prices! Still, {{she probably}} deserves all she gains. It would cost {{a good deal}} to bring flour up. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> get it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, {{bowed to}} Father Conmee from the farther {{footpath}} along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R

6000|$|Selina went on {{with her}} hints {{in the same way}} as before. [...] "How does she know--ah, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> know?" [...] was the vocal part of the {{performance}} this time. My clever inquiries followed the vocal part as before: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear little mistress! <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> behave?" [...] asked Phebe, {{longing for}} news, but too {{grateful}} to ask at headquarters, remembering how generously Rose {{had tried to}} help her, even by silence, the greatest sacrifice a woman can make at such interesting periods.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How distressing! How wretched! It {{would have}} killed me long before! <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> bear it? I know it was patiently, but I cannot {{understand}} it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So that is it. Then he has let the cat {{out of the}} bag at last, Hawtrey; that is {{a comfort}} anyhow. And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> take it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because your {{grandmother}} is dead!' And they ran and told their father. Then the man {{came up and}} said to Mohammed: 'What was the matter? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> die?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{flambeau}} glares still {{within a}} yard, held up in a park-keeper's hand; its long eager tongue of flame almost licks {{the figure of}} the Expected--there--where she stands full in my sight.

6000|$|... "Blockhead!" [...] exclaimed the irate Osman, who was {{a sturdy}} but ill-favoured {{specimen}} of Moslem humanity. [...] "Of course I know that, but <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> escape over the wall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> get it? Never mind. I'm {{not going}} to set you against her, if you're her {{favourite}} for the moment. She has a niece with her there,--hasn't she?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'We met Mr Carker the Junior in the street, queerer than ever.
