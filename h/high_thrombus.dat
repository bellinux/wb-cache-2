50|$|The {{specific}} {{cause is}} dependent {{of the type}} of TMA that is presented, but the two main pathways that lead to TMA are external triggers of vascular injury, such as viruses, bacterial Shiga toxins or endotoxins, antibodies, and drugs; and congenital predisposing conditions, including decreased levels of tissue factors necessary for the coagulation cascade. Either of these pathways will result in decreased endothelial thromboresistance, leukocyte adhesion to damaged endothelium, complement consumption, enhanced vascular shear stress, and abnormal vWF fragmentation. The central and primary event in this progression is injury to the endothelial cells, which reduces the production of prostaglandin and prostacyclin, ultimately resulting in the loss of physiological thromboresistance, or <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> formation rate in blood vessels. Leukocyte adhesion to the damaged endothelial wall and abnormal von Willebrand factor (or vWF) release can also contribute to the increase in thrombus formation. More recently, researchers have attributed both TTP and HUS to targeted agents, such as targeted cancer therapies, immunotoxins, and anti-VEGF therapy.|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association between electrocardiographic (ECG) grade III ischemia and angiographic thrombus burden in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). Methods: The study population consisted of 307 patients with STEMI. Baseline ECGs of the patients were analyzed for grade III ischemia; angiographic thrombus burden was assessed by thrombolysis in myocardial infarction thrombus classification. Results: A total of 108 (35 %) patients had low thrombus burden whereas 199 (65 %) patients had <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> bur-den.

Material/Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 780 patients who underwent PPCI in our clinic due to STEMI. Clinical, laboratory, and demographic properties of the patients were recorded. Angiographic coronary thrombus burden was clas-sified using thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) thrombus grades. Results: Patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden were older, with higher diabetes prevalence longer pain to balloon time, higher leukocyte count, higher admission troponin, and admission CK-MB concentrations. SYNTAX score was higher and myocardial perfusion grades were lower in patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden. Multivariate lo-gistic regression analysis revealed SYNTAX score as the strongest predictor of thrombus burden.

The determinants and prognostic implications of SMR and {{its relationship with the}} histopathology of the rescued thrombus were evaluated in 601 patients with acute myocardial infarction showing ST elevation and pre-procedural total occlusion of the infarct-related artery (TIMI flow 0). Two groups were considered according to the presence of SMR, defined as the visualization of contrast material after crossing the occlusion with the guide wire. SMR was achieved in 303 patients (50. 4 %) and was found to be associated with less time to treatment (248 vs. 286 minutes; p = 0. 001), less deteriorated initial left ventricular function and shock at admission (9. 2 vs. 16. 4 %; p = 0. 008), higher successful rate (94. 7 % vs. 78. 5 %; p < 0, 0001) and of <b>higher</b> rate of <b>thrombus</b> rescue: 70 / 81 vs. 27 / 79 patients (p < 0. 0001).

BackgroundBoth clinical and angiographic features influence risk of PCIs. MethodsPercutaneous coronary interventions performed between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1999, were analyzed. Logistic regression and bootstrap methods were used to create an integer risk score for estimating the risk of procedural complications using baseline, angiographic and procedural characteristics. The risk score was tested in a validation-set consisting of all procedures performed in the year 2000. ResultsAmong 5, 463 procedures, 5 clinical and 3 angiographic variables were significantly correlated with procedural complications: cardiogenic shock, left main coronary artery disease, severe renal disease, urgent or emergent procedure, congestive heart failure class III or <b>higher,</b> <b>thrombus,</b> multivessel disease and older age. In the validation-set, the model fitted the data adequately; the average receiver operating characteristic curve area was 0. 782 (standard deviation, 0. 018).

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether thrombectomy during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden improves myocardial reperfusion and reduces infarct size. Background: Thrombectomy aims at reducing distal thrombotic embolization during pPCI, improving myocardial reperfusion and clinical outcome. Methods: We randomized 208 patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden in a 1 : 1 ratio to either pPCI with thrombectomy (Group T) or standard pPCI (Group S). Thrombectomy was performed with either rheolytic or manual aspiration catheters. Three-month magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess infarct size and transmurality and microvascular obstruction (MVO). The primary endpoints were ST-segment elevation resolution (STR) > 70 % at 60 min and 3 -month infarct size. Results: The baseline profile was similar between groups, except for a higher rate of initial Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 in Group S (p = 0. 002). Group T showed a significantly higher rate of STR (57. 4 % vs. 37. 3 %; p = 0. 004) and of final myocardial blush 3 (68. 3 % vs. 52. 9 %; p = 0. 03). Group T and Group S did not differ with regard to infarct size (20. 4 ± 10. 5 % vs. 19. 3 ± 10. 6 %; p = 0. 54) and transmurality (11. 9 ± 12. 0 % vs. 11. 6 ± 12. 7 %; p = 0. 92), but Group T showed significantly less MVO (11. 4 % vs. 26. 7 %; p = 0. 02) and a higher prevalence of inhomogeneous scar (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Objectives: To compare {{angiographic}} {{and optical}} coherence tomography (OCT) data pertinent to thrombi, along with the histologic characteristics of aspirated thrombi in patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with or without inflammation, as assessed by C-reactive protein (CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Methods: In the OCTAVIA (Optical Coherence Tomography Assessment of Gender Diversity in Primary Angioplasty) study, 140 patients with STEMI referred for primary percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The patients underwent OCT assessment of the culprit vessel, along with blood sampling of CRP and MPO, and histologic analysis of the thrombus. Results: Biomarkers were available for 129 patients, and histology and immunohistochemistry of the thrombi were available for 78 patients. Comparisons were made using the median thresholds of CRP and MPO (2. 08 mg/L and 604. 124 ng/mL, respectively). There was no correlation between CRP and MPO levels in the whole population (p = 0. 685). Patients with high CRP levels had <b>higher</b> <b>thrombus</b> grades and more frequent TIMI flow 0 / 1 compared with those with low CRP levels (5 [1 st quartile 3; 3 rd quartile 5] vs. 3. 5 mg/L [1; 5], p = 0. 007, and 69. 3 vs. 48. 5 %, p = 0. 04, respectively). Patients with high MPO levels more commonly had early thrombi than had those with low MPO levels (42. 5 vs. 20. 0 %, p = 0. 04).

40|$|A {{real-time}} and biocompatible {{flow control}} technique for microchannel based physiological experiments has been developed. Current micro flow control techniques {{are limited in}} their ability to develop physiological waveforms and maintain high flow accuracy. The new technique provides accurate real time flow control of steady and user specified complex waveforms. This low impact flow control technique offers high adaptability {{for a wide range of}} frequencies and flow rates. The system is highly scalable as the operating parameters rely on the scale of specific components. A prototype system was constructed incorporating a constant air pressure source to supply the base flow rate, a compact, disposable flow probe to measure the flow rate and a real time feedback control system to drive a fluid control valve. The fluid control valve allows for finer control over the base flow by pinching the silicone tube carrying the flow. Performance tests were completed for this prototype, showing a steady flow error of 1. 2 %. The optimum pulsatile range was for oscillations between 1 – 3 Hz. For sinusoidal waveforms within this range the total harmonic distortion was under 2 % and the root mean square error was under 8 %. Micro PIV and thrombus growth experiments were completed to demonstrate the capacity of this flow control systems ability to be used in microchannel based physiological experiments. Micro PIV results indicate that viscous forces affect the flow profile within a high aspect ratio microchannel with fluid viscosity of 4 x 10 - 3 N. s/m 2 and a Womersley number between 0. 117 and 0. 2925. Thrombus growth experiments comparing the pulsatile flow with steady flow at the microchannel wall showed that pulsatile flow promoted <b>higher</b> <b>thrombi</b> growth. It was hypothesised that pulsatile velocities varying between 33. 1 and 67. 5 mm/s in a platelet rich region would significantly promote the development of thrombi...|$|R
40|$|Background: Limited {{data are}} {{available}} on the impact and safety of fibrinolytic therapy (FT) in left - side prosthetic valve acute thrombosis (PVAT). Study objective: To improve our knowledge about the FT role in left -side PVAT. Design: Bibliographic search and analysis. Methods: MEDLINE search from January 1970 to January 2007. Studies were classified according to the evidence level recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians and included if they had objective diagnosis of leftside PAVT and FT efficacy assessment (hemodynamic, echocardiographic or fluoroscopic improvement). New York Heart Association class was used to establish functional state. Data on clinical characteristics, diagnosis strategy, anticoagulation status, fibrinolytic and heparin regimens, cardiovascular adverse events, outcome, and follow-up were also required. Results: A systematic search produced a total of 900 references. Each abstract was analyzed according to the predetermined criteria. Thirty-two references with 904 patients constitute the subject of this analysis. Only one trial had evidence III and thirty-one evidence V. FT was more used in young female patients (64 %) with prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis (77 %), and clinical instability (82 %). Transesophageal echocardiogram had a <b>higher</b> <b>thrombus</b> detection rate (100 %). Although several fibrinolytic regimens were used in a first or second course, streptokinase was the most frequent agent (61 %). Clinical improvement was observed in 86 % of the patients, objective success in 78 %, and failure in 14 %. Rescue fibrinolysis was done in 17 %. Complications: peripheral and cerebral embolism rate was 5 % and 4 %, respectively. Major bleeding 4 % and intracranial hemorrhage 1 %.

40|$|Fibrin {{targeting}} is {{an attractive}} strategy for nuclear imaging of thrombosis, atherosclerosis and cancer. Recently, FibPep, an (111) In-labeled fibrin-binding peptide, was established as a tracer for fibrin SPECT imaging and was reported to allow sensitive detection of minute thrombi in mice using SPECT. In this study, we developed EPep, a novel (111) In-labeled fibrin-binding peptide containing the fibrin-binding domain of the clinically verified EP- 2104 R peptide, and sought to compare the potential of EPep and FibPep as tracers for fibrin SPECT imaging. In vitro, both EPep and FibPep showed high stability in serum, but were less stable in liver and kidney homogenate assays. Both peptide probes displayed comparable affinities toward human and mouse derived fibrin (Kd ≈ 1 μM), and similarly to FibPep, EPep showed fast blood clearance, low nontarget uptake and <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> uptake (6. 8 ± 1. 2 % ID g(- 1)) in a mouse carotid artery thrombosis model. Furthermore, EPep showed a similar affinity toward rat derived fibrin (Kd ≈ 1 μM), displayed <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> uptake in a rat carotid artery thrombosis model (0. 74 ± 0. 39 % ID g(- 1)), and allowed sensitive detection of thrombosis in rats using SPECT. In contrast, FibPep displayed a significantly lower affinity toward rat derived fibrin (Kd ≈ 14 μM) and low uptake in rat thrombi (0. 06 ± 0. 02 % ID g(- 1)) and did not allow clear visualization of carotid artery thrombosis in rats using SPECT. These results were confirmed ex vivo by autoradiography, which showed a 7 -fold higher ratio of activity in the thrombus over the contralateral carotid artery for EPep in comparison to FibPep. These {{findings suggest that the}} FibPep binding fibrin epitope is not fully homologous between humans and rats, and that preclinical rat models of disease should not be employed to gauge the clinical potential of FibPep. In conclusion, both peptides showed approximately similar metabolic stability and affinity toward human and mouse derived fibrin, and displayed <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> uptake in a mouse carotid artery thrombosis model. Therefore, both EPep and FibPep are promising fibrin targeted tracers for translation into clinical settings to serve as novel tools for molecular imaging of fibri...|$|E
40|$|Background Distal {{embolization}} during primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCls), {{may affect}} myocardial reperfusion. We evaluated the prevalence and features of embolization during primary PCI {{and its relationship}} with clinical and angiographic variables. Methods Forty-six consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent primary PCI with a filter-based distal protection device. Histopathologic analysis was performed on retrieved embolic fragments, assessing the presence and relative amount of fibrin, necrosis, lipid droplets, collagen, mucopolysaccharides, and leukocytes, {{as well as the}} total debris volume. Such variables were related to baseline clinical and angiographic variables. Results Embolic material was recovered in 41 (89 %) of 46 cases, with a mean total debris volume of 1. 2 +/- 2. 2 mm(3) Prevalent histopathologic patterns were organized thrombus (47 %),. fresh thrombus (29 %), and plaque fragments (24 %). At multivariate analysis, none of the baseline clinical variables considered significantly predicted the total debris volume. Among angiographic variables, angiographic signs of <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden (cut-off coronary occlusion pattern or large intracoronary minus image) independently predicted the total debris volume at multivariate analysis, (odds ratio 15. 8, P. 20), or its qualitative composition.

40|$|Background: Deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) is a potentially progressive disease with complex clinical sequelae. The clinical practice {{guidelines of the}} American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend various treatments for all patients with objectively proven DVT. This study retrospectively compares enoxaparin with CDT on treatment efficacy and safety {{and the evolution of}} acute proximal DVT in the lower limbs. Methods: This study comprised 53 patients with acute proximal DVT, who received either CDT followed by intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) or adjusted subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin) for 7 – 14 days. Warfarin was administered to all patients for at least 6 months. The study endpoints included the evolution of DVT and treatment efficacy and safety, which were assessed with frequent duplex ultrasounds, plethysmography, and venography. The mean duration of the follow-up was 15. 2 months. Results: In the CDT group, patency of the iliofemoral vein segment was observed in 42. 3 % of the patients after 1 week (p <  0. 001) and in 69. 2 % after 6 months. In the control group, patency was present in 15. 4 % of the patients after 3 months and in 38. 5 % after 6 months (p =  0. 05). Femoral venous obstruction was found in 30. 8 % of CDT patients and in 61. 5 % of the control group (p =  0. 05). Furthermore, femoral venous insufficiency was present in 46. 2 % of the CDT group and 53. 9 % of the control group after 6 months (p =  0. 587).

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether AAAs with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> signal intensity (SI) at T 1 -weighted (T 1 w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibit a faster aneurysm growth rate. MethodsThis was a prospective follow-up study. Patients with a small AAA underwent MRI examinations at 6 month intervals. Aneurysm thrombus and psoas muscle SI at the point of maximal diameter on T 1 w images were measured and expressed as a ratio (thrombus SI/muscle SI). Based on these measurements, patients were categorized into three groups: AAA with relative thrombus SI above (group A) and below (group B) the mean relative thrombus SI of 1. 20. Patients with AAA without thrombus constituted group C. Eight patients were scanned twice within 2 weeks to investigate scan–rescan reproducibility. Aneurysm growth rates were expressed as the change in maximal cross sectional area (cm 2). ResultsA total of 35 patients (m/f: 26 / 9; age 72  ±  7 years; AAA maximal diameter 4. 9  ±  0. 5  cm) were included. Mean aneurysm growth rate for patients in group A (n =  11, 1. 87  cm 2 / 0. 5  year) was two-fold higher than group B (n =  17, 0. 78  cm 2 / 0. 5  year, p = . 005) and eight-fold higher than group C (n =  7, 0. 23  cm 2 / 0. 5  years, p = . 004) at 6 months' follow-up. At 12 months' follow-up, the mean aneurysm growth rate remained significantly higher in group A (n =  7, 3. 03  cm 2 /year) than groups B (n =  10, 1. 63  cm 2 /year, p = . 03) and C (n =  7, 0. 73  cm 2 /year, p = . 004).

On immediate transfer to the catheterization laboratory for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI), coronary angiogram showed proximal left anterior descending (LAD) thrombotic occlusion. In consideration of her history of glucose- 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and "loss of consciousness" at a young age after taking aspirin, which contraindicated aspirin therapy, we treated this patient using a new, two-step strategy, with an emergency minimalist intervention using manual thrombectomy and intracoronary glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIbIIIa) inhibition with abciximab. Subsequent angiography control confirmed the persistence of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial (TIMI) grade 3 flow and the presence of an intermediate proximal LAD coronary lesion, which was not treated, also due to the persisting contraindication to aspirin.

We reviewed the clinical information of 169 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy. Overall and cancer-specific survival rates were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to investigate the potential prognostic factors. Results. The median survival time was 63 months. The five-year overall survival and cancer-specific survival rate were 53. 6 % and 54. 4 % for all patients. For all patients, significant survival difference was only observed between early (below hepatic vein) and advanced (above hepatic vein) tumor thrombus. However, significant differences existed between both RV/IVC and early/advanced tumor thrombus groups in N 0 M 0 patients.

We used AngioCT data from 74 patients, aged 55 ± 10 years, after endovascular procedure to prepare 3 D geometries of stent-grafts. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to reconstruct blood hemodynamic and simulate thrombus formation. Next, geometric parameters of stent-grafts included the ratio of volume of upper part to the bifurcations, the relation of inlet and outlet diameters of a stent-graft and deformations in the iliac part of the stent-graft were analyzed. We also analyzed tortuosities (spiral twisting of the flow around the flow direction) and bends (the largest angulation in distal part of a stent-graft). The CFD results were confronted with AngioCT data to verify if computer generated thrombus appeared in particular patient. Additionally, geometric parameters of analyzed stent-grafts were used to propose a mathematical tool for prediction of thrombus appearance. The results showed that tortuosities and bends of a stent-graft had the <b>highest</b> impact on <b>thrombus</b> formation. Formation of thrombi was observed in 22 % to 31 % of cases (at blood hematocrit Hct = 40 %) even for small values of tortuosities and bends indicating that these parameters are dominant in determining blood clotting. Our calculated results overlapped with clinical data in 80 % to 91 %. Therefore, we conclude that tortuosities and bends have <b>high</b> impact on <b>thrombus</b> formation and should be under special attention during stent-graft recommendation and patients' follow-ups...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 62 -year-old male was {{undergoing}} treatment of NHL with bone marrow involvement with thrombocytopenia. After 15 min of starting of IV infusion of rituximab, he started having severe retrosternal chest pain, diagnosed as acute ST elevation inferior wall MI. Patient was pre-loaded with dual anti platelets. Coronary angiogram showed 100 % occlusion of proximal RCA. Thrombosuction of this culprit RCA revealed underlying 90 % stenosis. After that, PCI with balloon angioplasty of RCA was done. The procedure was terminated {{in the view}} of successful balloon angioplasty with good TIMI flow. He was kept on dual antiplatelet therapy for one month with regular platelet monitoring. With the growing increasing global use of rituximab for various oncological and immunological diseases, this complication of myocardial infarction should be kept in mind.

Angiography showed occluded right coronary artery with extensive thrombus burden. There was no significant left coronary artery disease. Due to failure of thromboaspiration and angiojet from the previous attempt 2 years previously, intracoronary thrombolysis with streptokinase was administered via thromboaspiration catheter. Following intracoronary thrombolysis, aspiration catheter was able to retrieve the majority of thrombi and achieved thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow {{at the end of}} the procedure with resolution of transient ST elevation. This case demonstrated that the use of adjunctive intracoronary thrombolysis and manual aspiration in a patient presenting with myocardial infarction with heavy thrombus burden might be useful in selected cases. <Learning objective: The use of adjunctive intracoronary thrombolysis and manual aspiration in a patient presenting with myocardial infarction with heavy thrombus burden might be useful in selected cases. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{percutaneous}} {{treatment of}} saphenous vein graft lesions containing angiographically massive thrombus {{is associated with}} a high risk of distal embolisation and no-reflow. The optimal management for these lesions remains unclear and a challenge to the interventional cardiologist. Five cases are described in whom the risks of percutaneous angioplasty were felt to be excessive owing to a <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> load. Each case was treated with a bolus and infusion of abciximab (ReoPro; Eli Lilly—a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist) at least 24  hours before further angiography. Repeat angiography of the culprit vein graft, following treatment with abciximab alone, demonstrated a major reduction in the thrombus score and the presence of TIMI 3  flow in each case. Immediately following repeat angiography, angioplasty with stent insertion was performed successfully with no distal embolisation or no-reflow phenomenon.

40|$|Approximately 30 % of strokes are cryptogenic {{despite an}} {{exhaustive}} in-hospital work-up. Analysis of clot composition following endovascular treatment could {{provide insight into}} stroke etiology. T-cells already {{have been shown to}} be a major component of vulnerable atherosclerotic carotid lesions. We therefore hypothesize that T-cell content in intracranial thrombi may also be a biomarker of atherothrombotic origin. We histopathologically investigated 54 consecutive thrombi retrieved after mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke patients. First, thrombi were classified as fibrin-dominant, erythrocyte-dominant or mixed pattern. We then performed quantitative analysis of CD 3 + cells on immunohistochemically-stained thrombi and compared T-cell content between "atherothrombotic", "cardioembolism" and "other causes" stroke subtypes. Fourteen (26 %) thrombi were defined as fibrin-dominant, 15 (28 %) as erythrocyte-dominant, 25 (46 %) as mixed. The stroke cause was defined as "atherothrombotic" in 10 (18. 5 %), "cardioembolism" in 25 (46. 3 %), and "other causes" in 19 (35. 2 %). Number of T-cells was significantly <b>higher</b> in <b>thrombi</b> from the "atherothrombotic" group (53. 60 ± 28. 78) than in the other causes (21. 77 ± 18. 31; p< 0. 0005) or the "cardioembolism" group (20. 08 ± 15. 66; p< 0. 0003).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to relate the various {{clinical}} presentations of acute coronary syndromes to the underlying plaque morphology as assessed from histopathologic analysis of plaque fragments obtained by directional coronary atherectomy (DCA). BACKGROUND: Autopsy studies have shown that unstable angina and infarction are related to plaque instability and involve events such as fissure or rupture of the fibrous cap, thrombosis and inflammation. The clinical severity and prognosis of acute coronary syndromes can be estimated by the Braunwald classification of unstable angina. Whether plaque morphology can be related to the Braunwald classification has not been evaluated. METHODS: Plaque fragments were obtained by DCA in 75 patients: 38 with unstable angina, 19 with stable angina and 18 with no symptoms after infarction. The presence of fibrous tissue, <b>thrombus,</b> <b>high</b> cellularity, inflammatory cells, atheroma, neovessels and "stellar-shaped" smooth muscle cells was evaluated in 7 -micron thick sections by appropriate staining. The patients were classified according to clinical presentation without knowledge of the results of pathologic examination, and a plaque instability score was assigned. The risk of further cardiac events was classified as low, medium or high. RESULTS: Increasing severity of the score of unstable angina was associated with increasing prevalence of <b>thrombus,</b> <b>high</b> cellularity, atheroma and neovessels. Plaque from patients with unstable angina considered to be at low risk of further events appeared very similar to that of patients with stable angina, whereas the specific morphologic characteristics of plaque instability were more frequently observed as the clinical score and the risk of further events increased. After thrombolyzed infarction, plaque morphology depends on the delay between the acute event and DCA. Within 1 week after infarction, plaque still showed the morphologic characteristics of instability, whereas late DCA provided samples with morphologic features similar to those observed in patients with stable angina. CONCLUSIONS: The morphologic features of plaque fragments vary at different stages of acute coronary disease. The specific features of plaque instability correlate with the clinical scoring system of the Braunwald classification...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—: Thrombus {{aspiration}} during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for {{the treatment}} of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with STEMI. METHODS—: Included were large (N≥ 1000) randomized controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy vs. PCI alone in patients with STEMI. Individual patient data was provided by the leadership of each trial. The pre-specified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular (CV) mortality within 30 days and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 30 days. RESULTS—: The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS, TASTE and TOTAL) enrolled 19, 047 patients, of whom 18, 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. CV death at 30 days occurred in 221 (2. 4 %) of 9155 patients randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 (2. 9 %) of 9151 randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 70 - 1. 01, p= 0. 06). Stroke or TIA occurred in 66 (0. 8 %) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 46 (0. 5 %) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio [OR] 1. 43 95 % CI 0. 98 - 2. 1, p= 0. 06). There {{were no significant differences in}} recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden (TIMI thrombus grade ≥ 3) thrombus aspiration was associated with less CV death (170 [2. 5 %] vs. 205 [3. 1 %] HR 0. 80; 95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 98, p = 0. 03), and with more stroke or TIA (55 [0. 9 %] vs. 34 [0. 5 %] OR 1. 56; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 42, p= 0. 04). However, the interaction p-values were 0. 32 and 0. 34, respectively. CONCLUSIONS—: Routine thrombus aspiration during STEMI PCI did not improve clinical outcomes. In the <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden subgroup the trends toward reduced CV death and increased stroke or TIA provide a rationale for future trials of improved thrombus aspiration technologies in this high-risk subgroup.

40|$|Background. Insufficient {{data are}} {{available}} on the potential benefit of selective aspiration and clinical predictors for no-reflow in STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) adjunct with aspiration thrombectomy. Objective. The aim of our study was to investigate clinical predictors for insufficient reperfusion in patients with <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden treated with PPCI and manual aspiration thrombectomy. Methods. From January 2011 till December 2015, 277 STEMI patients undergoing manual aspiration thrombectomy and PPCI were selected and 202 patients with a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) thrombus grade 4 ~ 5 were eventually involved in our study. According to a cTFC value, patients were divided into Group I (cTFC > 40), namely, insufficient reperfusion group; Group II (cTFC ≤ 40), namely, sufficient reperfusion group. Results. Univariate analysis showed that hypertension, multivessel disease, time from symptom to PCI (≧ 4. 8 hours), and postaspiration cTFC > 40 were negative predictors for insufficient reperfusion. After multivariate adjustment, age ≧ 60 years, hypertension, time from symptom to PCI (≧ 4. 8 hours), and postaspiration cTFC > 40 were independently associated with insufficient reperfusion in STEMI patients treated with manual aspiration thrombectomy. Upfront intracoronary GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Tirofiban) was positively associated with improved myocardial reperfusion. Conclusion.

40|$|Aims We {{sought to}} {{identify}} predictors of distal embolization (DE) occurring during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (p-PCI) {{as well as}} to assess its impact on both myocardial reperfusion and necrosis, according to time-to-treatment. Methods and results Clinical and angiographic characteristics were prospectively assessed in 400 consecutive patients who underwent p-PCI, in order to identify predictors of DE. The impact of DE on Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow, myocardial blush, and troponin I (TnI) was assessed according to symptom onset-to-balloon time. DE occurred in 64 (16 %) patients and did not change with time-to-treatment (P = 0. 87). The occlusion pattern of infarct-related artery (IRA), treatment of right coronary artery, higher TIMI thrombus score, longer lesion, and large IRA diameter were predictors of DE. The rate of TIMI 0 / 1 and myocardial blush 0 / 1 was higher in patients exhibiting DE when time-to-treatment was ≤ 6 h (P < 0. 0001), while TnI was higher in patients with DE when time-to-treatment was < 3 h. Conclusion DE during p-PCI occurs more often in the presence of <b>high</b> <b>thrombus</b> burden lesion. It reduces the effectiveness of myocardial reperfusion within 6 h and enhances myocardial damage within 3 h after symptom onset. Afterwards, it does not affect myocardial reperfusion or the extent of myocardial damage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgoundThe {{favorable}} {{effects of}} insulin during myocardial infarction (MI) remain unclear {{due to the}} divergence between mechanistic studies and clinical trials of exogenous insulin administration. The rs 7903146 polymorphism of the transcription factor 7 -like 2 (TCF 7 L 2) gene is associated with attenuated insulin secretion. MethodsIn non-diabetic patients with ST-elevation MI (STEMI), using such a model of genetically determined down-regulation of endogenous insulin secretion we investigated the change in plasma insulin, C-peptide, interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), C-reactive protein (CRP), and nitric oxide (NOx) levels between admission (D 1) and the fifth day after MI (D 5). Coronary angiography and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were performed at admission and 30 days after MI, respectively. Homeostasis Model Assessment estimated insulin secretion (HOMA 2 %β) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA 2 %S). ResultsAlthough glycemia did not differ between genotypes, carriers of the T-allele had lower HOMA 2 %β and higher HOMA 2 %S at both D 1 and D 5. As compared with non-carriers, T-allele carriers had higher plasma IL- 2 and CRP at D 5, <b>higher</b> intracoronary <b>thrombus</b> grade, lower FMD and NOx change between D 1 and D 5 and higher 30 -day mortality. ConclusionIn non-diabetic STEMI patients, the rs 7903146 TCF 7 L 2 gene polymorphism is associated with lower insulin secretion, worse endothelial function, higher coronary thrombotic burden, and higher short-term mortality.

However, currently used thrombus measurements are prone to inter-observer variability and oversimplify the heterogeneous thrombus composition. Our aim was first to introduce an automated method to assess the entire thrombus density and then to compare the measured entire thrombus density with respect to current standard manual measurements. In 135 AIS patients, the density distribution of the entire thrombus was determined. Density distributions were described using medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), kurtosis, and skewedness. Differences between the median of entire thrombus measurements and commonly applied manual measurements using 3 regions of interest were determined using linear regression. Density distributions varied considerably with medians ranging from 20. 0 to 62. 8 HU and IQRs ranging from 9. 3 to 55. 8 HU. The average median of the thrombus density distributions (43. 5 ± 10. 2 HU) was lower than the manual assessment (49. 6 ± 8. 0 HU) (p < 0. 05). The difference between manual measurements and median density of entire thrombus decreased with increasing density (r = 0. 64; p < 0. 05), revealing relatively higher manual measurements for low density thrombi such that manual density measurement tend overestimates the real thrombus density.
