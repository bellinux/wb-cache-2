MTV News praised the delivery of Minaj's verse, calling it structured like a nursery rhyme, musing that it [...] "sets {{the tone for the}} song (which is intense and hallucinatory) and the album". Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield praising the lyricism, describing it as witty, and wrote [...] "in 'Dark Fantasy,' West rhymes [...] "mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago" [...] with [...] "diablo," [...] "bravado" [...] and [...] "My chick in that new Phoebe Philo/So much head, <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Sleepy Hollow.

[...] In their guide to Carey's albums, Rolling Stone stated that [...] "Close My Eyes," [...] along with [...] "Butterfly" [...] and [...] "Breakdown," [...] were songs which indirectly spoke about her [...] "pending extraction from the tentacles" [...] of Mottola, who exercised his power over her as the head of Sony, the label to which Carey was signed.|$|E

500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> time." ...|$|E

60|$|As I {{had grown}} {{accustomed}} to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me.

I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the night,--like Camilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.|$|E
60|$|I had not shed a tear before, but now I cried tempestuously, and {{clung to}} him like a shipwrecked little mariner in a storm. Neither spoke, but he held me fast and let me cry myself to sleep; for, when the shower was over, a pensive peace fell upon me, and the dim old garret seemed not a prison, but a haven of refuge, since my boy came {{to share it with}} me. How long I slept I don't know, but it must have been an hour, at least; yet my good Christy never stirred, only waited patiently till <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the twilight, and was not afraid because he was there. He took me down as meek as a mouse, and kept me by him all that trying evening, {{screening}} me from jokes, rebukes, and sober looks; and when I went to bed he came up to kiss me, and to assure me that this awful circumstance should not be reported at home. This took a load off my heart, and I remember fervently thanking him, and telling him I never would forget it.|$|E

6000|$|You {{see how far}} my {{imagination}} had gone towards readjustment when Mary returned into my life. You see how strange and distant it was to meet her again, changed completely into the great lady she had intended to be, speaking to me with the restrained and practised charm {{of a woman who}} is young and beautiful and prominent and powerful and secure. There was no immediate sense of shock in that resumption of our broken intercourse, {{it seemed to me that}} night simply that something odd and curious had occurred. I do not remember how we parted that evening or whether we even saw each other after dinner was over, but from that hour forth Mary by insensible degrees resumed her old predominance in my mind. <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the night and thought about her, and next day I found myself thinking of her, remembering things out of the past and recalling and examining every detail of the overnight encounter. How cold and ineffective we had been, both of us! We had been like people resuming a disused and partially forgotten language. Had she changed towards me? Did she indeed want to see me again or was that invitation a mere demonstration of how entirely unimportant seeing me or not seeing me had become? ...|$|E

There wasn't a soul in sight. But just level with my head there was a hole in the rock. It was quite small--I could only just get my hand in, but it went a long way back. I took the oilskin packet from round my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off a bit of gorse--My! but it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so that you'd never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I marked the place {{carefully}} in my own mind, so that I'd find it again. There was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the world like a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was waiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed of myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man opposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt scared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the corridor to get a little air. I thought I'd slip into another carriage. But the woman called me back, said I'd dropped something, and when I stooped to look, something seemed to hit me--here." [...] She placed her hand {{to the back of her}} head.
