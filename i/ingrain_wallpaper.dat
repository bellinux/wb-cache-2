50|$|<b>Ingrain</b> <b>wallpaper</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used type of wallpaper in Germany. It was also commonplace in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Ingrain (or wood-chip) {{wallpaper}} is a decorating material. It {{consists of}} two layers of paper with wood fibre in between; different kinds of <b>ingrain</b> <b>wallpaper</b> are distinguished by the size and form of the fibre pieces.|$|E
5000|$|Stephens {{was born}} two miles north in {{a log cabin}} on his father's farm; he was {{orphaned}} {{at the age of}} fourteen. Stephens purchased the estate in 1845 from the estate of Williamson Byrd, a relative of his stepmother. The building was the former family home, but [...] "had been sold out from under the brothers when their father died." [...] In 1872-75, Stephens tore down the old house, except for two rear rooms, and erected the current structure, which is restored to its original appearance. The home is a simple two-story white frame house. It has a hip roof and a veranda extending across its front. The first floor includes Stephens' bedroom, including original walnut furniture, a round table at which Stephens wrote, Stephens' wheelchair, a repaired original flowered <b>ingrain</b> carpet, and <b>wallpaper</b> with blue and gold stripes. The dining room includes [...] "massive chairs" [...] replicated from a single remaining original chair. To the rear is the library, where Stephens wrote from 1868-70 his Constitutional View of the Late War between the States. Steps lead from the dining room to the second floor; {{at the top of the}} stairs is the [...] "Tramps' Room," [...] where many guests, including uninvited guests, often stayed. To the home's rear are restored outbuildings: slave quarters, a wine cellar, smokehouse, woodhouse, washhouse, and chickenhouse. At the time of emancipation in 1864, Stephens owned thirty-one slaves, most of whom remained with him after the war's end. It was at Liberty Hall that Stephens was captured by Union Army forces from a detachment of the 4th Iowa Cavalry, after which Stephens formally surrendered to General Emory Upton and was imprisoned before being released.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ingrain</b> <b>wallpaper</b> {{was invented}} by German {{pharmacist}} Hugo Erfurt in 1864; marketed by the company his grandfather founded, it was first used as a decoration for shop windows, but began seeing use as a wallpaper from the 1920s on as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{emission}} of microbial {{volatile organic compounds}} (MVOC) underlies many different influences. Aim {{of this study was}} to analyze the reproducibility of MVOC production by a mould strain by retesting. We also searched for differences between wild strains and strains from certified collections. 3 wild strains and 2 certified strains of each Penicillium brevicompactum, Aspergillus versicolor, Eurotium amstelodami and Chaetomium globosum were analyzed. The mould species were cultivated on <b>ingrain</b> <b>wallpaper.</b> Samples were taken on Tenax TA® and analyzed by GC/MS. Unsteadiness in the MVOC production of a mould strain during retesting could be demonstrated and also certain variability between the strains of one genus. In addition, a clear variability of the MVOC production between different mould genera could be observed. No differences between wild- and certified strains have been found. Overall very low emission rates could be detected. For example, by a mould area of 0, 25 m² and a room volume of 50 m³, only in very small cases the technical detection limit would have been reached. During the study, only a very small number of marker substances could be found...|$|E
