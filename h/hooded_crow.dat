5|$|American crows are the {{new world}} {{counterpart}} to the carrion crow and the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow.</b> Although the American crow and the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> does in Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN Red List {{does not}} {{distinguish}} the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> from the carrion crow, {{but the two}} species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10millionkm2 (3.8million mi2), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so are evaluated as Least Concern. The carrion crow/hooded crow hybrid zone is slowly spreading northwest, but the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> has {{on the order of}} three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia).|$|E

40|$|Magpies (Pica pica) and <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus corone cornix) are {{scavenger}} birds {{feeding on}} carcasses, arthropods, vegetables, small preys and food waste. In Italy, {{they tend to}} remain in the same territory and establish large populations both in urban and rural environments. For these reasons, these birds have a potential role as sentinels for the spread of Toxoplasma gondii in a given area. Trichinella pseudospiralis has been previously reported in corvids. In the present study, 798 free ranging corvids, including 678 magpies and 120 <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> deceased following a program of population size reduction of the province of Pisa, were examined for T. pseudospiralis and T. gondii infections. More specifically, sera from 651 magpies and 120 <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> were examined by IFAT for antibodies specific to T. gondii. In seropositive birds, the heart was homogenized and DNA was extracted to perform a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) detection method for B 1 gene of T. gondii and genotyping for SAG. In the case of Trichinella, breast muscle samples (50 g each) from 678 magpies and 91 <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> were tested by an artificial digestion method. After digestion, eventually recovered larvae were processed for molecular typing. Data were statistically analysed (p < 0. 05).

5|$|The typical {{lifespan}} is unknown, {{but that}} of the carrion crow is four years. The maximum recorded age for a <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> is 16 years, and 9 months.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|In the British Isles, the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> breeds {{regularly}} in Scotland, the Isle of Man, and the Scottish Islands. It also breeds widely in Ireland. In autumn, some migratory birds {{arrive on the}} east coast of Britain. In the past, this was a more common visitor.|$|E

5|$|This species, {{like its}} relative, is seen {{regularly}} killed by farmers and on grouse estates. In County Cork, Ireland, the county's gun clubs shot over 23,000 <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> {{in two years}} in the early 1980s.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} a {{secondary}} {{host of the}} parasitic great spotted cuckoo, the European magpie being the preferred host. However, {{in areas where the}} latter species is absent, such as Israel and Egypt, the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> becomes the normal corvid host.|$|E
5|$|The old name of Royston crow {{originates}} {{from the}} days when this bird was a common winter visitor to southern England, the sheep fields around Royston, Hertfordshire, providing carcasses on which the birds could feed. The local newspaper, founded in 1855, is called The Royston Crow, and the <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> is also featured on the crest of the North Hertfordshire District Council.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> breeds in {{northern}} and eastern Europe, and closely allied forms inhabit southern Europe and western Asia. Where its range overlaps with carrion crow, as {{in northern}} Britain, Germany, Denmark, northern Italy, and Siberia, their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than purebred birds, {{and this is}} one of the reasons this species was split from the carrion crow. Little or no interbreeding occurs in some areas, such as Iran and central Russia.|$|E
50|$|The black-throated loon is {{sometimes}} parasitized by Eustrongylides tubifex, {{a species of}} nematode that can cause Eustrongylidosis. Mammalian predators, such as red foxes and pine martens, are likely the cause of about 40% of clutch losses. Avian predators, such as <b>hooded</b> <b>crows,</b> also take the eggs of this loon.|$|R

5|$|Predators of {{the corn}} crake on its European {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and <b>hooded</b> <b>crow.</b> In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids.

5|$|Western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes, pastures, {{cultivated}} land, coastal cliffs, and towns. They thrive when forested {{areas are}} cleared and converted to fields and open areas. Habitats {{with a mix}} of large trees, buildings, and open ground are preferred; open fields are left to the rook, and more wooded areas to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius). Along with other corvids such as the rook, common raven (Corvus corax), and <b>hooded</b> <b>crow</b> (C. cornix), some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks; populations measured in three urban parks in Warsaw show increases from October to December, possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north. The same data from Warsaw, collected from 1977 to 2003, showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four-fold. The cause of the increase is unknown, but a {{reduction in the number of}} rooks may have benefited the species locally, or rooks overwintering in Belarus may have caused western jackdaws to relocate to Warsaw.|$|E
40|$|Communal {{roosting}} {{in birds}} may function to enhance foraging efficiency as {{explained by the}} information centre hypothesis, which predicts that successful foragers return from the roost to the rewarding food patch and that birds ignorant of this food follow knowledgeable roost-mates. We tested these predictions by exposing 34 radio-tagged, free-ranging, flock-living <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus corone cornix) to a novel experimental set-up mimicking a superfluous food patch with maximum temporal and spatial unpredictability Each replicate lasted two days and was located on a new site. Data were collected during ten replicates over three years. First, a crow {{was more likely to}} visit the experimental food patch on the second day when it had been there on the first day. Second, when a crow had not been at this food patch on the first day, it was more likely to visit it on the second day if it had roosted together with a crow that had been there on the first day, but only if this knowledgeable roost-mate returned to the food patch on the second day. Our results support the information centre hypothesis and suggest that communal roosting might function to enhance foraging efficiency in <b>hooded</b> <b>crows...</b>|$|R
5000|$|USUV's {{host range}} {{includes}} primarily Culex mosquitoes, birds, and humans. A 2008-2009 survey of mosquitoes and birds in Emilia-Romagna detected USUV in 89 Culex pipiens pools and in 2 Aedes albopictus pools. Twelve wild birds, primarily European Magpies (Pica pica), <b>Hooded</b> <b>Crows</b> (Corvus cornix), and [...] Eurasian Jays (Garrulus glandarius), {{were determined to}} be USUV-positive. USUV detection in mosquito species confirms the role of Culex pipiens as the main vector and the possible involvement of Aedes albopictus in the virus cycle.|$|R
40|$|Corvids in Zhytomyr city reach maximum {{density in}} the winter period. Rooks and Eurasian Jackdaws were the most {{abundant}} species in winter, usually feeding in multispecies flocks and forming collective roosts. Suburban green areas (buffer zones) were characterized by a considerably high diversity of Corvidae species: this habitat was occupied by all six species. We also registered the highest density of Eurasian Jays and <b>Hooded</b> <b>Crows</b> in this habitat. The green areas in the city center were also characterized by significant corvid density, especially during the breeding season. The maximum breeding density of Rooks was in these habitats, which held 6 of 12 identified urban colonies in Zhytomyr. We found that the European Magpies, Eurasian Jays, and <b>Hooded</b> <b>Crows</b> also had high breeding success here. Eurasian Jackdaws occurred here only in autumn and winter, when they fed together with Rooks on lawns, gardens, and parks. With stable snow cover the Rook density in habitats of the green areas decreased due to the depletion of food resources. The individual buildings zone of the city were characterized by the lowest density of all corvid species, except for European Magpies and Eurasian Jays. The number of common species (Rooks, Eurasian Jackdaws, and <b>Hooded</b> <b>Crows)</b> was low because of shortage of food resources, lack of sites for large roosting flocks and shortage of suitable nesting sites. However, Eurasian Magpies reached one of their highest densities in this habitat (12. 8  birds/km 2). This species was registered in habitats around private buildings all the year round, successfully nesting in the yards of private houses and on trees in the streets. Its breeding density was 11. 2 birds/km 2. During three years of research (2009 – 2012) the density of all corvids except for European Magpie, practically did not change, although we determined a slight positive trend for all the species. The strong {{increase in the number}} of Eurasian Jackdaws could be explained by the increasing density of wintering populations or due to the increasing number of migrants from more northern regions...|$|R

50|$|Wildlife enthusiasts {{also enjoy}} the glen, {{as it is}} home to many {{interesting}} animals and plants. In the northern woods and fields red deer can be seen. Sheep and meadow pipits graze pretty much everywhere, whilst there are also large flocks of herring gulls and <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> about, as well as a pair of ravens by the hostel. Rabbits and swallows tend to be restricted to the farmland in the south. Again, the beach is the star attraction for wildlife. Turnstones, ringed plovers, grey herons, dunlins, curlews and most of all oystercatchers all hang around probing in the mud for food.

40|$|Although {{predator}} {{control programmes}} rarely consider complex competitive interactions among predators, {{it is becoming}} clear that removal of larger ‘superior’ competitors often releases the ‘inferior’ ones and can precipitate trophic cascades. In contrast, our study indicates that culling <b>hooded</b> <b>crows</b> Corvus cornix appears to release a larger competitor, the common raven Corvus corax. Ravens ranged more widely, and the predation of artificial nests was significantly faster (although total predation was similar), after the removal of crows. Our study provides evidence of a novel reversal of competitive release where a larger species was freed from constraints imposed on its distribution and behaviour by a smaller species, and {{emphasizes the importance of}} considering community and ecosystem effects of predator manipulations when undertaken for conservation or game management...|$|R
5000|$|As a group, crows show {{remarkable}} {{examples of}} intelligence. Natural history {{books from the}} 18th century recount an often-repeated, but unproven anecdote of [...] "counting crows" [...] — specifically a crow whose ability to count to five (or four in some versions) is established through a logic trap set by a farmer.

In another instance, a goshawk drowned while attempting to capture a tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). One young goshawk managed to escape a red fox that had caught it with a chewed wing, only to drown in a nearby creek. Another, and rather gruesome, hunting mishap occurred when a goshawk caught a large mountain hare and, while attempting to hold it in place by grasping vegetation with its other foot, was torn in half.|$|R
