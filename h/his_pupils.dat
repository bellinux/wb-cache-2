5|$|Vainio {{returned}} to {{teaching in the}} early 1970s. Vainio made up nicknames for all <b>his</b> <b>pupils,</b> who in return called him Junnu. He {{had a habit of}} coming up with very unorthodox methods of punishment but in general got on well with <b>his</b> <b>pupils.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anne Wales Abbot was {{believed}} to be the designer of the Ives' game, The Mansion of Happines for over 145 years, from 1843 to 1989. She, however, did not design Ives The Mansion of Happiness but did design two other Ives' games: Dr. Busby and Master Rodbury and <b>His</b> <b>Pupils.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chopin's public {{popularity}} as a virtuoso {{began to}} wane, {{as did the}} number of <b>his</b> <b>pupils,</b> and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65.|$|E
50|$|Francesco’s brother, Vincenzo Podesti (1812-1897), {{was also}} a painter. At the Academy, Aurelio Tiratelli was <b>his</b> <b>pupil.</b> <b>His</b> main <b>pupils</b> were the {{painters}} from Messina Giacomo Conti and Ferdinando Cicconi.|$|R
40|$|A {{handwritten}} document {{outlining the}} "{{story of the}} Bradley Organization" and "the story {{of the history of}} music teaching, which, for practical purposes, began with Frederic Chopin who deeded this legacy to <b>his</b> <b>pupil</b> Mathias, from whom it was inherited by <b>his</b> <b>pupil</b> Philipp, who in turn with <b>his</b> <b>pupil</b> Harold Bradley founded in Paris in 1930 the first music education research program. Its meaning and purpose are described in the following pages. ...|$|R
5000|$|He had {{a studio}} in Brussels where he {{received}} in 1682 Andreas Meulebeek as <b>his</b> <b>pupil</b> {{and the next year}} Mathys Schoevaerdts. His nephew Adriaen (Frans) became <b>his</b> <b>pupil</b> in 1694. [...] He also trained his son Frans.|$|R
5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by <b>his</b> <b>pupils,</b> his writing system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Drax's henchman Chang, {{played by}} Japanese aikido {{instructor}} Toshiro Suga, was recommended {{for the role}} by executive producer Michael G. Wilson, {{who was one of}} <b>his</b> <b>pupils.</b> Wilson, continuing a tradition he started in the film Goldfinger, has a small cameo role in Moonraker: he appears twice, first as a tourist outside the Venini Glass shop and museum in Venice, then {{at the end of the}} film as a technician in the US Navy control room.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Tompion was {{the first}} English clockmaker with an {{international}} reputation and many of <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> {{went on to become}} great horologists in their own right, such as George Graham who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury pendulum, and his pupil Thomas Mudge who created the first lever escapement. Famous clockmakers of this period included Joseph Windmills, Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and Christopher Pinchbeck who used the Pinchbeck alloy.|$|E
5|$|Arjona was {{a talented}} {{basketball}} player {{who played for}} Leones de Marte and TRIAS. He toured Central America {{as a member of}} the Guatemala national basketball team. Until recently, he held the record for the most points scored (78) in a single game by a Guatemalan. He also taught at a primary school (called Santa Elena III), where he claimed to have spent six hours giving lessons and the rest of the day playing soccer. This earned him a visit from a Ministry of Education representative, who was sent to evaluate <b>his</b> <b>pupils.</b> The representative found that the students' education was actually above average. In 1988, he became the basketball coach of a boys' school (called Instituto Don Bosco).|$|E
5|$|Chris is Neighbours second ongoing {{homosexual}} character, {{following the}} introduction of Lana Crawford in 2004. Neighbours has featured a few short-term or minor male gay characters before for plot points or small story arcs, but Chris is the first male gay character {{to be given a}} prominent role. The first minor male gay characters to appear were Andrew MacKenzie (John Morris) and Alf Taylor (Frank Bren) in 1994. The following year a gay schoolteacher, Andrew Watson (Chris Uhlman), became the victim of a dismissal campaign by <b>his</b> <b>pupils.</b> Hairdresser Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) was often hinted at being gay.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 Bennett {{began to}} teach at the RAM, with which he was {{associated}} {{for most of the}} rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at Queen's College, London. Amongst <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> during this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor Michael Costa.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May {{he became}} the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate. He passed as Second Class Flier. He {{was good enough to}} be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{pioneering}} Irish architects was Sir Edward Lovett Pearce (1699–1733), who {{became one of the}} leading advocates of Palladianism in Ireland. A cousin of Sir John Vanbrugh, he was originally one of <b>his</b> <b>pupils,</b> but rejecting the baroque, he spent three years studying architecture in France and Italy, before returning home to Ireland. His most important Palladian work is the former Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin. He was a prolific architect who also designed the south façade of Drumcondra House in 1727 and Cashel Palace in 1728.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{was born}} in England, {{probably}} in about 1100. Nothing else is known of his background. He owed his name {{to the place where}} he taught, Melun in France. Robert studied under Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor at the University of Paris, where in 1137 he succeeded Abelard as a teacher in the school on Mont Ste-Geneviève. John of Salisbury and William of Tyre were among <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> in Paris. King Henry II of England's cousin, Roger of Worcester, later the Bishop of Worcester, was another of Robert's students. He probably also taught Thomas Becket, later Archbishop of Canterbury, although this is not certain.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's musical {{influence}} on later composers outside the former Soviet Union {{has been relatively}} slight, although Alfred Schnittke took up his eclecticism and his contrasts between the dynamic and the static, and some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence {{can also be seen}} in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E
5|$|The overweighting of the {{stressed}} syllables {{strengthens the}} humour of the lines. Busch also uses dactyls, where one accented syllable {{is followed by}} two unaccented syllables, as in his Plisch und Plum, where they underline the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher Bokelmann educates <b>his</b> <b>pupils.</b> They create tension in the Sourdough chapter from Adventures of a Bachelor, through the alternation of trochees and dactyls. Busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems, as in Fips the Monkey, where he uses the epic hexameter in a speech about wisdom.|$|E

5|$|While {{still an}} undergraduate, Stanford was {{appointed}} organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1882, aged 29, {{he was one}} of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music, where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also Professor of Music at Cambridge. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of Brahms. Among <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the Bach Choir and the Leeds triennial music festival.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of <b>his</b> <b>pupils</b> explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E
5|$|Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was {{the first}} {{significant}} artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers, adding elements of Romanticism to the Grand Manner tradition of Joshua Reynolds. He became a knight in 1822 and the King's painter and limner in 1823, marking {{a return to the}} post being associated with the production of art. <b>His</b> <b>pupils</b> included the brothers William (Alexander) (1772–1841), Archibald (1765–1835) and Andrew Robertson (1777–1845). William and Archibald went on to found the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York, and Andrew to be the leading Scottish miniaturist of his day. Also associated with Radeburn towards {{the end of his career}} were John Syme (1795–1861) and Colvin Smith (1795–1875).|$|E
