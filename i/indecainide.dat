40|$|Intracellular {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} from rabbit atria, cardiac Purkinje cells and papillary muscles {{before and after}} exposure to various concentrations of <b>indecainide.</b> The effects of aprindine also were studied in the atrial preparations. Both drugs depressed the maximum rate of depolarization (MRD) in a dose-related manner, <b>indecainide</b> being approximately ten times more potent than aprindine. Aprindine caused a dose-related bradycardia, but <b>indecainide</b> had no significant effect on sinus node frequency. <b>Indecainide</b> had a dose-related negatively inotropic effect in normal, half-normal and twice-normal extracellular calcium concentrations. <b>Indecainide</b> shortened action potential duration (APD) in atrium and Purkinje cells but prolonged APD to 50 % repolarization in ventricular muscle. The actions of <b>indecainide</b> were extremely persistent. No significant recovery of MRD was observed after pauses in stimulation of up to 16 s. <b>Indecainide</b> {{had no effect on}} effective refractory period (ERP) measured by interpolated premature stimuli. <b>Indecainide</b> is therefore categorized as a Class 1 c antiarrhythmic agent. The effects of both aprindine and <b>indecainide</b> on MRD were increased in hypoxic atria. Conduction velocity in hypoxic atria exposed to <b>indecainide</b> was greater than in controls, however, suggesting the possibility of improved cell-to-cell coupling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTen {{patients}} {{were treated with}} oral <b>indecainide</b> for frequent ventricular ectopic depolarizations during a short-term, dose-ranging, single blind inpatient trial followed by open label long-term therapy for 2 years. During dose ranging, patients received placebo followed by 50, 75 and 103 mg of <b>indecainide</b> three times daily. Eight of the 10 patients achieved ≥ 80 % reduction in ventricular ectopic depolarizations during inpatient therapy. Mean ventricular ectopic depolarizations decreased from 15, 792 / 24 h to 2, 357 / 24 h on optimal dosage (p < 0. 01). Nine patients had paired ventricular ectopic depolarizations; four of the nine had ≥ 99 % reduction of these beats. Among seven patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, five had 100 % elimination of these events with <b>indecainide</b> and all had ≥ 90 % reduction in these events. <b>Indecainide</b> prolonged the PR interval 44 ± 27 ms (p < 0. 0001) and the QRS interval 11 ± 9 ms (p < 0, 0901) from baseline without prolongation of the QTc or JTc interval. The mean trough plasma level of <b>indecainide</b> on optimal dosage was 409 ± 173 ng/ml and the mean plasma elimination half-life was 10. 3 ± 2. 3 h (range 7. 1 to 14. 2). No adverse hemodynamic effects of <b>indecainide</b> were detected. Side effects during short-term therapy were mild and did not require discontinuation of the drug. Efficacy was maintained for some patients during long-term therapy for 2 years, although five patients discontinued therapy because of loss of efficacy or side effects. <b>Indecainide</b> is a highly effective and well tolerated antiarrhythmic drug for suppression of frequent and repetitive ventricular ectopic depolarizations...|$|E
