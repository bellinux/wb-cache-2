40|$|The {{importance}} of Ixodes ricinus in {{the transmission of}} tick-borne pathogens is well recognized in the United Kingdom and across Europe. However, the role of coexisting Ixodes species, such as the widely distributed species Ixodes trianguliceps, as alternative vectors for these pathogens has received little attention. This study aimed to assess the relative {{importance of}} I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps in the transmission of Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti among United Kingdom <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> (Microtus agrestis), which serve as reservoir hosts for both pathogens. While all instars of I. trianguliceps feed exclusively on small mammals, I. ricinus adults feed primarily on larger hosts such as deer. The abundance of both tick species and pathogen infection prevalence in <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> were monitored at sites surrounded with fencing that excluded deer and at sites where deer were free to roam. As expected, fencing significantly reduced the larval burden of I. ricinus on <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> and the abundance of questing nymphs, but the larval burden of I. trianguliceps was not significantly affected. The prevalence of A. phagocytophilum and B. microti infections was not significantly affected by the presence of fencing, suggesting that I. trianguliceps is their principal vector. The prevalence of nymphal and adult ticks on <b>field</b> <b>voles</b> was also unaffected, indicating that relatively few non-larval I. ricinus ticks feed upon <b>field</b> <b>voles.</b> This study provides compelling evidence for the importance of I. trianguliceps in maintaining these enzootic tick-borne infections, while highlighting the potential for such infections to escape into alternative hosts via I. ricinus...|$|R

The brown rat is even the primary prey in Lebanon despite it being tied solely to human habitations as the environment is often too arid to allow it to survive further afield. Black rats (Rattus rattus), at , are also hunted but rarely in equal number to the generally more successful brown rats.

The European water vole, averaging at , was the main prey species in Styria, Austria, although considerably secondary in biomass to hedgehogs, as well as in central Sweden. The water vole often the second or third most regularly found prey species in several other European studies. In Samara, Russia, the diet is dominated by the European water vole, although other species such as European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) and European hares (Lepus europaeus) (both also significant prey there) probably outweigh them in biomass contribution. The common vole and European water vole together made up roughly 80% of the prey by number in the High Tatras of Slovenia and more than 60% of the diet in bordering Poland.|$|E

40|$|In {{northern}} Europe, rodent populations display cyclic density fluctuations, {{which can}} be correlated with the human incidence of zoonotic diseases they spread.

Antibodies against all four viruses were detected. However, seroprevalence of hantaviruses, LV and LCMV was low. OPV antibodies (most likely cowpox) were more common but restricted geographically to southeast Finland. Within these sites, antibody prevalence showed delayed density-dependence in spring and direct density-dependence in fall. Higher seroprevalence was found in spring than fall.

40|$|A craniometric {{investigation}} using univariate {{and principal}} component analysis (PCA) was performed on 91 skull traits of 472 <b>field</b> <b>voles,</b> collected on nine islands and from the Jutland peninsula in Denmark in order to reveal possible geographical differences in skull shape and size. Because of missing values in the skulls due to various damages, only 186 individuals were measured for the dorsal side of the skull, 174 individuals for the ventral side and 154 individuals for the mandible. Of these traits, from the dorsal side of the skull 28 traits were measured, from the ventral side 33 traits and from the mandible 30 traits. With few exceptions, differences in skull shape were found between samples collected from the different islands, and also between samples from islands and samples from the Jutland peninsula.

40|$|Capsule: Barn Owl pellets {{can be used}} {{to assess}} {{population}} changes in small mammals though with certain important reservations. Aims: To conduct a large-scale, long-term analysis of pellets regurgitated by Barn Owls collected from a defined area of countryside within the UK south Midlands and compare results with those of other studies that have used pellet analysis to investigate the diet of Barn Owls. Methods: Over 61 000 Barn Owl pellets collected over 20 years in the south Midlands of England were analyzed. Results: We recorded a steady increase in the proportion of <b>Field</b> <b>Voles</b> in pellets over time at the expense of Wood Mice, and a positive relationship between various rainfall measures and the proportion of <b>Field</b> <b>Voles</b> in pellets. We suggest that the conclusions of previous studies of the diet of Barn Owls have often been predicated on inconsistent or untenable assumptions. Conclusion: We challenge some of the premises on which Barn Owl pellet analyses have traditionally been based. We do not think that either a shortage of <b>Field</b> <b>Voles</b> in pellets, or of pellets containing the remains of more, smaller prey items, are indicative of foraging difficulty. Barn Owl pellets {{can be used to}} assess population changes in small mammals, so long as possible causes of bias, which we discuss, are acknowledged...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> or {{short-tailed vole}} (Microtus agrestis) is a grey-brown vole, around four inches (ten centimetres) in length, {{with a short}} tail. It {{is one of the}} most common mammals in Europe, with a range {{extending}} from the Atlantic coast to Lake Baikal. These voles are found in moist grassy habitats, such as woodland, marsh or on river banks. Although they make shallow burrows, they usually build nests above ground. They are an important food source for owls and some other predators and their population size tends to peak and trough cyclically. Field voles breed prolifically, mainly in summer, but often all year round, even under snow.

50|$|There {{is a wide}} {{distribution}} of mammals such as <b>field</b> <b>voles,</b> foxes and badgers {{as well as many}} songbirds. The skylark is plentiful due to the extensive rough pasture present below the main peaks which allows ground nesting of the species. Pied wagtails are common near the streams and torrents running from the hill tops.|$|R
50|$|The <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> breeds {{throughout}} the year but the breeding season peaks in spring and summer. The nest is made on or just {{under the surface of}} the ground, often in a clump of grass or sedge. The gestation period is about three weeks and up to a dozen young are borne. These grow rapidly, suckle for twelve days and leave the nest at twenty one days, reaching sexual maturity soon afterwards. Like the common vole, the <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> is subject to population explosions when conditions are right. Females become pregnant again soon after parturition. The pregnancy rate is nearly 100% in late spring but falls during midsummer only to rise again later. Mortality in the nest is about 20% but may rise to 50% in the middle of summer when the digestibility of the food supplies fall. Life expectancy is about two years but is lower for spring-born individuals than for ones born later in the year.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> {{is common}} {{over most of}} its very wide range, {{although}} thinning out towards the peripheries and may be locally scarce where conditions are less suitable.

50|$|The <b>field</b> <b>vole</b> is {{more active}} by day than the common vole. It excavates shallow burrows {{close to the}} surface of the ground, under leaf litter and under snow in winter.
