5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> to come to aid.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} mind (ToM) {{impairment}} describes a difficulty {{someone would have}} with perspective-taking. This is also {{sometimes referred to as}} mind-blindness. This means that individuals with a ToM impairment would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> seeing phenomena from any other perspective than their own. Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> with social reciprocity. ToM deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders, people with schizophrenia, people with nonverbal learning disorder, people with attention deficit disorder, persons {{under the influence of alcohol}} and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that certain medical conditions (normally only neurological conditions) can impact dreams.

25|$|The shape, size, position, symmetry, spacing, firmness, {{and amount}} of sagging of {{individual}} women's breasts vary considerably. Manufacturers' bra size labeling systems vary {{from country to country}} because no international standards exist. Even within a single country, one study found that the bra label size was consistently different from the measured size. As a result, about 25% of women <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> finding a properly fitted bra. Some women choose to buy custom-made bras due to the unusual size or shape of their breasts.|$|E

25|$|Loan Funds assist {{entrepreneurs}} and business owners in Israel to open or expand their businesses, through loans with highly attractive conditions {{as well as}} comprehensive business guidance. The Jewish Agency acts as a partial guarantor for the loans, to support those businesses that otherwise would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> qualifying for loans or presenting the necessary collateral for them. The various funds have different eligibility criteria, with some focusing on stimulating the economy in specific regions of Israel, and others focusing on specific populations of business owners, such as Israeli Arabs, Ethiopian-Israelis, immigrants, etc.|$|E
25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{has also}} been connected with the current spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This is partly because migrants can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> moving to new environments, as they lack the natives’ resistance to local diseases and infections. Many migrants are also {{at greater risk of}} becoming sick because of the marginal conditions in which they live. However, as described above, the majority of the attention has been on circular migrants as disease carriers. Contact with migrant workers places their rural partners at greater risk for acquiring STDs. Due to the nature of their work, circular migrants are gone from home often and for great lengths of time, which can disrupt the balance of their family and sex lives.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of sexual}} {{violence}} {{on the rise in}} the United States is Human Trafficking. Poverty can lead to increased trafficking due to more people on the streets. Women who are impoverished, foreign, socially deprived, or at other disadvantages are more susceptible to being recruited into trafficking. Many laws stated in Kelsey Tumiel’s dissertation, have recently been made to try to combat the phenomenon, but it is predicted that human trafficking will surpass illegal drug trafficking amounts in the US. Women that are victims of these sexual violence acts <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> escaping the life due to abuse of power, organized crime, and insufficient laws to protect them. There are more people current enslaved in trafficking than there were during the African slave trade. “Branding” of human trafficking brings awareness to the issue claims Tam Mai, the author. This allows for public assertion and intervention. A claim made in Tam Mai's article states that by reducing poverty, thus may lead to a decrease in trafficking from the streets.|$|E

500|$|According to Morgan, despite garment {{manufacturing}} being a three-trillion-dollar industry, {{the working}} conditions {{in those countries}} are poor.

Just prior to that, workers had been forced into the factory even though a crack was seen in the walls.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Karl Heitmueller, Smallville's Clark Kent was {{a better}} {{representation}} of the original material and remained [...] "true {{to the heart of}} the story" [...] by showing Clark's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and his obligations. However, Heitmueller wrote that the series would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> addressing why no one in Smallville (including Lex Luthor) recognized Clark when he put on the suit. TV Guide's Michael Schneider called it one of the best examples of a superhero adaptation for television, but Christopher Hooton of Metro wrote that Smallville was a story which did not need to be told: [...] "No-one bothered to follow Bruce Wayne's tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?" ...|$|E
500|$|The giraffe has an {{extremely}} elongated neck, {{which can be}} up to [...] in length, accounting {{for much of the}} animal's vertical height. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over [...] long. They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe's vertebral column, compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe’s closest living relative, the okapi. This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a strengthened nuchal ligament, which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior thoracic vertebrae, giving the animal a hump.|$|E

Daniel {{is thought to have}} been driving, and is blamed for the accident. A weakened Cassie escapes from the hospital to find Daniel and tell him she was driving; she is returned to the hospital. During the episode dated May 24, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. Following her death, the strong relationship between Nick and Sharon changes forever. Weighing in on the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] plot, Morrow stated, [...] "As a person who watched Camryn grow up, I was devastated and it was not that difficult to use those feelings in the scenes we had to play. But as an actor, I have to commend our producer and writers at that time because it gave the show a huge new storyline that years later we are still playing out". He felt that losing a child gave Nick [...] "an edge and a change" [...] that affected him deeply. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick tells a judge that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. Luke Kerr of Zap2it referred to this as playing the [...] "Cassie card".|$|E

The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E
