5|$|As {{the rebel}} forces {{advanced}} towards his enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush.

This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, they fell upon the Immortals, who also panicked and fled, abandoning their posts.

Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and <b>forth.</b> <b>The</b> goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.|$|E
5|$|The Votadini, who {{occupied}} the south-east of Scotland, came under Roman sway {{at an early}} stage and Cerialis sent one division north through their territory to the shores of the Firth of <b>Forth.</b> <b>The</b> XXth Legion took a western route through Annandale in an attempt to encircle and isolate the Selgovae who {{occupied the}} central Southern Uplands. Early success tempted Cerialis further north and he began constructing a line of Glenblocker forts to the north and west of the Gask Ridge which marked a frontier between the Venicones to the south and the Caledonians to the north.|$|E

5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set <b>forth</b> <b>the</b> {{position of the}} Holy See {{with respect to the}} differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put <b>forth</b> <b>the</b> view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E

Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored in history by Charles Kingsley, Regius Professor of Modern History.

5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set <b>forth</b> <b>the</b> law of Thelema {{in a way}} similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E

The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E

5000|$|Queensferry, {{also called}} South Queensferry or simply [...] "The Ferry", {{is a town}} {{to the west of}} Edinburgh, Scotland, {{traditionally}} a royal burgh of West Lothian. It lies some ten miles to the north-west of Edinburgh city centre, on the shore of <b>the</b> Firth of <b>Forth</b> between <b>the</b> <b>Forth</b> Bridge and <b>the</b> <b>Forth</b> Road Bridge. <b>The</b> prefix South serves to distinguish it from North Queensferry, on the opposite shore of <b>the</b> <b>Forth.</b> Both towns derive their name from the ferry service established by Queen Margaret in the 11th century, which continued to operate at the town until 1964, when the Road Bridge was opened.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of this period the boundaries of Alba contained only a small proportion of modern Scotland. Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the term Scotia was applied in sources only to the region between the River <b>Forth,</b> <b>the</b> central Grampians and the River Spey and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from {{the second half of the}} twelfth century. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. After this time both Berwick and the Isle of Man were lost to England, and Orkney and Shetland were gained from Norway in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|British consuls in the United States {{sought to}} enlist Americans for the Crimean War in 1854, in {{violation}} of neutrality laws, and Pierce eventually expelled minister Crampton and three consuls. To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 message to Congress Pierce had set <b>forth</b> <b>the</b> American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for the clergy, setting <b>forth</b> <b>the</b> proper {{procedures}} for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E

In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed {{that many of the}} legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers.

5|$|In the Cretaceous, {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and <b>forth,</b> <b>the</b> Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway.
