P. bursaria {{cells were cultured in}} a lettuce medium {{supplemented}} with various concentrations of sludge suspension at 23 °C under LD (ligh and dark cycle) condition. Results suggested that 2 P. bursaria proliferates normally even at 1. 5 % sludge suspension. However, 1. 5 x 10 % sludge suspension 2 showed acute toxicity to P. bursaria. On the other hand, with 1. 5 x 10 % sludge suspension pHwas raised up from 7. 3 to 8. 8 before the incubation, no lethal effect was found in the sludge suspension. To investigate the lethal ingredient in the sludge, P. bursaria was treated in both sludge suspension and sludge supernatant solution. The result indicated that P. bursaria was very sensitive to the former, but not the later even after 7 2 days of incubation. These results suggested that the lethal toxicity of 1. 5 x 10 % sludge suspension is derived from suspended fine particles (insoluble parts).

Using early-life-stage toxicity tests with Bufo arenarum embryos (the most sensitive of three native species), we determined the water quality at six sampling stations of the river valley and expressed the results as acute and chronic toxicity units. Along most of the river, the toxicity was higher than the allowable level of whole <b>industrial</b> effluent <b>toxicity</b> recommended by U. S. EPA. In a tributary stream, Arroyo Moron, the water was about 10 times more toxic than the criteria maximum concentration (CMC) recommended by U. S. EPA for industrial effluents. Similar degradation of the water quality was found taking as a reference value an upstream sampling station. In all places where the water quality was worse than the CMC, no macroorganisms were found, and in one of these places, a large number of dead fishes was observed.

40|$|International audienceCadmium is a {{heavy metal}} and a {{pollutant}} {{that can be found}} in large quantities in the environment from <b>industrial</b> waste. Its <b>toxicity</b> for living organisms could arise from its ability to alter thiol-containing cellular components. Glutathione is an abundant tripeptide (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) that is described as the first line of defence against cadmium in many cell types. NMR experiments for structure and dynamics determination, molecular simulations, competition reactions for metal chelation by different metabolites (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly, α-Glu-Cys-Gly and γ-Glu-Cys) combined with biochemical and genetics experiments have been performed to propose a full description of bio-inorganic reactions occurring in the early steps of cadmium detoxification processes. Our results give unambiguous information about the spontaneous formation, under physiological conditions, of the Cd(GS) (2) complex, about the nature of ligands involved in cadmium chelation by glutathione, and provide insights on the structures of Cd(GS) (2) complexes in solution at different pH. We also show that γ-Glu-Cys, the precursor of glutathione, forms a stable complex with cadmium, but biological studies of the first steps of cadmium detoxification reveal that this complex {{does not seem to be}} relevant for this purpose...|$|R

In order to determine whether specific physicochemical characteristics of CNTs are responsible for their toxicological effects, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of eight CNTs representative of each of the commonly encountered classes: single- SW-, double- DW-, and multiwalled (MW) CNTs, purified and raw. In addition, because most previous studies of CNT toxicity were conducted on immortalized cell lines, we decided to compare results obtained from V 79 cells, an established cell line, with results from SHE (Syrian hamster embryo) cells, an easy-to-handle normal cell model. After 24 hours of treatment, MWCNTs were generally found to be more cytotoxic than SW- or DWCNTs. MWCNTs also provoked more genotoxic effects. No correlation could be found between CNT genotoxicity and metal impurities, length, surface area, or induction of cellular oxidative stress, but genotoxicity was seen to increase with CNT width. The toxicity observed for some CNTs leads us to suggest that they might also act by interfering with the cell cycle, but no significant differences were observed between normal and immortalized cells...|$|R

Plants, which {{are able to}} store heavy metals in their organs, {{can be used for}} phytoremediation of polluted soils and utilization of these plants is effective for phytoremediation as a cheap and economic method. In this research, the absorption rate of Cd (II), Ni (II) by Descurainia sophia was considered in hydroponic conditions. Plants were grown in Hoagland media containing different concentrations of Cd (II), Ni (II). An experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications was conducted. Two weeks after treatment of plants the sample were gathered and metal concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Besides, the content of chlorophyll and proline was measured. The results showed the chlorophyll content in high concentrations of the metals (Cd (II), Ni (II)) was decreased in plants that were sign of pigment degradation in presence of heavy metals. Similarly, the proline content in plants was increased under stress which was sign of damage of heavy metal stress on plant and activation of defensive mechanisms in this condition. The effects of toxic concentration of nickel and cadmium on metal accumulation in these plants showed that roots were able to absorb more than shoots, which is sign of elements connection to root cell wall...|$|R

The <b>toxicity</b> of chromium is well known but the effects of molybdenum and molybdenum mining on natural populations and communities of freshwater invertebrates have not often been studied. However, chromium, and molybdenum (and their compounds) are included in the same list (List II) of European Union dangerous substances.

Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo effects of these two metals on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of D. magna Straus were investigated. LC 50 values determined at 48 h were 0. 29 and 2847. 5 mg L- 1 for chromium (as sodium dichromate) and molybdenum (as sodium molybdate), respectively. No significant in vitro effects of both metals on AChE were found. However, both toxicants inhibited AChE in vivo at concentrations under the respective 48 -h LC 50 values.

A composition of BAC distillers grains received from wheat, corn, barley, millet at different spirit enterprises which use hydro fermentative grain processing. Considering polydispersity of distillers grains they were separated on {{solid and liquid}} phases preliminary. Physical and chemical characteristics of distillers grains' liquid base were identified. Elementary composition of distillers grains is signified by active accumulation of biogenic elements (phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, iron) and low content of heavy metals. The solid phase of distillers grains accumulates carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen in high concentration. The liquid phase of distillers grains contains: proteins and amino acids (20 - 46 %), reducing sugars (5, 6 %- 17, 5 %), galacturonides (0, 8 - 1, 4 %), ascorbic acid (6, 2 - 11, 4 mg%). The solid base of distillers grains contains: galacturonides (3, 4 - 5, 3 %), fatty oil (8, 4 - 11, 1 %) with predomination of essential fatty acids, proteins and amino acids (2, 1 - 2, 5 %), flavonoids (0, 4 - 0, 9 %), tocopherols (3, 4 - 7, 7 mg%). A method of complex processing of distillers grains based on application of membrane filtering of liquid phase and liquid extraction by inorganic and organic solvents of solid phase, which allows almost full extraction of the sum of biologically active compounds (BAC) from liquid phase (Biobardin BM) and solid phase (Biobardin UL). Biobardin BM comprises the following elements: proteins and amino acids (41 - 69 %), reducing sugars (3, 5 - 15, 6 %), fatty oil (0, 2 - 0, 3 %), flavonoids (0, 2 - 0, 7 %), ascorbic acid (17 - 37 mg%). Biobardin UL includes: oligouronids (16, 4 - 19, 5 %), proteins and amino acids (11 - 21 %), fatty oil (3, 2 - 4, 9 %) which includes essential acids; flavonoids (0, 6 - 1, 5 %), tocopherols (6, 6 - 10, 2 mg%), carotinoids (0, 13 - 0, 21 mg%). Proteins of Biobardins are inhomogeneous by their molecular mass and solubility in water and salt solutions. Both Biobardins are characterized by the mineral composition identical to the composition of relative distillers grains phase. During the experiments on animals practical nontoxicity and hepatotoxicity absence of Biobardins were established. Using prednisole stomach ulcers of rats as a model a signified gastroprotective influence of Biobardin BM was established.
