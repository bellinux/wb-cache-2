5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes {{a moment to}} the right. The moment is small compared to the moment <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E

5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes {{a source of}} heat. Depending {{on the amount of}} tilt, the heat <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2005, the Washington Blade {{also ran}} a free news {{clipping}} service called the BladeWire. This service collected news stories {{of interest to}} the LGBT community from a variety of local, state, regional, national, and selected international media sources. The service was <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Blades editors and was published on the internet. A feature of the BladeWire also allowed it to be syndicated onto other websites using JavaScript.|$|E
5|$|Camberwell Green, at the {{junction}} of Camberwell Road and Camberwell Church Street, was the traditional site of Camberwell Fair, an annual fair held every August.

40|$|Having {{established}} some {{properties of}} sequences <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> summing <b>the</b> digits of squared positive integers (Okagbue et al, 2015), we go {{a step further}} to explore the properties and characteristics of sequences <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> summing <b>the</b> digits of cubed positive integers. The results are different from summing the digits of squared positive integers. Two distinct sequences were obtained: one <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> summing <b>the</b> digits of cubed positive integers and the other sequence as the complement of the first but the domain remains the positive integers. The properties of these two sequences are discussed. The properties include their decompositions, subsequences, algebraic, additive, multiplicative, divisibility, uniqueness and ratios...|$|R

5|$|Capacitive discharge: {{this is a}} nonthermal plasma <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{application}} of RF power (e.g., 13.56MHz) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance {{on the order of}} 1cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{resistance}} welding (ERW) – a welding process that produces coalescence of laying surfaces where heat {{to form the}} weld is <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electrical resistance of the material. In general, an efficient method, but limited to relatively thin material.|$|E
5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E

5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on about half of the volcanoes; under the {{influence}} of pyroclastic flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous lahars such as the one <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia. This eruption claimed 23,000 fatalities, and lahars are a major cause of volcanic eruption associated fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Glow {{discharge}} plasmas: non-thermal plasmas <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{application of}} DC or low frequency RF (<100 kHz) electric {{field to the}} gap between two metal electrodes.

5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E

The number of flights would be limited to 40 per day, and the increase would be phased in over three years to 2016. The airfield was mostly used for VIP jets, with about 3,800 miilitary flights a year.|$|E
5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been <b>generated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.|$|E
