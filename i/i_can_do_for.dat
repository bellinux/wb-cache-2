500|$|Foreigners like Coey {{who volunteered}} for the Rhodesian Army {{received}} the same pay and conditions of service as local regulars. Ideologically and religiously motivated, Coey viewed himself {{as a kind of}} latter-day crusader. He kept a thorough journal of his thoughts and experiences throughout his army service. [...] "I believe God intended me to come here for some purpose," [...] he wrote soon after enlisting. [...] "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is the most <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> my country under the circumstances." [...] He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify [...] "his people" [...] against a foreign conspiracy. His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you. Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies.

2500|$|Gupta {{describes}} the letter written by Tagore as [...] "historic". He writes that Tagore [...] "renounced his knighthood in {{protest against the}} inhuman cruelty of the British Government {{to the people of}} Punjab", and he quotes Tagore's letter to the Viceroy [...] "The enormity of the measures taken by the Government in the Punjab for quelling some local disturbances has, with a rude shock, revealed to our minds the helplessness of our position as British subjects in India ... he very least that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> my country is to take all consequences upon myself in giving voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised into a dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation..." [...] English Writings of Rabindranath Tagore Miscellaneous Writings Vol# 8 carries a facsimile of this hand written letter.|$|E
2500|$|For {{people with}} incomes above $250,000, Obama wants {{to reduce their}} {{charitable}} tax deduction from 35 cents for each dollar donated to 28 cents for each dollar donated, to match the level of deductions for people making less than $250,000. In a press conference on March 24, 2009, Obama stated {{that he wanted to}} return to the rate that existed in the Reagan administration. [...] "There's very little evidence that this has a significant impact on charitable giving," [...] said Obama. [...] "I'll tell you what has a significant impact on charitable giving, is a financial crisis and an economy that's contracting. And so {{the most important thing that}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> charitable giving is to fix the economy, to get banks lending again, to get businesses opening their doors again, to get people back to work again." [...] Thomas L. Hungerford of the Congressional Research Service has written that [...] "allowing the tax cuts targeted to high income taxpayers to expire as scheduled could help reduce budget deficits in the short-term without stifling the economic recovery." ...|$|E
