This has several disadvantages however, first a willing second person has to be found, and secondly unless the other person has {{had a lot of}} practice holding hanks, the yarn winds off a swift much better. Yarn tends to catch on the hands and wristwatches of the person holding the hank, and a swift has neither hand nor watch to catch the yarn.|$|E
25|$|After her imprisonment, Bembenek filed three {{unsuccessful}} appeals of her conviction citing police {{errors in}} handling of key {{evidence and the}} fact that one of the prosecution's witnesses, Judy Zess, had recanted her testimony, stating it was made under duress. Bembenek and her supporters also alleged that Milwaukee police may have singled her out for prosecution because of her role as a key witness in a federal investigation into police corruption. Bembenek's supporters suggested that Fred Schultz may have arranged to <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> murder his ex-wife. One possible candidate was Frederick Horenberger, a career criminal who briefly worked with Schultz on a remodeling project and was a former boyfriend of Judy Zess. A disguised Horenberger had robbed and beaten Judy Zess several weeks prior to Christine Schultz's murder and would later serve a ten-year sentence for that crime.|$|E

[...] Dianne Ebertt Beeaff, author of A Grand Madness: Ten Years on the Road with U2, sees the song's narrator as longing for assistance from any source, religious or secular: [...] "This is a real plea, a bleary worn-down drained wish to disappear.

500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me.

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{develops}} {{this discussion}} of games into the key {{notion of a}} language-game. Wittgenstein introduces the term using simple examples, but intends it {{to be used for}} the many ways in which we use language. The central component of language games is that they are uses of language, and language is used in multifarious ways. For example, in one language-game, a word might be used to stand for (or refer to) an object, but in another the same word might be used for giving orders, or for asking questions, and so on. The famous example is {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "game". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, [...] "war games". These are all different uses of the word [...] "games". Wittgenstein also gives the example of [...] "Water!", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or as an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word [...] "water" [...] has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society.|$|E

And now Beyonce wants us to know that this album ... reflects how: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> that takes over when it's time for me to work and when I'm on stage, this alter ego that I've created kind of protects me and who I really am." [...] The Courant commented [...] "her musical forebear Janet Jackson is occasionally known as Damita Jo, so why shouldn't Beyonce have an alter-ego, too?". The rear artwork of Jennifer Lopez's Rebirth drew comparisons to Jackson's Damita Jo album cover, depicting Lopez topless in a similar pose amidst a white backdrop. Critics cited [...] "Just a Little While" [...] to influence Crystal Kay's [...] "Busy Doing Nothing" [...] and Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Cherry Pie." [...] The Washington Times likened Whitney Houston's [...] "Like I Never Left", a duet with Akon, to being inspired by Jackson's [...] "My Baby," [...] which featured Kanye West.

2500|$|Cen Wenben's {{activities}} for the several following years were not recorded in history. By 627, when Emperor Gaozu's son, Emperor Taizong, was emperor, he was a lowly-ranked secretary at the Palace Library but {{also served as a}} junior official at the legislative bureau. On one occasion when Emperor Taizong carried out a field-tilling ceremony (to show ceremonial attention to farming), Cen wrote an ode to field-tilling, and on one New Year's Day when Emperor Taizong summoned the imperial officials to a feast, Cen wrote an ode to New Year's Day. The odes were considered beautifully written, and Cen became famous from them. The general Li Jing (who had at one point served as Li Xiaogong's assistant) also recommended him. He was promoted to a mid-level post in the legislative bureau and became more well regarded by Emperor Taizong. After Yan Shigu, the official who was largely responsible for drafting imperial edicts during the reign of Emperor Gaozu, was dismissed around that time, the chancellor Wen Yanbo, the head of the legislative bureau, stated to Emperor Taizong that no one was capable as drafting imperial edicts as Yan and sought to have Yan reinstated. Emperor Taizong instead responded, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> in mind; you, Duke, need not worry." [...] He then made Cen the deputy head of the legislative bureau and made Cen in charge of drafting imperial edicts. At that time, Cen was also assisting Linghu Defen in compiling the official history of the Northern Zhou state, the Book of Zhou. It was said that most of the commentaries on the biographies were written by Cen. After the work was completed in 636, Emperor Taizong created Cen the Viscount of Jiangling. In 637, when Emperor Taizong visited the eastern capital Luoyang, there were heavy floods of rivers near Luoyang, and Cen took this opportunity to submit a secret petition urging Emperor Taizong to reduce his travel out of the capital. He also pointed out that too many construction projects were being carried out on behalf of Emperor Taizong's favorite son, Li Tai (the Prince of Wei) — that such expenditures will breed further expenditures. Emperor Taizong was pleased with Cen's petitions and awarded him with silk. In 642, Cen was given the additional designation of Zhuanzhang Jimi (專掌機密) — considered a chancellor de facto designation. It was said that Cen was humble and, despite his honorable status, he always greeted those who had known, no matter how minor that person's position was.|$|E

6000|$|The [...] "approaching marriage" [...] {{referred}} {{of course}} to Dr. Dumfarthing's betrothal to Juliana Furlong. It was not known that he had ever exactly proposed to her. But it was understood that before giving up his charge he drew her attention, in very severe terms, to the fact that, as his daughter was now leaving him, he must either <b>have</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to look after his manse or else be compelled to incur {{the expense of a}} paid housekeeper. This latter alternative, he said, was not one that he cared to contemplate. He also reminded her that she was now at a time of life when she could hardly expect to pick and choose and that her spiritual condition was one of, at least, great uncertainty. These combined statements are held, under the law of Scotland at any rate, to be equivalent to an offer of marriage.|$|E
