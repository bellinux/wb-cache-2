40|$|Dimensions of {{one kind}} of {{stainless}} steel plate before finish rolling were obtained through analysis of the rough rolling processes by finite element method and updated geometrical method. The FE models of finish rolling process with a front <b>edge</b> <b>roll</b> were built, and influences of the edge rolling reduction on the stress change in the plate edge during finish rolling were analyzed. The results show that when the edge rolling reduction is increased from 0 mm to 2 mm, the compressive stress in plate corner clearly increases in edge rolling process, and the zone of tensile stress during whole rolling decreases; when the edge rolling reduction is increased from 2 mm to 5 mm, the compressive stress in the plate corner seldom changes, and the compressive stress decreases after the horizontal rolling...|$|E
40|$|In-plane {{geometrical}} defects on wafer surfaces following Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) processing in {{the lateral}} millimeter range and in vertical dimensions in the nanometer range are of increasing importance. They {{will become a}} severe yield limiting factor in the 32 nm generations and below. At the wafer edge these defects are known as <b>edge</b> <b>roll</b> off (ERO). The feasibility of measuring flatness and geometry of bare silicon wafers and patterned wafers from different process steps as e. g. shallow trench isolation (STI) and interconnect metallization was successfully demonstrated using wave front sensing. The used wave front sensing methods were according to Makyoh and Shack Hartmann. The specifications achieved were for the Makyoh method a lateral resolution of 2. 4 mm and for Shack Hartmann method 1. 1 mm. The vertical resolution was 100 nm for the Makyoh method and 50 nm for the Shack Hartmann method. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDemand for {{diminishing}} <b>edge</b> <b>roll</b> off of workpiece has rapidly increased, {{particularly in}} polishing silicon wafers as the substrates of the semiconductor devices and glass disks as the substrates of magnetic media disks. In general, {{the usage of}} harder polishing pads {{is thought to be}} very effective in achieving the high surface flatness of the workpiece edge. Then the hardness, especially the rubber hardness of the polishing pads is widely measured {{as one of the most}} important pad specifications in practical processes. However, it has not been clarified whether the edge surface flatness can be estimated by the current rubber hardness tests. Then, based on the elastic contact theory, the polishing pad property which influences the surface profile near the edge was investigated and, as a result, it was found that the usage of the indenter with a diameter of 20 mm or above could estimate the obtained edge surface flatness appropriately in indentation tests such as rubber hardness tests...|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} design blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> for {{arbitrary}} rim shape compact range reflectors is presented. The reflectors may be center-fed or offset-fed.

A procedure to obtain optimum <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> parameter is also presented. The procedure leads to blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> that minimize the diffracted fields emanating from the junction between the paraboloid and the <b>rolled</b> <b>edge</b> surface while satisfying certain constraints regarding the reflector size and the minimum operating frequency of the system...|$|R
40|$|In {{a compact}} range (which employs a {{parabolic}} main reflector to convert the spherical wave originating from a point source to a reflected plane wave) the edge-generated diffractive fields degrade the uniformity of the plane wave.

This paper discusses the problem of designing an optimized <b>rolled</b> <b>edge.</b> Two examples of reflectors with <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> are presented, one with elliptic <b>rolled</b> <b>edges</b> and the other with blended <b>rolled</b> <b>edges,</b> both adhering to the same constraints on minimum operating frequency and size.
