5|$|British Airways (BA) is {{the largest}} airline in the United Kingdom based on fleet size, or the second largest, behind easyJet, when {{measured}} by passengers carried. The airline is based in Waterside near its main hub at London Heathrow Airport. In January 2011 BA merged with Iberia, creating the International Airlines Group (IAG), a holding company registered in Madrid, Spain. IAG is the world's third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and in the <b>FTSE</b> <b>100</b> Index.|$|E
5|$|On July 2008 British Airways {{announced}} a merger plan with Iberia, another flag carrier airline in the Oneworld alliance, wherein each airline would retain its original brand. The agreement was confirmed in April 2010, and in July the European Commission and US Department of Transport permitted the merger {{and began to}} co-ordinate transatlantic routes with American Airlines. On 6 October 2010 the alliance between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations. The alliance generates an estimated £230million in annual cost-saving for BA, {{in addition to the}} £330million which would be saved by the merger with Iberia. This merger was finalised on 21 January 2011, resulting in the International Airlines Group (IAG), the world's third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest airline group in Europe. Prior to merging, British Airways owned a 13.5% stake in Iberia, and thus received ownership of 55% of the combined International Airlines Group; Iberia's other shareholders received the remaining 45%. As a part of the merger, British Airways ceased trading independently on the London Stock Exchange after 23 years as a constituent of the <b>FTSE</b> <b>100</b> Index.|$|E

40|$|In the {{deprivation}} indices: Taking {{stock of}} the <b>FTSE,</b> the <b>100</b> logos and brand identities of the UK’s top <b>100</b> <b>FTSE</b> index companies are presented through a rapid fire game of word association from which a narrative (of sorts) emerges.

The Deprivation Indices raises questions about class and identity in a neoliberal political landscape and asks if it is possible for a disenfranchised, underpaid and overworked population to build creative relationships with images outside of the dominant discourse of late capitalism. This is a deliberately provocative, radical writing and performance inspired by artists like Penny Arcade - Bitch! Dyke! Faghag! Whore! And exhibitions like Branded and on Display.

40|$|Who speaks? And {{who does}} not? And {{who is it}} that listens? The answers to these {{questions}} matter. This paper is a performance, a draft of which was given at Knowle West Media Centre in March 2015. In Sharing the Index, the 100 logos and brand identities of the UK’s top <b>100</b> <b>FTSE</b> index companies are conveyed through a rapid fire game of word association from which a narrative (of sorts) emerges. What is revealed is the story of how these companies (Vodafone, United Utilities, Dorothy Perkins, Shell etc.) have become entwined within the fabric of everyday life, and what is offered is an interpretation of their impacts on a community. But this isn’t just a story. Sharing the Index raises questions about the possibilities for radicalism within a neoliberal political landscape. How might a disenfranchised, underpaid and overworked population become motivated towards collective radical action? Sharing the Index is a deliberately provocative, radical writing and performance work (inspired by artists like Penny Arcade - Bitch! Dyke! Faghag! Whore!), which soberly critiques late capitalism and its role in establishing and maintaining the conditions of poverty. This performance relies upon ‘reclamation’ and ‘reverse discourse’ (Foucault, History of Sexuality: Vol 1) as a move towards personal and socio-political empowerment.

Multiple regressions are applied to test the significance of board leadership structures, board remuneration and firm size to firm profitability.

40|$|Executive summary This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the extent of goodwill impairment and the properties of CEOs and CFOs of a selection of <b>FTSE</b> Eurotop <b>100</b> Index companies. Prior research indicated that it is likely that CEOs tend to take earnings baths early in their tenure, as the losses can then still easily be blamed on their predecessors, as well as creating a lower benchmark for measuring their own future financial performance. Also, the nature of a specific turnover process and the prior employment of the incoming CEO (hired from within or outside the company) have been considered as an explanatory variable by some studies. The outcomes {{of this study indicate that}} the tenure and prior employment of the CEO are significantly associated with a company’s financial reporting behavior in relation to the magnitude of goodwill impairment. However, contrary to expectations, goodwill impairment charges are likely to increase as the tenure of a CEO increases. CEOs promoted from inside the same company are likely to impair goodwill by larger amounts, compared to CEOs hired from outside the company. A significant association between the CFO tenure and prior employment variables and the magnitude of impairment charges was not established in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterisation}} {{of equity}} market return series as random in nature {{has been questioned}} in recent times by the application of new statistical tools. This study uses recent advances in chaos theory to examine the behaviour of the London Financial Times Stock Exchange (<b>FTSE)</b> All Share, <b>100,</b> 250 and 350 equity indices. The results reject {{the hypothesis that the}} index series examined in this study are random, independent and identically distributed. The results show that the FTSE stock index returns series is not truly random since some cycles or patterns show up more frequently than would be expected in a true random series. A Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH(1, 1)) process appears to explain the behaviour of the index series. The results may have implications for derivative instruments on the indices as well as for weak form market efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates trade {{duration}} {{clusters of}} all stocks {{listed in the}} F T SE 100 stock index. We address the question whether or not different stocks from different industry sectors have different duration patterns {{when it comes to}} trading these assets. The answer to this is essential in highfrequency trading as the similarity of durations will reduce the problem of asynchronous trading and improve the scheduling of order placement for certain trading strategies. A flexible augmented ACD model is estimated to capture the duration cluster patterns for trade durations in a limit order book by analyzing the arrival process of trades in the electronic markets. Using transaction data of all <b>100</b> <b>FTSE</b> stocks traded at the London Stock Exchange, 69 stocks could be reasonably modelled by a ACD(1, 1) specification and, thus, selected for a subsequent cluster analysis to find similarities of the duration patterns across all stocks in our sample.

30|$|We {{examined}} {{a sample of}} 1990 serial acquisitions {{that were part of}} 379 series, which were announced by 267 listed acquirers from the UK, Germany, and France between January 1 st, 1995 and December 31, 2008. Acquirers were listed as of January 1 st, 1995, in the <b>FTSE</b> 350, HDAX <b>100</b> or SBF 120 indexes or were created through a merger of equals prior to 2008. By choosing this time period, our sample covers several M&A-cycles. The starting point of 1995 ensures that duties for ad hoc reporting are in place for all three countries. Germany was the last to introduce this duty, on January 1, 1995, due to the implementation of the second capital market support law (Zweites Finanzmarkt-förderungsgesetz) and § 15 WpHG (the Securities Trading Act). To be included in the sample, acquirers must have been clearly identifiable in Worldscope, Datastream, and Thomson Financial SDC and not part of the financial services industry (SIC 6000 - 6999). Furthermore, accounting data in the fiscal year prior to the announcement date of an acquisition had to be available in Worldscope, and capital market data up to 10  days before as well as 10  days after the announcement date had to be available in Datastream.|$|R
