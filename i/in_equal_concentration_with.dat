40|$|The {{sensitivity}} and selectivity of voltammetric sensor for uric acid {{can be improved}} by modifying the working electrode using a polymer with a molecular template (molecularly imprinted polymer, MIP). Polymer and MIP was synthesized from methacrylic acid (MAA) as monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylic acid (EGDMA) as cross-linker, uric acid (UA) as template {{and the results were}} characterized by various methods. The poly-MAA formation was identified by a decrease in the intensity of infrared (IR) spectra at ~ 1540 cm- 1 (C=C) and an increase at ~ 1700 cm- 1 (C=O) compared to the IR spectra of the MAA and EGDMA. The SEM analysis showed that the cavity of polymer is small enough (~ 0. 1 µm) and homogeneous. Establishment of MIP was carried out by extracting of the uric acid from the polymer network. The IR spectra of MIP exhibited the decrease in intensity at ~ 1700 cm- 1 (C=O) compared to the non imprinted polymer (NIP). The data of BET analysis showed that polymer pore size increase slightly from 37. 71 Å to 38. 02 Å after the extraction process of uric acid from the polymer network. Its may be due to incomplete extraction of uric acid from the polymer network. Modifications of hanging mercury drop electrode using MIP made from MAA, EGDMA, and UA with a mole ratio of 1 : 3 : 1 produced a sensitive and selective voltammetric sensor for uric acid. The sensitivity obtained was 16. 405 nA L/µg. The presence of ascorbic acid <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>with</b> uric acid decreased the current response of only 0. 08 %.

40|$|The room-temperature crystal {{structures}} of Ba 6 Mn 4 MO 15 (M = Zn, Cu) have been refined using X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data simultaneously. Ba 6 Mn 4 ZnO 15 is isostructural with Ba 6 Ni 5 O 15 and contains transition metals in chains of oxide polyhedra (trigonal prisms and octahedra); neighboring chains {{are separated from}} each other by the Ba atoms. Zn and Mn occupy the trigonal prismatic site <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>concentrations,</b> <b>with</b> the remaining Zn and Mn partially ordered over the two crystallographically distinct octahedral sites. The neutron diffraction data show Ba 6 Mn 4 CuO 15 to adopt a very similar structure but reveal that Cu is displaced {{from the center of}} the trigonal prism to give pseudo-square-planar coordination. A neutron diffraction experiment performed at 1. 7 K showed additional intensity due to long-range magnetic order on the octahedral sites, and this has been modeled using an unusual magnetic structure in which the antiferromagnetic superexchange within the highly frustrated crystal structure leads to a rotation of 120 Δ between spins in neighboring chains. The magnetic moments refined to 0. 16 (2) and 0. 12 (3) μB per octahedral site in the Cu and Zn compounds, respectively. The magnetic susceptibility of Ba 6 Mn 4 CuO 15 is consistent with the trigonal prismatic Cu remaining paramagnetic in the range 5 ≤ T/K ≤ 300, in which case the contribution to the susceptibility from the octahedrally coordinated Mn is qualitatively similar to the observed susceptibility of Ba 6 Mn 4 ZnO 15, showing a broad maximum (90 (5) K for M = Cu, 45 (5) K for M = Zn) indicative of 1 -dimensional ordering. In neither compound is it possible to identify the Neel temperature, although the susceptibility of Ba 6 Mn 4 CuO 15 suggests that the Cu spins in trigonal prismatic coordination freeze at 5 K, and it is likely that this coincides with the onset of long-range magnetic ordering on the octahedral sites...|$|R

50|$|Cells {{have a more}} acidic pH {{inside the}} cell than outside (gastric mucosal cells being an exception). Therefore, basic drugs (like bupivacaine, pyrimethamine) are more charged inside the cell than outside. The cell {{membrane}} is permeable to non-ionized (fat-soluble) molecules; ionized (water-soluble) molecules cannot cross it easily. Once a non-charged molecule of a basic chemical crosses the cell membrane to enter the cell, it becomes charged due to gaining a hydrogen ion because of the lower pH inside the cell, and thus becomes unable to cross back. Because transmembrane equilibrium must be maintained, another unionized molecule must diffuse into the cell to repeat the process.

30|$|The {{effect of}} mixing of {{groundwater}} and its {{behavior on the}} Piper plot is well explained by Karmegam et al. (2011) and Singaraja et al. (2012). The observed pattern of compositional change suggests that cation exchange reactions are taking place when saltwater intrusion occurs (Jeen et al. 2001; Richter and Kreitler 1993). Most of the groundwater samples indicated a chemical composition dominated by sodium and chloride ions, which usually specifies a strong seawater influence (Pulido-Leboeuf 2004). The Ca–HCO 3 type of water probably signifies the partly flushed water or confined saline water source, in which HCO 3 {{is higher than the}} alkaline earth cations (Ca + Mg) <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>concentrations</b> (Mercado 1985). This is more prominent in Alluvial aquifer due to frequent flushing or recharge of groundwater. These excess HCO 3 ions release the alkali ions (usually Na+) which enter into the groundwater by ion exchange processes (Jeen et al. 2001), whereas it results in the domination of Na+ in groundwater.|$|R

Pure analytical grade SO 2 (99.9  %) gas in pressurized gas cylinders purchased from AFROX (Pty) Ltd, South Africa was used. All standard solutions were prepared <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 100  mg/L using double-distilled water with zero levels of dissolved oxygen. Different concentrations of HCl acid solutions (1.0, 3.0 and 4.0  M) were prepared by diluting HCl acid solution (10  M, 32  % HCl) with known quantities of distilled water. 99.9  % pure analytical grade SO 2 gas in pressurized gas cylinders {{was used in}} G–L precipitation tests at moderately high pressure (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 bars). The concentration (99.9  %) and flow rate (177  ml/min) of SO 2 gas were kept constant throughout the tests. The stirring speed (500  rpm) was also kept constant throughout the tests. Barren solution samples which remained after precipitation were analysed for platinum, iron, cobalt and chromium {{by means of an}} Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical Emission Spectrophotometer (ICP–OES) instrument (Shimadzu model ICPE– 9000). Solid samples (dry precipitates) were analysed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The experiments were carried out using a CSTR, (2 L capacity, Büchiglasuster pressure glass vessel autoclave).|$|R
40|$|Mixed alkali effect (MAE) in x(Na_ 2 O). (30 - x) K_ 2 O. 70 B_ 2 O_ 3 (x = 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25) glasses doped with 0. 5 Ho_ 2 O_ 3 {{has been}} {{investigated}} by measuring the optical properties of Ho^ 3 +. From the optical absorption spectra, optical band gaps (E_opt) for both direct and indirect transitions have been calculated using Davis and Mott theory and are found to exhibit a minimum when the two alkalies are <b>in</b> <b>equal</b> <b>concentration</b> (due to mixed alkali effect). Spectroscopic parameters like Racah (E^ 1, E^ 2, E^ 3), spin-orbit (ξ_ 4 f), configuration interaction (α,β) and Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters (Ω_ 2, Ω_ 4 and Ω_ 6) have been calculated {{as a function of}} x. Also radiative and non-radiative transition probabilities (A_T and W_MPR), radiative lifetimes (τ_R), branching ratios (β) and integrated absorption cross sections (Σ) have been obtained. The spectral profile of the hypersensitive transition has been correlated to the site symmetry of the rare earth ion. The trends observed in the intensity parameters, radiative lifetimes and stimulated emission cross sections as a function of x in these borate glasses have been discussed, keeping in view the mixed alkali effect...|$|R
