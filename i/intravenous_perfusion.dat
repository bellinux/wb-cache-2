40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects on}} hemodynamics and blood gases of an <b>intravenous</b> <b>perfusion</b> of diltiazem vs placebo, administered randomly and in a double-blind fashion, to 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction (< 24 hours). After 130 minutes, we noted a significant reduction of the arterial blood pressure and the systemic vascular resistances; the other hemodynamic variable are not significantly modified. Diltiazem causes a slight but significant decrease of PaO 2 after 130 minutes in <b>intravenous</b> <b>perfusion.</b> This effect is secondary to an increase of the arterio-alveolar gradient in O 2, reflecting an increase of the pulmonary shunt. This has no clinical consequence since the oxygen transfer remains stable. In conclusion, intravenous diltiazem administered in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is well tolerated hemodynamically and clinically. It may induce a minimal arterial hypoxemia by increasing the arterio-alveolar gradient in oxygen. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} {{induction}} treatment followed by long-term maintenance treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS) has attracted considerable attention. The combination of mitoxantrone as the induction therapy {{followed by an}} immunomodulatory drug (e. g., interferon beta or glatiramer acetate) as the maintenance therapy is of particular interest. This approach is suitable for patients with particularly aggressive disease, characterised by frequent relapses with incomplete recovery and the accumulation of focal lesions visible on magnetic resonance imaging. A long-term study has shown that a short (6  month) course of mitoxantrone followed by maintenance therapy with an immunomodulatory drug brings about a rapid reduction in disease activity and subsequent sustained disease control for at least 5  years. Furthermore, randomised {{studies have demonstrated that}} induction with mitoxantrone followed by maintenance treatment affords better disease control than monotherapy with an interferon beta. Natalizumab is also effective in patients with very active MS, but has a propensity to result in rebound inflammatory disease activity on withdrawal.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} this study: Despite improvements in clinical outcome following treatment of synovial sepsis in horses, the prognosis for survival following septic navicular bursitis remains guarded, whilst the prognosis for athletic activity is considered poor. Surgical intervention is deemed essential for resolution. Two different surgical endoscopic {{approaches to the}} bursa have been described, however only {{the use of the}} direct approach has been reported in the management of clinical sepsis. The risk of inadvertent penetration of adjacent synovial structures with this approach is reported but has not been quantified. A transthecal approach, via the digital flexor tendon sheath, is considered to involve fewer complications than the direct approach but is typically reserved for elective examination of the aseptic bursa. The use of this approach in sepsis has not been evaluated. <b>Intravenous</b> regional limb <b>perfusion</b> with antimicrobials is an established adjunct in the management of synovial sepsis and is suggested to improve case outcome. The synovial concentrations of antimicrobial achieved following IVRP in case’s of clinical sepsis have not been established. Objectives: To quantify the risk of inadvertent synovial structure penetration when making a direct surgical endoscopic approach to the navicular bursa. To determine a safer direct approach, with reduced risk of inadvertent synovial penetration. · To review the outcome of clinical case’s of navicular bursa sepsis following surgical management via the transthecal endoscopic approach and post-operative management involving <b>intravenous</b> regional limb <b>perfusion</b> with amikacin. To compare these outcomes with those reported following management via the direct approach. · To investigate the concentrations of amikacin achieved in synovial fluid following IVRP in clinical case’s of synovial sepsis. Hypotheses: · There is significant risk of inadvertently penetrating the distal interphalangeal joint and/or digital flexor tendon sheath when making a direct surgical endoscopic approach to the navicular bursa, with attendant potential for contamination of these structures when managing septic bursitis. Making the approach as abaxial as possible and advancing the instrument in a sagittal trajectory will minimise the risk of inadvertent synovial penetration. · The prognoses for survival and return to athletic function following surgical management of navicular bursa sepsis via the transthecal approach, in addition to post-operative <b>intravenous</b> regional <b>perfusion</b> with amikacin, are comparable with those reportedly managed via the direct approach. The surgical technique permits simplified postoperative intrasynovial medication and monitoring of synovial fluid parameters by establishing communication between the bursa and tendon sheath · Following regional <b>intravenous</b> limb <b>perfusion,</b> the levels of amikacin accumulated in contaminated synovial structures are greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration for commonly encountered bacteria, potentially validating the contribution of perfusion techniques as adjunct therapies in treating synovial sepsis. Methods: · Using 40 cadaver horse limbs, a conventional endoscopic approach, was made to the lateral aspect of the navicular bursa of each limb. Successful entry was confirmed endoscopically. Centesis and distension of the DFTS and DIPJ were performed to determine whether communication with the arthroscopic portal or bursa had occurred. Positive contrast radiographic navicular bursograms were performed to identify iatrogenic communication with the DFTS and/or DIPJ. A pilot study employing a modified approach was performed. · The case records of 10 horses presented with navicular bursa contamination, which underwent therapeutic surgical endoscopy of the navicular bursa via a transthecal approach and received post-operative <b>intravenous</b> regional <b>perfusion</b> with amikacin were evaluated retrospectively. Follow-up information was obtained by telephone questionnaire. · <b>Intravenous</b> regional limb <b>perfusion</b> with amikacin was performed on clinical case’s of synovial sepsis and synovial fluid was aspirated from the contaminated synovial cavity 30 minutes later. Synovial fluid amikacin concentration was then measured. Results: · Using the direct surgical approach to the navicular bursa, inadvertent penetration of a synovial structure occurred in 45...|$|R

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical and operational reports of a single helicopter-based emergency medical service. Data from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008 were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 921 patients were identified, with a male:female ratio of 2 : 1. There were 56 (6 %) patients aged 15 or under. The median time from emergency call to helicopter take-off was 7 min (IQR = 5 - 10 min). 840 (91 %) patients suffered from trauma-related injuries, with falls from heights during sports activities the most frequent event. The most common injuries involved the legs (246 or 27 %), head (175 or 19 %), upper limbs (117 or 13 %), spine (108 or 12 %), and femur (66 or 7 %). Only 81 (9 %) victims suffered from a medical emergency, but these cases were, {{when compared to the}} trauma victims, significantly more severe according to the NACA index (p< 0. 001). Overall, 246 (27 %) patients had a severe injury or illness, namely, a potential or overt vital threat (NACA score between 4 and 6). A total of 478 (52 %) patients required administration of major analgesics: fentanyl (443 patients or 48 %), ketamine (42 patients or 5 %) or morphine (7 patients or 1 %).

Conclusions: Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy is a condition often misdiagnosed. A clinical presentation suggestive of acute coronary syndrome in a postmenopausal woman without history of coronary disease and in whom a precipitating stressful event can be found should lead the physician to suspect the diagnosis of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy.

40|$|The {{dual role}} of P 2 Y 1 and P 2 Y 12 receptors in {{platelet}} aggregation by ADP has been firmly established, {{based on the}} action of selective inhibitors, gene targeting in mice and human genetic evidence. Both of these receptor subtypes constitute targets for antithrombotic agents, and compounds with a dual action might also be of interest. However, the agents currently on the market (ticlopidine and clopidogrel), or known to be in development (cangrelor, AZD- 6140 and prasugrel), all target the P 2 Y 12 receptor. The thienopyridines (ticlopidine, clopidogrel and prasugrel) irreversibly inactivate the P 2 Y 12 receptor via the covalent binding of an active metabolite generated in the liver, while the other compounds are competitive antagonists.

The remaining four dogs did not undergo extracorporeal circulation and served as control subjects. In both groups, ancrod administration itself resulted in a marked drop in alpha 2 -antiplasmin (33 % and 67 %, respectively, of the baseline values) and in slight but significant decreases in factor II and plasminogen activities of 25 % and 20 %, respectively (p less than 0. 05), in the group subjected to carbon dioxide removal. There were no significant changes in platelet number or factor V and antithrombin III activities. During the 6 -hour bypass period, platelet count and antithrombin III and factor II and V levels decreased significantly. No bleeding was observed.

40|$|Background/Aims: Bosentan, a dual endothelin ETA/B {{receptor}} antagonist, {{may cause}} dose-dependent reversible cholestatic liver injury. We herein tested whether bosentan or metabolites, both eliminated in bile, induce alterations in bile secretion. Methods: Bile flow and output of bile constituents were monitored in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats with biliary fistulas. Normal and TR rats {{with a genetic defect}} in mrp 2, received bosentan intravenous injections. Results: Bosentan bolus intravenous injections of 0. 1 - 10 mg/kg triggered a dose-dependent increase in biliary bilirubin excretion. In addition, doses (greater {{than or equal}} to 10 mg/kg) caused a sustained increase in canalicular bile salt-independent bile flow, combined with significant increases in the concentration and output or glutathione and of bicarbonate in bile. In rats receiving bosentan (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg), both under basal conditions and under <b>intravenous</b> taurocholate <b>perfusion</b> (2 mumol/min/kg), phospholipid and cholesterol secretions were profoundly inhibited and uncoupled from bile salt secretion. In TR - rats, the choleretic effect of bosentan was reduced to non-significant levels. The stimulation of bilirubin secretion and the uncoupling of phospholipid from bile salt secretion were absent, whereas that of cholesterol was maintained.

30|$|Sedation and {{analgesia}} {{is particularly}} challenging {{in children with}} regards to a specific metabolism because tolerance and withdrawal phenomena are frequently observed in cases of prolonged administration [9]. Many studies have proved that continuous <b>intravenous</b> <b>perfusion</b> of drugs is associated with longer mechanical ventilation [2, 3]. Recent years have seen emerging techniques of goal-directed sedation. These include daily interruption of sedatives and nurse-driven protocols. In adults, Kress et al. [10] evaluated daily interruption of sedatives and showed {{a significant reduction in}} the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and cumulative doses of midazolam and opioids. Nurse-driven sedation and analgesia protocols were evaluated in adults and, despite interesting results [11 – 13], a Cochrane review in 2015 concluded that there was insufficient evidence {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} protocol-directed sedation [14]. In paediatric units, goal-directed sedation protocols were also developed but few studies were found in the literature, with unclear results [15 – 17]. Recently, a randomised controlled trial among children admitted in PICU for acute lung injury showed no difference in duration of ventilation regardless of sedation protocol or usual care implementation [18]. Daily interruption of sedation was also studied in PICU: Gupta et al. [19] and Verlaat et al. [20] showed a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation, PICU length of stay, and duration of benzodiazepine perfusion with a daily sedation interruption protocol. However, more recently a RCT including 129 patients [21] under sedation protocol assessed the impact of daily sedation interruption in critically ill children and no improvement of clinical outcomes was found; an increased mortality was even found in the group with daily sedation interruption without any evidence of a relationship.|$|E
40|$|Fluoroquinolones are {{antibiotics}} {{with central}} excitatory side effects. These adverse effects presumably result from inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to GABAA receptors. This GABA antagonistic effect is greatly potentiated by the active metabolite of fenbufen, biphenylacetic acid (BPAA). Nevertheless, it remains questionable whether GABA receptor antagonism alone {{can explain the}} convulsant activity potentials of these antimicrobial agents. The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible effects of norfloxacin, both in the absence and {{in the presence of}} BPAA, on the extracellular hippocampal levels of GABA and glutamate, the main central inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, respectively. This in vivo microdialysis approach with conscious rats allows monitoring of behavioral alterations and concomitant transmitter modulation in the hippocampus. Peroral administration of 100 mg of BPAA per kg of body weight had no effect on behavior and did not significantly alter extracellular GABA or glutamate concentrations. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>perfusion</b> of 300 mg of norfloxacin per kg did not change the rat's behavior or the concomitant neurotransmitter levels in about half of the experiments, while the remaining animals exhibited severe seizures. These norfloxacin-induced convulsions did not affect extracellular hippocampal GABA levels but were accompanied by enhanced glutamate concentrations. Half of the rats receiving both 100 mg of BPAA per kg and 50 mg of norfloxacin per kg displayed lethal seizures, while the remaining animals showed no seizure-related behavior. In the latter subgroup, again no significant alterations in extracellular GABA levels were observed, but glutamate overflow remained significantly elevated for at least 3 h. In conclusion, norfloxacin exerts convulsant activity in rats, accompanied by elevations of extracellular hippocampal glutamate levels but not GABA levels, even in the presence of BPAA...|$|E
30|$|Vaptans {{have emerged}} {{recently}} as promising {{drugs in the}} treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. They act as competitive antagonists to AVP hindering its binding to its receptors (mainly V 2 receptors) located on the basolateral pole of the collecting ducts. The result is a down regulation of AQP 2 and an increase of electrolyte-free diuresis [258]. Taken as a whole, studies focusing on patients with hyponatremia related to congestive heart failure [259, 260], cirrhosis [259, 261] and SIADH [259] have documented a positive effect of the drug on PNa levels but have failed to demonstrate that the reversal of mild to moderate hyponatremia equates with an improvement in meaningful outcomes. Furthermore, hyponatremic patients do not respond uniformly to vaptans, cirrhotic patients being less responsive to their effects [262]. Numerous impediments hamper the use of vaptans in the ICU setting. Their action is not immediate and they provide only for a modest increase in PNa levels which makes vaptans unsuitable for the treatment of highly symptomatic hyponatremia, unless they are used in combination with other strategies [263, 264]. To date, only conivaptan may be delivered intravenously and its use in the ICU has been confined to case reports or small non randomized studies [265]. After a loading dose, administration through a continuous <b>intravenous</b> <b>perfusion</b> has been advocated. However, this regimen comes with a greater risk of vascular irritation and in-site thrombosis [266]. Other notable side effects include hypokalemia, headaches, thirst and drug interactions due to competition between vaptans and other CYP 3 A 4 substrates. Finally, although seemingly rare, the risk of PNa overcorrection does exist and special attention should be paid regarding the occurrence of hyperaquaresis upon treatment initiation, especially in cases of chronic SIADH.|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{accounts}} of tiludronate administration via <b>intravenous</b> regional limb <b>perfusion</b> (IVRLP) exist despite {{a lack of}} information regarding safety for synovial structures in the perfused area. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether tiludronate concentrations in synovial structures after IVRLP with low dose (0. 5 mg, LDT) or high dose (50 mg, HDT) tiludronate remain below a value demonstrated in vitro to be safe for articular cartilage (19, 000 ng/ml in DIP joints of two HDT limbs. Tiludronate was measurable only in synovial fluid from HDT limbs 24 h post-perfusion. There were no differences in synovial fluid cytology variables between control and treated limbs. Conclusions. In some horses, IVRLP with HDT may result in synovial fluid concentrations of tiludronate that may have adverse effects on articular cartilage, based on in vitro data. IVRLP with LDT is unlikely to promote articular cartilage degradation. Further studies to determine a safe and effective dose for IVRLP with tiludronate are needed...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} <b>intravenous</b> regional limb <b>perfusion</b> (IRLP) administration of amphotericin B in horses to treat pythiosis after surgical excision and thermocautery. Study Design Case series. Animals Horses (n = 12) with Pythium insidiosum infection of the distal aspect of the thoracic or pelvic limbs. Methods After surgical excision of granulation tissue and thermocautery, 50 mg amphotericin B was administered by IRLP through a catheter placed in a superficial vein of the affected limb next to the lesion after placing a tourniquet above the injection site. The lesions and locomotor system were evaluated before treatment and at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 60 days. Results Ninety-two percent of horses treated with amphotericin B had complete lesion resolution 35 or 60 days after 1 or 2 IRLP treatments, respectively. IRLP induced limb edema and pain during regional palpation in 42 %, and inflammation of the injection site in 33 % of horses; however these signs resolved after 14 days. Conclusions IRLP administration of amphotericin B was effective for treating pythiosis in equine limbs, resolving infection with manageable side effects.
