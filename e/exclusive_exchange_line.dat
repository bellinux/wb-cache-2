We consider a general class of continuous, strictly convex and strongly monotone preferences over bundles of goods for individuals.

This dataset and our four indices {{for the impact of}} colonialism create {{for the first time the}} opportunity to compare directly the levels of colonial transformation for a sample of 83 African and Asian countries. Some of our exploratory findings on the interrelation of the dimensions show that in British colonies political domination was in general less direct and less violent. Plantation colonies experienced more investment in infrastructure and more violence during decolonization. The correlations between indicators for economic distortion (trade policy, trade and FDI concentration) show that the economic re-direction of some colonies towards a more <b>exclusive</b> <b>exchange</b> with the metropole country was an interdependent process. In general, a more intense political domination came along with a higher level of economic transformation. If an area was transformed economically, however, a social transformation was likely to take place too, but these processes should not be confounded. In areas that were politically united for the first time under colonialism, economic distortion and social transformation were more profound...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{backbone}} {{dynamics of}} the uniformly 15 N-labeled ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) reverse transcriptase have been investigated using two-dimensional inverse-detected heteronuclear 15 N-lH NMR spectroscopy. 15 N TI, T 2, and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) data were obtained for 107 {{out of a total}} of 134 backbone amide groups. The overall rotational correlation time (78) for the protein at 26 OC is 10. 4 ns. The backbone N-H vectors for all the measurable residues exhibit very fast motions on a time scale of 1 2 0 ps. The 15 N relaxation data for only 14 residues can be explained by this single internal motion alone. A further 39 residues display a second motion on a time scale ranging from 28. 8 ps to 3. 9 ns, while another 15 residues are characterized by an additional motion on the 170 -ns to 2. 25 -ms time scale resulting in 15 N TZ <b>exchange</b> <b>line</b> broadening. There are 39 residues that exhibit both the additional 15 N T 2 <b>exchange</b> <b>line</b> broadening and the slow (28. 8 ps- 3. 9 ns) internal motion. Thus, the RNase H domain experiences extensive mobility throughout its structure as evidenced by the 93 residues which exhibit multiple modes of motion. Distinctly mobile regions of the protein are identified by large decreases in the overall order parameter (S 2) and correspond to the C-terminal residues and the loop regions betwee...|$|R

40|$|Charge {{exchange}} emission {{is known}} to provide a key diagnostic to the interface between hot and cold matter in many astrophysical environments. Most of the recent charge exchange studies focus on its emission in the X-ray band, but few on the UV part, although the latter can also provide a powerful probe of the charge exchange process. An atomic calculation, {{as well as an}} application to observed data, are presented to explore and describe the potential use of the UV data for the study of cosmic charge exchange. Using the newest charge exchange model in the SPEX code v 3. 03, we re-analyze an archival Hubble STIS data of the central region of NGC 1275. The NGC 1275 spectrum shows hints for three possible weak lines at about 1223. 6 Å, 1242. 4 Å, and 1244. 0 Å, each with a significance of about 2 - 3 σ. The putative features are best explained by charge exchange between highly ionized hydrogen, neon, and sulfur with neutral matter. The wavelengths of the charge <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> are found robustly with uncertainties ≤ 0. 3 Å. The possible charge exchange emission shows a line-of-sight velocity offset of about - 3400 km s^- 1 with respect to the NGC 1275 nucleus, which resembles one of the Lyα absorbers reported in Baum et al. (2005). This indicates that the charge <b>exchange</b> <b>lines</b> might be emitted as the same position of the absorber, which could be ascribed to outflowing gas from the nucleus.
