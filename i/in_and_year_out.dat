25|$|Bunning's 2,855 career strikeouts put him {{in second}} place on the all-time list {{at the time of}} his retirement, behind only Walter Johnson. His mark was later surpassed by other pitchers, and he is {{currently}} 17th all-time. Despite year <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>out</b> putting up excellent numbers, Bunning rarely led the league in any pitching categories. He never led the league in ERA; the only year he led the league in wins (20, in 1957, with the Detroit Tigers) was the only year he ever won 20 or more games; he did, however, lead the league in strikeouts three times (with 201 in 1959 and 1960, and 253 in 1967). He never won a Cy Young Award; the closest he would come was in 1967, his best year, when at age 35, he came in second behind Mike McCormick. He finished with a middling 17–15 record, but posted a career-best ERA (2.29), and led the league in shutouts (6), games started and innings pitched (40/302.1), and strikeouts (253). It was the only year in his career he earned any Cy Young Award votes. He did, however, win the NL Player of the Month Award June 1964, the month of his perfect game (3–0, 2.20 ERA, 42 SO).|$|E

40|$|International audienceIreland ran a {{conventional}} test and slaughter Bovine Tuberculosis eradication programme from 1954 until 1988.

At this point a major initiative, ERAD, was launched targeted with reducing the disease levels by half within a four-year period and devising the strategy and supports necessary to achieve final eradication. The lessons learned at that time have informed Ireland's eradication programme ever since. Eradication was not possible without developing solutions to address the wildlife disease reservoir and other identified constraints. Since 1992 the programme objectives have been restated. It is now effectively an interim control programme where significant resources have been invested <b>in</b> research <b>and</b> development aimed at overcoming the identified constraints to eradication.

Technological progress lets surveys become out of date within a short duration. This paper intends to shortly describe selected important advances in VIR <b>in</b> recent <b>years</b> <b>and</b> point <b>out</b> promising directions for future research. A software architecture for visual media handling is proposed that allows handling image and video content equally. This allows to integrate both types of media in a singe system. The major advances in feature design are sketched and new methods for semantic enrichment are proposed. Guidelines are formulated for further development of feature extraction methods. The most relevant retrieval processes are described and an interactive method for visual mining is suggested that really puts "the human in the loop". For evaluation, the classic recall- and precision-based approach is discussed {{as well as a}} new procedure based on MPEG- 7 and statistical data analysis. Finally, an "ideal" architecture for VIR systems is outlined. The selection of VIR topics is subjective and represents the author's point of view.

The precision required represents a huge increase in the precision currently achievable by standard ceramic processing. The project has produced very promising results. While we did not achieve the degree of precision in as-fired parts that we had targeted ({+-} 0. 025 %), we did improve our ability to hold tolerances to the {+-} 0. 25 level from our initial level of {+-} 2. 5 % on parts that were 5 to 10 inches in diameter.
