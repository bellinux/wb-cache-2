5|$|As a junior, Watts {{played in}} the forward line as a strong-marking tall and was an {{accurate}} shot on goal. Regarded as an incredibly quick player for his height, especially over the first twenty metres, his speed and athleticism saw him dominate in the forward line as a junior. After struggling to replicate his form from the juniors in the AFL, he was trialled as a defender in 2011 by then senior-coach, Dean Bailey, playing primarily as the loose man in defence. Bailey intended on using him as both a defender and forward; he recognised Watts {{would not be the}} main key forward at the club, which was intended when he was drafted, but when playing in the forward line, he would instead be used as a floating forward. He played a new role in 2012 under Mark Neeld in defence, where he was highly praised for his ability to read the play and take intercept marks. He played in defence for the duration of Neeld's tenure, until Neeld was sacked and replaced by Neil Craig in the middle of 2013 with Craig electing to return Watts to the forward line. After playing in the forward line and in defence, incoming coach in 2014, Paul Roos, saw an opportunity for Watts to play in the midfield due to his body size and elite <b>kicking,</b> <b>in</b> addition to the club needing an influx of midfielders. After the desperate need for midfielders dissipated, Watts returned to a half-forward role in the middle of 2014; he played as a half-forward throughout Roos' coaching term and was used as a back-up ruckman in 2016.|$|E

25|$|On 21 March, the 2nd Brigade, {{including}} the 3rd Bombay European Regiment, {{was before the}} formidable city of Jhansi. The defences of Jhansi and its fort were reported to look impregnable and the battle plan involved taking the city prior to {{an attack on the}} fort. Preparations for a bombardment took place during the 24–25 March and the action commenced on 25 March 1858. The enemy too kept up their matchlock and round shot fire. The 1st Brigade arrived at Jhansi on the 25th and their artillery added to the bombardment which lasted eight days. Progress was made, with much of the defences {{of the city and the}} fort in poor shape as a result of the combined bombardment, but the logistics of battle were <b>kicking</b> <b>in</b> and the continued availability of ammunition was becoming critical. On 31 March, a force of 20,000 troops of the enemy was reported to be making their way to attack the British and relieve the city.|$|E

25|$|After a “hand” within thirty {{yards of}} the Wanderers’ lines, Weir got possession, and, {{successfully}} charging the English forwards, {{passed it on to}} Herriot, who in turn placed it to Campbell, who by a well judged kick dropped the ball just below the bar, thus securing another goal for the Scotsmen in sixteen minutes. No sooner had the English captain started the ball than Herriot, Weir and Lawrie, by neat passing sent it back, and after the backs and half backs had shown good play, the two M'Neills brought it along the left side, and passing it to Lawrie, the latter made a shot for goal, but the ball passed just outside the goal post. The play was now in the centre, the Queen’s Park men dribbling and passing, while their opponents indulged chiefly in heavy <b>kicking.</b> <b>In</b> 33 minutes from the commencement of operations H. M'Neill, obtaining possession, kicked the ball to Herriot, who unselfishly serving it to Lawrie, the latter again made a shot for goal, this time with more success, as the ball, passing above the goalkeeper’s head, went clean through thus obtaining the third goal.|$|E
25|$|England {{moved into}} the quarter finals, where they met Wales at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Aided {{by the arrival of}} Catt at half-time, Wilkinson went on to score 23points in the match, which England won 28–17 to proceed to the semi-finals. England met France, whom they had beaten earlier that year on two occasions. England won 24–7, with Wilkinson scoring all of England's points through his <b>kicking.</b> <b>In</b> the final versus Australia, with the scores level at 17–17, Wilkinson {{received}} a pass and kicked a drop goal in extra time with just 26 seconds remaining; England won 20–17. The last time Australia had lost a World Cup match was eight years earlier in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, when Wilkinson's mentor Rob Andrew scored a drop goal at the stroke of full-time to win the game for England. After the match, Wilkinson expressed his relief at converting the winning drop goal, as it was his first success in four attempts during the match. The win gave England its first ever Rugby World Cup, and broke the Southern Hemisphere's dominance of the tournament in the process. Wilkinson became the tournament's leading points scorer with 113 points. He was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year and also named the 2003 IRB International Player of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Screenwriter Richard D'Ovidio was {{inspired}} to script the story after his wife heard an NPR segment with a 9-1-1 operator discussing her job.

The story was originally conceptualized as a television series entitled The Hive (a reference to the constant calls and conversations sounding like bees buzzing), but D'Ovidio decided to redraft it as a film on realizing that [...] "the operators couldn't be the ones <b>kicking</b> <b>in</b> doors and going out into the field" [...] all the time.

500|$|Davies {{stated that}} he based many aspects of New New York on Mega-City One from the {{anthology}} comic 2000 AD, including the businessman's appearance on Max Normal from the Judge Dredd comic books. The numbered mood patches parallel the number coded mood controllers in the Ninth Doctor novel Only Human by Gareth Roberts; Davies confirms that this was his inspiration. The character of Sally Calypso was an homage to Halo Jones, which featured a similar character named Swifty Frisko. Also in the online commentary, Davies noted that Brannigan's appearance was based on [...] "Ratz", the CGI disembodied cat's head that was a [...] "virtual presenter" [...] of CBBC's Live & <b>Kicking</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s. Ma and Pa {{at the start of}} the episode are based on the farming couple in the painting American Gothic, both having identical hairstyles, glasses and fashions.

500|$|Looking back in 2004, Holloway's biographer Eric Midwinter wrote, [...] "With his cockney authenticity, his splendid {{baritone}} voice, and {{his wealth}} of comedy experience, {{he made a}} great success of this role, and, as he said, it put him 'bang {{on top of the}} heap, in demand' again at a time when, in his mid-sixties, his career was beginning to wane". His performances earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Following his success on Broadway, Holloway played Pooh-Bah in a 1960 US television Bell Telephone Hour production of The Mikado, produced by the veteran Gilbert and Sullivan performer Martyn Green. Holloway appeared with Groucho Marx and Helen Traubel of the Metropolitan Opera. [...] His notable films around this time included Alive and <b>Kicking</b> <b>in</b> 1959, co-starring Sybil Thorndike and Kathleen Harrison, and No Love for Johnnie in 1961 opposite Peter Finch. In 1962, Holloway took part in a studio recording of Oliver! with Alma Cogan and Violet Carson, in which he played Fagin.|$|E
500|$|As the {{violence}} escalated, the US responded with what many Iraqis called the [...] "senseless use of firepower" [...] and [...] "midnight raids on innocent men". Human Rights Watch accused the Army {{of a pattern}} of [...] "over-aggressive tactics, indiscriminate shooting in residential areas and a quick reliance on lethal force", as well as using [...] "disproportionate force". [...] For example, if Iraqi insurgents set off a land mine, the US would respond by dropping bombs on those houses with arms caches; when insurgents fired a mortar round at American positions near Fallujah, the Americans responded with heavy artillery. American forces near Al Qaim conducted [...] "hard knocks" [...] on local residents, <b>kicking</b> <b>in</b> doors and manhandling individuals, only to discover they were innocent. In an incident on 11 September, soldiers manning a checkpoint near Fallujah shot multiple rounds at both an Iraqi police truck and a nearby hospital, killing seven. Soldiers also beat and abused Iraqi detainees. There was a constant rotation of units through the province, which led to confusion among the American troops: Fallujah had five different battalions rotate through in five months.

He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only <b>kicking</b> <b>in</b> when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a nice little touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad".
