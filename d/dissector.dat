50|$|The {{advancement}} of all-electronic television (including image <b>dissectors</b> and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) {{marked the beginning}} of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical TV usually only produced small images. It was the main type of TV until the 1930s.|$|R
25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image <b>dissector</b> {{camera tube}} {{transmitted}} its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently {{to hold a}} demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
25|$|In 1931, David Sarnoff of RCA {{offered to}} buy Farnsworth's patents for US$100,000, with the {{stipulation}} that he become an employee of RCA, but Farnsworth refused. In June of that year, Farnsworth joined the Philco company and moved to Philadelphia {{along with his wife}} and two children. RCA would later file an interference suit against Farnsworth, claiming Zworykin's 1923 patent had priority over Farnsworth's design, despite the fact it could present no evidence that Zworykin had actually produced a functioning transmitter tube before 1931. Farnsworth had lost two interference claims to Zworykin in 1928, but this time he prevailed and the U.S. Patent Office rendered a decision in 1934 awarding priority of the invention of the image <b>dissector</b> to Farnsworth. RCA lost a subsequent appeal, but litigation over a variety of issues continued for several years with Sarnoff finally agreeing to pay Farnsworth royalties. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application; he also divided his original application in 1931, receiving a patent in 1935, while a second one was eventually issued in 1938 by the Court of Appeals on a non-Farnsworth-related interference case, and over the objection of the Patent Office.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image <b>dissector</b> was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

40|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} rapidly {{expanding}} among urologists as a {{minimally invasive treatment}} with surgical procedures becoming increasingly challenging. Accurate haemostatis is of utmost importance in laparoscopy, as bleeding can rapidly impair the working environment conditions. We subsequently reviewed the different haemostatic tools used in laparoscopy with the focus on ultrasonic <b>dissectors</b> and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (EBVS). Briefly, {{there is a wide}} variety of haemostatic tools currently available in laparoscopy, all with their inherent advantages and limitations. The comparison of ultrasonic <b>dissectors</b> and EBVS shows that both systems are very attractive with similar physical properties concerning thermal spread and bursting pressure of vessels sealed. It has to be noted, however, that EBVS can handle vessels of up to 7 mm. In conclusion, haemostatic tools constitute a rapidly evolving domain with devices being developed which cause less thermal spread, while being more precise and faster. This evolution should finally allow more complex laparoscopic surgical procedures. Journal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|The typical {{method of}} {{controlling}} the CE is to do more counting.

The proportionator provides a superior result by avoiding more counting.|$|R
25|$|The {{advancement}} of all-electronic television (including image <b>dissectors</b> and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) {{marked the beginning}} of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical TV usually only produced small images. It was the main type of TV until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.|$|R
2500|$|Farnsworth also {{developed}} the [...] "image oscillite", a {{cathode ray tube}} that displayed the images captured by the image <b>dissector.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Farnsworth {{called his}} device an image <b>dissector</b> because it {{converted}} individual {{elements of the}} image into electricity one at a time. [...] He replaced the spinning disks with caesium, an element that emits electrons when exposed to light.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 RCA {{introduced}} an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle. Dubbed the Iconoscope by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was {{claimed to be}} much more sensitive than Farnsworth's image <b>dissector.</b> However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image <b>Dissector</b> through the invention of a completely unique [...] "multipactor" [...] device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. A problem with the multipactor, unfortunately, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.|$|E
50|$|For {{many years}} the {{photocathode}} {{was the only}} practical method for converting light to an electron current. As such it tends {{to function as a}} form of 'electric film' and shared many characteristics of photography. It was therefore the key element in opto-electronic devices, such as TV camera tubes like the orthocon and vidicon, and in image tubes such as intensifiers, converters, and <b>dissectors.</b> Simple phototubes were used for motion detectors and counters.|$|R

5000|$|Albert Loren Rhoton, Jr., (November 18, 1932 [...] - [...] February 21, 2016) was an American {{neurosurgeon}} and {{a professor}} specializing in microsurgical neuroanatomy.

[...] Such tools in use worldwide include the Rhoton Micro <b>Dissectors</b> designed for delicate work in the treatment of brain aneurysms and tumor resection.|$|R
2500|$|In 1930, Vladimir Zworykin, who {{had been}} {{developing}} his own all-electronic television system at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh since 1923, but which {{he had never been}} able to make work or satisfactorily demonstrate to his superiors, was recruited by RCA to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image <b>Dissector</b> that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. But Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image <b>Dissector,</b> which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects to be effective, and turned his attention to what would become the Iconoscope. In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, [...] "Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now [...] than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic , he didn't have storage. Therefore, [...] definition was very low.... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method." [...] Contrary to Zworykin's statement, Farnsworth's patent #2,087,683 for the Image <b>Dissector</b> (filed April 26, 1933) features the [...] "charge storage plate" [...] invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a [...] "low velocity" [...] method of electron scanning, also describes [...] "discrete particles" [...] whose [...] "potential" [...] is manipulated and [...] "saturated" [...] to varying degrees depending on their velocity. Farnsworth's patent numbers 2,140,695 and 2,233,888 are for a [...] "charge storage dissector" [...] and [...] "charge storage amplifier," [...] respectively.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image <b>dissector,</b> having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image <b>Dissector</b> Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{principle}} in the dissection of human cadavers is {{the prevention of}} human disease to the <b>dissector.</b> Prevention of transmission includes the wearing of protective gear, ensuring the environment is clean, dissection technique and predissection tests to specimens {{for the presence of}} HIV and Hepatitis viruses. Specimens are dissected in morgues or anatomy labs. When provided, they are evaluated for use as a [...] "fresh" [...] or [...] "prepared" [...] specimen. A [...] "fresh" [...] specimen may be dissected within some days, retaining the characteristics of a living specimen, for the purposes of training. A [...] "prepared" [...] specimen may be preserved in solutions such as formalin and pre-dissected by an experienced anatomist, sometimes {{with the help of a}} diener. This preparation is sometimes called prosection.|$|E
25|$|American {{television}} broadcasting {{at the time}} consisted {{of a variety of}} markets {{in a wide range of}} sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941.

In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents.

50|$|The main advancements in {{neurosurgery}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} highly crafted tools.

Most of these modern tools, like chisels, elevators, forcepts, hooks, impactors, and probes, have been in medical practice for a relatively long time. The main difference of these tools, pre and post advancement in neurosurgery, were the precision in which they were crafted. These tools are crafted with edges that are within a millimeter of desired accuracy. Other tools such as hand held power saws and robots have only recently been commonly used inside of a neurological operating room.|$|R
2500|$|Baird's {{television}} {{systems were}} replaced by the electronic television system developed by the newly formed company EMI-Marconi under Isaac Shoenberg, which had access to patents developed by Vladimir Zworykin and RCA. Similarly, Philo T. Farnsworth's electronic [...] "Image Dissector" [...] camera was available to Baird's company via a patent-sharing agreement. However, the Image <b>Dissector</b> camera {{was found to be}} lacking in light sensitivity, requiring excessive levels of illumination. Baird used the Farnsworth tubes instead to scan cinefilm, in which capacity they proved serviceable though prone to drop-outs and other problems. Farnsworth himself came to London to Baird's Crystal Palace laboratories in 1936, but was unable to fully solve the problem; the fire that burned Crystal Palace to the ground later that year further hampered the Baird company's ability to compete.|$|E
2500|$|Farnsworth {{worked out}} the {{principle}} of the image <b>dissector</b> in the summer of 1921, not long before his fifteenth birthday, and demonstrated the first working version on September 7, 1927, having turned 21 the previous August. A farm boy, his inspiration for scanning an image as series of lines came from the back-and-forth motion used to plow a field. In the course of a patent interference suit brought by RCA in 1934 and decided in February 1935, his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, produced a sketch he had made of a blackboard drawing Farnsworth had shown him in spring 1922. [...] Farnsworth won the suit; RCA appealed the decision in 1936 and lost. Although Farnsworth was paid royalties by RCA, he never became wealthy. [...] The video camera tube that evolved from the combined work of Farnsworth, Zworykin and many others was used in all television cameras until the late 20th century, when alternate technologies such as charge-coupled devices started to appear.|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's image <b>dissector</b> {{camera tube}} {{transmitted}} its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver {{in another room}} of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, [...] "There you are — electronic television!" [...] The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator; so the television system now had no mechanical parts. [...] That year Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images using his television system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Pem.|$|E
