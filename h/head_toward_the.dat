5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E

25|$|Aids: The rider {{applies the}} outside leg {{slightly}} further back from its normal position, which activates the outside hind (the first {{beat of the}} intended lead). At the same time, he or she uses the outside rein to flex the horse's <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> outside, which frees up the animal's inside shoulder, encouraging it to fall into that lead. If the rider were {{to ask for the}} left lead, for example, he or she would apply the right leg behind the girth and use the right rein to turn the horse's head to the right. To make the rider's intent even clearer, the horse may be angled slightly toward the outside rail of the arena, which will guide it into taking the correct lead as it goes towards the unobstructed inside, and also discourages the horse from simply running onto the forehand.|$|E

500|$|Cyber Danganronpa VR is {{a virtual}} reality game in which the player plays through the fourth [...] "class trial" [...] from the {{adventure}} game , where the player aims to uncover who was behind the murder of Sakura Ogami; unlike the original game, which uses 2D cutouts for characters, Cyber Danganronpa VR uses 3D models. The player character's classmates give testimonies, which appear as words; if the player notices something in the testimony that seems suspicious, they can refute the words by shooting them with [...] "truth bullets". To do this, the player needs to turn their <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> character who testified, and press {{a button on the}} DualShock 4 controller. The game takes around ten minutes to play through, and ends with a first-person sequence where the character Monokuma punishes the player.|$|E

500|$|Teach's {{movements}} between late 1717 {{and early}} 1718 are not known. [...] He and Bonnet were probably responsible {{for an attack}} off Sint Eustatius in December 1717. [...] Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Spanish-controlled Saman√° Bay in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity.

[...] Hume reinforced his crew with musket-armed soldiers and joined up with [...] to track the two ships, to no avail, though they discerned that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off St Christopher Island, and reported also that they had last been seen [...] "gone down the North side of Hispaniola". [...] Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were.|$|E
500|$|One of the subplots of {{the novel}} details the budding love between Pitar and Maluma, a female member of the band. Costello {{perceives}} the group of females as his personal harem, but when Maluma {{falls in love with}} Pitar she breaks off her relationship with him. On each day, the characters discover new insights and artefacts, but seek rest from their exhaustion by the seventh day. This repose, however, is disrupted by the attack of a saber-toothed cat. Several members of the band are killed, including Costello, thus enabling Re to assume power. Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the band, stating, [...] "We should leave in time, leave Re and his new Reich, which, when I'm taking into account Thorn's previous reign, would be the Third over here." [...] Pitar and Maluma <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> savanna, an action which alludes to both the expulsion from paradise and the Out of Africa theory. Only odd-numbered chapters narrate the love story, which bookmarks the novel. Writer Karin Gayer mentions in her review that the love story of Pitar and Maluma, and its positioning within the text, offers [...] "a second interpretation of the beginning and the end".|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Italian {{psychiatrist}} Amarro Fiamberti, Freeman at some point conceived of approaching the frontal lobes through the eye sockets instead of through drilled holes in the skull. In 1945 he took an icepick from his own kitchen and began testing the idea on grapefruit and cadavers. This new [...] "transorbital" [...] lobotomy involved lifting the upper eyelid and placing the point of a thin surgical instrument (often called an orbitoclast or leucotome, although quite different from the wire loop leucotome described above) under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the orbitoclast through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, around fifteen degrees toward the interhemispherical fissure. The orbitoclast was malleted five centimeters (2in) into the frontal lobe, and then pivoted forty degrees at the orbit perforation so the tip cut toward {{the opposite side of the}} <b>head</b> (<b>toward</b> <b>the</b> nose). The instrument was returned to the neutral position and sent a further two centimeters (in) into the brain, before being pivoted around twenty-eight degrees each side, to cut outwards and again inwards. (In a more radical variation at the end of the last cut described, the butt of the orbitoclast was forced upwards so the tool cut vertically down the side of the cortex of the interhemispherical fissure; the [...] "Deep frontal cut".) All cuts were designed to transect the white fibrous matter connecting the cortical tissue of the prefrontal cortex to the thalamus. The leucotome was then withdrawn and the procedure repeated on the other side.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} personalities of his protagonist couple, Sparks faced difficulty {{in finding a}} vehicle that would draw Will and Ronnie to spend time together. ‚ÄúIt had to be during the summer, she [...] had to be new in town, and whatever happened had to start in June and end in August. Because you always want a conclusion,‚Äù said Sparks of his requirements. He mentioned summer camp or a summer job as typical vehicles used in books, but dismissed them as unoriginal and boring. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs got to be original, it‚Äôs got to be interesting, {{and at the same}} time it‚Äôs got to be universal, that you feel like it could happen to anybody.‚Äù Sparks eventually chose to have Will and Ronnie bond over a loggerhead sea turtle nest, knowing that Loggerhead eggs often hatch in August. The scene of the hatching nest took place during the first week of August and involved 26 live loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings. Sea turtle hatchlings have an innate sense to <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ocean water as soon as they are born, so scenes of the nest hatching had to be taken swiftly. Said Mike Dodd of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the biologist who supervised the scene, the hatchlings [...] "did all they know how to do: They crawled down to the water and swam off." [...] Sparks told an interviewer he suspected filmmakers would digitally add more turtles to the scene. At the time of filming, the loggerhead sea turtle was listed as a threatened species. The environmentally friendly theme was an added bonus to Tybee Island, which was then promoting ecotourism.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981 the Western Australian Museum and the Royal Australian Navy cooperated {{to examine}} a large {{magnetic}} anomaly off the Zuytdorp Cliffs consistent with the magnetic signature expected from the wreck of Sydney. Subsequent {{to the location of}} the Titanic and the [...] by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the museum conducted a seminar at the 50th anniversary of the ship's loss in November 1991 to determine if Sydney could be located. This project was assisted by Associate Professor Kim Kirsner of the University of Western Australia. While the size of the area being searched in the hunt for Kormoran was reduced to a size similar to that used in previous successful searches, the oceanographers, scientists, and search and rescue specialists at the seminar could not reduce the area to be searched for Sydney below a [...] zone. While the location of the battle as reported by German sailors and their commander had been confirmed by oceanographic evidence, researchers were unsure of the whereabouts of Sydney. One alternative was that the ship had tried to reach the nearest dry dock at Surabaya; another possibility was that they had tried to <b>head</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> nearest port facility at Geraldton. Some Germans said they saw the Sydney sink while they rowed towards its burning hulk after they had abandoned their own ship; others said it had disappeared on a south-east course into the night. As a result of pressure from the newly formed HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust, a joint standing committee held a parliamentary inquiry in 1997 into the circumstances surrounding the sinking of Sydney. The inquiry was the largest in Australia‚Äôs history, receiving submissions from hundreds of parties. The committee made a number of findings and recommendations, concluding: ...|$|E
