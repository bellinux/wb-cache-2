40|$|Clinical {{experience}} and {{a limited number of}} studies suggest that a cancer diagnosis confers a high risk of accidental falls. The negative sequelae of falls in older persons are well documented; risk factors <b>for</b> <b>falls</b> in this population have been extensively investigated and evidence for the efficacy of interventions to reduce falls is steadily emerging. It is not known whether the risk factors <b>for</b> <b>falls</b> and effective interventions <b>for</b> <b>falls</b> risk reduction in patients with cancer are different from those in older persons. Electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL were searched for studies of risk factors <b>for</b> <b>falls</b> or effective interventions <b>for</b> <b>falls</b> risk reduction in patients with cancer. Assessment of study quality was performed. Data analysis was descriptive. Seven studies designed to identify the risk factors <b>for</b> <b>falls</b> in patients with cancer and one study to determine the predictive validity of a screening tool <b>for</b> <b>falls</b> in patients with cancer were included. All had methodological shortcomings, precluding the generation of a new synthesis from this review, but highlighting important design and statistical issues. Further research is needed to identify patients at risk and inform the design of an interventional model to reduce falls risk. Investigators should be cognizant of the limitations of using cross-sectional study design to answer this research question, should employ validated tools to measure exposure variables, use reliable methods to ascertain the occurrence of falls and appropriate statistical models to adjust for confounding variables...|$|R

During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon.

5|$|During {{the many}} {{changes in the}} {{operational}} plans <b>for</b> <b>Fall</b> Gelb the idea of leaving the Fortress Holland alone, just as the Dutch hoped for, was at times considered. The first version of 19 October 1939 suggested {{the possibility of a}} full occupation if conditions were favourable. In the version of 29 October it was proposed to limit the transgression to a line south of Venlo. In the Holland-Weisung (Holland Directive) of 15 November it was decided to conquer the entire south, but in the north to advance no further than the Grebbe Line, and to occupy the Frisian Isles. Hermann Göring insisted on a full conquest as he needed the Dutch airfields against Britain; also he was afraid the Entente might reinforce Fortress Holland after a partial defeat and use the airfields to bomb German cities and troops. Another rationale for complete conquest was that as the fall of France itself could hardly be taken for granted, it was for political reasons seen as desirable to obtain a Dutch capitulation, because a defeat might well bring less hostile governments to power in Britain and France. A swift defeat would also free troops for other front sectors.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner {{received}} the order <b>for</b> <b>Fall</b> Gelb at 13:15, during lunch, on 9 May 1940. The German attack began at 5:35 {{on the morning}} of 10 May 1940. The XIX Armeekorps advanced without resistance through Luxemburg and reached the Belgian border at 10:00. The 1st and 2nd Panzer Division reached the line Menufontaine (south of Bastogne) – Fauvillers, the 10th Panzer Division the line Rulles (west of Habay) – St. Marie (west of Étalle), that evening. The advance breached the second Belgian line of defence at Bouillon and Neufchâteau on 11 May. The German forces, consisting of the 1st and 10th Panzer Division reached the area north of Sedan on the night of 12/13 May. The following day at 8:00 German Ju 87 Stukas and bombers from Luftflotte 3 (3rd Air Fleet) targeted the French and Belgian forces in what would become the Battle of Sedan. At 15:30 the German artillery began a 30-minute bombardment followed by an aerial attack. German troops began crossing the Meuse at 16:00 in rubber assault boats. The assault company of Kradschützen-Bataillon I (1st Motorcycle Infantry Battalion) under the command of Wend von Wietersheim established the first bridgehead north of Igles and west of Saint-Menges.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1939, in {{preparation}} <b>for</b> <b>Fall</b> Weiss (Case White)—the German invasion of Poland—Manstein was appointed Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. Here he worked along with Rundstedt's Chief of Operations, Colonel Günther Blumentritt, {{to develop the}} operational plan. Rundstedt accepted Manstein's plan calling for the concentration {{of the majority of}} the army group's armoured units into Walther von Reichenau's 10th Army, with the objective of a decisive breakthrough which would lead to the encirclement of Polish forces west of the River Vistula. In Manstein's plan, two other armies comprising Army Group South, Wilhelm List's 14th Army and Johannes Blaskowitz's 8th Army, would provide flank support for Reichenau's armoured thrust towards Warsaw, the Polish capital. Privately, Manstein was lukewarm about the Polish campaign, thinking that it would be better to keep Poland as a buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union. He also worried about an Allied attack from the west once the Polish campaign was underway, which would draw Germany into a two-front war.|$|E
5|$|The {{finalized}} {{plan for}} the assault called for between nine and eleven gliders {{to land on the}} western bank of the Albert Canal by each of the three bridges just prior to 05:30 on 10 May, the time scheduled <b>for</b> <b>Fall</b> Gelb to begin. The groups assigned to assault the three bridges would overwhelm the defending Belgian troops, remove any demolition charges and then prepare to defend the bridges against an expected counter-attack. Forty minutes later, three Ju-52 transport aircraft would fly over each position, dropping a further twenty-four airborne troops as reinforcements as well as machine-guns and significant amounts of ammunition. Simultaneously, the force assigned to assault Fort Eben-Emael was to land on top of the Fort in eleven gliders, eliminate any defenders attempting to repel them, cripple what artillery they could with explosive charges, and then prevent the Garrison from dislodging them. Having achieved their initial objectives of seizing the bridges and eliminating the long-range artillery pieces possessed by the Fort, the airborne troops would then defend their positions until the arrival of German ground forces.|$|E

In March 2009, Apple Inc. also withdrew from its leasing agreement, and less than a month later it signed an agreement to develop a new storefront in the Clybourn Corridor on property bounded by North Avenue, Halsted Street and Clybourn Avenue. After Apple backed out of its lease, Lululemon backed out of its lease to be located next to Apple. Other March 2009 tenant signings included Chicago's haberdashery Bigsby & Kruthers, Sunglass Hut, crystal jewelers Swarovski, Starfruit Cafe, and Fast-casual eatery Tahini. Also, in the face of declining advertising revenue, CBS sought to sublease part of its studio. A Loews Hotel will be built in forthcoming years.|$|E

Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997.
