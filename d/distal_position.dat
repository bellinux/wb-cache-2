50|$|NO {{leads to}} at least 200 fold {{increase}} in sGC activity. Because nitric oxide has a partially filled pi* orbital, back bonding prefers a bent geometry for the heme-NO complex. NO has a strong trans effect, in which the histidine-iron bond is weakened when NO binding delocalizes electrons to the dz2 orbital toward the axial ligand. Thus nitric oxide binding ferrous heme at the <b>distal</b> <b>position</b> gives a His-Fe-NO complex that dissociates to a 5-coordinate Fe-NO complex. However, the identification of two distinct NO dependent processes in sGC activation has led to speculation that a proximal NO is responsible for histidine displacement, giving an intermediate 6-coordinate NO-Fe-NO complex. Depending on product concentration, the intermediate can then dissociate either {{to one of two}} 5-coordinate forms, the more active distally NO ligated form, or the less active proximally NO ligated form. An alternative hypothesis states that a second, non-heme binding site accounts for the second NO dependent activation process to give the fully active enzyme.|$|E
50|$|Characteristics of {{the limbs}} of Aardonyx {{suggest that it}} was habitually bipedal. Evidence for {{bipedalism}} {{can be seen in}} the forelimbs; the structure of the radius and ulna limited the degree to which the manus could be pronated, and the length of the humerus is only 72 percent that of the femur. However, characteristics found in both the fore and hind limbs of Aardonyx show a trend toward more habitual quadrupedalism that would eventually lead to the obligatory quadrupedalism seen in sauropods. The proximal end of the ulna possesses an incipient craniolateral process that gives the bone a y-shape similar to, although more subtle than, those of obligatory quadrupedal sauropodomorphs. The radius is shifted cranially, and a radial fossa allows for the ulna to cradle the radius craniolaterally. These characteristics suggest that there was a development towards greater quadrupedalism in Aardonyx. Although the hindlimbs of Aardonyx clearly show evidence for bipedalism (such as the retention of a convex proximal lateral profile of the femur and the position of the cranial trochanter far from the lateral margin of the femur), there is also evidence that indicates a shift toward quadrupedalism. Features of the femur suggests that the gait of Aardonyx was slower than that of more basal sauropodomorphs. The shaft of the femur is straighter and the fourth trochanter is more distally placed. The repositioning of the fourth trochanter to a more <b>distal</b> <b>position</b> causes the M. caudofemoralis longus muscle, the main femoral retractor muscle, to have greater leverage (more mechanical advantage) but conversely a decrease in the velocity of femoral retraction; consequently, Aardonyx was a powerful but slower walker than typical prosauropods.|$|E
40|$|From the Palacozoic to the Cretaceous, crustal {{thinning}} in the Mid Norway {{area was}} associated with the denudation of gneiss-cored culminations and metamorphic core complexes in the footwalls of major extensional faults.

Some of the culminations and core complexes became part of the erosional template in Mid-Late Palaeozoic time, some were probably exhumed in the Mesozoic, whereas some may never have reached the surface. We present an overview of five types of gneiss-cored culminations and core complexes that have been identified in the field, through the interpretation of offshore, long-offset seismic reflection data.

40|$|AbstractElectrostatics-based {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed to examine the proton uptake upon reduction of the terminal electron acceptor QB in the photosynthetic reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides {{as a function of}} pH and the associated conformational equilibrium. Two crystal structures of the reaction center were considered: one structure was determined in the dark and the other under illumination. In the two structures, the QB was found in two different positions, proximal or distal to the nonheme iron. Because QB was found mainly in the <b>distal</b> <b>position</b> in the dark and only in the proximal position under illumination, the two positions have been attributed mostly to the oxidized and the reduced forms of QB, respectively. We calculated the proton uptake upon QB reduction by four different models. In the first model, QB is allowed to equilibrate between the two positions with either oxidation state. This equilibrium was allowed to vary with pH. In the other three models the distribution of QB between the proximal position and the <b>distal</b> <b>position</b> was pH-independent, with QB occupying only the <b>distal</b> <b>position</b> or only the proximal position or populating the two positions with a fixed ratio. Only the first model, which includes the pH-dependent conformational equilibrium, reproduces both the experimentally measured pH dependence of the proton uptake and the crystallographically observed conformational equilibrium at pH 8. From this model, we find that QB occupies only the <b>distal</b> <b>position</b> below pH 6. 5 and only the proximal position above pH 9. 0 in both oxidation states. Between these pH values both positions are partially occupied. The reduced QB has a higher occupancy in the proximal position than the oxidized QB. In summary, the present results indicate that the conformational equilibrium of QB depends not only on the redox state of QB, but also on the pH value of the solution...|$|E

Although Swigart et al. stated that pronator quadratus repair after volar plate fracture fixation is often durable [18], repair could also be suboptimal due to the very short tendon or a damaged and friable muscle, that renders it unsuitable for suturing [28]. Moreover, the integrity of the muscle is not checked after the repair to assess if the repaired pronator quadratus is still in place or has not detached again. Additionally, repair of the pronator quadratus muscle does not seem to adequately protect the tendons, since cases of late tendon irritation after pronator quadratus repair are still identified [29], and flexor pollicis longus rupture in particular is caused by a too <b>distal</b> <b>positioning</b> of the plate, prominent at the watershed line, which may increase the risk of tendon injury [27, 30, 31].|$|R

30|$|Abnormal {{positioning}} of the patella is another pathology reported in patients with intraarticular adhesions (Noyes and Barber-Westin 2017). The {{results of the current}} study suggest that adhesions in the suprapatellar pouch may lead to proximal translation of the patella, most prominently at 0 degrees of flexion. A proximal position of the patella relative to the trochlear groove is known as patella alta (Insall and Salvati 1971). This condition predisposes the affected knee to patellofemoral dislocation due to decreased contact with the femur, especially at lower flexion angles (Fox et al. 2012). The current study also observed distal translation of the patella with anterior interval adhesions, which aligns well with the results of Ahmad et al.â€™s study (Ahmad et al. 1998). <b>Distal</b> <b>positioning</b> of the patella in the trochlear groove is known as patella baja and is associated with anterior knee pain, extensor lag, and a reduction in range of motion (Fox et al. 2012; FlÃ¶ren et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Farm-saved seed {{accounts}} for the greatest proportion of seeds used by farmers worldwide especially in low-income countries. One way through which farmers {{have been able to}} improve quality of the farm-saved seed is seed selection. In maize, grains can be selected in terms of, in addition to health, kennel size. One way of easing selection based on kernel size may be selection of ears and discriminative threshing of the ears. A study was conducted at Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania to determine effects of selecting different sizes of ears and threshing discriminatively grains positioned in basal, distal and middle areas of the ears. Grains so selected were tested for germination capacity and vigour. Results showed that as expected larger ears and basal position of grains were accompanied with larger size of kernels. Size of ears did not influence grain germination capacity but it had significant effects on grain and seedling vigour. Grains from very small ears were earliest to germinate (lower mean germination time, MGT), which is an expression of high grain vigour. However, grains from larger ears and basal positions in ears (consequently larger kernel size) led to significantly (P 0. 05) more vigorous seedlings (larger seedling dry weight). Basal position of kernels resulted in significantly higher germination capacity and larger seedling dry weight than <b>distal</b> <b>position.</b> It can be concluded that selection of ears and selective threshing of the ears with avoiding <b>distal</b> <b>position</b> kernels can also be important criteria in quality improvement of maize grains.

In this study we observed a correlation between the number of trivalents with the frequency of abnormal spermatids; additionally, the number of chiasmata, especially proximal and interstitial ones, was strongly correlated with the frequency of the linear orientation.

Trunk GUs of seedlings and saplings included preformed and neoformed organs, whereas main-branch GUs of saplings were entirely preformed. The size of a GU was more closely related to the number of preformed green leaves than to the number of cataphylls of its preceding bud.
