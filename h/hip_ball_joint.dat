None of the tested systems met the requirements, although the same types have been successfully implanted for many years. The reason for these obviously contradictory results could be the different stress distribution which is found for high and low loading heights as in the test and in the physiological situation, respectively. This argument is based on Finite Element calculations and the analysis of the fracture pattern under different loads...|$|R

Lubricating film thickness is evaluated by a thin film colorimetric interferometry, results are ploted at graphs representing dependence of lubricating film thickness on experiment duration or on mutual speed of articulating surfaces. There is described the influence of concentration of bovine serum and different kinematic conditions on lubricating film forming. From observed interferograms is apparent the adsorption of proteins to glass disc and femoral head surfaces, denaturation and formation of protein aggregations affecting the residual lubricating film thickness...|$|R
50|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as <b>hip</b> <b>balls</b> and sockets (<b>joint</b> replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.Titanium has the inherent ability to osseointegrate, enabling use in dental implants that can last for over 30 years. This property is also useful for orthopedic implant applications. These benefit from titanium's lower modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) to more closely match that of the bone that such devices are intended to repair. As a result, skeletal loads are more evenly shared between bone and implant, leading to a lower incidence of bone degradation due to stress shielding and periprosthetic bone fractures, which occur at the boundaries of orthopedic implants. However, titanium alloys' stiffness is still {{more than twice that}} of bone, so adjacent bone bears a greatly reduced load and may deteriorate.|$|R

5000|$|In non-MacPherson strut {{automobile}} suspension, the two <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> {{are called}} the [...] "upper ball joint" [...] and [...] "lower ball joint". Lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> are sometimes larger and may wear out faster, because the fore and aft loads, primarily due to braking, are higher at the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> (Torque reaction and drag add at the bottom joint, and partly cancel at the top joint.) Also, lateral cornering loads are higher at the bottom joint. Depending on the suspension design, the vertical load from the suspension spring may be handled entirely by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or entirely by the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> The damper load, (which is low in normal conditions, zero when stationary, but in peak bump or rebound rate may be almost {{as large as the}} spring load) is usually, but not always, taken on the same <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> as the spring load. The anti-roll bar loading is often, but not always, taken on the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> It may be taken by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or directly from the steering knuckle by ball-jointed drop links.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{study the}} effects of {{acetabular}} component position and <b>hip</b> <b>ball</b> diameter on the posterior stability of the hip joint after total hip replacement. Methods Computer navigation system and synthetic bone model were used to simulate the motion of hip after total hip replacement. The hip was flexed to 90 degree and was adducted 0 and 30 degree as indicated by the computer navigation, after then it was progressively internally rotated until the hip was dislocated. The degree of internal rotation when the hip was dislocation was recorded. Results When the acetabular component abduction was 45 degree and anteversion were 0, 5, 10, 15 degrees, and the hip was flexed to 90 degree and adducted to 0 and 30 degrees, there was significant difference between 28 mm and 36 mm <b>hip</b> <b>balls</b> in the degrees of internal rotation when the hip was dislocated (P 0. 05). 36 mm diameter <b>hip</b> <b>ball</b> was significantly better in stability. The degree of internal rotation when the hip dislocated was less when the hip was adducted 30 degree compared to 0 degree. The stability was diminished with less acetabular component anteversion. With 0 degree anteversion and the hip adducted to 30 degree, a 28 mm diameter <b>hip</b> <b>ball</b> would lead to dislocation even if the hip was in external rotation. Conclusions The increasing anteversion of acetabular component can increase the stability of total hip replacement. Large <b>hip</b> <b>ball</b> is more stable than small <b>hip</b> <b>ball.</b> However, when anteversion of acetabular component is sufficient, there is no difference in stability between large and small <b>hip</b> <b>balls.</b> 目的探討髖臼杯的前傾位置與球頭大小對全髖關節置換(THA) 術后后方穩定性的影響。方法利用計算機導航技術在假骨上模擬THA術后,不同髖臼杯前傾位置和不同球頭大小在屈髖 90 °、內收 0 °和內收 30 °時髖關節內旋到引起脫位的角度進行測量和比較發生后脫位時的角度差異。結果在髖臼杯外展 45 °、前傾 0 °、 5 °、 10 °、 15 °時, 28 mm和 36 mm球頭在屈髖 90 °內收 0 °和 30 °情況下內旋至脫位的角度有明顯差別(均為P 0. 05),內收 30 °時比內收 0 °時髖關節內旋至脫位的角度減小。關節穩定性隨髖臼杯前傾減小而下降。髖臼杯前傾 0 °和髖關節內收 30 °時, 28 mm球頭在外旋位時就可發生脫位。結論髖臼杯前傾角度增加可增加THA術后關節的穩定性,大球頭的穩定性優于小球頭,前傾達到某一角度時,大球頭和小球頭間的后方穩定性無差別。link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|Sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> do {{not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust boot seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R

50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Specifically, the original design had the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} no exact {{lifespan}} that can be put on sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> they can fail as early as 80000 miles km in modern vehicles, and much sooner in older vehicles.

Then it keeps on with clicking, popping or snapping sound when the wheel is turned and eventually turn into a squeaking sound {{at the end of a}} stop, when the gas pedal is used and/or also when hitting bumps. Another symptom could be 'thud' noises coming from front suspension when going over bumps. Dry <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> have dramatically increased friction and can cause the steering to stick or be more difficult.|$|R
