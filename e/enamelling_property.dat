40|$|Mice lacking {{amelogenin}} (KO) have hypoplastic enamel. Overexpression of {{the most}} abundant amelogenin splice variant M 180 and LRAP transgenes can substantially improve KO enamel, but only ~ 40 % of the incisor thickness is recovered and the prisms are not as tightly woven as in WT enamel. This implies that the compositional complexity of the enamel matrix is required for different aspects of enamel formation, such as organizational structure and thickness. The question arises, therefore, how important the ratio of different matrix components, and in particular amelogenin splice products, is in enamel formation. Can optimal expression levels of amelogenin transgenes representing both the most abundant splice variants and cleavage product at protein levels {{similar to that of}} WT improve the enamel phenotype of KO mice? Addressing this question, our objective was here to understand dosage effects of amelogenin transgenes (Tg) representing the major splice variants M 180 and LRAP and cleavage product CTRNC on <b>enamel</b> <b>properties.</b> Amelogenin KO mice were mated with M 180 Tg, CTRNCTg and LRAPTg mice to generate M 180 Tg and CTRNCTg double transgene and M 180 Tg, CTRNCTg, LRAPTg triple transgene mice with transgene hemizygosity (on one allelle) or homozygosity (on both alleles). Transgene homo- vs. hemizygosity was determined by qPCR and relative transgene expression confirmed by Western blot. Enamel volume and mineral density were analyzed by microCT, thickness and structure by SEM, and mechanical properties by Vickers microhardness testing. There were no differences in incisor enamel thickness between amelogenin KO mice with three or two different transgenes, but mice homozygous for a given transgene had significantly thinner enamel than mice hemizygous for the transgene (p < 0. 05). The presence of the LRAPTg did not improve the phenotype of M 180 Tg/CTRNCTg/KO enamel. In the absence of endogenous amelogenin, the addition of amelogenin transgenes representing the most abundant splice variants and cleavage product can rescue abnormal <b>enamel</b> <b>properties</b> and structure, but only up to a maximum of ~ 80 % that of molar and ~ 40 % that of incisor wild-type enamel...|$|R

The present study was undertaken with the aim to describe <b>enamel</b> <b>properties</b> of transport and distribution of organic molecules in intact feline teeth and teeth affected with resorptive lesions. The results indicate that damaged enamel is prone to a greater bilateral diffusion process, leading to continuous disruption of the enamel structure.

40|$|Deciduous {{dentition}} {{can provide}} valuable {{insight into the}} life of an individual during early childhood; information that is usually lost as deciduous teeth are replaced by the permanent dentition. The purpose of this thesis is the application of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to assess the enamel thickness and density distribution of a sample of deciduous canines and first molars from the Middenbeemster site, an 18 th – 19 th century, non-industrial, rural society in the Netherlands. The main objectives are to assess trends and correlations between <b>enamel</b> <b>properties</b> (thickness and density) and dental disease and wear, as well as investigating sexual dimorphism in a known-sex subsample. The sample consists of 38 individuals who are macroscopically evaluated to determine the presence of dental disease and extent of dental wear. The latter was conducted using a modified method for dental wear scoring, involving an average score for the entire dentition. A strong correlation (R 2 = 0. 6715) between age and dental wear score was identified, building upon previous studies showing a positive correlation between age and dental wear, and provides initial insights into the benefits of developing a novel method for subadult age-estimation. Of the 38 individuals in the sample, 35, represented by 33 deciduous canines and 30 deciduous first molars, were scanned and analysed using fixed-point measurements and threshold-based 3 D evaluation with an integrated micro-CT software. The enamel thickness within the sample ranged between 0. 38 mm and 0. 66 mm, while the enamel density ranged between 1914 and 2173 mgHA/ccm. No significant differences (p > 0. 05) were found to indicate that enamel thickness and density {{play a significant role in}} the progression of dental wear or the presence and/or rate of dental disease. Enamel hypomineralisation and hypoplasia were identified; however, the impact of these on the overall enamel thickness and density distribution was seemingly limited. Archival data provided known-sex for 20 individuals (13 females, 7 males). This study investigated this small subsample of known-sex individuals focusing on the two key variables, enamel thickness and density. No significant differences were found in the statistical comparison of means, and the applied logit model failed to show sufficient discriminatory ability. The results of the analysis were considered in conjunction with confounding factors involving the use of skeletal samples to make population inferences, and the current limitations of micro-CT technology. Overall, this study represents an exploratory investigation into various <b>enamel</b> <b>properties</b> of an archaeological population, adding to the still under-represented data acquired from deciduous dentition, and emphasises the benefits and contributions of micro-CT to human osteoarchaeology research...|$|R

With its superior properties to other types of heat exchanger, the heat exchanger composed of heat pipes is playing an important role in solving the energy question, especially in the recovery of industrial afterheat. Heat pipe is subject to the corrosion generated by vitriolic dew when it works in flue gas, and the situation is worsen when the flue-gas temperature is relatively lower. In this paper, a variety of prevention methods are discussed for minimizing sulfuric acid corrosion, and most content is concentrated on surface techniques of heat pipe. The author makes a proposal that enamel is applied in the surface of heat pipe. Based on theoretical and experimental studies, the <b>enamel's</b> <b>properties</b> of anti-corrosion, thermal stability, heat transfer, and so on are dwelled on with some valuable conclusions drawn. It can be discovered that enameled heat pipe has not only economical cost, excellent corrosion-resistant property, but also can achieve high thermal stability and create less even negligible heat transfer resistance by adopting appropriate prescription and manufacture technology. In conclusion, heat pipe with high anti-corrosion ability has promising perspective in many industrial applications, and it is also going to be put into new uses such as in heat exchanging of the scrubber.

Manufacturers give data sheets for each material. The properties listed are characterized by a specific value.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the local direction dependence of physical properties like the elastic modulus or the thermal expansion in dental hard tissues. With this knowledge the ‘perfect filling/dental material' could be characterized. Materials and method. Enamel sections of ∼ 400 – 500 μm thickness have been cut with a diamond saw from labial/buccal to palatal/lingual (canine, premolar and molar) and parallel to labial (incisor). Crystallite arrangements have been measured in over 400 data points on all types of teeth with x-ray scattering techniques, known from materials science. Results. X-ray scattering measurements show impressively that dental enamel has a strong direction dependence of its physical properties which also varies with location within the tooth. Dental materials possess only little or no property direction dependence. Therefore, a mismatch was found between enamel and dental materials properties. Conclusion. Since dental materials should possess equal (direction depending) properties, worthwhile properties could be characterized by transferring the directional <b>properties</b> of <b>enamel</b> into a <b>property</b> ‘wish list' which future dental materials should fulfil.

There is considerable variation in textural characteristics among the P. robustus specimens. Specifically, adult SK 34 stands apart from the two subadult specimens, SK 6 and SK 47, suggesting life history could be reflected in patterns of dental microwear texture characteristics, although seasonality and availability of fallback foods may also explain the variation observed in P. robustus.

Explicit fracture relations are used to analyze the data and to extrapolate the results from humans to earlier hominins.

At the same time, the base diameter of sea otter first molars is larger, diminishing the fracture susceptibility in a compensatory manner. We also conduct nanoindentation tests to map out elastic modulus and hardness of sea otter and human molars through a section thickness, and microindentation tests to measure toughness. We find that while sea otter enamel is just as stiff elastically as human enamel, it is a little softer and tougher. The role of these material factors in the capacity of dentition to resist fracture and deformation is considered.

Methods: Forty bovine incisors were sectioned to obtain flat enamel specimens and challenged by demineralization solution of pH 4. 47 for 72  h. The enamel specimens were randomly divided into four groups: (I) control, demineralized enamel with no treatment (C); (II) demineralized enamel primarily treated with cold plasma, then bioglass paste protected with adhesive, afterward additional application of cold plasma (PBP); (III) demineralized enamel treated with cold plasma, then bioglass paste protected with light cured adhesive (PB); and (IV) bioglass paste applied to demineralized enamel and protected with light cured adhesive (B).

40|$|Human salivary {{secretions}} are supersaturated {{with respect}} to the calcium phosphate salts which form dental <b>enamel,</b> a <b>property</b> which provides important protection for the teeth. We previously proposed that statherin, a 43 -residue phosphopeptide, {{plays a key role in}} this protective system by inhibiting or delaying potentially harmful precipitation of calcium phosphate salts in the salivary glands and mouth. The purpose of the present study was to deter-mine if the concentrations of statherin in saliva, despite their wide normal range, are high enough to fulfill this function. Concentrations of statherin in stimulated human parotid saliva samples from 36 female and 32 male subjects, aged from 1 7 to 30 years, were determined by a single radial immunodiffusion method. Values found ranged from 3. 0 to> 27. 3,uM, with a mean value of 12. 8 (S. D. ± 5. 46) WM. At concentrations below these values, statherin inhibited spon-taneous precipitation of calcium phosphate salts from an assay sys-tem which was more supersaturated {{with respect to}} dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, and comparably supersaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite, than were human saliva samples. The inhibitory activities of five of the 65 stimulated parotid saliva samples assayed were greater than would be anticipated from their statherin concentrations. This unexplained discrepancy is not associated with the presence of the acidic proline-rich proteins in saliva, although these proteins also affect calcium phosphate precipitation. The results of this study show that statherin is present in stimu-lated human parotid saliva at concentrations and levels of activity which are consistent with its proposed biological function, and sup-port the proposal that statherin plays a significant role in a system which provides a protective and reparative but stable environment for the teeth...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{different}} types of dental pathology, wear, and developmental defects can allow inferences into diet and behaviour {{in a variety of}} ways. In this project data on these different variables were collected for South African hominins and compared with extant primates. The species studied include Paranthropus robustus, Australopithecus africanus, A. sediba, early Homo, Homo naledi, baboons, chimpanzees and gorillas. Macroscopic examination of each specimen was performed, with a 10 X hand lens used to verify certain pathologies. Variables recorded include antemortem chipping, enamel hypoplasia, caries, occlusal wear, tertiary dentine, abscesses, and periodontal disease. Clear differences in frequencies were found in the different South African hominin species. Homo naledi displays high rates of chipping, especially small fractures above molar wear facets, likely reflecting a diet containing high levels of contaminants. Other noteworthy results include the high levels of pitting enamel hypoplasia in P. robustus molars compared to other species, likely due to a species-specific <b>enamel</b> formation <b>property</b> or developmental disturbance. The low rates of chipping in P. robustus does not fit with this species being a hard food specialist. Instead, the wear best supports a diet of low-quality tough vegetation. Australopithecus africanus likely had a broad diet, with angled molar wear, lack of caries, and high chipping frequencies supporting this conclusion. Seven new carious lesions are described, two from H. naledi and five P. robustus. Other, rarer, pathologies are also highlighted, including abscesses in an early Homo individual, root grooves caused by erosive wear in A. africanus and a case of amelogenesis imperfecta in a female chimpanzee.

30|$|As teeth {{consist of}} at least two {{materials}} with different <b>properties</b> (<b>enamel</b> and dentine), the tooth bud (sometimes called “the tooth germ”—that is an aggregation of cells that eventually forms a tooth) is organized into three parts: the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental follicle. The enamel organ is composed {{of at least}} four other groups of cells [for the biological details see Refs. (Avery 2001; Nanci 2012)]. Altogether, these groups of cells give rise to ameloblasts, which secret enamel matrix proteins. The protein gel adjacent to ameloblasts is supersaturated with CaPO 4, which leads to the precipitation of biological apatite. Similarly, the dental papilla contains cells that develop into odontoblasts, which are dentine-forming cells. The dental follicle gives rise to three important entities: cementoblasts, osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth (Bosshardt and Selvig 2000). Osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of teeth (see bone formation above). Fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments that connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum (Boskey 2007; Glimcher 2006; Boskey and Roy 2008; Hall 2015; Avery 2001; Nanci 2012).|$|R
30|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the enamel protects the dentin and vital pulp from the oral environment. The dental enamel {{should be able to}} withstand the mastication forces over millions of cycles throughout the entire lifetime of an individual [13 – 15]. It must exhibit superior mechanical properties to dissipate stress in the tooth and to prevent crack initiation [12]. Given that the microstructure and composition of enamel change from the outer enamel toward the enamel-dentin junction (EDJ), the natural tooth enamel exhibits gradient mechanical behaviors [15 – 18]. Chronic exposure to high fluoride levels results in structural changes in dental enamel and leads to dental fluorosis [19 – 21]. These changes are often accompanied by alterations in the mechanical behavior of the enamel [22 – 24]. Shearer et al. [22] and Suckling et al. [23] used an animal model to study the mechanical behavior of the dental fluorosis enamel. Fan et al. [24] investigated the mechanical behavior of human mild dental fluorosis enamel. To date, however, the gradient nanomechanical behavior of the dental fluorosis enamel remains unclear. In addition, the selection criteria for restorative materials for dental fluorosis are also ambiguous. Therefore, this study investigates the gradient nanomechanical behavior of the mild dental fluorosis enamel and severe dental fluorosis <b>enamel.</b> The nanotribological <b>properties</b> of four different restorative materials are compared with those of the outer {{layer of the}} dental fluorosis enamel.

HA has been synthesis using various methods, and the most practical technique is known as wet chemical precipitation. HA with the molecular formula of Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 is one of the essential mineral consist from the calcium phosphate salt group (Rajkumar et al. 2011). It is the most stable calcium phosphate salt among the other salt such as tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) at the range pH value in between 4 and 12 and at normal temperatures (Koutsopoulos 2002; Sadat-Shojai et al. 2013; Abidi and Murtaza 2014). The composition of HA will be formed when the stoichiometric of Ca/P ratio approximately in the range of 1.67 (Rujitanapanich et al. 2014; Abidi and Murtaza 2014). HA is usually found in the vertebrate group, especially in the hard tissue of bone and teeth <b>enamel.</b> The similarity <b>properties</b> of the chemical composition and the crystal structure of HA with the natural human bone give an alternative biomedical application uses in the human body such as bone implant for bone tissue substitution and drug delivery system (Santhosh and Prabu 2013). Besides, HA can be directly ingrowths in the host bone as artificial bones in human body and it was widespread used in orthopedic application due to its special abilities in bioactivity and biocompatibility (Zhang 2007).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{evaluated}} in vivo and in vitro enamel permeability in different physiological and clinical conditions {{by means of}} SEM inspection of replicas of enamel surface obtained from polyvinyl siloxane impressions subsequently later cast in polyether impression ma-terial. This technique, not invasive and risk-free, allows the evaluation of fluid outflow from enamel surface {{and is able to}} detect the presence of small quantities of fluid, visu-alized as droplets. Fluid outflow on enamel surface represents <b>enamel</b> permeability. This <b>property</b> has a paramount importance in enamel physiolgy and pathology although its ef-fective role in adhesion, caries pathogenesis and prevention today is still not fully under-stood. The aim of the studies proposed was to evaluate enamel permeability changes in differ-ent conditions and to correlate the findings with the actual knowledge about enamel physiology, caries pathogenesis, fluoride and etchinhg treatments. To obtain confirmed data the replica technique has been supported by others specific techniques such as Ra-man and IR spectroscopy and EDX analysis. The first study carried out visualized fluid movement through dental enamel in vivo con-firmed that enamel is a permeable substrate and demonstrated that age and enamel per-meability are closely related. Examined samples from subjects of different ages showed a decreasing number and size of droplets with increasing age: freshly erupted permanent teeth showed many droplets covering the entire enamel surface. Droplets in permanent teeth were prominent along enamel perikymata. These results obtained through SEM inspection of replicas allowed innovative remarks in enamel physiology. An analogous testing has been developed for evaluation of enamel permeability in primary enamel. The results of this second study showed that primary enamel revealed a substantive permeability with droplets covering the entire enamel sur-face without any specific localization accordingly with histological features, without changes during aging signs of post-eruptive maturation. These results confirmed clinical data that showed a higher caries susceptibility for primary enamel and suggested a strong relationship between this one and enamel permeability. Topical fluoride application represents the gold standard for caries prevention although the mechanism of cariostatic effect of fluoride still needs to be clarified. The effects of topical fluoride application on enamel permeability were evaluated. Particularly two dif-ferent treatments (NaF and APF), with different pH, were examined. The major product of topical fluoride application was the deposition of CaF 2 -like globules. Replicas inspec-tion before and after both treatments at different times intervals and after specific addi-tional clinical interventions showed that such globule formed in vivo could be removed by professional toothbrushing, sonically and chemically by KOH. The results obtained in relation to enamel permeability showed that fluoride treatments temporarily reduced enamel water permeability when CaF 2 -like globules were removed. The in vivo perma-nence of decreased enamel permeability after CaF 2 globules removal has been demon-strated for 1 h for NaF treated teeth and for at least 7 days for APF treated teeth. Important clinical consideration moved from these results. In fact the caries-preventing action of fluoride application may be due, in part, to its ability to decrease enamel water permeability and CaF 2 like-globules seem to be indirectly involved in enamel protection over time maintaining low permeability. Others results obtained by metallographic microscope and SEM/EDX analyses of or-thodontic resins fluoride releasing and not demonstrated the relevance of topical fluo-ride application in decreasing the demineralization marks and modifying the chemical composition of the enamel in the treated area. These data obtained in both the experiments confirmed the efficacy of fluoride in caries prevention and contribute to clarify its mechanism of action. Adhesive dentistry is the gold standard for caries treatment and tooth rehabilitation and is founded on important chemical and physical principles involving both enamel and dentine substrates. Particularly acid etching of dental enamel enamel has usually employed in bonding pro-cedures increasing microscopic roughness. Different acids have been tested in the litera-ture suggesting several etching procedures. The acid-induced structural transformations in enamel after different etching treatments by means of Raman and IR spectroscopy analysis were evaluated and these findings were correlated with enamel permeability.
