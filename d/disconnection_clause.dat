40|$|Disconnection clauses’ {{are legal}} {{provisions}} inserted into multilateral conventions {{to ensure that}} certain parties to the convention {{are not required to}} apply the rules of the convention because other relevant rules have already been agreed to among themselves. A <b>disconnection</b> <b>clause</b> can also be described more generally as a ‘conflict clause’ because it signals to all parties that parallel and potentially conflicting treaty obligations exist. This paper presents a discussion of the <b>disconnection</b> <b>clause</b> which argues that while these clauses make it possible for a limited group of parties to enhance the objectives of a treaty by taking measures that correspond to their special circumstance, this practice also creates a possibility that the inter se agreement will undermine the original treaty regime. The actual impact of a particular <b>disconnection</b> <b>clause</b> depends on how the clause is crafted, along with the changing nature of the regime that it refers to. The potential for a <b>disconnection</b> <b>clause</b> to undermine the object and purpose of the original treaty can therefore be removed during its design. Nevertheless, without full disclosure when negotiating the convention, any clause that seeks to replace treaty provisions with an alternative regime that would be applicable only between certain parties may, at worst, be creating different standards for different parties and, at best, be opaque and incoherent. This paper first describes the various types of <b>disconnection</b> <b>clause,</b> focusing on their purpose and development. It then assesses the main legal and political controversies surrounding these clauses before assessing whether these clauses could potentially create more legal problems than they are intended to solve or whether they are simply a practical response to deepening regionalism...|$|E
40|$|The Lisbon Treaty has {{established}} the Union {{as a legal}} personality. It opens for mixed agreements on foreign policy and community topics. In areas where the Union legislates, the EU can sign various kinds of agreements {{on behalf of the}} member states, who are consequently not allowed to negotiate international agreements on their own (autonomously) in these areas. The European Union's accession to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) represents a historic step for the railway community. This relationship is now clear: a <b>disconnection</b> <b>clause</b> in the accession agreement in principle allows EU law precedence for traffic internal to the EU. The relationship between EU law and COTIF law is there more about coordination than disconnection...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the auspices}} of the Council of Europe more than 200 {{international}} agreements were drafted and concluded. They foster closer cooperation primarily among member states and set PanEuropean legal standards. In some Council of Europe conventions special clauses have been introduced that allow a group of parties for a derogation from convention obligations - they are known as “disconnection clauses”. <b>Disconnection</b> <b>clauses</b> resemble conflict of law rules, are general in nature, normally are formulated in a unconditional way, and operate automatically. They are meant to provide protection for regulations established by more closely integrated states, e. g. Nordic states or the European Union. For the latter, they are crucial as they safeguard the EU autonomy and uphold primacy of EU rules visàvis international obligations of member states. Yet <b>disconnection</b> <b>clauses</b> raise much concern as contributing to further fragmentation of international law and may possibly have a disadvantageous effect on compliance with and consistency of legal standards in Europe...|$|R
5000|$|After goodybags with {{unlimited}} internet allowance were introduced, {{complaints were}} made to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) from customers who had their internet access disabled. The reason given by Giffgaff for their <b>disconnection</b> was a <b>clause</b> in the terms and conditions stating may disconnect you [...] "if you do anything...which we reasonably think adversely impacts the Service to other Giffgaff customers or may adversely affect the Network". The complaint was not upheld by the ASA who concluded that unlimited internet was advertised correctly. Giffgaff noted that their customer service agents had used the clause above incorrectly and promised to rectify this.|$|R
