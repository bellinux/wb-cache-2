5|$|The modern Olympic Games {{were first}} held in Athens in 1896, and {{travelled}} to Paris {{four years later}} {{as part of the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle world's fair. The second Games featured a greatly expanded range of events from the <b>first,</b> <b>up</b> from 43 to 95. Among the events added in 1900 was the tug of war. Two tug of war teams were entered for the Paris tournament; Racing Club de France represented the host nation, along with a team from the United States which was composed of six athletes that were taking part in various other events during the Games. The American team withdrew from the competition, as they discovered that the tug of war was scheduled {{at the same time as}} the hammer throw which three of their team were competing in. A Scandinavian team was accepted as a late-entry by the organisers, comprising a mix of Swedish and Danish athletes competing at the Games. Various reports assign the credit for the formation and entry of this team to different sources; a Danish account claimed that it was one of the Danish pullers, Eugen Schmidt who was responsible, while a Swedish record attributed it to their representative at the Games, Lieutenant Bergh.|$|E

25|$|In April 2009, Uganda {{travelled}} to South Africa for the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier.

Uganda finished 10th overall after beating Denmark but losing to Bermuda in positional playoff matches, and thus was relegated to 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three.|$|E

25|$|Bardot then {{appeared}} in four movies {{that made her}} a star. <b>First</b> <b>up</b> was a musical, Naughty Girl (1956), where Bardot played a troublesome school girl.

It was followed by a comedy, Plucking the Daisy (1956), written by Vadim with the director Marc Allegret, and another success at France. So too was the comedy The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful (1956) with Louis Jourdan.|$|E
25|$|Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally {{the toughest}} English side I played against, and the {{experience}} of playing against them <b>first</b> <b>up</b> in my Test career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not for the faint of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, the {{problems}} with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but the politics and the economics.

They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service {{to each other on}} the basis of whose engine was <b>first</b> <b>up</b> at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push.

25|$|Sunline resumed in February 1999. She won <b>first</b> <b>up</b> but was {{narrowly}} beaten for {{the first}} time by Rose O'War, second-up, in Melbourne's Angus Armanasco Stakes, her 9th career start. The race was not run to suit, with a long shot racing away before the home turn, which may have exposed Sunline's lack of fitness on the day, as she was jumping from 1,200 to 1,600 metres. At her next start, Sunline defeated Rose O'War in the Kewney Stakes, and in her first look at the Cox Plate course, defeated the VRC Oaks (and subsequent AJC Oaks) winner Grand Archway by four-and-a-half lengths in the Moonee Valley Oaks (2,040 metres).|$|E
25|$|The {{last two}} {{weekends}} of matches were played in South Africa and Argentina. <b>First</b> <b>up</b> the Wallabies faced the Springboks in Cape Town, where South Africa won 28–10. The victory {{came after a}} ten-minute period {{at the end of}} the match where the Springboks scored three-tries. The same weekend Argentina faced the All Blacks in La Plata. For the New Zealanders the match was overshadowed by the omission of Aaron Cruden, who had missed the flight to Argentina, and was subsequently dropped from the squad for the last two weeks of the Championship. The All Blacks won 34–13, and with the bonus-point win took an unassailable lead in the Championshipgiving them their third Rugby Championship, and 13th overall since the inception of the Tri-Nations Championship in 1996.|$|E
