5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{are not in}} {{agreement}} about how much energy is contained in the vacuum. Quantum mechanics requires the energy to be large as Paul Dirac claimed <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sea of energy. Other scientists specializing in General Relativity require the energy to be small enough for curvature of space to agree with observed astronomy. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows the energy to be as large as needed to promote quantum actions {{for a brief moment}} of time, even if the average energy is small enough to satisfy relativity and flat space. To cope with disagreements, the vacuum energy is described as a virtual energy potential of positive and negative energy.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton Select is a fast pitch league {{containing}} {{teams from}} across the city. It is a league for the ages of 19 and under. It is a relatively unknown league to the public, but is highly scouted. It is a very competitive league that has each park trying {{to be regarded as}} Hamilton's finest team. Hamilton select consists of 28 teams in the Hamilton region but East Hamilton is where the top teams are found. The league originated in 1997. The team to win earns an entry into Regionals to play against Niagara's, Ottawa's, and Toronto's top teams. There has only been one team to win Regionals representing Hamilton: Gage Park 1999. Over the past 12years there have only been 6 different teams to represent Hamilton: Gage Park (5), Rosedale (3), Scott Park (2), Roxborough (1), and Berrisfield (1). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> community within the community, although it is a highly competitive league it is a tight group of competitors.|$|E
25|$|Broadly speaking, cask ale brewing {{starts the}} same as that of keg beer. The same brew run could be used to make cask, keg, and bottled beer. The {{difference}} is what happens after the primary fermentation is finished and the beer has been left to condition. Typically keg and bottled beers are either sterile-filtered or pasteurised or both, but beer destined for cask is simply 'racked' (poured) into the cask in its natural state. Finings are usually placed in the cask to assist 'dropping' the yeast giving a clear beer. Extra hops and priming sugar may also be added. The cask is sealed and sent off to the pub. In this state <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bottle-conditioned beer and, like bottle-conditioned beers, the beer will continue to develop for a certain period of time. Also like bottle-conditioned beers, the length of time the beer can last in the cask will depend on the nature of the beer itself: unopened, stronger beers can last for months; light, delicate beers need to be tapped and sold quickly. Stronger beers may also need longer to settle and mature. Some pubs have been known to keep very strong beers in a sealed cask for a year or more to allow them to fully develop.|$|E
500|$|The recitative [...] "" [...] (The way of vile sins) is secco, {{accompanied}} by the continuo. The words [...] "So zeigt sich nur ein leerer Schatten und übertünchtes Grab" [...] (It shows itself as only an empty shadow and a whitewashed grave) are expressed in [...] "pale" [...] harmonies. The final lines are arioso and illustrate in [...] "" [...] (<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sharp sword, that pierces through body and soul) {{the movement of the}} sword by fast runs in the continuo.|$|E

2500|$|Famously, upon visiting Merthyr's districts {{aforementioned}} in 1850, Thomas Carlyle {{wrote that}} the town was filled with such [...] "unguided, hard-worked, fierce, and miserable-looking sons of Adam I never saw before.

2500|$|A {{computer}} program could be written {{to carry out}} the actions of Dawkins's hypothetical monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed.

2500|$|The Siemens {{line has}} been complemented by a new design of trams called the [...] Avenio, which have been built on the design {{technology}} of Combino Plus in Sul de Tejo and Budapest.

2500|$|The {{scenario}} is staged {{to produce a}} string of gibberish letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 2728, or about 1040, so {{the probability that the}} monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a [...] "target" [...] phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, [...] "METHINKS <b>IT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>LIKE</b> <b>A</b> WEASEL".|$|E
2500|$|Bede was lucid about earth's sphericity, writing [...] "We {{call the}} earth a globe, {{not as if}} {{the shape of a}} sphere were {{expressed}} in the diversity of plains and mountains, but because, if all things are included in the outline, the earth's circumference will represent the figure of a perfect globe...
