5000|$|Copolymers of pHEMA {{are still}} widely used today. Poly-HEMA {{functions}} as a hydrogel by rotating around its central carbon. In air, the non-polar methyl side turns outward, making the material brittle and easy to grind into the correct lens shape. In water, the polar hydroxyethyl side turns outward and the material becomes flexible. Pure pHEMA yields lenses that are too thick for sufficient oxygen to diffuse through, so all contact lenses that are pHEMA based are manufactured with copolymers that make the gel thinner and increase its water of hydration. These copolymer hydrogel lenses are often suffixed [...] "-filcon", such as Methafilcon, which is a copolymer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate. Another copolymer hydrogel lens, called Polymacon, is a copolymer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate and <b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dimethacrylate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Profiles of {{reaction}} rate {{as a function}} of time were obtained for free radical crosslinking polymerizations of <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> methacrylates and <b>dimethacrylates</b> using differential scanning calorimetry. Copolymerizations of <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> monomethacrylates with small amounts of dimethacrylate crosslinking agents were studied in addition to homopolymerizations of dimethacrylates. In the former case, the effects of the crosslinking agent, initiator, solvent, and the pendent <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> chain length were investigated. Typically, a sharp increase in the reaction rate was observed which was attributed to autoacceleration. The time period before the onset of autoacceleration increased and the maximum reaction rate decreased as the solvent concentration or the pendent chain length were increased or the crosslinking agent concentration was decreased. These results were explained by an increase in the mobility of the growing polymer leading to a decrease in the magnitude of the gel effect. Studies of dimethacrylates yielded similar results for the effect of solvent. However, the maximum reaction rate increased when the number of repeating units between the methacrylate functionalities was increased from one to four, but decreased when the number of repeating units was increased from four to nine. Photopolymerization experiments indicated that radicals with significantly different lifetimes might be present in dimethacrylate homopolymerizations...|$|R
