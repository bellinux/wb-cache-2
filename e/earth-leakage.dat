50|$|An <b>Earth-leakage</b> {{circuit breaker}} (ELCB) is a safety device used in {{electrical}} installations with high Earth impedance to prevent shock. It detects small stray voltages {{on the metal}} enclosures of electrical equipment, and interrupts the circuit if a dangerous voltage is detected. Once widely used, more recent installations instead use residual current circuit breakers which instead detect leakage current directly.|$|E
30|$|DC {{electric}} railways produce magnetic fields, {{not only}} from the intended traction currents, but also from unintended <b>earth-leakage</b> currents; these fields, particularly those from the leakage currents, are becoming an increasing problem for geomagneticians. This paper introduces the relevant properties of DC-railway traction-power circuits, and the various ways in which <b>earth-leakage</b> currents are produced, and discusses models of how these leakage currents vary along the track and with train position. It describes the geometry of the resultant magnetic fields, and gives the formal algebra for calculating the magnetic field when these leakage currents are known, but also suggests some simple approximations that could be used when the current distribution is not known in detail. This paper also summarises previous relevant papers.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} optical current {{monitors}} incorporating low-birefringence fibre have been described. However, when such fibres are wound into small coils birefringence due to bending is induced, which reduces the sensitivity. This effect restricts {{the number of}} turns of small diameter which can be employed and thus no highly sensitive current monitors {{have been developed for}} use as <b>earth-leakage</b> detectors for example...|$|E
