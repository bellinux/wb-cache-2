40|$|The {{age of the}} non-metamorphic {{sedimentary}} {{series in}} the Cantabrian mountains ranges from the Cambrian through the Tertiary. The Lower Palaeozoic deposits mainly show a sandy or quartzitic facies, and were deposited in an extensive Cambro-Ordovician geosyncline of which only the miogeosynclinal part is accessible for investigation, the orthogeosynclinal part now being covered by the Mesozoic-Tertiary deposits of the Spanish Meseta. The Caledonian orogeny is expressed in phenomena resulting from igneous activity. The Hercynian orogeny started with <b>epeirogenetic</b> movements during the Upper Devonian (Bretonic phase of Stille). The uplift caused a varying hiatus on which Upper Famennian transgressive sediments are found unconformably overlying anything between the Lower Famennian and the Middle Cambrian. The E-W-trending León line {{played an important role}} during these <b>epeirogenetic</b> movements. In the Asturides north of it, a Central Asturian dome shows an almost constant amount of uplift. Over a very wide area the Upper Famennian rests unconformably on the Lower Ordovician quartzite. Two main stratigraphic and tectonic units are distinguished: 1. The Isidro-Tarna-Ponton subarea. 2. The Mampodre-Fontasguera-Ten subarea. The Upper Famennian transgression was followed by the sedimentation of a uniform limestone during the Visean and Namurian. In the Central Asturian dome region a period of non-deposition or slow sedimentation set in after the sedimentation of the Namurian limestone. Locally, even this limestone was deposited under such conditions. South of the León line, the sedimentation continued with a thick series of mainly clastic deposits (San Emiliano Formation). During the Upper Namurian-Lower Westphalian, tectonic forces (Sudetic phase of Stille) caused nappe and overthrust structures south of the León line, whereas the areas north of this line, the Central Asturian dome region included, acted as a marginal trough to this orogene. The Asturian folding phase started in the Upper Westphalian, during which the Carboniferous basins north of the León line became folded. In the Central Asturian dome region, for example, SW-NE-moving thrust sheets developed, and were refolded in a predominantly E-W direction. Stephanian intramontanous coal basins are found in the present area along the León line. These basins were folded in an E-W direction at some time between the Triassic and Upper Stephanian (Saalic phase of Stille). Features indicative of a Würm glaciation are frequently found in the area under consideration...|$|E
40|$|The Upper Devonian {{shelf of}} the studied area {{was divided into}} two {{platforms}} separated by a significant break in the slope, related to the deep-seated fault system of the Sabero-Gordón Line. As differentiated block movements influenced the depositional history of the area, an External Zone, an Intermediate Zone and an Internal Zone can be distinguished. Each zone runs parallel to the east-west striking Upper Devonian coast and has a characteristic sedimentary succession. Due to upheaval, tilting and erosion of the area north of the Sabero-Gordón Line and intermitted subsidence south of this line, related to progradation of the linear shoreline from north to south, three regressive coarsening upward sequences were deposited in the External Zone. The first sequence is capped by a calcareous transgressive unit of minor importance. Based on these sequences the Nocedo Formation {{is divided into three}} members. The Gordon Member and the Millar Member are newly introduced in this paper. The Fueyo Member was already officially introduced by Evers (1967). After deposition of the three cycles <b>epeirogenetic</b> movements decreased and a levelling stage occurred in which coastal sands spread out over the whole area forming the transgressive upper part of the Ermita Formation...|$|E
40|$|Canali-type {{channels}} on Venus show inverted profile segments; that is, {{large portions}} of the channels trend uphill. The original gradients for these channels were not horizontal, but must have progressively trended downhill. Therefore, undulation patterns imposed on the profiles {{have to be the}} result of tectonism occurring since channel formation. This implies that some of the uppermost geological units of the plains, which are coincident with canali, experienced significant postemplacement tectonic deformation. The pattern of deformation is hierarchical. Within observational limits, at least two scales of deformation are indicated. The longer scale deformation (thousands of kilometers) corresponds to large-scale basins; the shorter scale deformation (hundreds of kilometers) corresponds to ridge belts or to small-scale domes/basins. The latter features, at scales up to a few hundred kilometers, extensively deform some plain areas. Although not appearing in the topographic profiles because of resolution limitations, deformation scales of tens of kilometers or less, which mostly reflect wrinkle ridges, also overlap the longer deformation scales. The channels probably formed relatively quickly in comparison to the time scale of deformation. Canali formation is closely related to the genesis of plains, and canali profile deformation reflects tectonic processes operating at multiple scales. The lower limit rates of large-scale tectonic warping are comparable to <b>epeirogenetic</b> deformation rates for Earth's intraplate continental interiors...|$|E
40|$|Late Sandbian {{to early}} Katian δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphy has in Norway been {{described}} in only two previous reports that dealt with two geographically rather widely separated areas, namely the Oslo-Asker district and the Nes-Hamar district. No data have been available from the Ordovician outcrop areas between these districts that could help clarify the partly unclear regional stratigraphic relations across the Oslo region. A chemostratigraphic study of the classical road section at Tønnerud in the northwestern Hadeland district about halfway between the previously investigated districts resulted in the recognition of two δ 13 C excursions, namely one in the uppermost Furuberget Formation tentatively identified as the Guttenberg Isotopic Carbon Excursion {{and one in the}} lower Solvang Formation that is classified as the KOPE (RAKVERE) excursion. Based on these results, the Furuberget and Solvang formations are interpreted to be separated by a significant gap in the study area corresponding to the Oandu and lower Rakvere regional Baltoscandic stages. This suggests that the Tønnerud succession is less complete stratigraphically than those in the Oslo-Asker district. Similar gaps are not uncommon in this interval in Baltoscandia and in North America and probably reflect both eustatic and local <b>epeirogenetic</b> movements that make it difficult to establish a regionally applicable sequence stratigraphy...|$|E
40|$|The Devonian and Carboniferous rock-sequence in the Cantabrian Mountains is {{developed}} {{in two different}} facies which are separated by an E-W tectonic line, the León Line, and called the Leonide and Palentian facies, respectively to the S and N. The Leonide facies is widely exposed throughout the Cantabrian Mountains and its tectonic history is now well known. The most complete sequence of the Palentian facies occurs in the present area, which lies across {{the boundaries of the}} provinces of Palcncia, León and Santander. Towards the west and north the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous gradually plunge below the younger strata. The Palentian facies in this region is only found north of a second fundamental tectonic feature, the SE-NW Cardaño Line. This line joins the León Line in the SE of the area near the village of Santibañez but can be traced far to the NW into the province of Oviedo. Immediately south of the Cardaño Line there is the Sicro basin filled with Upper Carboniferous elastics which even overlap in places the León Line further south. The pre-Westphalian rocks of the present area are limited to the north by the Peña Prieta Line, the fundamental nature of which is emphasised by a large granite intrusion. To the east the Polentinos fault separates the present area from the mainly Westphalian, Pisuerga basin. The fundamental lines are partly expressed at the surface as large fault systems. It is remarkable that in the Palentian facies sedimentation was not interrupted by the major erosional periods known from the Leonide facies. The post-Silurian and pre-Westphalian sequence of the Palentian facies is on average about 850 m thick and consists mainly of shales with thin limestone intervals. The corresponding sequence of the Leonide facies is on average about 1750 m thick and shows important, thick Devonian reef limestone intervals. Only the lower and uppermost of the Devonian contain clearly higher-energy deposits (sandstone sequences). Both the lithology and fossil association confirm that the Palentian facies sequences developed in a more offshore (middle to outer neritic) environment of deposition than indicated for the Leonide facies (littoral to inner neritic), Important <b>epeirogenetic</b> movements in the late Namurian and in the Westphalian disturbed the preceding long period of quiet sedimentation. Between the Cardaño Line to the south, the Peña Prieta Line to the north and the Polentinos fault to the east the Cardaño block was subjected to a regional tilting during the deposition of the rocks of the Yuso Group. The maximum uplift and erosion are indicated in the N and E whereas the deepest subsidence and maximum deposition have been detected in the S and W of the Cardaño block. The pre-Westphalian rocks, where unconformably overlain by those of the Yuso Group, show local, gentle, pre- or synsedimentary folded structures. The present study has not revealed pre-Westphalian structures that would justify {{the use of the term}} orogenic phase (i. e. Sudetic) for their origin. They are rather interpreted as the results of local compression accompanying pre- and synsedimentary <b>epeirogenetic</b> movements. The unconformable Yuso Group consists of a conglomerate facies — the Curavacas Formation — up to about 700 m thick and a sandstone-shale facies — the Lechada Formation — of at least 750 m N of Cardaño de Arriba (probably up to 2000 m to the W). The Westphalian rocks were deformed during the main compressive phase, which therefore is thought to correspond with the Asturian folding phase (pre-Stephanian). The tectonic transport here was from north to south in contrast to the Leonides where it was from south to north. This correlates with the theory that the folding of the two areas took place at different times; Asturian in the Asturides (Palentian facies) and Sudetic in the Leonides. The inhomogeneity of the Palentian facies rock sequence is reflected in the very complicated final tectonic picture. The Cardaño Area can be subdivided into 4 subareas (Northern, Central, Southern and Arauz), in each of which a different lithofacies is related with a corresponding minor tectofacies. Simultaneous cross folding can be related to the rapid facies changes in the affected rocks. The present area gives very instructive examples of the close interaction of tectonics and sedimentation. <b>Epeirogenetic</b> movements between fundamental tectonic lines controlled the deposition of the sedimentary sequence. These heterogeneous rocks were then acted upon by a relatively short compressive tectonic phase which created out of them the present architecture of the Cardaño Area...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} {{architecture of}} the immense volumes of eruptive products in Continental Flood Basalt Provinces (CFBPs) provides vital clues, through the constraint of a chrono-stratigraphic framework, to the origins of major intraplate melting events. This work presents close examination of the internal facies architecture and structure, duration of volcanism, <b>epeirogenetic</b> uplift associated with CFBPs, and the potential environmental impacts of three intensely studied CFBPs (the Parana-Etendeka, Deccan Traps and North Atlantic Igneous Province). Such a combination of key volcanological, stratigraphic and chronologic observations can reveal how a CFBP is constructed spatially and temporally to provide crucial geological constraints regarding their development. Using this approach, a typical model can be generated, {{on the basis of}} the three selected CFBPs, that describes three main phases of flood basalt volcanism. These phases are recognized in Phanerozoic CFBPs globally. At the inception of CFBP volcanism, relatively low-volume transitional-alkaline eruptions are forcibly erupted into exposed cratonic basement lithologies, sediments, and in some cases, water. Distribution of initial volcanism is strongly controlled by the arrangement of pre-existing topography, the presence of water bodies and local sedimentary systems, but is primarily controlled by existing lithospheric and crustal weaknesses and concurrent regional stress patterns. The main phase of volcanism is typically characterised by a culmination of repeated episodes of large volume tholeiitic flows that predominantly generate large tabular flows and flow fields from a number of spatially restricted eruption sites and fissures. These tabular flows build a thick lava flow stratigraphy in a relatively short period of time (c. 1 – 5 Ma). With the overall duration of flood volcanism lasting 5 – 10 Ma (the main phase accounting for less than half the overall eruptive time in each specific case). This main phase or ‘acme’ of volcanism accounts for much of the CFBP eruptive volume, indicating that eruption rates are extremely variable over the whole duration of the CFBP. During the waning phase of flood volcanism, the volume of eruptions rapidly decrease and more widely distributed localised centres of eruption begin to develop. These late-stage eruptions are commonly associated with increasing silica content and highly explosive eruptive products. Posteruptive modification is characterised by continued episodes of regional uplift, associated erosion, and often the persistence of a lower-volume mantle melting anomaly in the offshore parts of those CFBPs at volcanic rifted margins...|$|E
40|$|A short {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the stratigraphy of the Devonian and the Lower Carboniferous of the Cantabrian Mountains precedes the report of the author's stratigraphic and palaeontologic observations in León: the Río Esla area (Gedinnian to Viséan), the central Cantabrian area (Famennian to Viséan), and the Gildar-Montó area (Eifelian to Viséan); in Asturias: the coastal area (Frasnian to Viséan); in Palencia: the Arauz-Polentinos area (Gedinnian to Givetian), the Carda 0 ̆ 148 o-Triollo area (Eifelian to Viséan), and the San Martín-Valsurvio area (Givetian and Famennian to Viséan); and in Santander: the Liébana area (Eifelian to Viséan). Most of the conodont faunas, which were extracted from calcareous formations, could be arranged in the zonal succession established in Germany, and thus supplied new data about several formations in the Cantabrian Mountains. The presence of the transgressive Ermita Formation in Asturias and Palencia is demonstrated. The age of this unit ranges maximally from uppermost Famennian to lowermost Tournaisian. The Carda 0 ̆ 148 o Formation ranges from middle or upper Givetian to upper Frasnian. The Vidrieros Formation ranges from {{the upper part of the}} lower Famennian to the lowermost Tournaisian. A synthesis of the stratigraphic data delimits the Palentine facies area, which is clearly separated from the Asturo-Leonese facies area by positive areas. The following palaeogeographic units are distinguished: the Asturo-Leonese Basin, the Palentine Basin, and the Asturian Geanticline. The development of these units from the Middle Devonian to the Lower Carboniferous is demonstrated by eight facies-pattern maps. The sedimentation on the Asturian Geanticline was limited and probably incomplete. An <b>epeirogenetic</b> uplift of this geanticline took place in late Frasnian to early Famennian times. This uplift is correlated with the deposition of the quartzitic Murcia Formation in the sheltered Palentine Basin. The uplifted area was covered by the Ermita transgression in the late Famennian to early Tournaisian. After a break in the sedimentation, a local transgression resulted in the Vegamian Formation in the upper Tournaisian. In most of the area the Alba transgression began in the uppermost Tournaisian or lower Viséan. In the Palentine Basin the deposition of the Alba Formation started in the upper Viséan. The chapter on systematics deals mainly with the most important zonal guide forms of the conodonts. Three new elements are described: Icriodus eslaensis n. sp. from the middle to upper Givetian, Siphonodella? n. sp. a, probably from the upper Tournaisian, and n. gen. A n. sp. a, a simple compound conodont from the upper Gedinnian or lower Siegenian...|$|E
40|$|Precambrian clastic rocks, {{deposited}} under unstable conditions, were folded {{before in}} a relatively stable environment shallow marine sedimentation spread out over the whole area. Silico-clastic sediments were deposited from Cambrian to Devonian, except from the Lower-Middle Cambrian when carbonate deposition dominated. With a hiatus in sedimentation during the Llanvirn to Llandovery {{the influence of a}} rising block, NNE of the present area, started. During the Silurian this rise resulted in development of clastic sequences trending to thin towards the N. From the Devonian to Upper Carboniferous sedimentation circumstances became less stable. As a result an alternation of clastic and carbonate rocks developed. Towards the end of the Devonian <b>epeirogenetic</b> uplift and tilting of {{the northern part of the}} area resulted in strong erosion and consequently the uppermost transgressive Devonian sandstone rests on a variety of older deposits. The Sabero-Gordón line separates the uplifted area in the north from the area where continued subsidence and sedimentation took place during the Upper Devonian. During the Lower Carboniferous differences in sedimentation circumstances were strongly reduced resulting in the deposition of the Alba Formation all over the area. During the Namurian the Sabero-Gordón Une renewed its function as a facies boundary between a northern and a southern area. Together with the development of the progress of the maximal Carboniferous sedimentation towards the north the initial folding of the Hercynian orogenesis started south of it. After the orogenesis oblong coal basins developed during the Stephanian B along normal faults approximately parallel to the strike of the folding. After folding of these coal basins a long period of non-deposition followed which ended in the Upper Cretaceous when sedimentation took place along the southern border of the folded Palaeozoic. The Tertiary morphogenetic uplift of the Cantabrian Mountains is accompanied by continental deposits forming the border of the Duero basin. During the Hercynian orogenesis major deformation took place in the Leoides (Fig. 3). The Sabero-Gordón line separates the Leónides in a strongly folded area in the south and an area with thrust sheets north of it. The shape of folds and thrusts is mainly determined by the lithological properties of the Palaeozoic rocks. Table 2 shows the rocks units which are supposed to have their own tectonic-style. In the southern area (Alba synclinorium) minor folding is an important feature. Based on a symmetry-concept most of these folds are parasitic folds. In some places minor folds in the folded area as well as in the thrust area show that deformation took place by gravity-stress. The León line separating the Leonides from the Asturides seems to have no significance as a fundamental structural line in this area...|$|E
40|$|Three {{members are}} informally {{distinguished}} in this formation (A, B, and C from base to top). They are {{present at the}} western part of the outcrop (thickness ca. 246 m). On the eastern and southeastern part, only member A and basal part of member B are present and the thickness is reduced to ca. 20 m. A sharp surface of discontinuity separates member A from member B. The Portilla Formation abounds in reef-building elements associated with other groups. Five major carbonate facies types are established that belong to a complex biostromal ‘reef’ facies. Vertical and lateral facies changes are demonstrated. The carbonate facies was deposited in a shallow-marine environment. Towards end of deposition of member A, sharp changes in depositional conditions occurred, soon followed by a notable influx of siliciclastics. A distinctive barrier ‘reef’ pattern was established during deposition of member B. It protected a back-reef area from the open shallow sea. This back-reef environment was separated from an area of dominantly siliciclastic deposition in the southeast by an extremely shallow marine or shoal area which might have been emergent. During deposition of member B there occurred a rhythmic alternation of the back-reef carbonates and the carbonates continuous with the ‘reef’ barrier, probably reflecting minor changes in sea level likely due to <b>epeirogenetic</b> movements of the bottom. Eventually organic growth and associated carbonate sedimentation exceeded the rate of subsidence and as a result the ‘reefs’ laterally shifted seawards, followed by the back-reef facies. The facies pattern suggests an increasingly emergent tendency of the marginal part of the carbonate basin due to bottom movements. The barrier ‘reef’ pattern of member B probably terminated due to changes in relative subsidence during deposition of member C. A strong supply of siliciclastics during the deposition of the Nocedo Formation brought an end to the carbonate sedimentation of the Portilla Formation. The variation in thickness in the Portilla Formation has been mainly due to a slow and prolonged differential subsidence of the carbonate depositional basin. The absence of a large part of member B and member C in the easterly and southeasterly directions is probably largely due to non-deposition of sediments. Seventeen species are described of rhynchonellid brachiopods, out of which four species are new. Three new genera are established. Wherever available some critical German rhynchonellid species have been sectioned for comparison. The rhynchonellid and atrypid brachiopod fauna from the Portilla Formation show a great affinity with the Middle Devonian fauna of Eifel region, Germany. The Spanish fauna could be assigned to the mixed or Eifel facies, or close to this type. Striking similarity exists also between the Spanish fauna and the Middle Devonian fauna from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. The rhynchonellids and atrypids strongly suggest that the Eifelian — Givetian boundary lies in the basal part of member B. It is suggested that member A is of Eifelian age and that members B and C, apart from the basal part of member B are of Givetian age...|$|E
40|$|Many pebbles of igneous rocks, both {{plutonic}} and effusive, and of {{sedimentary rocks}} {{were collected from}} a submarine ridge known as the Yamato Bank in the Japan Sea. They are round or subangular with well polished surface, and vary in size from sand-grade to gravel over 50 cm. in diameter. If these pebbles had been found only in a limitted area lying 011 the track of steamships, their presence might be attributed to ballast thrown overboard from passing vessels. But {{the distribution of the}} pebbles is evidence of its improbability. Neither is it likely that ocean currents transport pebbles of this size so far from the present shores. On the other hand, there can be no wearing down of the surface of hard rocks on the sea-floor with a depth of 500 - 600 in. The only alternative is that the sea-floor that yielded these pebbles was at one time either a land-surface or a shallow sea near the shore, when they were formed by erosive action of the water flowing over their respective parent rock-masses, t'le shores submerging later to their present depths. All the pebbles described in this paper have the general petrographic characters common to their respective rock-types now exposed in the Japanese Islands. Hence it is inferred that the pebbles are derived from land which is now below the sea and which is geologically connected with the Japanese Islands, or that it was transported from some part of the present Japanese Islands before its submergence to where they lie on the sea-floor at present. The granite pebbles does riot show characteristics that could be correlated with any Japanese granite whose geological age has been established; while the andesite arid basalt pebbles have characteristics common to the late-Tertiary and Quaternary volcariics in the Japanese Islands. It is therefore highly probable that the sea-floor where these pebbles exist was a land-surface or a very shallow sea near the shore during the post-Neogene. If the latest land-submergence had occurred in a very remote geological past, the pebbles could riot have remained for long, geologically speaking, in the condition in which they are found at present without the aid of some auxiliary agent such as earthquake disturbances at the sea-bottom, since a sea-floor with a depth of 500 -average along its outer margin, and the lower one, which is far less incomplete in form than the other, extends down to 720 m. These two are regarded by him as the prolongations respectively of the T arid PN terraces on the present land-surface of the Japanese Islands. Thus, the present discovery of the pebbles and the inferences drawn from a petrographic study made of them may be strong evidences in support of Dr. Yabe's views concerning the <b>epeirogenetic</b> or eustatic movement of the Japanese Islands in recent geologic times, regardless of the cause, the magnitude, or the mechanism of the movement. Further studies of these pebbles may supply data that will afford more weighty evidence in favor of some particular age-span for the latest land-stage of the seas now bordering the present Japanese Islands. In conclusion the writer desires to express his sincere thanks to Lieutenant-Commander Asahina, who supplied him with a piece of the granite pebble, and also to Mr jSTiirio, through whose kindness the writer obtained many pebbles from the collection of the Imperial Fisheries Experimental Station of Tokyo...|$|E
