Forest floor samples from plantations of three age classes (13 -year-old; 27 -year-old; 41 -year-old) with various site qualities (II–VII) were collected from the Kuitpo radiata pine plantations in the Mount Lofty forest region of South Australia. The C concentrations of the forest <b>floor</b> <b>components</b> were significantly higher in the 41 -year-old plantation than in the 13 -year-old plantation, whereas the N concentrations were significantly lower in the 41 -year-old plantation than in the 13 -year-old plantation, except for the needle component. The C and N content of needles was significantly larger in the 13 -year-old plantation than in the 41 -year-old plantation, whereas fine woody materials, such as branches and bark, contributed less to the total C and N contents in the 13 -year-old plantation. The total C content of the forest floor did not significantly differ with age, whereas the N content was significantly affected by age in the radiata plantations.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Forestry, 2011 In {{temperate}} coniferous forests, {{forest floor}} fuels {{have been linked}} to variation in important effects of fire, most notably mineral soil heating and post-fire tree mortality. To improve the understanding of fire effects, I collected forest floor fuels in long-unburned Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) - white fir (Abies concolor) forests of the Lake Tahoe Basin, USA. Fuels from each forest floor horizon (litter, fermentation, and humus), as well as other important woody fuels (1 -hour fuel, 10 -hour fuel, and cones), were collected around the bases of large (> 50 cm diameter) Jeffrey pine and white fir. To isolate the effects of spatial position, I quantified fuel loading, depth, and bulk density at the base of each tree, beneath the crown drip line, and beyond the crown in open ???gaps???. Seasonal fuel moisture trends were measured during the 2009 and 2010 fire seasons. To understand the structure of the litter horizon, both spatially and between species, litter composition was examined, and mineral ash contents of each forest floor horizon were measured. Little variation was detected in forest floor bulk densities, depths, and moisture contents between the two conifers. There was also little variability in forest floor moisture across the Lake Tahoe Basin, but isolated rainfall events significantly altered forest floor moisture patterns. Duff (the fermentation and humus) moisture varied spatially throughout stands, whereas other important forest <b>floor</b> <b>components</b> did not. Results from the interannual moisture study revealed that moisture of the forest floor horizons differed between years while woody fuel moisture did not. The variability in field results underscore the importance of measuring duff moisture content, as well as 10 -hour woody fuel moisture, prior to prescribed fire. Forest floor bulk density and depth did not differ between Jeffrey pine and white fir. However, Jeffrey pine forest floors were more flammable than white fir forest floors in the laboratory, where samples of forest floor litter were burned under controlled conditions. Forest floor fires beneath Jeffrey pines could potentially burn at greater intensities and smolder longer than white fir forest floors due to differences in burning characteristics. In the Tahoe Basin, {{a better understanding of the}} complexity of forest fuels will help land managers manage and restore these fire-prone forests. More broadly, these results help inform the understanding of fuels dynamics in other temperate coniferous forests.

40|$|The Saltstone {{facilities}} at the DOE Savannah River Site (SRS) stabilize {{and dispose of}} low-level radioactive salt solution originating from liquid waste storage tanks at the site. The Saltstone Production Facility (SPF) receives treated salt solution and mixes the aqueous waste with dry cement, blast furnace slag, and fly ash to form a grout slurry which is mechanically pumped into concrete disposal cells that compose the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF). The solidified grout is termed “saltstone”. Cementitious materials play {{a prominent role in}} the design and long-term performance of the SDF. The saltstone grout exhibits low permeability and diffusivity, and thus represents a physical barrier to waste release. The waste form is also reducing, which creates a chemical barrier to waste release for certain key radionuclides, notably Tc- 99. Similarly, the concrete shell of an SDF disposal unit (SDU) represents an additional physical and chemical barrier to radionuclide release to the environment. Together the waste form and the SDU compose a robust containment structure at the time of facility closure. However, the physical and chemical state of cementitious materials will evolve over time through a variety of phenomena, leading to degraded barrier performance over Performance Assessment (PA) timescales of thousands {{to tens of thousands of}} years. Previous studies of cementitious material degradation in the context of low-level waste disposal have identified sulfate attack, carbonation influenced steel corrosion, and decalcification (primary constituent leaching) as the primary chemical degradation phenomena of most relevance to SRS exposure conditions. In this study, degradation time scales for each of these three degradation phenomena are estimated for saltstone and concrete associated with each SDU type under conservative, nominal, and best estimate assumptions. The nominal value (NV) is an intermediate result that is more probable than the conservative estimate (CE) and more defensible than the best estimate (BE). The combined effects of multiple phenomena are then considered to determine the most limiting degradation time scale for each cementitious material. Degradation times are estimated using a combination of analytic solutions from literature and numerical simulation codes provided through the DOE Cementitious Barriers Partnership (CBP) Software Toolbox ([URL] For the SDU 2 design, the roof, wall, and <b>floor</b> <b>components</b> are projected to become fully degraded under Nominal conditions at 3866, 923, and 1413 years, respectively. For SDU 4 the roof and floor are estimated to be fully degraded under Nominal conditions after 1137 and 1407 years, respectively; the wall is assumed to be fully degraded at time zero in the most recent PA simulations. Degradation of these concrete barriers generally occurs from combined sulfate attack and corrosion of embedded steel following carbonation. Saltstone is projected to degrade very slowly by decalcification, with complete degradation occurring in excess of 200, 000 years for any SDU type. Complete results are provided...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Floor {{surfaces}} are notable for the diverse roles that {{they play in}} our negotiation of everyday environments. Haptic communication via floor surfaces could enhance or enable many computer-supported activities that involve movement on foot. In this paper, we discuss potential applications of such interfaces in everyday environments and present a haptically augmented <b>floor</b> <b>component</b> through which several interaction methods are being evaluated. We describe two approaches {{to the design of}} structured vibrotactile signals for this device. The first is centered on a musical phrase metaphor, as employed in prior work on tactile display. The second is based upon the synthesis of rhythmic patterns of virtual physical impact transients. We report on an experiment in which participants were able to identify communication units that were constructed from these signals and displayed via a floor interface at well above chance levels. The results support the feasibility of tactile information display via such interfaces and provide further indications as to how to effectively design vibrotactile signals for them.

40|$|Predicting {{the fire}} {{performance}} of commonly used Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) floor systems {{is important in}} designing them for fire situations. In the past, many researchers conducted full scale fire tests and numerical analyses for this purpose. However, some researchers have proposed fire design rules to predict the fire resistance ratings of LSF floor systems to avoid expensive fire tests. Their proposals were developed only for LSF floors made of conventional lipped channel section (LCS) joists. Therefore this research was aimed at developing fire design rules for the new LSF floor systems made of hollow flange channel (HFC) section joists. It used the fire performance data from an extensive parametric study based on validated finite element models of the new floor system with varying <b>floor</b> <b>component</b> configurations. Three different fire design rules were proposed to predict the fire resistance ratings of LSF floors based on the available design equations from past research and current design standards. The proposed design equations were validated by comparing the fire resistance rating predictions with the finite element analysis results obtained from the parametric study. Further a new Direct Strength Method based fire design rule was also developed and validated using finite element analysis results.

The present quantitative effort on the UH- 60 A Black Hawk hub accelerations considers the lateral and longitudinal vibrations. An earlier study had considered the vertical vibration. The NASA/Army UH- 60 A Airloads Program flight test database is used. A physics based "maneuver-effect-factor (MEF) ", derived using the roll-angle and the pitch-rate, is used. Fundamentally, the lateral vibration data show high vibration levels (up to 0. 3 g's) at low airspeeds (for example, during landing flares) and at high airspeeds (for example, during turns). The {{results show that the}} advance ratio and the gross weight together can predict the vertical and the longitudinal vibration.
