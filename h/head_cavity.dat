40|$|Autotaxin, encoded by the Enpp 2 gene, generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) extracellularly, {{eliciting}} various cellular responses through specific LPA receptors. Previous {{studies have}} revealed that Enpp 2 −/− mice die at E 9. 5 owing to angiogenic defects in the yolk sac. Moreover, Enpp 2 −/− embryos show growth retardation, allantois malformation, no axial turning, and <b>head</b> <b>cavity</b> formation. We have also demonstrated that lysosome biogenesis is impaired in yolk sac visceral endoderm cells of Enpp 2 −/− embryos {{as a result of}} the downregulation of the Rho-ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase) -LIM kinase pathway. In this study, we examine what signaling defect(s) is responsible for <b>head</b> <b>cavity</b> formation and yolk sac angiogenic defects. By using a whole embryo culture system, we show that 10 μM Ki 16425, an antagonist for the LPA receptors, induces <b>head</b> <b>cavity</b> formation and yolk sac angiogenic defects in wild-type embryos. Moreover, 1 μM Ki 16425 induces both phenotypes in Enpp 2 heterozygous embryos at significantly higher incidence than in wild-type embryos, suggesting an interaction between autotaxin and LPA receptor signaling. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of the Rho-ROCK pathway induces <b>head</b> <b>cavity</b> formation, whereas multiple pathways are involved in yolk sac angiogenic defects. These results reveal the signal transduction defects that underlie the abnormalities in Enpp 2 −/− embryos...|$|E
40|$|Artificially {{infected}} adult flies {{were used}} in this study. In both Musca species, P. bovicola developed in the fat-body cells, mainly of the abdomen. Escape from the midgut and penetration of the fatbody cell was possibly achieved by use of the cephalic hook of the microfilaria. At 27 °C, development to the 3 rd larval stage took 9 days, but maximum length was only reached after 11 days. Sharp increases in larval length took place on Days 6 - 7 and on Day 9. These sudden increases possibly indicate moults to the 2 nd and 3 rd larval stages respectively. During larval development the fat-body cell increased markedly in size to form a thin-walled capsule around the larva. On reaching the 3 rd stage, larvae escaped from the capsules and migrated to the <b>head</b> <b>cavity</b> and proboscis. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

30|$|By {{analyzing}} the vocalist’s pronunciation through spectral image analysis, you can observe {{the pitch of}} the singing voice and various overtones, partial sounds, and sounds in different frequency segments. The analysis results from {{the average of the}} sound frequency analysis in a certain time zone, which we call the “frequency spectrum.” In fact, it is a frequency and sound intensity distribution map of each harmonic column of singing. This frequency spectrum shows the sound intensity profile of the sound of singing at different frequencies, and its sound intensity is expressed in decibels. Usually, we give a more specific “sound form” reference frame from the perspective of musical acoustics. It allows us not only to understand the sound in the abstract concept of the “anapharyngeal cavity, oral cavity, chest cavity, <b>head</b> <b>cavity,</b> high position resonance” pointed out by the abstract general auditory organs, but also to visually see the visual form and specific numerical values. This method of analysis is specific, intuitive, and accurate [15]. In addition, the graphics and data provided by the computer can not only objectively reflect the characteristics of pitch, sound intensity, etc., but also assist the auditory to further analyze the timbre, resonance, and other factors of sound of singing.|$|E

The experiments reported on here are {{a continuation of the}} Integral Effects Testing (IET) DCH program. The experiments incorporated a 1 / 40 scale model of the Zion Nuclear Power Plant containment structures. The model included representations of the primary system volume, RPV lower <b>head,</b> <b>cavity</b> and instrument tunnel, and the lower containment structures. The experiments were steam driven. Iron-alumina thermite with chromium was used as a core melt stimulant in the earlier IET experiments. These earlier IET experiments at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) provided useful data on the effect of scale on DCH phenomena; however, a significant question concerns the potential experiment distortions introduced by the use of non-prototypic iron/alumina thermite. Therefore, further testing with prototypic materials has been carried out at ANL. Three tests have been completed, DCH-U 1 A, U 1 B and U 2. DCH-U 1 A and U 1 B employed an inerted containment atmosphere and are counterpart to the IET- 1 RR test with iron/alumina thermite. DCH-U 2 employed nominally the same atmosphere composition of its counterpart iron/alumina test, IET- 6. All tests, with prototypic material, have produced lower peak containment pressure rises; 45, 111 and 185 kPa in U 1 A, U 1 B and U 2, compared to 150 and 250 kPa IET- 1 RR and 6.

40|$|Synopsis Whether {{or not the}} {{vertebrate}} head {{is fundamentally}} segmented has been controversial for over 150 years. Beginning in the late 19 th century, segmentalist theories proposed that the vertebrate head evolved from an amphioxus-like ancestor in which mesodermal somites extended {{the full length of}} the body with remnants of segmentation persisting as the mesodermal <b>head</b> <b>cavities</b> of sharks and lampreys. Antisegmentalists generally argued either that the vertebrate ancestors never had any mesodermal segmentation anteriorly or that they lost it before the origin of the vertebrates; in either case, the earliest vertebrates had an unsegmented head and the embryonic cranial mesoderm of vertebrates is at best pseudo-segmented, evolving independently of any pre-vertebrate segmental pattern. Recent morphologic studies have generally confirmed the accuracy of the major classical studies of head development in lampreys and sharks, yet disagree with their theoretical conclusions regarding the evolution of head segmentation. Studies of developmental genes in amphioxus and vertebrates, which have demonstrated conservation of the mechanisms of anterior–posterior patterning in the two groups, have shed new light on this controversy. Most pertinently, some homologs of genes expressed in the anterior amphioxus somites, which form as outpocketings of the gut, are also expressed in the walls of the <b>head</b> <b>cavities</b> of lampreys, which form similarly, and in their major derivatives (the velar muscles) {{as well as in the}} eye and jaw muscles of bony gnathostomes, which derive from unsegmented head mesoderm. These muscles share gene expression with the corresponding muscles of the shark, which derive from the walls of <b>head</b> <b>cavities</b> that form, not as outpocketings o...|$|R

25|$|In its {{physical}} aspect, singing has a well-defined technique {{that depends on}} the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or bellows; on the larynx, which acts as a reed or vibrator; on the chest and <b>head</b> <b>cavities,</b> which have the function of an amplifier, as the tube in a wind instrument; and on the tongue, which together with the palate, teeth, and lips articulate and impose consonants and vowels on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a vocal technique and are made to interact upon one another. During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the diaphragm while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the abdominal, internal intercostal and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of external intercostals, scalenes, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The pitch is altered with the vocal cords. With the lips closed, this is called humming.|$|R

40|$|Because of its basal {{position}} on the phylogenetic tree of vertebrates, the lamprey embryo {{would be expected to}} exhibit segmental head mesoderm. Recent observations, however, show that the lamprey does not have any somite-like segments in the <b>head.</b> Coelomic <b>head</b> <b>cavities</b> that are most conspicuous in elasmobranch embryos, do not appear to represent universal vertebrate traits. From the perspective of generative constraint, segmental structures in the vertebrate body can be classified into primary segments, which arise as segmental embryonic primordia such as somites and pharyngeal pouches, and secondary segments whose patterns are determined by the presence of primary segments. Secondary segments include neural crest derivatives and epibranchial placodes that are not initially segmented. The head mesoderm of vertebrates is secondarily regionalized into several domains that do not impose any secondary segmental patterns on other structures. Thus, the vertebrate head is characterized by a lack of segmental generative constraint in its mesoderm. Classical segmental theories are now refuted because they attempted to equate the vertebrate head with that of the amphioxus, whose rostral somites are considered primary segments, which are absent from vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|The prechordal {{plate is}} {{generally}} {{described as a}} population of axial mesendodermal cells that is formed during early embryonic development, in the rostral- most area of the vertebrate head. The population of the prechordal plate cells is specific for vertebrate, and evolution of the vertebrate head {{was one of the}} key steps during vertebrate evolution. During vertebrate embryogenesis, the prechordal plate cells are pushed by the growth of the forebrain, until only some small population remains in front of the notochord, which later differentiate into mesodermal cells. The precise morphogenesis of this prechordal mesoderm, differs across vertebrates, but in most vertebrates produces a pair of <b>head</b> <b>cavities,</b> which are called premandibular. Within the organogenesis of vertebrates, extrinsic eye muscles are formed from these mesodermal cells and cavities. The prechordal plate, however is also referred to as one of the important centers that control the formation of the vertebrate head during early embryogenesis, since its removal or inhibition of important signals caused various disorders and embryonic dead. This thesis aims to summarize the information on the formation and function of the prechordal plate cells during vertebrate embryogenesis.
