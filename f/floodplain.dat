40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of Amazonian <b>floodplains</b> on the hydrological, sedimentary, and biogeochemical river budget was investigated along the Vargem Grande–Óbidos reach, by applying six mixing models based on variable regional and/or variable hydrological sources. By comparing {{the output of}} many different models designed for different purposes, the nature and the magnitude of processes linking water and biogeochemical budgets of the Amazonian <b>floodplains</b> were clarified. This study reveals {{that most of the}} chemical baseline of the Amazon River basin is acquired before the studied 2000 -km Amazonian reach. However, the tight connection between the hydrograph stage of the river and the chemical signals provides insightful information on the dynamics of its <b>floodplains.</b> The chemical expression of biotic and abiotic processes occurring in the Amazonian <b>floodplains</b> can be particularly perceived during falling waters. It appears delayed in time compared to the maximum extension of submerged area, because the alternating water circulation polarity (filling versus emptying) between the main channel and the adjacent <b>floodplains</b> determines delayed emptying of <b>floodplains</b> during falling waters. It results also in a longer time of residence in the hydrograph network, which strengthens the rate of transformation of transiting materials and solutes. Biotic and biologically mediated processes tend to accentuate changes in river water chemistry initiated upstream, in each subbasin, along river corridors, indicating that processes operating downstream prolong those from upstream (e. g., <b>floodplains</b> of the large tributaries). Conversely, the flood wave propagation tends to lessen the seasonal variability {{as a result of the}} water storage in the <b>floodplains,</b> which admixes waters of distinct origins (in time and space). The morphology of <b>floodplains,</b> determining the deposition and the diagenesis of the sediments as well as the variable extension of submerged areas or the chronology of <b>floodplains</b> storage/emptying, appears to be the main factor controlling the <b>floodplains</b> biogeodynamics. By coupling classical end-member mixing models (providing insight on hydrological source) with a variable regional contribution scheme, relevant information on the biogeochemical budget of the Amazonian <b>floodplains</b> can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple unsteady flow model was proposed which estimates velocities, friction factors and {{the components of}} discharge in the main channel and on the <b>floodplains</b> simultaneously. Bottom roughness of the main channel and the <b>floodplains,</b> the flow resistance of vegetation on the <b>floodplains</b> and the flow resistance caused by the momentum transfer between the main channel and the <b>floodplains</b> {{were included in the}} model using Nuding’s method. A pre-processing program was developed to convert topographic field data that can be derived from a digital terrain model into cross-sectional input data of the flow model. The model was applied to a 28 -km reach on the Upper Rhine for three steady flow cases and for two unsteady flood event cases to investigate resistance effects of partly vegetated <b>floodplains.</b> Computed discharges and water levels correlated well with the measured data. It was found that a significant component of discharge was transported by the <b>floodplains</b> in some cross-sections during high flows. 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved <b>floodplain.</b> Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet <b>floodplain.</b> All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area, which is a cause of road congestion there.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the relationship between street patterns and <b>floodplains.</b> Although some researchers have written {{about the relationship between}} land use and <b>floodplains</b> in The Woodlands, few have discussed how the city form was designed around the hydrological system. This thesis will focus on one aspect of the city form, the street pattern, to determine the effectiveness of street designs' response to <b>floodplains.</b> Unlike the grid-like pattern advocated by the New Urbanists, street patterns in The Woodlands are loops and cul-de-sacs [...] a typical suburban pattern {{at the time it was}} developed; however, street patterns adapt to the boundaries of <b>floodplains</b> and protect them very well. Using a GIS tool to overlay 100 -year <b>floodplains</b> on the street layer, it is clear to see that there are low percentages of streets in the 100 -year <b>floodplains.</b> Thus, The Woodlands employed nonstructural techniques to mitigate flood hazard, which minimize the development in <b>floodplains.</b> Flood control in The Woodlands is much better than other places in the Houston area. From flood control and the protection of the natural environment standpoints, the nonstructural techniques are advocated more than structural techniques for <b>floodplains</b> in the development management. Therefore, the design of street patterns in an area is determined by both the aim of convenient transportation and the aim of hazard mitigation...|$|R

5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained <b>floodplain,</b> around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated {{between high and low}} water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the <b>floodplain,</b> which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to map, classify and evaluate abandoned areas which are in the southern part of Černokostelecko. It begins with an examination of theories relating to abandoned land and landscape change. The study of abandoned land is rarely included in scientific studies. In the next part, applied part, were mapped coverage of wood species, former use, dominant plants and lenght of abandonment. The abandoned areas were classified and distributed according to their character. It was focused on <b>floodplains</b> of Jevanský and Vlkančický stream. It was found out that high proportion of abandoned areas are situated in <b>floodplains.</b> Most of these areas were formerly in use as pastures or meadows. The lenght of abandonment differs, but the majority date from after 1990, co-inciding with the instance of great economic and political change. Abandoned areas in <b>floodplains</b> has relatively low coverage of the wood species, whereas in areas outside <b>floodplains,</b> coverage of the wood species is considerably higher and it is probable that areas areas outside of <b>floodplains</b> will in future, be covered by forest.
