25|$|American <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> with Algeria, {{the other}} major Barbary Coast State, was much less {{productive}} than with Morocco. Algeria began piracy against the U.S. on 25 July 1785 with the capture of the schooner Maria, and Dauphin a week later. All four Barbary Coast states demanded $660,000 each. However, the envoys were given only an allocated budget of $40,000 to achieve peace. Diplomatic talks to reach a reasonable sum for tribute or for the ransom of the captured sailors struggled to make any headway. The crews of Maria and Dauphin remained enslaved for over a decade, and soon were joined by crews of other ships captured by the Barbary States.|$|E
25|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the Nazi takeover in Germany, the Vatican was taking <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> to attempt to defend the Jews of Germany. In the spring of 1933, Pope Pius XI urged Mussolini to ask Hitler to restrain the anti-Semitic actions taking place in Germany. Mussolini urged Pius to excommunicate Hitler, as he thought it would render him less powerful in Catholic Austria and reduce the danger to Italy and wider Europe. The Vatican refused to comply and thereafter Mussolini began to work with Hitler, adopting his anti-Semitic and race theories. In 1936, with the Church in Germany facing clear persecution, Italy and Germany agreed to the Berlin-Rome Axis.|$|E

25|$|When none of {{the main}} {{candidates}} gained a majority, the National Congress of Bolivia appointed former MNRA head Walter Guevara Arze as interim president on August 8, 1979. This first civilian regime since the brief term of Luís Adolfo Siles Salinas in 1969 was overthrown, however, by a bloody coup under Colonel Alberto Natusch Busch in November. When Natusch stepped down after two weeks because of intense civilian opposition and only limited military support, as well as United States <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> to prevent recognition of the Natusch government, another interim president was appointed. Lidia Gueiler Tejada (1979–80), head of the Chamber of Deputies and a veteran MNR politician, {{became the first woman}} president of Bolivia. In 1980 Gueiler presided over elections in which the parties of the left gained a clear majority of the vote.

Then, a selection of manifestations of diplomacy in sport have been presented, as a result of which types of sport-related actions typically referred to as diplomatic have been outlined. These include: promoting the fulfillment of foreign policy objectives through sport (e. g. establishing contacts in the field of sport in order to develop a closer relationship with a given country or to manifest a boycott), building a country’s positive image and international prestige (with the use of sport-related contacts, victories in sport, organisation of sport events, and, sometimes, participation in sport), and undertaking <b>diplomatic</b> <b>actions</b> by bodies from the sport sector. The thesis has also been formulated that the efficiency of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>actions</b> in sport usually depends on specific circumstances in which they were performed...|$|R
2500|$|On 26 September 2006, a {{candidate}} for the Labour Party, Erdinç Saçan, was removed by his party, because he would not hold to the party stance that the Armenian Genocide was caused by the Young Turks.

Both parties agreed that all their members should openly conform to the party's point of view on this sensitive human rights issue. The sensitivity over these issues was underlined when the speaker of the Turkish parliament, Bülent Arınç, in response threatened the Netherlands with <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> over this incident.

2500|$|Ribbentrop {{played a}} key role in the {{conclusion}} of a Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in 1939, and in the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> surrounding the attack on Poland. In public, Ribbentrop expressed great fury at the Polish refusal to allow for Danzig's return to the Reich, or to grant Polish permission for the [...] "extra-territorial" [...] highways, but since these matters were only intended after March 1939 to be a pretext for German aggression, Ribbentrop always refused in private to allow for any talks between German and Polish diplomats about these matters. It was Ribbentrop's fear that if German–Polish talks did take place, there was the danger that the Poles might back down and agree to the German demands as the Czechoslovaks had done in 1938 under Anglo-French pressure, and thereby deprive the Germans of their excuse for aggression. To further block German–Polish diplomatic talks, Ribbentrop had the German Ambassador to Poland, Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, recalled, and refused to see the Polish Ambassador, Józef Lipski. On 25 May 1939, Ribbentrop sent a secret message to Moscow to tell the Soviet Foreign Commissar, Vyacheslav Molotov, that if Germany attacked Poland [...] "Russia's special interests would be taken into consideration".|$|E
2500|$|Starting 23 July, all of Germany's leaders {{returned}} secretly to Berlin to {{deal with}} the crisis they had in large part initiated. A division emerged at various meetings of the Reich’s leadership between those led by the chancellor who wanted {{to see what would happen}} following an Austrian attack on Serbia, and the military led by Moltke and Falkenhayn, who urged that Germany immediately follow up an Austrian attack on Serbia with a German attack on Russia. Moltke repeatedly stated that 1914 would be the best time for starting a [...] "preventive war" [...] from the German point of view, or the Russian Great Military Programme would finish by 1917, making Germany unable to ever again risk a war. Moltke added that Russian mobilization was regarded as an opportunity to be sought rather than as a sort of threat, as it would allow Germany to go to war while presenting it as forced on Germany. The German military attaché in Russia reported that Russian preparations for mobilization were on a much smaller scale than was expected. Though Moltke at first argued that Germany should wait for Russia to mobilize before beginning the [...] "preventive war", by the end of the week he urged that Germany should launch it anyway. In Moltke's view, in order to invade France successfully, Germany would need to seize the Belgian fortress of Liège by surprise. The longer the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> continued, the less likely Moltke thought that Liège could be stormed by surprise, and if Liège were not taken, then the entire Schlieffen Plan would be unhinged.|$|E

2500|$|Starting 7 July, the German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Tschirschky, and the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Berchtold held {{almost daily}} {{meetings}} {{about how to}} co-ordinate the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> to justify a war against Serbia. On 8 July, Tschirschky presented Berchtold with a message from Wilhelm who declared he [...] "stated most emphatically that Berlin expected the Monarchy to act against Serbia, and that Germany would not understand it, if... the present opportunity were allowed to go by... without a blow struck". At the same meeting, Tschirschky told Berchtold, [...] "if we [...] compromised or bargained with Serbia, Germany would interpret this as a confession of weakness, {{which could not be}} without effect on our position in the Triple Alliance and on Germany's future policy". On 7 July, Bethmann Hollweg told his aide and close friend Kurt Riezler that [...] "action against Serbia can lead to a world war". Bethmann Hollweg felt such a [...] "leap in the dark" [...] was justified by the international situation. Bethmann Hollweg told Riezler that Germany was [...] "completely paralysed" [...] and that the [...] "future belongs to Russia which is growing and growing, and is becoming an ever increasing nightmare to us". Riezler went to write in his diary that Bethmann Hollweg painted a [...] "devastating picture" [...] with Russia building rail-roads in Congress Poland that allow Russia to mobilize faster once the Great Military Programme was finished in 1917, and that an Austro-Serbian war would probably cause a world war, [...] "which would lead to an overthrow of the existing order", but since the [...] "existing order was lifeless and void of ideas", such a war could only be welcomed as a blessing to Germany. Bethmann Hollweg's fears about Russia led him to credit Anglo-Russian naval talks in May 1914 as the beginning of an [...] "encirclement" [...] policy against Germany that could only be broken through war. After Anglo-French naval talks had taken place, the Russians demanded the same courtesy be extended to them, which led to inconclusive Anglo-Russian naval talks.|$|E

I am afraid of our wasting that which we at present derive from moral causes, by laying down general principles when nobody will attend to them, and when in all probability they will be disregarded. My objection to doing at present what you propose is, that it is impossible according to my views to do so without being considered to throw our weight into the French scale against Germany, with consequent encouragement on one side and irritation on the other.” ...|$|E

Although the demands constituted a grave menace to our trade, although the Far East was in an uproar about them, although America took drastic <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> against them, Mr. Lloyd George never heard of them until they were explained to him by the Chinese Delegation at Versailles.[64] He had no time to find out what Japan wanted, but had time to conclude a secret agreement with Japan in February 1917, promising that whatever Japan wanted in Shantung we would support at the Peace Conference.[65] By the terms of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan was bound to communicate the Twenty-one Demands to the British Government. In fact, Japan communicated the first four groups, but not the fifth and worst, thus definitely breaking the treaty;[66] but this also, one must suppose, Mr. Lloyd George only discovered by chance when he got to Versailles.|$|E

60|$|The Turks {{were driving}} at war whilst we were labouring for peace, and both by <b>diplomatic</b> <b>action</b> and by sending the fleet to protect Turkish {{territory}} against Russian attack, we had become auxiliaries {{and turned the}} weaker of the two contending powers into the stronger. A few months afterwards Mr. Gladstone found a classic parallel for the Turkish alliance. 'When Aeneas escaped from the flames of Troy he had an ally. That ally was his father Anchises, and the part which Aeneas performed in the alliance was to carry his ally upon his back.' But the discovery came too late, nor was the Turk the only ally. Against the remonstrances of our ambassador the Sultan declared war upon Russia, and proceeded to acts of war, well knowing that England and France in what they believed to be interests of their own would see him through it. If the Sultan and his ulemas and his pashas were one intractable factor, the French Emperor was another. 'We have just as much to apprehend,' Graham wrote (Oct. 27), 'from the active intervention of our ally as from the open hostility of our enemy.' Behind the decorous curtain of European concert Napoleon III. was busily weaving scheme after scheme of his own to fix his unsteady diadem upon his brow, to plant his dynasty among the great thrones of western Europe, and to pay off some old scores of personal indignity put upon him by the Czar.|$|E
