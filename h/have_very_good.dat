5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E

25|$|The {{correlation}} between Doppler-detected intravascular bubbles and decompression sickness is {{that almost all}} divers who developed DCS after a dive produced large numbers of bubbles, but even grade 3 or 4 bubbles could manifest without signs or symptoms of DCS, and grades 0, 1 and 2 bubbles are associated with very low risk. In {{a series of tests}} by Sawatsky, Grade 3 bubbles were associated with a 5% risk and Grade 4 with about 10% risk. Bubbles may occur after exposures that <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> safety records. The utility of bubble detection is in assessing relative decompression stress. The value of bubble detection in non-symptomatic divers, is that this {{can be used as a}} safer threshold for assessing acceptable decompression stress than the incidence of clinical symptoms for evaluating decompression algorithms.|$|E

25|$|Wisconsin {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball. The Badgers put {{together}} a nice 11–play drive that would end with Wisconsin striking first with a 4-yard touchdown run by RB James White. The next two drives (one by each team) would all result in three–and–outs. The Badgers would get the ball back after an interception by quarterback turned safety Tanner McEvoy. BYU would take over after a catch and fumble by WR Kenzel Doe. BYU then put together their own nice 13–play drive but {{they would have to}} settle for a field goal. A Wisconsin three–and–out would give the ball back to BYU and the first quarter came to a close with Wisconsin leading 7–3. The Cougars would get the ball to the Badgers 32-yard line but they would put the ball rather than attempt a long field goal into the wind. Two plays later, the Badgers would again turn the ball over after an interception by QB Joel Stave. The Couguars would <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> field possession after the interception at their own 40-yard line but the Badgers defense would force a punt. Wisconsin would get down to the BYU 20-yard line but stalled there and settle for a 38-yard field goal by K Jack Russell, the first field goal of his career. The Badgers defense forced BYU to a three–and–out and Wisconsin would score just before halftime on a 5-yard touchdown pass to James White from Joel Stave. Wisconsin led 17–3 at the half.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} median eyes (AME) <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> vision. This {{pair of eyes}} {{is built}} like a telescopic tube with a corneal lens {{in the front and}} a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of up to tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the ultraviolet range. As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have evolved a method called image defocus instead. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the first two closest to the surface contain ultraviolet-sensitive pigments while the two deepest contain green-sensitive pigments. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of defocus from the fuzzy layer, it is possible to calculate the distance to the objects in front of them. In addition to receptor cells, also red filters have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. It seems that all salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (for example, Cosmophasis umbratica) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling (Lim & Li, 2005). Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.|$|E

500|$|In 1971, Brown {{sold his}} {{interest}} in KFC to Heublein for $284 million (. Using some of the profits from the KFC sale, Brown and some associates bought the Miami-based Lum's chain of restaurants from its founders, Stuart and Clifford S Perlman, for $4 million. Of the 340-outlet beer-and-hot-dog chain, Brown said [...] "they did not <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> food. I figured that upgrading {{it would be my}} first task." [...] Accordingly, he hired a group of young executives to find [...] "the perfect hamburger". A month later, he hired Ollie Gleichenhaus, owner of a hamburger restaurant in Miami Beach, Florida, to train Lum's staff to create his hamburgers. He later started a chain of drive-through restaurants called Ollie's Trolley, named for Gleichenhaus, but the franchise failed. Lions Club International at Tampa, Florida, honored Brown with its Service to America Award in 1974. Brown sold the Lum's chain for $9.5 million to Friedrich Jahn's Wienerwald holding group in 1978. A few years later, Brown launched John Y's Chicken, a venture which also subsequently failed.|$|E

500|$|The hunting {{tactics of}} Portia are {{versatile}} and adaptable. All members of Portia have instinctive hunting tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and}} error against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. There are differences in the hunting tactics of the regional populations of P. fimbriata. Those in Australia's Northern Territory are poor at hunting jumping spiders and better against non-salticid web-building spiders and against insects. The Sri Lanka variant is fair against other jumping spiders, and good against web spiders and insects. P. fimbriata in Queensland is an outstanding predator of other jumping spiders and of web spiders, but poor against insects. The Queensland variant use a unique [...] "cryptic stalking" [...] technique which prevents most jumping spider prey from identifying this P. fimbriata as a predator, or even as an animal at all. Some jumping spider prey have partial defences against the cryptic stalking technique. All types of prey spiders occasionally counter-attack, but all Portia species <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> defences, starting with especially tough skin.|$|E

2500|$|Crocodiles <b>have</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> night vision, and {{are mostly}} nocturnal hunters. They use the {{disadvantage}} of most prey animals' poor nocturnal vision to their advantage. The light receptors in crocodilians’ eyes include cones and numerous rods, so it is assumed all crocodilians can see colours. Crocodiles have vertical-slit shaped pupils, {{similar to those of}} domestic cats. One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil, helping to protect the eyes during daylight. On the rear wall of the eye is a tapetum lucidum, which reflects incoming light back onto the retina, thus utilizing the small amount of light available at night to best advantage. In addition to the protection of the upper and lower eyelids, crocodiles have a nictitating membrane (sometimes called a [...] "third eye-lid") that can be drawn over the eye from the inner corner while the lids are open. The eyeball surface is thus protected under the water while a certain degree of vision is still possible.|$|E
