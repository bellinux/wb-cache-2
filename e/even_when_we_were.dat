500|$|Arsenal {{exited the}} {{competition}} in the semi-finals against Middlesbrough. At Highbury, the setting for the first leg, Juninho scored the only goal of the tie. Arsenal's task of progressing was made more difficult after Keown was sent off in the second leg and Boudewijn Zenden doubled Middlesbrough's aggregate scoreline. Though Edu equalised for Arsenal on the night, Reyes' own goal earnt Middlesbrough the win. Wenger opined of the result: [...] "I don't think we deserved to lose; <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> down to 10 men we were running the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Don Everly {{claimed in}} a 2014 {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times that {{he had given up}} smoking in the late 1960s and that Phil had stopped too but started again during their breakup and had continued until 2001. Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of black lung disease. He admitted that he had lived [...] "a very difficult life" [...] with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something which was mainly attributed to [...] "their vastly different views on politics and life," [...] with the music being the one thing they shared closely, saying, [...] "it's almost like we could read each other's minds when we sang." [...] However, Don also stated he had not gotten over Phil's death, saying, [...] "I always thought about him every day, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he's gone." [...] Don added that he always firmly believed he would die before his brother, because he was older than Phil. In a 2016 interview Don said he was still coping with the loss of Phil and that he had kept some of his brother's ashes in his home. He added that he would pick up the ashes every morning and say [...] "good morning," [...] while admitting that it was a peculiar ritual.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} of being a woman. Little speeches that are sheer coquetry when you analyze them, come to our lips and escape <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> most anxious to be straightforward." ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{alone in}} my chamber where none could hear us, I told Kari that Quilla was promised in {{marriage}} to a prince who would be Inca of all the land.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mind the}} sleeping, father, but the waking {{is not so}} pleasant. However, I shall soon get {{accustomed}} to it, I suppose. But I always did hate {{getting up in the}} dark, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going out fishing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{came out}} with that text of Scripture which had been so {{efficient}} with {{the crew of the}} Little Sally: [...] "For <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> with you this we commanded you, that if any would not work neither should he eat." ...|$|E

[p.203] extricating {{a box of}} provisions: {{the labour}} was {{rendered}} lighter {{by the absence of}} the Maghrabis, some of whom were wandering about the beach, whilst others had gone off to fill their bags with fresh water. We found their surliness insufferable; <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> passing from poop to forecastle, landing or boarding, they grumbled forth their dissatisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{a charming}} song, Archibald, that you {{commenced}} last <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{interrupted by the}} party that brought in the peddler," [...] he said. [...] "The allusion to Galen was much to the purpose." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{an example}} of how utterly {{oblivious}} a pair of towers can be to their work, George told us, later on in the <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> discussing the subject after supper, of a very curious instance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Barbara and I {{got used}} to taking {{a cup of coffee}} in the <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in England," [...] she said. [...] "Talking of the Old Country {{reminded}} me of it. Will you pour it out, Barbara?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{eyes were}} on Laura's face while the message was being delivered. I had found her unaccountably quiet and {{composed}} on going into her room in the morning, and so she remained all through breakfast. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting together on the sofa in her room, waiting for Sir Percival, she still preserved her self-control.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, {{and ever}} since Shrewsbury," [...] pursued Carton, [...] "you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always nowhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had, as I have said, a {{twin brother}} named Ernest, whose {{resemblance}} {{to me was}} so great that <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> together people could see no difference between us. Down to the smallest detail we were exactly the same. As we grew older this likeness became less marked because our expression was not the same, but with our features in repose the points of difference were very slight.|$|E
5000|$|Joy is also {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} {{the most difficult to}} cultivate of the four immeasurables (brahmavihārā: also [...] "four sublime attitudes"). To show joy is to celebrate happiness and achievement in others <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> facing tragedy ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am glad of that. I {{shall be}} always glad to think so, Walter. Do you {{recollect}} that a {{thought of this}} change seemed to come into our minds {{at the same time}} that <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> talking together?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will tell}} you about it some day, Jacob; it is too long to go into now. You remind me of it some <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at a lonely inn, with nothing to do. How do you get on at night?' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{took our}} leave early, and left together. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> groping among Mr. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I {{felt that the}} right twin {{was on his way}} back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had {{evaporated}} into the evening air.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed much}} {{as if the}} Indians had no care {{as to whether they}} were being followed, for, instead of sending back scouts along the trail, as Brant almost always did, the party {{remained}} in a body, and <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> so close on them as to lie down within view of their camp-fires at night, we never saw one of the painted villains who appeared curious to know if any person was in the rear.|$|E
6000|$|I don't {{know what}} devil {{prompted}} me, for I seldom spoke to him, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> told off on duty together; but I said at last, after a moment's pause, [...] "If you are engaged to be married, as I suppose {{you are from}} what you say, I wonder you could bear to come away on such a long business as this, when you couldn't get a word or {{a letter from the}} lady you're engaged to for a whole winter." ...|$|E
60|$|A LONG, lonely journey, {{with sadness}} in the heart; {{away from the}} {{familiar}} to the strange: that is a hard and dreary thing even to the rich, the strong, the instructed; a hard thing, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> called by duty, not urged by dread.|$|R
6000|$|One <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> thus promenading, and I {{was trying}} {{to look like a}} prize St. Bernard, and the old man {{was trying to}} look like he wouldn't have murdered the first organ-grinder he heard play Mendelssohn's wedding-march, I looked up at him and said, in my way: ...|$|R

6000|$|So then, when he saith, [...] "By grace ye are saved," [...] {{it is all}} one {{as if he had}} said, By the goodwill, free mercy, and loving-kindness of God ye are saved; as {{the words}} {{conjoined}} with the text do also further manifest: [...] "But God," [...] saith Paul, [...] "who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ [by grace ye are saved]." ...|$|E
6000|$|Called Christian, {{how many}} times have thy sins laid thee upon a sick-bed, and, to thine and others' thinking, at the very mouth of the grave? yet God said {{concerning}} thee, Let him live, for he is not yet converted.

60|$|Our eldest girl, who is {{very like}} her mother, married John Spatter's eldest son. Our two {{families}} are closely united in other ties of attachment.

6000|$|... "We {{see very}} little of him," [...] Mary Hunter said; [...] "he is always away on horseback all day.

40|$|Indexicals <b>are</b> inevitably autobiographical, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{not talking}} about ourselves. For example, if you hear me say, "That {{portrait}} right there is beautiful, " you can surmise not only that I ascribe beauty to an object of my immediate awareness but also something about my spatial relation to it.

6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have lived}} {{a very quiet}} life, Capitaine Rotherby.

60|$|Exam. 6. Art thou born again?

6000|$|I say, {{this is the}} way to make others be {{affected}} with mercy, as he saith, by the apostle Paul, [...] "But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus; that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness to us-ward (or toward us) through Christ Jesus;" [...] Eph. ii. 4-7.
