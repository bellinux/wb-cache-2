25|$|When Chen Tai was {{retreating}} back to Longxi Commandery, {{he predicted}} that Jiang Wei {{would attempt to}} make use of the mountainous terrain along the way to lay an ambush, so he took a southern detour back to Longxi Commandery. As he expected, Jiang Wei had indeed sent troops to lie in ambush for three days. However, the historian Pei Songzhi pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for Jiang Wei to set up the ambush because he did not know that Wei reinforcements would show up when he was besieging Didao so the ambush would not have served its purpose.|$|E
25|$|With The Rock {{defeating}} Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin {{was set to}} face The Rock at WrestleMania. In {{the weeks}} leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, Debra, being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon, but then relieved of that role after failing to prevent a brawl between Rock and Austin. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Austin faced The Rock for the second time and before the match began it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside, then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time. After the match, Austin celebrated by shaking hands with Mr. McMahon, a man he once considered his nemesis, even sharing a beer with him and turning heel for the first time since 1997. This decision has been highly criticised by many, including Austin himself, as Austin was such a top-level face that many agreed <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to turn him heel.|$|E
500|$|Port Moresby became {{congested}} in September 1942. This {{represented a}} dangerous situation, so procedures were instituted whereby ships would wait at Townsville until called forward. Due {{to lack of}} capacity at Port Moresby, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for ships to travel in convoy, so they sailed to and from Port Moresby individually or in small groups. Convoys to New Guinea did not commence until December 1942. Turnaround time for ships from Townsville to Port Moresby was 11 to 13 days, of which 5 to 7 days was spent awaiting discharge in Port Moresby. Some 125 ship voyages were made to Port Moresby between May and November 1942. During 1942, 3,033 vehicles, 199 guns and [...] of stores were shipped to New Guinea.|$|E

500|$|The 747 {{enjoyed a}} fairly smooth {{introduction}} into service, overcoming concerns that some airports {{would not be}} able to accommodate an aircraft that large. Although technical problems occurred, they were relatively minor and quickly solved. After the aircraft's introduction with Pan Am, other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service. [...] Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft's long range rather than its payload capacity. [...] While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat, this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined. A moderately loaded 747, one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied, used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747. Nonetheless, many flag-carriers purchased the 747 due to its iconic status [...] "even if <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> economically" [...] to operate. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747s at John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{inevitable}} punishment {{of the rebels}} had occurred, the Persians were {{in the mood for}} conciliation. Since these regions were now Persian territory again, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. Artaphernes thus set out to re-establish a workable relationship with his subjects. He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges. Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each city, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size. Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia. The following year, Mardonius, another son-in-law of Darius, would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies. The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair. Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo. [...] Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names. Darius' conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.|$|E

50|$|This leads one {{to believe}} that Plato {{somewhat}} telescoped the happenings of the sixth century.

5000|$|The {{success of}} this {{hedgehog}} defence outside Moscow led Hitler to insist on the holding of territory when <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> military <b>sense,</b> and to sack generals who retreated without orders. Officers with initiative were replaced with yes-men or fanatical Nazis.

2500|$|The English Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, in {{his book}} The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt, observes that Shoshenq III built [...] "a {{dividing}} wall, with a double scene showing Osorkon II" [...] and himself [...] "each adoring an unnamed deity" [...] in the antechamber of Osorkon II's tomb. Dodson concludes that while one may argue Shoshenq III erected the wall to hide Osorkon II's sarcophagus, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for Shoshenq to create such an elaborate relief if Takelot II had really intervened between him and Osorkon II at Tanis for 25 years unless Shoshenq III was Osorkon II's immediate successor. Shoshenq III must, hence, have wished to associate himself with his predecessor [...] Osorkon II. Consequently, the case for establishing Takelot II as a Twenty-second Dynasty king and successor to Osorkon II disappears, as Dodson writes. Takelot II instead founded the 23rd dynasty of Egypt and ruled a divided Egypt by administering Middle and Upper Egypt.|$|E
50|$|Armstrong faced {{accusations of}} doping {{as early as}} the 1999 Tour de France. Specifically, many European papers contended his victory in Stage 9, in which he {{seemingly}} ascended the Alps with almost no difficulty, could not have been possible through natural means. Armstrong adamantly denied this, and the American press generally supported him. Armstrong contended, among other things, that <b>it</b> would have <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> for him to dope since he lived in France for most of the year; France has some of the strictest anti-doping laws in the world.|$|R

2500|$|Congress, {{under the}} control of {{conservative}} Republicans, agreed to the program for multiple reasons. The 20-member conservative isolationist Senate wing of the party, based in the rural Midwest and led by Senator Kenneth S. Wherry (R-Nebraska), was outmaneuvered by the emerging internationalist wing, led by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg (R-Michigan). The opposition argued that it would be [...] "a wasteful 'operation rat-hole'"; that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> to oppose communism by supporting the socialist governments in Western Europe; and that American goods would reach Russia and increase its war potential. Vandenberg, assisted by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (R-Massachusetts) admitted there was no certainty that the plan would succeed, but said it would halt economic chaos, sustain Western civilization, and stop further Soviet expansion. Senator Robert A. Taft (R-Ohio) hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however, it was [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] in [...] "the world battle against communism." [...] In the end, only 17 senators voted against it on March 13, 1948 A bill granting an initial $5 billion passed Congress with strong bipartisan support.

Professor Nahum M. Sarna, formerly of Brandeis University, wrote that the steward's reassuring reply was intelligible only on the assumption that he was privy to Joseph's scheme. [...] His purpose was to lull the brothers into a false sense of relief. Professor Robert Alter of University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the steward dismissed the brothers' fears by introducing a kind of fairy tale explanation for the silver that they found in their bags.

5000|$|Furthermore, Barcelonas {{industrial}} elite wanted Catalonia to stay part of Spain since Catalonias industrial markets {{relied on}} consumption from other Spanish regions which, little by little, started to join {{some sort of}} development.
