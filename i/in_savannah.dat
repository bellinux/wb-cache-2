5|$|Hurricane David made {{landfall}} in Georgia as a quickly weakening minimal hurricane, {{bringing a}} three–five foot (0.9–1.5 m) storm surge and heavy surf. Its inner core remained away from major cities, though Savannah recorded sustained winds of 58 mph (93 km/h) and wind gusts of 68 mph (109 km/h). No major damage occurred <b>in</b> <b>Savannah.</b> High winds downed numerous power lines, leaving many without power {{for up to}} two weeks after the storm. Offshore, strong seas disrupted a portion of the coastal reef by moving a sunken ship 300 feet (90 m). Overall, Hurricane David was responsible for minor damage and two casualties from its heavy surf.|$|E

5|$|In May 1803 a shipload of captive West Africans, upon {{surviving}} the middle passage, were landed by U.S.-paid captors <b>in</b> <b>Savannah</b> by slave ship, to be auctioned off {{at one of}} the local slave markets.

The group of 75 Igbo slaves were bought by agents of John Couper and Thomas Spalding for forced labor on their plantations in St. Simons Island for $100 each.|$|E

In November 1863, Twombly and the Army of the Tennessee marched northeast into Tennessee; his regiment spent the winter of 1863–64 in Pulaski, Tennessee. Twombly went on to participate in the Atlanta Campaign and Sherman's March to the Sea. He was promoted to first lieutenant in July 1864 and to captain in November 1864. While stationed <b>in</b> <b>Savannah,</b> Georgia in January 1865, Twombly was made the assistant inspector general of the Third Brigade of his division.|$|E

5|$|The New Guinean magpie, G. tibicen papuana, is {{a little-known}} {{subspecies}} found in southern New Guinea. The adult male has a mostly white {{back with a}} narrow black stripe, and the female a blackish back; the black feathers here are tipped with white similar to subspecies dorsalis. It has a long deep bill resembling that of subspecies longirostris. Genetically it {{is closely related to}} a western lineage of Australian magpies comprising subspecies dorsalis, longirostris and eylandtensis, suggesting their ancestors occupied <b>in</b> <b>savannah</b> country that was a land bridge between New Guinea and Australia and was submerged around 16,500 years ago.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{crossed over the}} Florida panhandle and southeastern Georgia, the winds {{weakened}} to , although it still produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds <b>in</b> <b>Savannah,</b> Georgia. No severe damage {{was reported in the}} city. The tropical storm continued northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic and paralleling the coastlines of the Carolinas just offshore. Several ships reported strong winds and rough seas. On October6, the storm restrengthened to its peak intensity before becoming an extratropical cyclone about 200mi (320km) southeast of Cape Cod; however, one meteorologist assessed it as acquiring extratropical characteristics after it exited Georgia into the western Atlantic. As an extratropical storm, it reached winds of 80mph (130km/h), based on a ship report south of Atlantic Canada. Late on October7, the storm was last observed to the south of Newfoundland. The storm {{was the only one in}} the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, {{but it is also}} found in quiet, nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests <b>in</b> <b>savannah</b> country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening <b>in</b> <b>savannah</b> and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E
5|$|John McCloskey, {{the manager}} of the minor league {{baseball}} Montgomery Colts of the Class-B Southern League, heard about McGinnity's pitching. McCloskey signed McGinnity, who made his professional debut with the Colts in 1893. McCloskey habitually baited umpires during games, a trait which McGinnity learned. The league folded as a result of financial troubles related to the Panic of 1893. Jimmie Manning, manager of the Southern League franchise <b>in</b> <b>Savannah,</b> Georgia, became manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-A Western League for the 1894 season, and signed McGinnity to pitch for the Blues. Combined for Montgomery and Kansas City, McGinnity had a 21–29 win–loss record, while walking more batters than he could strikeout, and allowing more than a hit per inning pitched. According to a Western League umpire, catcher Tim Donahue tipped McGinnity's pitches to opposing batters due to a personal feud. As McGinnity continued to struggle for Kansas City, he requested his release in June.|$|E

5|$|Rainfall in Georgia {{peaked at}} 8inches (203mm) in Mount Vernon. The {{precipitation}} assisted firefighters in combating wildfires {{in the southern}} portion of the state, which gave thousands of workers a brief respite after they had fought the fires daily for over a month. The rainfall caused some minor flooding, and <b>in</b> <b>Savannah</b> a few minor traffic accidents occurred. Gusty winds blew down trees and power lines, and along the coast, rough surf was reported. Heavy rainfall from the storm spread {{across much of the}} East Coast of the United States. State totals peaked at 6.12inches (155mm) near Hardeeville, South Carolina, 3.73inches (95mm) in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, and 3.75inches (95mm) near Pennington Gap, Virginia. High winds also occurred in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Robin Wright as Jenny Curran: Forrest's {{childhood}} friend {{with whom he}} immediately falls in love, and never stops loving throughout his life. A victim {{of child sexual abuse}} at the hands of her bitterly widowed father, Jenny embarks on a different path from Forrest, leading a self-destructive life and becoming part of the hippie movement in the 1960s and the 1970s/1980s drug culture. She re-enters Forrest's life at various times in adulthood. Jenny eventually becomes a waitress <b>in</b> <b>Savannah,</b> Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest's) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterwards she dies of an unnamed illness, but given the time period, the movie's propensity for showing the major aspects of U.S. culture, and the character's depicted actions during the 60s and 70s, it can be speculated that she died of AIDS or Hepatitis C.|$|E
5|$|The British {{were eager}} {{not to lose}} any useful {{inhabitants}} and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 {{as a result of}} the new British rule and religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities <b>in</b> <b>Savannah,</b> Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina; they added to the commercial development of Mobile. In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.|$|E
