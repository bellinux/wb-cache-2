5|$|Ardhanarishvara is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{attempt to}} syncretise the two {{principal}} Hindu sects, Shaivism and Shaktism, dedicated to Shiva and the Great Goddess. A similar syncretic image is Harihara, a composite form of Shiva and Vishnu, the Supreme deity of the Vaishnava sect.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} those charged with {{involvement}} in the coup occurred {{more than two years}} later in mid-1963. Diệm scheduled the hearing {{in the middle of the}} Buddhist crisis, a move that was <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to deter the populace from further dissent. Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the coup and called before the Special Military Court.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its history}} Goofus and Gallant has been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{effective}} didactic comic. It {{has been used}} in several studies as a stimulus to prompt children to identify kind and unkind actions, and the characters of Goofus and Gallant, as archetypes of badness and goodness, have been referenced in several works by philosophers.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the close}} precincts of the Bijaymandal, a domed {{building}} is seen {{which has a}} unique architectural façade of two openings on each of its three sides, <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> annex to another building (based on underground passages seen in the adjoining structure). However, the purpose for which this dome was built is not known.|$|E
5|$|As {{the statue}} became {{an object of}} a pagan veneration, missionaries and the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, to destroy the statue. In 1661, Lannion ordered the statue to be thrown into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> act of anger by their insulted idol. In 1664, the statue was drawn from the river and restored to its original location.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
50|$|In some settings, {{such as the}} one {{described}} above, a zone diagram can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> certain equilibrium between mutually hostile kingdoms,. In {{a discrete}} setting it can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stable configuration in a certain combinatorial game.|$|R
50|$|The unadorned Dynkin diagram (i.e., {{that with}} only white nodes and no arrows), when <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Satake diagram, {{represents}} the split real {{form of the}} Lie algebra, whereas it represents the compact form when <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Vogan diagram.|$|R

5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5|$|Prices {{of several}} rare-earth {{elements}} increased sharply by mid-2010 as China imposed a 40% export reduction, citing environmental concerns {{as the reason}} for the export restrictions. These quotas have been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to control the supply of rare earths. However, the high prices have provided an incentive to begin or reactivate several rare-earth mining projects around the world, including the United States, Australia, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|Putana is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{infantile}} {{disease or}} bird, symbolizing danger to an infant or desire respectively, {{and even as}} a symbolic bad mother. She is included {{in a group of}} malevolent Hindu mother goddesses called the Matrikas and also in the group of Yoginis and Grahinis (Seizers). Ancient Indian medical texts prescribe her worship to protect children from diseases. A group of multiple Putanas is mentioned in ancient Indian texts.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{the notion}} of a part of speech can be {{somewhat}} complicated in Inuit language. Fully inflected verbs can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> nouns. The word ilisaijuq can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fully inflected verb - [...] "he studies" [...] - but can also be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> noun: [...] "student".|$|R
50|$|In general relativity, a timelike {{congruence}} in a four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{family of}} world lines of certain ideal observers in our spacetime. In particular, a timelike geodesic congruence can be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> family of free-falling test particles.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} international {{reaction was}} extremely critical of Lumumba. Lumumba's attack on colonialism was especially <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attack on Belgium itself and nearly provoked a diplomatic incident {{between the two}} countries. International observers though the speech unwise, ungrateful and tactless. The confrontational attitude taken by Lumumba appeared to confirm Belgian and American suspicions that Lumumba was a dangerous radical. Between September 1960 and January 1961, partly at the instigation of the two countries, Lumumba was deposed from power, arrested and executed with the complicity of both the Congolese and Katangese governments.|$|E
5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition. The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in {{accordance}} with the gesture of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been handed down since 1365. Another interpretation {{is that it is}} a gospel book.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad had a {{distinctive}} Syrian iconography, which is {{clear in the}} seals of the kings that gave prominence to the Syrian gods. Egyptian influence was minimal and limited to the ankh, which cannot be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> emulation of Egyptian rituals but rather as merely {{a substitute for the}} cup held by the deity elsewhere. Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style, which was favored in Mari during the reign of king Zimri-Lim, whose queen Shibtu was the daughter of Yarim-Lim I.|$|E
50|$|The {{statement}} {{generally is}} a descriptive statement identifying {{the beliefs of}} the speaker(s), and thus state a basic assumption, not a logical conclusion. It may also be <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> speech act. Sometimes but not always <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> splitting or a false dilemma, which is an informal fallacy.|$|R

5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 {{of a decision}} on plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} was <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments about homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Following Buckingham’s {{death in}} 1628, {{when it was}} safer to do so, a {{translation}} of a history by Pierre Matthieu was published under the title, The Powerful Favourite, the life of Aelius Sejanus. This was followed in 1634 by another translation, Sir Thomas Hawkins' Politicall Observations upon the Fall of Sejanus, which had originally been titled Della peripetia di fortuna (Of Changes of Fortune) by its author, Giovanni Battista Manzini. Later in the century Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, {{was the target of}} the four-page political pamphlet Sejanus, or The popular favourite, now in his solitude, and sufferings, signed with the pseudonym Timothy Tory (1681). The story of Sejanus, with reference to the Earl's imprisonment in the Tower on a charge of treason, is <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> argument for absolute monarchy, direct rule without the intermediary of politicians.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} flank, ASquadron 2RTR's patrol toward Sidi Azeiz was being {{monitored}} by Panzer Regiment5, but the Germans misidentified the light cruiser tanks as heavily armoured Matilda infantry tanks, {{and reported that}} an attack was not possible. Herff—believing the British had two divisions operating in the area—had grown uneasy. ASquadron's patrol was <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to concentrate south of Sidi Azeiz, {{in preparation for a}} thrust north the next day; such a move threatened to sweep aside Herff's force and completely unhinge the German front in the Sollum–Bardia area. In response, Herff broke contact with the British; his plan was to join up with Cramer's Panzer Regiment8 to mount a concentrated counter-attack the following morning.|$|E

5|$|On the film's {{release in}} 1957, it became Italy's first horror {{film of the}} sound era. It was not {{successful}} in Italy, which Freda <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> audience not interested in horror films made by Italians. The film was released theatrically as The Devil's Commandment and Lust of the Vampire in the United States and United Kingdom respectively. English critics predominantly discuss the film {{in terms of its}} cinematography and place in film history. Despite being the first of the Italian horror films, {{it was not until the}} British film Dracula (1958) and the international hit Black Sunday were released that a greater amount of horror films began being produced in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Several {{buildings}} were constructed {{on the summit}} during the Saxon and early medieval periods; they have been <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> early church and monks' hermitage. The head of a wheel cross dating from the 10th or 11th century has been recovered. The original wooden church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1275, and the stone Church of St Michael built on the site in the 14th century. Its tower remains, {{although it has been}} restored and partially rebuilt several times. Archaeological excavations during the 20th century sought to clarify the background of the monument and church, but some aspects of their history remain unexplained. The Tor is mentioned in Celtic mythology, particularly in myths linked to King Arthur, and has a number of other enduring mythological and spiritual associations.|$|E
5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} <b>interpreted</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> archetypal trickster, {{displaying}} talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, {{but by a}} shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize {{the status quo and}} reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E
