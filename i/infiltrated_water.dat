50|$|Robert E. Horton {{suggested}} that infiltration capacity rapidly declines {{during the early}} part of a storm and then tends towards an approximately constant value after a couple of hours {{for the remainder of the}} event. Previously <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> fills the available storage spaces and reduces the capillary forces drawing water into the pores. Clay particles in the soil may swell as they become wet and thereby reduce the size of the pores. In areas where the ground is not protected by a layer of forest litter, raindrops can detach soil particles from the surface and wash fine particles into surface pores where they can impede the infiltration process.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{infiltration}} can continue {{only if there}} is room available for additional water at the soil surface. The available volume for additional water in the soil depends on the porosity of the soil and {{the rate at which}} previously <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> can move away from the surface through the soil. The maximum rate that water can enter a soil in a given condition is the infiltration capacity. If the arrival of the water at the soil surface is less than the infiltration capacity, it is sometimes analyzed using hydrology transport models, mathematical models that consider infiltration, runoff and channel flow to predict river flow rates and stream water quality.|$|E

These alternatives will be compared by several criteria. The criteria presented in this report, which are in most cases subdivided into sub-criteria are: "public health", "abiotic environment", "nature", "landscape", "land use", "technological feasibility", flexibility", vulnerability", "economy" and "administrative/egal aspects". An important part of the information about groundwater, surface water and <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> related supplies necessary for the application of the weighing method is obtained from three so-called "Base Reports". This last report deals primarily with the groundwater collected for public water supplies, particularly concerning drinking-water propduction. Much information of a highly variable quality is used.

40|$|International audienceInventory of {{unstable}} hillslopes, hydrogeological mapping and hydrochemical {{characteristics of}} natural spring waters {{were used to}} determine the long-term relationships between groundwater and gravitational instabilities in the Upper Tinée Valley (South-East French Alps). Water chemistry and flow records allow to propose a conceptual model of water flow within unstable rocky slopes and to back-calculate the volume of <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> and the flow velocity in the aquifers for different deformation states of the slopes. An increase in infiltrated yield, flow velocity and porosity is observed and linked to collapsed and toppled structures in the upper parts of the hillslopes. In these areas, perched aquifers take place in the reworked media. When a large landslide occurs, it modifies the geometry of the slope and bypasses the perched flows down {{to the foot of the}} slope. With long-term continuous slope deformation, the associated effect between water flows and slope destabilization changes. In the fractured rock, the coupled effect corresponds to rising water pressures with limited volumes of infiltrated water; in the more fractured and permeable collapsed and toppled areas, the volumes of <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> increase with a lower variation of water pressures...|$|E

Two MAR sites were constructed by Karlskrona municipality on Johannishus Esker in Sweden. One of these sites, Vång, was monitored for electrical conductivity and electrical resistivity (using electrical resistivity tomography - ERT) during a 9 -week tracer infiltration test. The aim of the monitoring was to map the pathways of the <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water,</b> with the overall goal to increase the efficiency of the MAR. ERT proved useful in determining both the nature of the esker formation and the water migration pathways. In Vång, the esker ridge follows a tectonically controlled paleovalley.

During the tracer test, the <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> was detected in the area close to the infiltration ponds, whereas far-situated observation wells were less affected. For sequential infiltration and recharge periods in MAR, the timing of the well pumping is another important factor.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{laboratory}} investigation of transport layer using drainage cell system {{are presented in}} this paper. The drainage cell was sandwiched between grade V and grade VI residual soil in a two-dimensional laboratory slope model. Coarse particles of gravel were compacted inside the holes of the drainage cell to facilitate capillary break development and modify hydraulic properties between the soil layers. The grades V and VI residual soils were compacted in the slope model to their dry densities. The whole set up was subjected to three rainfall patterns of 1. 0586 x 10 - 5 m/s, 1. 2014 x 10 - 6 m/s and 3. 7337 x 10 - 7 m/s for 2 hour, 24 hour and 7 day, respectively.

30|$|Underground rivers have an up to 30  % lower {{mineralization}} (EC), on average, {{compared to}} wells indicating a shorter residence time and/or {{a higher proportion}} of quickly <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> especially after precipitation events. This explains the slightly lower Ca and HCO 3 concentration in most of the investigated underground rivers during the pronounced rainy season in 2012 in contrast to the dry season hydrochemistry. Enhanced Al and Fe concentrations in some subsurface rivers (Golek, Toto, Sodong Dedapayu) are probably the result of substantial surface water input (Table  1). In Sodong Dedapayu, a strong runoff from the fields was visually observable during sampling which also caused a considerable decline of most element concentrations due to dilution, and negative calcite saturation. In Toto River, however, all other parameters apart from Al and Fe remain similar compared to dry season. As a consequence, not dilution by <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> but rather resuspension of previously deposited intrakarstic sediment is probably the dominating process causing the Al and Fe increase.|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{groundwater}} recharge (AGR) and bank filtration (BF) are old, widely applied methods to produce drinking water by the infiltration of surface water through soil. These methods are increasingly used {{because they are}} considered to offer a relatively inexpensive and sustainable way to increase the water quality by physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the primary goals of AGR and BF is the removal of natural organic matter (NOM) that has several indirect adverse effects. Pollutants possibly existing in aquatic environments may pose a risk of aquifer contamination and have harmful effects for human health. Biodegradation has {{an important role in}} sustainable removal of NOM and pollutants in AGR and BF. However, the mechanisms affecting the natural removal processes are still poorly understood, and therefore more knowledge of underlying biogeochemical processes is needed. A research project TEVA (Improving artificial {{groundwater recharge}} by the development of on-line monitoring and control) was established to improve the understanding of the removal mechanisms of NOM during AGR and to enhance the AGR process control by on-line monitoring. As a part of the TEVA-project, the aim of this thesis was to study the effects of surface water infiltration on a pristine aquifer by monitoring physico-chemical water and bacterial community changes in Virttaankangas AGR site, southwest Finland, during experimental river water infiltration. In addition, the feasibility of biofilm collector slides for aquifer biofilm sampling was evaluated. The progress of <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> in the aquifer was evident from increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Compared to the initial <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> concentration, DOC removal was observed along the soil passage. However, no preferential removal of any molecular fraction of DOC could be demonstrated. Due to infiltration, the native groundwater bacterial community profile changed significantly towards the community composition of <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water.</b> Attached bacterial community composition was not strongly influenced by water infiltration. Leucine incorporation method confirmed bacterial activity in the subsurface, whilst the RNA-based community analysis indicated that only a minor part of the attached and unattached communities were responsible for the activity in the aquifer.

However, the biofilm collectors accumulated dominating soil bacterial groups and therefore the collectors reliably collected the dominant soil bacteria...|$|E
