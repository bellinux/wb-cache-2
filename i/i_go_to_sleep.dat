2500|$|In 2014, Kidman {{starred in}} the biopic, Grace of Monaco {{in the title role}} that chronicles the 1962 crisis, in which Charles de Gaulle {{blockaded}} the tiny principality, angered by Monaco's status as a tax haven for wealthy French subjects and Kelly's contemplating a Hollywood return to star in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie. Opening out of competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, the film received largely negative reviews. Kidman also starred in two films with Colin Firth, the first, the British-Australian historical drama, The Railway Man in which Kidman played officer's wife Patti Lomax received positive critical reviews. Katherine Monk of the Montreal Gazette said of Kidman's performance, [...] "It's a truly masterful piece of acting that transcends Teplitzky's store-bought framing, but it's Kidman who delivers the biggest surprise: For the first time since her eyebrows turned into solid marble arches, the Australian Oscar winner is truly terrific". The second, the British thriller film Before <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> <b>Sleep</b> drew positive critical response of Kidman's performance, as Christine Lucas, a car crash survivor with brain damage. Kidman also appeared in the family film Paddington (2014) as a villain.|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{is like a}} room in a fairies' palace!" [...] exclaimed Grace. [...] "I {{know when}} <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> I'll dream of fairies and rainbows, and pots of gold--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> I'll have to {{shut my eyes}}," [...] he explained; [...] "and if I shut my eyes {{they may}} grow together, and then I'd be blind for life!" ...|$|E
60|$|After {{my dream}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> again, till <b>I</b> was finally aroused {{by a strong}} ray of light hitting me {{straight}} in the eye.|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{reflecting}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{worn out}} with useless wonderment, {{and did not}} wake again till breakfast time. That morning, when we were alone together, Ragnall said to me: ...|$|R

I blame him for hittin' so hard when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> but I s'pose he's right about my eatin'. You see," [...] and here his tone grew both confidential and mournful, [...] "I am an awful eater, an' I can't seem to help it. Somehow I'm hungry all the time.

60|$|He vouchsafed me no answer. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{then and}} dozed {{off and on}} till noon, when the storm abated. We had dinner, or rather breakfast, round a blazing bonfire.|$|R

6000|$|... "There's {{no other}} remedy.
