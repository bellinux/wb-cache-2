The percentage of consanguinity between any two individuals decreases fourfold as the most recent common ancestor recedes one generation. <b>First</b> <b>cousins</b> have four times the consanguinity of second <b>cousins,</b> while <b>first</b> <b>cousins</b> once removed have half that of <b>first</b> <b>cousins.</b> Double <b>first</b> <b>cousins</b> have twice that of <b>first</b> <b>cousins</b> and are as related as half-siblings.|$|R
