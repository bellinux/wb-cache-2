5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver the poison. This myth might <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> due to its {{similarity}} in appearance with the Brown recluse spider.

5|$|In {{the late}} twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, its {{identification}} as a Roman road has been questioned by academics, and alternative interpretations suggested for its purpose and date of construction.

5|$|Modern {{amphibians}} (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) {{are classified}} in Lissamphibia. Lissamphibians appear to <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> in the Permian.

50|$|An exact {{definition}} of malfeasance (or misfeasance (Brit)) in office is difficult: many highly regarded secondary sources (such as books and commentaries) compete over its established elements based on reported cases.

5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes.

5|$|Narcissus {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> {{in the area}} of the Iberian peninsula, {{southern}} France and north-western Italy, and within this area most sections of the genus appeared, with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were closer together. Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa. However, these are reconstructions, the Amaryllidaceae lacking a fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{national}} park's creation, debates <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> on its {{management and the}} impacts on {{the population of the}} upland.

5|$|There are two known {{examples}} of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells. ATP synthase is an enzyme {{used in the}} process of energy storage and transfer. It bears some similarity to the flagellar motors discussed below. ATP synthase is thought to <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> by modular evolution, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.|$|E
5|$|Willard Spiegelman, in {{his study}} of Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation.

5|$|With urbanisation, {{distinctive}} urban accents <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> {{which often}} differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents.

5|$|After {{his partner}} {{developed}} cancer in late 2011, Davies {{returned to the}} UK, and co-created the CBBC drama, Wizards vs Aliens, which aired from 2012 to 2014. He created Cucumber, a Channel 4 series about middle-aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene; Banana, an E4 series about young LGBT people in the Cucumber universe; and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing issues which <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> in the sister series, modern sex and sexuality with the cast and public. All three shows aired in 2015 for a single series.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta {{is often}} named as the fifth or sixth Mahavidya (Mahavidyas are {{a group of}} ten fearsome goddesses from the Hindu escoetric {{tradition}} of Tantra), with hymns identifying her as a fierce aspect of Devi, the Hindu Mother goddess. Kinsley says that three Mahavidyas– Kali, Tara, and Chhinnamasta– are prominent among Mahavidya depictions and lists, but that Chhinnamasta barely has an independent existence outside the group. The Guhyatiguhya-Tantra (c. 9th century) equates the god Vishnu's ten avatars with the ten Mahavidyas; the man-lion avatar Narasimha is described to <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> from Chhinnamasta. A similar list in Mundamala Tantra (pre-16th century) equates Chhinnamasta with the avatar Parshurama.|$|E

5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may <b>have</b> <b>arisen</b> out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women. Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story.|$|E
