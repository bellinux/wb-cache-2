Forthe turbulent flow in a cyclone the key to the success of CFD lies with the accurate description of the turbulent behavior of the flow. The simulation methodologies involve 5 steps before the simulation data can be verified with experimental data. The simulation starts with meshing of miniature cyclone via Gambit software. The meshed cyclone was then transferred into FLUENT software for simulation, where all the boundary condition is programmed in the software.

40|$|Plasma based {{systems are}} {{relatively}} new {{players in the}} field of waste treatment. They are however gaining more and more attention, driven by the ongoing development of a more sustainable waste management practice. The continued advances that are being made in the application of plasma technology for waste treatment increase the acceptance of this technology as a viable alternative to more conventional treatment options. Here, the focus is on two-stage plasma gasification systems where waste gasification is followed by plasma cleaning of the produced synthesis gas (syngas). Syngas can be burned directly in internal combustion engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer-Tropsch process into synthetic fuel. A major problem associated with biomass and waste gasification is the production of tar. Tar in the product gas will condense at low temperatures, and lead to clogged filters and blocked engines. There exist a number of treatment options, including mechanical methods (e. g. <b>filters,</b> <b>cyclone),</b> thermal and/or catalytic cracking, and more advanced plasma methods. Several researchers have investigated the applicability of plasma methods for gas cleaning. The studies available in the literature typically focus on VOC removal, mainly by using non thermal plasma. Nair has investigated corona plasma for tar removal. He performed experiments on a tar model compound (naphthalene) to identify the chemical mechanisms for tar removal in syngas. Nair performed experiments up to a temperature of 400 °C. However, syngas exits the gasifier at a temperature of at least 750 °C. The development and commercialization of plasma systems for syngas cleaning would benefit from more fundamental insights into the behavior of plasma tar cracking mechanisms at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the work performed by Nair can be extended to experiments on different tar model compounds (e. g. pyrene) and on real tar, obtained from waste pyrolysis experiments. A pulsed corona plasma lab setup is used to determine the efficiency of plasma tar cracking for different tar model compounds and varying operating conditions.

I would {{like to comment on}} some of the regression analyses presented and, what I consider to be, a lack of analysis of their data. There is something strange with the model for log-transformed concentration data as it is presented in Fig. 2 and Table 4.

However, this b value is not presented in Table 4, which contains slopes for all the four models with the log-transformed data. Nei-ther does the line go through the data presented in Figure 2, which makes it a strange result of a regres-sion analysis. In the paper, no arguments were presented for why the regression model should go through the origin of the log-transformed data.

This paper is a contribution to that effort where we determine the sensitivity of three key aspects of Northern Hemisphere cyclone behaviour [namely the number of cyclones, their intensity (defined here in terms of the central pressure) and their deepening rates] to specific features in the automatic cyclone identification. The sensitivity is assessed with respect to three such features which may be thought to influence the ultimate climatology produced (namely performance in areas of complicated orography, time of the detection of a cyclone, and the representation of rapidly propagating cyclones). We make use of 13 tracking methods in this analysis. We find that the <b>filtering</b> of <b>cyclones</b> in regions where the topography exceeds 1500 m can significantly change the total number of cyclones detected by a scheme, but has little impact on the cyclone intensity distribution. More dramatically, late identification of cyclones (simulated by the truncation of the first 12 hours of cyclone life cycle) leads to a large reduction in cyclone numbers over the both continents and oceans (up to 80 and 40 %, respectively). Finally, the potential splitting of the trajectories at times of the fastest propagation has a negligible climatological effect on geographical distribution of cyclone numbers. Overall, it has been found that the averaged deepening rates and averaged cyclone central pressure are rather insensitive to the specifics of the tracking procedure, being more sensitive to the data set used (as shown in previous studies) and the geographical location of a cyclone...|$|R

Beyond this specific objective, a secondary goal was to develop a meaningful method of evaluating the effect of particle size and other particle properties on dustcake drag and filter DP. As mentioned earlier, the effect of particle size on dustcake drag and filter DP can be a very important consideration in the selection and specification of a precleaner cyclone for use upstream of the hot-gas <b>filter.</b> Installing a <b>cyclone</b> ahead of a hot-gas filter will reduce the transient areal loading of dust to the filter, but the beneficial effect of the reduced areal loading may be offset by an increase in drag associated with a finer particle-size distribution.

This paper discusses the partitioning behaviour of seven elements (As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn and Pb) in different product streams during combustion tests on anthracite and bituminous coal. The combustion tests were carried out in a 2. 5 MWth CFB unit equipped with multi-stage control of solids, which is well suited for trace element partitioning studies. The mass balance ratio of the elements studied ranged from 56 %– 137 %, which is, considering their concentrations, both satisfactory and reasonable. Most of the elements {{were found in the}} bottom ash and fly ash during CFB combustion, while small amounts of As, Cd and Pb were emitted to the atmosphere along with fine particulates. The trace elements {{are more likely to be}} retained in the bottom ash from the bituminous coal but not in the case of anthracite. For the volatile elements, the enrichment in solid streams follows the trend of: bag <b>filter</b> ash > <b>cyclone</b> ash > IBHX (in-bed heat exchanger) solids > bottom ash, indicating that the volatile elements tend to be enriched in fine particles. Anthracite, when compared to bituminous coal, shows lower emission factors for all monitored elements, except for Pb. This study can serve as a good reference for trace element control strategies in coal-fired CFB boilers...|$|R
40|$|Decommissioning of {{a nuclear}} {{facility}} comprises not only actual dismantling but also, above all, management of the resulting residual materials and waste. Siemens Decommissioning Projects (DP) in Hanau {{has been involved in}} this task since 1995 when the decision was taken to decommission and dismantle the Hanau Fuel Fabrication Plant. Due to the decommissioning, large amounts of contaminated steel scrap have to be managed. The contamination of this metal scrap can be found almost exclusively in the form of surface contamination. Various decontamination technologies are involved, as there are blasting and wiping. Often these methods are not sufficient to meet the free release limits. In these cases, SIEMENS has decided to melt the scrap at Siempelkamp's melting plant. The plant is licensed according to the German Radiation Protection Ordinance Section 7 (issue of 20. 07. 2001). The furnace is a medium frequency induction type with a load capacity of 3. 2 t and a throughput of 2 t/h for steel melting. For safety reasons, the furnace is widely operated by remote handling. A highly efficient <b>filter</b> system of <b>cyclone,</b> bag <b>filter</b> and HEPA-filter in two lines retains the dust and aerosol activity from the off-gas system. The slag is solidified at the surface of the melt and gripped before pouring the liquid iron into a chill. Since 1989, in total 15, 000 t have been molten in the plant, 2, 000 t of them having been contaminated steel scrap from the decommissioning of fuel fabrication plants. Decontamination factors could be achieved between 80 and 100 by the high affinity of the uranium to the slag former. The activity is transferred to the slag up to nearly 100 %. Samples taken from metal, slag and dust are analyzed by gamma measurements of the 186 keV line of U 235 and the 1001 keV line of Pa 234 m for U 238. All produced ingots showed a remaining activity less than 1 Bq/g and could be released for industrial reuse...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} an AGCM sensitivity {{study in which}} the response in the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks to an imposed SST anomaly is investigated. The study was motivated by observational studies cited in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report indicating that the storm tracks have shifted northward {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century, a shift which may be related to global warming. To perform sensitivity studies, the NCAR CAM 3 model was applied using the data ocean model with an imposed 2 K SST anomaly in all oceanic grid points north of 45 ◦S. Additionally, the sensitivity to longitudinal and latitudinal variations in the SST anomaly domain was investigated by heating high-latitudes and low-latitudes, only high-latitudes and only low-latitudes in the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean in three different runs. To investigate the importance of a potential reduction in the ice cover, CAM 3 was run without ice in the Northern Hemisphere. The storm tracks were represented in terms of bandpass variance using the bandpass <b>filter</b> method and <b>cyclone</b> count using the CCI method developed by Rasmus E. Benestad at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Warming the ocean by 2 K in all oceanic grid points north of 45 ◦S yields, in terms of bandpass variance, a northeastward shift in the North-Atlantic storm track and no latitudinal shift in the Pacific storm track, with corresponding changes in atmospheric baroclinicity and the mean circulation. The zonally averaged Eady parameter shifts upward and northward in response to an increased upper-level temperature gradient and a decreased lower-level temperature gradient, consistent with the findings of Yin (2005). As Yin (2005) performed a climate scenario study using a 15 member ensemble of coupled GCMs, while this study investigates the effects in a uncoupled AGCM where the only forcing is a positive SST anomaly, indications are that oceanic heating is the main driver of the observed storm track changes. Variations in the SST anomaly domain reveals that low-latitude heating is the primary driver of the observed storm track changes. Removing the ice cover yields changes of comparable magnitudes to highlatitude heating, as is therefore not as important as low-latitude heating...|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} of pigments and powders in paint manufacturing cause emissions of airborne particles. A {{great variety of}} substances occur. Previous studies (Bohgard et al., 1994) of simulations of pouring of pigments, which occur in small scale weighing procedures, showed typically bimodal size distribution including a sub-micron and a super-micron mode. The objective {{of the study was}} to get detailed knowledge on the relation between different source processes (depending on production technology, equipment and the manual handling routines) and aerosol characteristics. Super-micron particles were continuously measured with a time-of-flight instrument (Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, APS TSI Inc.) and sub-micron particles with an electric mobility spectrometer (Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, SMPS TSI Inc.). In addition filter sampling techniques for standardised work-place sampling (so-called total dust <b>filter</b> cassettes, a <b>cyclone</b> sampler for respirable dust and IOM-samplers for inhalable dust) have been used for idealised exposure/area measurements using a rotating mannequin as a carrier of these samplers. The filters were analysed gravimetrically and with Particle Induced X-ray Emission Analysis. The aerosols were measured during manufacturing of batches of paint. Sources and source mechanisms, as pouring pigments from bags, disposal of packages, mixing of powders and pigments and suspected re-suspension sources, were documented simultaneously with the performance of the measurements. Figure 1 shows examples of size distributions obtained with the APS and SMPS. The size distributions have essentially bimodal shapes with median diameters of 0. 05 - 0. 4 [mu]m and of 2 - 5 [mu]m respectively. Rapid variation in concentration occurs. Preliminary results show that several sources occur. Irregular activities and events as disposal of package material, cleaning, leakage from conveyor tubes and re-suspension due to wind velocities from open gates and moving vehicles significantly contribute to the particle concentrations. Filter sampling with the samplers mounted on a mannequin torso, rotating 360 degrees forth and back, is advantageous by giving idealised measures on exposure. Samplers mounted on equal horizontal level will have equal sampling location integrated over time. Furthermore, the sampling procedure emulate sampling in accordance with sampling conventions. Inlet characteristics of samplers mounted on a body differ from characteristics of free-hanging samplers (Vincent, 1989). Higher estimated mass concentrations were obtained with the IOM-samplers for inhalable dust than with the 37 mm open-face [ldquo]total dust[rdquo] cassettes. Figure omitte...|$|R
40|$|A {{system to}} remove in situ char/ash from hot {{pyrolysis}} vapors {{has been developed}} and tested at the University of Twente. The system consists of a continuous fluidized bed reactor (0. 7 kg/h) with immersed filters (wire mesh, pore size 5 μm) for extracting pyrolysis vapors. Integration of the filter system in the fluidized bed should overcome operational problems related {{to the increase in}} pressure drop across the filter in time and a decrease in oil yield as typically observed in downstream pyrolysis vapor filtration and lead to process intensification. In this study the effect of in situ hot pyrolysis vapor filtration has been studied with respect to process stability, product yields, and product quality. Oil obtained via a more conventional cyclone system placed in parallel to the filter system served as reference for the quality and yields of the filtered oil. Good process stability concerning temperature and pressure drop across the hot gas vapor filter was achieved during a 2 h run, even when using a reused filter. Particles (char/sand) were retained inside the filter pores located at the outside surface of the filter, while the inside of the filter remained clean apart from some deposits formed on the metal wire and small 1 μm particles which slipped through the filter. Mass balance closures higher than 94 wt % were obtained. Comparable yields (<b>cyclone</b> + <b>filtered</b> oil) were obtained as in the experiments carried out with only the <b>cyclones.</b> The <b>filtered</b> oil contained significantly less solids, alkali metals, and ash compared to cyclone oil. For the alkali metals, only a considerable amount of potassium (K) was still present in filtered pyrolysis oil, which most likely entered the filtered oil via the vapor phase. There {{were no significant differences in}} the elemental composition of the oil produced via the <b>filter</b> line and <b>cyclone</b> line. The molecular weight of the filtered oil obtained with nondried feed was always marginally lower compared to the cyclone oil. Results of the aging tests show that the reactivity of pyrolysis oil can already originate from the highly reactive components in pyrolysis oil itself and does not need the presence of char/ash. To show the intrinsically high reactivity of solids-free pyrolysis oil vapors, an external filter section (1 μm pore size) was placed additionally and in series with the filter inside the fluidized bed. The results show that char is formed from the reactive pyrolysis vapors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn-situ CO 2 capture in coal {{utilization}} captures CO 2 during {{coal combustion}} or gasification such as Oxygen fuel combustion or HyPr-RING. coal gasification processes. Regarding Oxufuel combustion, Callide Oxyfuel Project has been being conducted {{as the world}} first project to apply the technology to an existing power plant, Callide A Power Station # 4 unit (30 MWe) with injection of captured CO 2 into the underground. This is a Japan-Australia collaboration project and JCOAL participates in it as a supporting collaborator. JCOAL also proposed a novel coal gasification method-,HyPr-RING (Hydrogen Production by Reaction-Integrated Novel Gasification). HyPr-RING method utilizes a chemical looping with the calcium cycle, in which CaO (or Ca(OH) 2) captures CO 2 during coal gasification completely to form CaCO 3 and release heat for gasification to produce near pure hydrogen in one gasifier. This paper introduces the current developing status of the HyPr-RING method, mainly including the experimental examination of the transition of sorbent particle size distribution, ash and sulfur concentration of materials at several locations of gasification and calcination system for the HyPr-RING process. And the plant cold gas efficiency which should be affected by ash separation was also analyzed. As the results, {{it was found that}} coal ash and sulfur concentrated highly in the process of calcination after cyclone. If it is possible, separate and remove ash and sulfur by applying devices like <b>filter</b> or/and <b>cyclone</b> separator, the plant coal gas efficiency may raise 2 points than that in the previous study in which a part of recycled sorbent was rejected without separation. One method for reducing CO 2, the green house gas emissions is to capture CO 2 before it releases into the atmosphere and then sequestrate it. Active lime (main component, CaO) can be used to capture CO 2 in the exhaust gas or in the reactor from fossil fuels utilization effectively. That is calcium oxide (CaO) absorbs CO 2 to yield calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) (Eq. (1)), then the CaCO 3 is thermally decomposed to CaO again and release nearly pure CO 2 (Eq. (2)) for sequestration. To obtain a nearly pure CO 2 stream from CaCO 3 decomposition, the heat for decomposing CaCO 3 can be supplied by combusting fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, in a calciner with oxygen fuel combustion. The oxygen diluted by CO 2 (CO 2 cycle) or H 2 O (steam cycle), in order to obtain near pure CO 2 stream from CaCO 3 decomposition. In our previous studies 4 − 6, it was clarified that calcinations of limestone (main component, CaCO 3) in a fluidized bed calciner can be performed in CO 2 cycle atmosphere when the bed temperature was raised above 1293  K, whereas with 60 % steam cycle in atmosphere, limestone can be decomposed at comparatively lower temperature, such as 1173  K. The decomposition conversions of the limestone were about 95 % and 98 %, in CO 2 cycle and in steam cycle atmospheres, respectively. Reducing the calcinations temperature of limestone was helpful to produce more than 30 % active CaO as shown in previous study 4 − 6. In this study, the energy of CaCO 3 calcination process by H 2 O (steam) cycle was analyzed and compared with CaCO 3 calcination process by CO 2 cycle. For process calculations, the mass and energy flows were calculated iteratively, based on the input and output balances, until err [(input-output) /input] was < 0. 01. Analysis showed that, although H 2 O (steam) cycle calcination had calcination energy more about 3. 6 % than CO 2 cycle due to water evaporation latent heat loss, however, the calcination energy per active CaO was lowest for H 2 O (steam) cycle...|$|R
