25|$|MHV, {{made out}} of metal are also {{susceptible}} to fatigue failure owing to the polycrystalline characteristic of metals, but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> with pyrolytic carbon MHV because this material is not crystalline in nature.|$|E
25|$|Pump-action {{weapons are}} faster to cycle than lever actions, {{but are not}} well suited for firing from a {{supported}} position. Most pump-action designs are found in shotguns, which are typically fired from a standing position where {{the movement of the}} arm to operate the action <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{turn the}} {{approach}} on its head: No species {{has been found}} in which homosexual behaviour has not been shown to exist, with the exception of species that never have sex at all, such as sea urchins and aphis. Moreover, a part of the animal kingdom is hermaphroditic, truly bisexual. For them, homosexuality <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

25|$|Compared with {{synthetic}} biomaterials such as polyglycolides and polylactides, silk {{is obviously}} advantageous {{in some aspects}} in biodegradation. The acidic degraded products of polyglycolides and polylactides will decrease the pH of the ambient environment and thus adversely influence the metabolism of cells, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> for silk. In addition, silk materials can retain strength over a desired period from weeks to months as needed by mediating the content of beta sheets.|$|E
25|$|Selection of a pigment for a {{particular}} application is determined by cost, and by the physical properties and attributes of the pigment itself. For example, a pigment {{that is used to}} color glass must have very high heat stability in order to survive the manufacturing process; but, suspended in the glass vehicle, its resistance to alkali or acidic materials <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b> In artistic paint, heat stability is less important, while lightfastness and toxicity are greater concerns.|$|E
25|$|One key {{concept in}} {{distinguishing}} secret societies from fraternities is that, on campuses that have {{both kinds of}} organizations, one can {{be a member of}} both, (that is, membership is not mutually exclusive). Usually, being a member of more than one fraternity is not considered appropriate, because that member would have divided loyalties; however, typically, there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> being a member of a secret society and a fraternity, because they are not considered similar organizations or competing organizations.|$|E
50|$|Of 19 African {{countries}} {{surveyed in}} 2010, Guinea-Bissau {{was one of}} the most tolerant about homosexual behavior. Nine percent in Guinea-Bissau said that homosexual behavior was morally acceptable, with fifteen percent saying it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was held}} that the Income Tax Act 1942 could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{challenged}} because it was within the Commonwealth's taxation power. The Income Tax (Wartime Arrangements) Act 1942 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> because {{it had already been}} repealed.|$|R

25|$|The {{ultimatum}} {{game is a}} game {{in economic}} experiments. The first player (the proposer) conditionally receives a sum of money and proposes how to divide the sum between the proposer and the other player. The second player (the responder) chooses to either accept or reject this proposal. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If the second player rejects, neither player receives any money. The game is typically played only once so that reciprocation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, THF is {{a popular}} solvent when its water {{miscibility}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b> It is more basic than diethyl ether and forms stronger complexes with Li+, Mg2+, and boranes. It {{is a popular}} solvent for hydroboration reactions and for organometallic compounds such as organolithium and Grignard reagents. Although similar to diethyl ether, THF is a stronger base. Thus, while diethyl ether remains the solvent of choice for some reactions (e.g., Grignard reactions), THF fills that role in many others, where strong coordination is desirable and the precise properties of ethereal solvents such as these (alone and in mixtures and at various temperatures) allows fine-tuning modern chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|A {{less obvious}} {{problem is that}} it is very {{difficult}} to keep such a vehicle moving in a straight line. Although a governor can be used to ensure the two engine speeds are similar, loads on the tracks will not be the same as it moves over different terrain, causing the more heavily loaded track to slow and the tank to turn in that direction. This will cause the tank to wander when moving over uneven ground. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> at very low speeds, and the system is sometimes used on bulldozers and other tracked construction vehicles. For tanks, considerable driver skill and constant adjustment are needed, even at the relatively low speeds seen on early designs.|$|E
30|$|However, {{mortality}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in this study, embryotoxic potentials {{based on}} sublethal effects clearly were. Thus, our results emphasise {{the importance of}} taking into account effects on subtle levels to obtain a realistic picture of pollution consequences.|$|R
50|$|The {{commission}} {{concluded that}} in general there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> with sexual abuse, though one incident in 1962 was dealt with promptly. However, the management did not consider the possibility of abuse when sending children to foster families.|$|R
30|$|A further {{indication}} that physiological/biological differences between patient groups <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> {{the fact that}} no notable intra-site differences of group averaged BSUV were observed over 5 years and three groups at each of the three participating sites, respectively.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{trade-off}} between the amplifying {{effect of the}} resonators {{and the length of}} sustain of a ringing bar. The energy in a ringing bar comes from the initial mallet strike, and that energy can either be used to make the bar ring louder initially, or not as loudly but {{for a longer period of}} time. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> with marimbas and xylophones, where the natural sustain time of the wooden bars is short, but vibraphone bars can ring for many seconds after being struck, and this effect is highly desirable in many circumstances. Therefore, the resonators in a vibraphone are usually tuned slightly off-pitch to create a balance between loudness and sustain.|$|E
25|$|Cooling towers {{originated}} in the 19th century {{through the development of}} condensers for use with the steam engine. Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the back pressure, which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, {{while at the same time}} increasing power and recycling boiler-water. However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical. The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040–2069. While water usage <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} misconceptions {{in regards to}} poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low socioeconomic status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of value, but more so a problem of access. A parent from a lower socioeconomic class {{is likely to have}} more factors than a parent from a wealthy socioeconomic class that may affect their involvement with their child’s education. For instance a person living in poverty is more likely to work multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their child’s education. The teachers, faculty, and administrators of the schools have to take these real-life factors into consideration.|$|E

50|$|Islamic {{tradition}} {{also holds}} that translations {{were made for}} Emperor Negus of Abyssinia and Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, as both received letters by Muhammad containing verses from the Quran. In early centuries, the permissibility of translations <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue,</b> but whether one could use translations in prayer.|$|R
25|$|Timber dams {{were widely}} used {{in the early part}} of the {{industrial}} revolution and in frontier areas due to ease and speed of construction. Rarely built in modern times because of their relatively short lifespan and the limited height to which they can be built, timber dams must be kept constantly wet in order to maintain their water retention properties and limit deterioration by rot, similar to a barrel. The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, cement is costly or difficult to transport, and either a low head diversion dam is required or longevity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue.</b> Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the North American West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures. Two common variations of timber dams were the crib and the plank.|$|E
25|$|Court {{cases in}} recent years have {{addressed}} the legality of Taser use by police officers. In Bryan v. MacPherson, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Taser had been used in a way that constituted excessive force and hence a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In the latter case Mattos v. Agarano, the same Court of Appeals found that in two situations involving Taser use, one in Drive Stun and one in dart mode, officers had used excessive force. According to an article in Police Chief magazine, this decision implies guidelines for the use of Tasers and other Electronic Control Devices in gaining compliance (in a setting where safety <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue),</b> including that the officer must give warning before each application, and that the suspect must be capable of compliance, with enough time to consider a warning, and to recover from the extreme pain of any prior application of the Taser; and that Tasers must not be used on children, the elderly, and women who are visibly pregnant or inform the officer of their pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{interactions}} are a complex topic. Some drug interactions can be simplistically classified as either synergistic or inhibitory interactions. In addition, drug interactions can occur {{directly at the}} site of action, through common pathways or indirectly through metabolism of the drug in the liver or through elimination in the kidney. Pancuronium and thiopental have different sites of action, one in the brain and one at the neuromuscular junction. Since the half-life of thiopental is 11.5 hours, the metabolism of the drugs <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> when dealing with the short time frame in lethal injections. The only other plausible interpretation would be a direct one, or one in which the two compounds interact with each other. Supporters of the death penalty argue that this theory does not hold true. They state that even if the 100mg of pancuronium directly prevented 500mg of thiopental from working,sufficient thiopental to induce coma would be present for 50 hours. In addition, if this interaction did occur, then the pancuronium would be incapable of causing paralysis.|$|E
