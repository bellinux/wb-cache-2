5|$|Repeated {{eruption}} of <b>dacite</b> and rhyodacite from vents {{on the southwest}} rim of the caldera from 220,000 to 50,000 years ago formed Mammoth Mountain, a volcano composed of overlapping lava domes. Eruptions of <b>dacite</b> and rhyodacite occurred in Mono Basin from 100,000 to 6,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Basin area is {{underlain}} by {{the quartz}} monzonite of the Boulder Batholith. The batholith is overlain by <b>dacite</b> from the Paleogene and Neogene periods (roughly 66million to 1.8million years ago) and andesite {{from the late}} Cretaceous. The andesite and monzonite are cut by dikes of <b>dacite</b> and rhyolite.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of <b>dacite</b> lava have erupted. The largest of the <b>dacite</b> domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E
50|$|In hand specimen, {{many of the}} {{hornblende}} and biotite <b>dacites</b> are grey or pale {{brown and}} yellow rocks with white feldspars, and black crystals of biotite and hornblende. Other <b>dacites,</b> especially pyroxene-bearing <b>dacites,</b> are darker colored.|$|R
50|$|The andesites and <b>dacites</b> are of grey {{to light}} grey colour respectively, with {{porphyritic}} to vitrophyric textures. In this stage, <b>dacites</b> {{are more common}} than in the Vinta Loma deposits. Basaltic andesite contains olivine, while the <b>dacites</b> tend to contain more amphibole and biotite. There is a tendency of silicic acid contents to increase in the upper parts of the exposure.|$|R
5|$|Phenocrysts include {{plagioclase}} in andesite {{with smaller}} amounts of amphibole, biotite, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. Apatite and zircon form accessory minerals. <b>Dacites</b> have similar composition but also contain hornblende. Olivine {{is found in}} the andesites and quartz in the <b>dacites.</b>|$|R
5|$|Licancabur has erupted {{primarily}} andesite, but basaltic andesite and <b>dacite</b> {{have also}} been found. The rocks are dark and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite {{was found in the}} older lavas, and <b>dacite</b> in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include amphibole, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. Plagioclase is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{is formed}} by {{andesite}} and <b>dacite</b> rocks, with fragmentary rocks prevailing over lava flows. The rocks have typical arc-volcano chemistry and composition, with a progression from andesite to <b>dacite</b> in the eruption products with younger age. Potassium-argon dating has indicated an age range from 5,900,000 to 90,000 years. Subsequent erosion has generated a large debris apron {{around the base}} of the volcano and carved rock formations which impressed early explorers; one well-known rock formation is Neza e Sultan.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The trigger for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the <b>dacite</b> domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and <b>dacite</b> erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E
50|$|In thin section, <b>dacites</b> {{may have}} an aphanitic to {{porphyritic}} texture. Porphyritic <b>dacites</b> contain blocky highly zoned plagioclase phenocrysts and/or rounded corroded quartz phenocrysts. Subhedral hornblende and elongated biotite grains are present. Sanidine phenocrysts and augite (or enstatite) are found in some samples. The groundmass of these rocks is often aphanitic microcrystalline, with a web of minute feldspars mixed with interstitial grains of quartz or tridymite; but in many <b>dacites</b> it is largely vitreous, while in others it is felsitic or cryptocrystalline.|$|R

5|$|About 130 {{volcanic}} vents {{belong to}} {{the field and the}} earliest eruptions occurred 1.5 million years ago.

5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted <b>dacite</b> magma commonly forms lava domes.

40|$|The Licancabur volcano {{is located}} on the Bolivia-Chile Altiplano (Central Andes). The lavas are andesites and <b>dacites.</b> Numerous mineralogic {{features}} attest that magma mixing occurred. Andesites have concave (spoon-shaped) REE patterns whereas <b>dacites</b> have steep slopes. A spectacular crossover of patterns occurs with increasing SiO 2. Most geochemical discrimination criteria of adakites are satisfied by Licancabur <b>dacites,</b> except their high Sr-isotope compositions (>  0. 7075). For the genesis of the Licancabur adakite-like lavas, a four-step model is proposed: (1) partial melting (5 to 10 wt %) of a subducted altered oceanic crust; (2) hybridation (<  10 wt %) of the magmas with melts derived from the overlying lithospheric mantle; (3) contamination (≈  1 wt %) of these hybrid magmas by TTG-type granodiorites of the Archean lower continental crust (with present-day Sr-isotope ratios ≈  0. 820); (4) evolution and differentiation by crystal fractionation (<  6 wt %) and magma mixing at upper crustal levels. © 2008 Académie des sciences.

5|$|<b>Dacite</b> eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When <b>dacite</b> magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5|$|Exposed in {{the middle}} of the {{mountain}} range is an assemblage of deformed andesite to <b>dacite</b> lava flows and volcanoclastic sediments.

40|$|The mid-Holocene eruptive {{products}} of Nevado de Longaví volcano (36 · 2 °S, Chile) {{are the only}} reported occurrence of adakitic volcanic rocks in the Quaternary Andean Southern Volcanic Zone (33 - 46 °S). <b>Dacites</b> of this volcano are chemically distinct from other evolved magmas of the region in that they have high La/Yb (15 - 20) and Sr/Y (60 - 90) ratios and systematically lower incompatible element contents.

A two-stage mass-balance crystal fractionation model that matches both major and trace elements is proposed to explain magmatic evolution from the least evolved mafic enclave to the <b>dacites.</b> Amphibole is the main ferromagnesian phase in both stages of this model, in agreement with the mineralogy of the magmas.

40|$|Potassic magnesian-rich <b>dacites</b> {{occur to}} the south of the Kanasi, Altai, northwestern Chinese. U-Pb dating of zircons from these rocks yields an early Devonian age of 411 ± 4 Ma. The <b>dacites</b> are enriched in SiO 2 (64. 71 ̃ 67. 77 wt%), MgO (3. 28 ̃ 3. 53 wt%) and K 2 O (2. 12 ̃ 2. 75 wt%), and {{depleted}} in Na 2 O (1. 70 ̃ 1. 85 wt%). The rocks have low CaO content(1. 12 ̃ 1. 28 wt%), high Al 2 O 3 content (14. 12 ̃ 15. 33 wt%) and K 2 O/Na 2 O ratios (1. 2 ̃ 1. 6), and ASI indexes larger than 1. 8, indicating features of peraluminous potassic calc-alkali igneous rocks, which are clearly different to primitive High-Mg andesites. The <b>dacites</b> possess moderate Cr(134 × 10 - 6 ̃ 153 × 10 - 6), Co(17. 5 × 10 - 6 ̃ 18. 7 × 10 - 6), and Ni (72 × 10 - 6 ̃ 81 × 10 - 6) contents. These rocks are enriched in LREEs, large ion lithophile elements(e. g. Rb, K) and high field strength element (e. g. U, Th, Pb) with moderate Sr, Ba, and "TNT" (Ta, Nb, Ti) negative anomalies, showing geochemical characteristics of igneous rocks in subduction zone. Their high Mg #(51. 7 ̃ 52. 5) and low ε Nd(t) ratios(- 4. 6 ̃ - 4. 2) imply partial melting of metasomatic peridotites in the mantle wedge. The relative high Ba/La, Pb/La and low Th/Yb, Nb/Y ratios suggest that the metasomatism of mantle peridotites was predominated by the melts of subducted sediments. Therefore, the above geochemistry indicates that the potassic magnesian-rich <b>dacites</b> were originated from the partial melting of metasomatic mantle peridotites mainly altered by the melts of subducted sediments, showing an active continental margin in the Devonian. In addition, the timing of the potassic magnesian-rich <b>dacites</b> provides a good constrain on the minimum depositional age of the underlying Habahe group and suggests the sediments of the group deposited before the early Devonian. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Volcanism in this {{chain is}} calc-alkaline, {{yielding}} both andesite, <b>dacite,</b> and rhyolite.

5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, mixing with the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of <b>dacite</b> with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E
5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of volcanic rock, called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other <b>dacite</b> domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak.

It is likely that crustal feedback and increased deep crustal influx of mantle-derived basalts drive increased magmatic flux.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which U-series disequilibria can be {{produced}} during partial melting of mafic lower crust is quantified using a simple batch melting model and both experimental and theoretical partition coefficients for U, Th and Ra. We show that partial melting of mafic lower crust can only produce small disequilibria between 238 U, 230 Th and 226 Ra. Crystallisation of basalt and mixing between young basalt and crustal derived melts will have a similar or smaller effect. Consequently, U-series disequilibrium in arc andesites and <b>dacites</b> can generally only be an inherited feature derived from a mantle parent, unless the timescales of silicic magma production within the crust are short compared to the half-life of 226 Ra. Our results have profound implications for several recent models of silicic magma production by thermal incubation and partial melting of the lower crust. We show that the 226 Ra excess observed in most arc andesites and <b>dacites</b> requires extremely rapid differentiation and/or the involvement of mantle derived basalts less than a few thousand years old. Application to Mount St. Helens suggests that crystallisation of young mantle-derived magma {{is likely to be}} the dominant process in the formation of these <b>dacites.</b> © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R
