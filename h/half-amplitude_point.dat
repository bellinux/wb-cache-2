5000|$|SCH (Subcarrier to Horizontal) phase {{refers to}} the phase {{relationship}} between {{the leading edge of}} horizontal sync (at the 50% amplitude point) and the zero crossings of the color burst (by extrapolating the color burst to the leading edge of sync). The error is referred to as SCH phase and is expressed in degrees of subcarrier phase. For PAL, the definition of SCH phase is slightly different due to the more complicated relationship between the sync and subcarrier frequencies — the SCH phase relationship for a given line repeats only once every eight fields. Therefore, PAL SCH phase is defined, per EBU Technical Statement D 23-1984 (E), as “the phase of the +U component of the color burst extrapolated to the <b>half-amplitude</b> <b>point</b> of {{the leading edge of the}} synchronizing pulse of line 1 of field 1.” ...|$|E
40|$|Diffraction {{patterns}} of compressional (P) and shear (SV) waves {{produced by a}} circular hole were experimentally obtained on a two-dimensional ultrasonic model. The shapes of the Fresnel patterns were found to depend on, 1) α/λ, {{the ratio of the}} radius of the cylinder to the wavelength; and, 2) the wave type. The transitional zone between the illuminated and the shadow regions broadens, and the <b>half-amplitude</b> <b>point</b> shifts away from the geometrical shadow as α/λ decreases. For comparable α/λ, the shadow boundary of the SV wave appears to start much earlier than that of the P wave...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{procedure}} {{for measuring the}} attenuative dispersion of body-wave phases has been developed and applied to PANDA recordings of direct P waves in the New Madrid seismic zone. We have determined relative group delays of spectral components of those waves for 152 paths and related that observed dispersion to seismic-wave attenuation using an expression we have derived for a continuous re-laxation model. The group delays are sensitive to, the value of Q 1 (x) over the 1 Qm flat portion of the attenuation spectrum, and 1 /s 2, {{the frequency of the}} <b>half-amplitude</b> <b>point</b> at the high-frequency end of the spectrum. Qm increases with epicentral distance from about 45 to 145 between 10 and 60 km, suggesting an increase of crustal P-wave Q with depth. In addition, Qm values for paths that are entirely, or mostly, confined to the active portion of the New Madrid seismic zone are lower than for paths that traverse a significant portion of crust outside the active region. The reduced Q in the source zone of New Madrid earthquakes can be explained by fluids in permeable rock, a mechanism previously proposed by Al-Shukri and Mitchell (1988) to explain reduced velocities there. A comparison of P-wave Q values reported in this study of attenuative dispersion with those previously deduced from the decay of spectral amplitudes shows that mean values obtained by the two methods are about the same, but that Q values from attenuative-dispersion measurements exhibit less scatter...|$|E
