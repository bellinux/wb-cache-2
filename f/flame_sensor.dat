40|$|GTI, and its {{commercial}} partners, {{have developed a}} high-efficiency low-dross combustion system that offers environmental and energy efficiency benefits at lower capital costs for the secondary aluminum industry users of reverberatory furnaces. The high-efficiency low-dross combustion system, also called Self-Optimizing Combustion System (SOCS), includes the flex-flame burner firing an air or oxygen-enriched natural gas flame, a non-contact optical <b>flame</b> <b>sensor,</b> and a combustion control system. The flex-flame burner, developed and tested by GTI, provides an innovative firing {{process in which the}} flame shape and velocity can be controlled. The burner produces a flame that keeps oxygen away from the bath surface by including an O 2 -enriched fuel-rich zone on the bottom and an air-fired fuel-lean zone on the top. Flame shape and velocity can be changed at constant firing rate or held constant over a range of firing conditions. A non-intrusive optical sensor is used to monitor the flame at all times. Information from the optical sensor(s) and thermocouples can be used to control the flow of natural gas, air, and oxygen to the burner as needed to maintain desired flame characteristics. This type of control is particularly important to keep oxygen away from the melt surface and thus reduce dross formation. This retrofit technology decreases fuel usage, increases furnace production rate, lowers gaseous emissions, and reduces dross formation. The highest priority research need listed under Recycled Materials is to turn aluminum process waste into usable materials which this technology accomplishes directly by decreasing dross formation and therefore increasing aluminum yield from a gas-fired reverberatory furnace.

All the experiments (except those using No. 2 diesel fuel and the diesel exhaust tests) were conducted in a similar manner, with combustible materials heated rapidly by electrical strip heaters producing smoldering fires that quickly transitioned into flaming fires.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{submitted}} to the United States Department of Energy in partial fulfillment of the contractual requirements for Phase I of the project titled, ''Real Time Flame Monitoring of Gasifier Burner and Injectors'', under co-operative agreement number DE-FS 26 - 02 NT 41585. The project is composed of three one-year budget periods. The work in each year is divided into separate Tasks to facilitate project management, orderly completion of all project objectives, budget control, and critical path application of personnel and equipment. This Topical Report presents results of the Task 1 and 2 work. The 2 D optical sensor was developed to monitor selected UV and visible wavelengths to collect accurate flame characterization information regarding mixing, flame shape, and flame rich/lean characteristic. Flame richness, for example, was determined using OH and CH intensity peaks in the 300 to 500 nanometer range of the UV and visible spectrum. The laboratory burner was operated {{over a wide range}} of air to fuel ratio conditions from fuel rich to fuel lean. The sooty oxygen enriched air flames were established to test the sensor ability to characterize flame structures with substantial presence of hot solid particles emitting strong ''black body radiation''. The knowledge gained in these experiments will be very important when the sensor is used for gasifier flame analyses. It is expected that the sensor when installed on the Global Energy gasifier will be exposed to complex radiation patterns. The measured energy will be a combination of spectra emitted by the combusting gases, hot solid particulates, and hot walls of the gasifier chamber. The ability to separate flame emissions from the ''black body emissions'' will allow the sensor to accurately determine flame location relative to the gasifier walls and the injectors, as well as to analyze the flame's structure and condition. Ultimately, this information should enable the gasification processes to be monitored and controlled and as a result increase durability and efficiency of the gasifier. To accomplish goals set for Task 2 GTI will utilize the CANMET Coal Gasification Research facility. The Entrained Coal Gasifier Burner Test Stand has been designed and is currently under construction in the CANMET Energy Technology Center (CETC), the research and technology arm of Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).

The performance of a prototype sensor node was verified when the luminous flame was imaged onto the sensor node with different angles ranging from - 30 degrees to 30 degrees and distances of 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 m enabling effective fire safety applications...|$|R
30|$|ZnO is {{emerging}} as a potential candidate due to its direct wide bandgap {{and its ability to}} tailor electronic, magnetic, and optical properties through doping and alloying. One significant property that has brought ZnO and its alloys with Mg to the forefront of a flurry of research activity is the large exciton binding energy (60 meV when compared to 25 meV for GaN) for use in UV lasers. ZnO has been widely reported as a visible-blind UV sensor [7] over a wide range of applications in military and non-military arenas [8] that includes missile plume detection for hostile missile tracking, <b>flame</b> <b>sensors,</b> UV source monitoring, and calibration. However, recent research in nanostructures of ZnO has proved that the reduced dimensions have the potential to provide more untapped properties if harnessed in a systematic manner. Many simple fabrication techniques [9], devices [10, 11], and applications [12] have been demonstrated and reproduced. ZnO nanoscale structures such as one-dimensional nanowires are attracting more attention because of their enormous potential as fundamental building blocks for nanoscale electronic [13] and photonic devices due to the enhanced sensitivity offered by quantum confinement effects [14]. In this work, we address the prominent defect-related property (could be sum or individual defects due to non-crystallinity, surface charge imbalance, or substrate to film interface strains) that affects the electrical properties of the ensuing device. The phenomenon of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) is a situation in which a photo-induced current in the device continues to flow even after the exciting photon source is turned off. PPC is a major issue in device operation that became a topic of intense research interest during development of GaN [15, 16] and AlGaN [17] photodetectors. The motivation of the present work is to understand the origin of PPC in ZnO by employing a simple device configuration consisting of a metal–semiconductor–metal structure. PPC is very difficult to observe in bulk materials and needs to be measured at very low temperature, which in turn complicates the carrier transport mechanisms, thus limiting the ability to extract and interpret the exact cause of the problem [18]. This phenomenon is observable in both macro and nanostructured films; however, the effects are more prominent in nanostructured materials due to singularity in their joint density of states, thus allowing a bulk phenomenon to be observable clearly even at room temperature.|$|R
40|$|The Fire Logistics Airborne Mapping Equipment (FLAME) system, {{mounted in}} a {{twin-engine}} and airplane {{operated by the}} U. S. Forest Service (USFS) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is an airborne instrument for detecting and pinpointing forest fires that might escape ground detection. The FLAME equipment rack includes the operator interface, a video monitor, the system's control panel and film output. <b>FLAME's</b> fire detection <b>sensor</b> is an infrared line scanner system that identifies fire boundaries. Sensor's information is correlated with the aircraft's position and altitude {{at the time the}} infrared imagery is acquired to fix the fire's location on a map. System can be sent to a fire locale anywhere in the U. S. at the request of a regional forester. USFS felt a need for a more advanced system to deliver timely fire information to fire management personnel in the decade of the 1990 s. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) conducted a study, jointly sponsored by NASA and USDA, on what advanced technologies might be employed to produce an end-to-end thermal infrared fire detection and mapping system. That led to initiation of the Firefly system, currently in development at JPL and targeted for operational service beginning in 1992. Firefly will employ satellite-reference position fixing and provide performance superior to FLAME...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{prototype}} of a Strip Resistive Thick GEM (S-RETGEM) photosensitive gaseous detector filled with Ne and ethylferrocene (EF) vapours at a total pressure of 1 atm for an early forest fire detection system. Tests show that it is one hundred times more sensitive than the best commercial ultraviolet (UV) flame detectors; and therefore, {{it is able to}} reliably detect a flame of ~ 1. 5 x 1. 5 x 1. 5 m 3 at a distance of about ~ 1 km. An additional and unique feature of this detector is its imaging capability, which in combination with other techniques, may significantly reduce false fire alarms when operating in an automatic mode. Preliminary results conducted with air-filled photosensitive gaseous detectors are also presented. The approach’s main advantages include both the simplicity of manufacturing and affordability of construction materials such as plastics and glues specifically reducing detector production cost. The sensitivity of these air-filled detectors at certain conditions may be as high as those filled with Ne and EF. Long-term test results of such sealed detectors indicate a significant progress in this direction. We believe that our detectors utilized in addition to other <b>flame</b> and smoke <b>sensors</b> will exceptionally increase the sensitivity of forest fire detection systems. Our future efforts will b...|$|R
