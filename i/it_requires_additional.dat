Purchase prices for the Jonz autos were lowered. A 1911 Jonz Runabout cost $ 825.00.|$|R

50|$|When {{performed}} by a trained laparoscopic tubal reversal surgeon, laparoscopic tubal reversal combines the success rates of micro-surgical techniques with the advantages of minimally-invasive surgery - namely faster recovery, better healing, less pain, fewer complications, and no large disfiguring scars. Laparoscopic surgery can be more expensive than an open surgery using a 2 to 3 inch incision because <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> surgical equipment.|$|E
5000|$|This {{definition}} [...] uses a metric on X (actually, uniform structure would suffice). This is {{a weaker}} definition {{than that of}} Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew, as <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional,</b> unnecessary structure on the topological space (but it {{does not depend on}} choice of metrics generating the given topology). However, in practice, the Bowen-Dinaburg topological entropy is usually much easier to calculate.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{moved its}} {{junction}} station for the branchline to Aberystwyth on cost grounds, from Devil's Bridge to Ystrad Meurig (later known as [...] ), the M&MR had let the contract {{for construction of}} the western 27 mi mainline to a combined team of David Davies of Llandinam and Fredrick Beeston. But it had excluded the route onwards to Llanidloes, as <b>it</b> <b>required</b> <b>additional</b> surveying to overcome engineering and resultant cost difficulties.|$|R

50|$|Double {{dropping}}, {{also known}} as the dropping system is a brewing method used for the production of ales. During the early 20th century it was the most popular method of clearing trub (inactive yeast and excess, staling and haze-forming protein from the malted barley) during fermentation for English ales. It is less commonly used today as <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> brewing vessels in a two-tier system.|$|E
50|$|This process {{also has}} {{intermediate}} reactions, and as such, the phosphate rock created has impurities. One such impurity—and {{the most important}} one—is iron oxide. Iron oxide impurities are reduced and form iron phosphides. The resulting second liquid product is called ferrophosphorus. Iron is considered an impurity and undesirable because <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> carbon and power for reduction. Thus, it locks up {{a certain percentage of}} the phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|As the Secure Copy Protocol {{implements}} file transfers only, GUI SCP {{clients are}} rare, as implementing <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> functionality (directory listing at least). For example, WinSCP defaults to the SFTP protocol. Even when operating in SCP mode, clients like WinSCP are typically not pure SCP clients, as they must use other means {{to implement the}} additional functionality (like the ls command). This in turn brings platform-dependency problems.|$|E

5000|$|Continuous {{simulation}} of dead time (its Laplace transform is [...] ) {{is not a}} trivial task and usually we use one of Padé approximations. We will simulate Padé approximation of 2nd orderand 4th order:Input signal is a unit step, communication interval equals 0.01s, length simulation run is 5s, results will be compared with output of built-in discrete function delay (<b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> array (del in our case) of appropriate size).|$|E
50|$|Let A be an open convex cone in Rn. This {{means that}} A {{is an open}} convex set such that, {{whenever}} x lies in A, so does the entire ray from the origin to x. Symbolically,If A is a cone, then the elements of H2(TA) have L2 boundary limits in the sense thatexists in L2(B). There is an analogous result for Hp(TA), but <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> regularity of the cone (specifically, the dual cone A* needs to have nonempty interior).|$|E
50|$|Köhler {{illumination}} is {{a method}} of specimen illumination used for transmitted and reflected light (trans- and epi-illuminated) optical microscopy. Köhler illumination acts to generate an extremely even illumination of the sample and ensures that {{an image of the}} illumination source (for example a halogen lamp filament) is not visible in the resulting image. Köhler illumination is the predominant technique for sample illumination in modern scientific light microscopy. <b>It</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> optical elements which are more expensive and may not be present in more basic light microscopes.|$|E

50|$|CTF {{is being}} {{replaced}} by the more advanced computer to plate (CTP) technology. Compared to CTP, the cost of maintaining and running a CTF system is much cheaper, even though <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> an <b>additional</b> step in the plate-making process.|$|R
50|$|Critical {{illumination}} or Nelsonian illumination is {{a method}} of specimen illumination used for transmitted and reflected light (trans- and epi-illuminated) optical microscopy. Critical illumination focuses {{an image of a}} light source on to the specimen for bright illumination. Critical illumination generally has problems with evenness of illumination as an image of the illumination source (for example a halogen lamp filament) is visible in the resulting image. Köhler illumination has largely replaced critical illumination in modern scientific light microscopy although <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> optics which less expensive and simpler light microscopes may not have.|$|E
50|$|In Poland magister (abbreviation: mgr or mgr inż. - in {{technical}} disciplines) is awarded after 5 years of University level education {{and it is}} an equivalent to Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Laws, Master of Music in an academic discipline. Before +/-1999 and the implementation of the Bologna Process the first academic degree awarded in Poland was magister. After implementation of the Bologna Process the person who obtained a Licentiate Degree can continue education to the magister level (<b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> 2 years of studies).|$|E
50|$|The downsides to this {{approach}} are; it introduces latency {{to the memory}} request, <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> power consumption for the buffer chips, and current implementations create a memory write bus significantly narrower than the memory read bus. This means workloads that use many writes (such as high-performance computing) will be significantly slowed. However, this slowdown is nowhere near as bad as not having enough memory capacity to avoid using significant amounts of virtual memory, so workloads that use extreme amounts of memory in irregular patterns might be helped by using fully buffered DIMMs.|$|E

This fortuitously assured the episode's survival: as a production made on film, it fell within the BBC Film Library's remit of retaining filmed productions. In 1998, David Croft made an appeal on BBC Two asking people if they held an off air video copy of the 5 remaining episodes.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} types of USMs: ring-type USM, micromotor USM, and Nano USM. Ring-type USM allows for {{full-time}} manual focus (FT-M) operations without switching out of AF mode. Micromotor USM is used {{to bring down the}} cost of the lens. It is possible to implement FT-M even with micromotor USM; however, <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> <b>additional</b> mechanical components, {{and the vast majority of}} micro-USM lenses do not offer such capability. Nano USM was introduced in 2016 with the release of Canon's latest iteration of the EF-S 18-135mm lens. It is intended to offer the AF speed of ring-type USM with the quietness of STM mechanisms (see below).|$|E
