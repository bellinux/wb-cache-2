5000|$|Labour for a Referendum (LfR) was a {{political}} campaign {{by members of the}} Labour Party that seeks a referendum in the United Kingdom on the European Union. The movement was set up following a pledge by the Conservative Party to hold an <b>in-out</b> vote if re-elected in United Kingdom general election, 2015. In the election campaign, Labour Party policy was that such a referendum would be an unnecessary distraction from government priorities. Following the Conservative victory in that election, the Labour Party committed to supporting passage of a Referendum Bill through Parliament [...] thus achieving the result sought by this campaign.|$|E

5000|$|For a {{few years}} the issue was largely settled but, with the {{approval}} by Parliament of the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty, there were calls from eurosceptic Members of Parliament for a new UK referendum on continued membership. Conservative Party leader David Cameron announced in January 2013, in {{what became known as}} [...] "The Bloomberg speech", a proposal to undertake a renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU, and subsequently to hold a UK referendum on its membership of the Union. However, at the time of Cameron's speech, the Conservative Party was in Coalition government with the Liberal Democrats who, along with the Labour Party, were at the time opposed to any new referendum being held. The Conservative Party did not have an overall majority and a private members bill by Conservative MP James Wharton to legislate a <b>in-out</b> referendum by the end of 2017 was blocked in the House of Lords. The proposals were contained in the Conservative Party manifesto for the United Kingdom general election, 2015, in which the Conservatives won with an unexpected overall majority. Following the election, the opposition Labour Party withdrew its opposition to holding an <b>in-out</b> EU referendum. On the bill's second reading, on 9 June 2015, MPs voted by 544 to 53 in favour of the principle of holding a referendum with only the Scottish National Party opposing the Bill.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Soodak {{began working}} with Arthur Iberall {{in an area of}} complex systems. They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long {{internal}} factory day delays. These systems are associated with nested hierarchy and with an extensive range of time scale processes. It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or <b>in-out</b> connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as heterarchy) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems. By 1975, they began to describe homeokinetics, the physics of complex, self-organizing systems, as dealing with the problems of nature, life, humankind, mind, and society.|$|E
