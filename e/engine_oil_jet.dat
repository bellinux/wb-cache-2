40|$|The {{selection}} of bearing steel surfaces {{for use with}} silicon nitride rolling elements within hybrid bearings {{is critical to the}} performance and life of such components, which have potential applications in advanced high speed aircraft. The wear and friction performance of these combinations is a major factor currently being considered for the next generation hybrid bearings. This paper reports on hybrid bearing contacts that have lubricated Si 3 N 4 elements, which have been loaded against various bearing steels under pure sliding contact conditions on a fully instrumented pin-on-disc wear test rig. The wear and friction performance of Si 3 N 4 has been compared to a baseline case of bearing steel M 50 ball sliding against a M 50 disc. Both hybrid and steel on steel contacts were lubricated by an aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> Mobil <b>Jet</b> II. Wear mechanisms were determined by post-test analysis of the pin wear scars, disc wear surface and wear debris using optical microscopy, surface profilometry and FEG-SEM (scanning electron microscopy). The wear rates of Si 3 N 4 sliding against different bearing steels are ranked by performance and related to their wear mechanisms, hardness and microstructure. Typical sliding contact wear mechanisms were found for the steel on steel combination while Si 3 N 4 sliding against steel showed that transgranular and sub-micron-cracking mechanisms predominate. Evidence of material transfer (steel onto the silicon nitride) was found. Friction values for the various combinations are also reported and found to be substantially lower (?= 0. 04) than bearing steel on bearing steel combinations (?= 0. 17). The disc and pin wear was monitored on-line by an electrostatic wear sensor, LVDT and laser displacement probe, a friction strain gauge, and an infrared thermometer. Correlations between wear rate and charge generation/level, friction, contact temperature, and disc hardness are presented...|$|R

Previous work has shown that electrostatic charge signals {{can be used to}} detect the onset of wear in lubricated tribocontacts, including hybrid contacts [1 - 4]. This paper reports further studies that have been undertaken to quantify the levels of charge generated by lubricated hybrid (silicon nitride sliding on bearing steel) contacts as a function of ceramic ball volume loss. Tests were carried out on an unheated pin-on-disc tribometer with a silicon nitride ball loaded against a bearing steel disc lubricated by two advanced aircraft <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>oils,</b> Mobil <b>Jet</b> 2 and Mobil Jet 291, at a constant sliding speed of 7 m s- 1. A series of loads were applied (1. 9 GPa – 3. 0 GPa) and the amount of wear and the wear mechanisms were quantified and determined respectively. In addition, friction and disc surface temperature measurements were made along with electrostatic charge measurements from a sensor positioned over the wear track. These measurements were used to monitor the wear conditions in real time. A correlation between ceramic ball volume loss and the rms (root mean square) of the electrostatic signal under steady state was found. Transient electrostatic features were identified within these signals possibly relating to transient wear processes within the contacts. Hence, the average of the rms charge levels may be a useful parameter for monitoring the health of hybrid contacts. Wear debris generated under different loads were analysed by microscopy. Worn pin and disc surfaces were analysed using SEM and EDX to identify wear mechanisms and to check the chemical compositions of any oil additive film. Polishing by tribo-chemical wear processes was found to be the predominant silicon nitride wear mechanism.
