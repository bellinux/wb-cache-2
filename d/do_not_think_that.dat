25|$|Just to make sure: I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any of {{the above}} is valid reasoning. I am writing this just to point out what I think are the central 'ideas' the authors had when writing their {{articles}} and how this led them to their conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{researchers}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{the plague}} ever became endemic in Europe or its rat population. The disease repeatedly {{wiped out the}} rodent carriers so that the fleas died out until a new outbreak from Central Asia repeated the process. The outbreaks {{have been shown to}} occur roughly 15 years after a warmer and wetter period in areas where plague is endemic in other species such as gerbils.|$|E

25|$|I really <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{we should}} have homosexuals guiding our children. I think that it’s a {{lifestyle}} that I don’t agree with. I realize {{a lot of people}} do. It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E
25|$|I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women {{just as there}} are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E
25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E

25|$|Further, on March 28, 2017, Trump {{signed an}} {{executive}} order to rewrite President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. Much of this incentive is driven by expanding the workforce in the coal industry, however it is still undetermined how soon this will take affect. With continued trends in repealing past rules and regulations regarding Climate change under the Trump administration, the commitment to the Paris climate agreement held at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference is under question. Uncertainty {{about the development of}} this debate sparks much global controversy and unclarity in the reactions and future prognoses of climate and environmental politics. While international concerns are expressed, economists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the proposed repeals will have much effect. Demand for coal on the national market has been declining and is still low, so that changes to the pollution standards and greenhouse gas emissions do not actually change the market drastically.|$|E

500|$|This case {{began in}} the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In the {{decision}} in that court, the trial court judge stated: [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 'income' as used in the statute, {{should be given a}} meaning so as to include everything that comes in." [...] The case did not involve compensation for labor or services. Instead, the case involved the federal income tax treatment of dividends paid by the Central Pacific Railway Company to its parent company, the Southern Pacific Company, which owned 100% of the stock of Central Pacific Railway Company. The District Court ruled that the dividends were taxable to the Southern Pacific Company. This decision was reversed by the Supreme Court.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone fully {{retracted}} [...] "A Rape on Campus" [...] {{and removed the}} article from its website. However, Coco McPherson, {{who is in charge}} of Rolling Stone's fact-checking operation, said, [...] "I one-hundred percent <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the policies that we have in place failed." [...] Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana was also cited on the Columbia report: [...] "It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things." [...] Jill Geisler in the Columbia Journalism Review reacted to Dana's statement by saying, [...] "At a time when humility should guide a leader's comments, that quote carries the aroma of arrogance." ...|$|E
500|$|Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict was {{positive}} on the season, but wrote [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> adults {{will be as}} entertained as in previous seasons. The comedy is more targeted at the kids than in the past." [...] In particular, Hrab cited the episode [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] as [...] "tiresome (for adults, anyway; kids will enjoy it)." [...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot of silly and good-natured fun for the kids and there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement". He added [...] " [...] delivers more of what SpongeBob fans crave." ...|$|E
500|$|Hindley {{was told}} that she should spend 25 years in prison before being {{considered}} for parole. The Lord Chief Justice agreed with that recommendation in 1982, but in January 1985 Home Secretary Leon Brittan increased her tariff to 30 years. By that time Hindley {{claimed to be a}} reformed Catholic. Ann West, the mother of Lesley Ann Downey, was at the centre of a campaign to ensure that Hindley was never released from prison, and until West's death in February 1999, she regularly gave television and newspaper interviews whenever Hindley's release was rumoured. In February 1985, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told [...] Brittan that his proposed minimum sentences of 30 years for Hindley and 40 years for Brady were too short, saying [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> either of these prisoners should ever be released from custody. Their crime was the most hideous and cruel in modern times." ...|$|E

500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he did, but there were tears in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|In {{his history}} of Egypt Manetho states that {{with the death of}} Unas the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. This may be because Unas died without a male heir, his {{probable}} son Unas-Ankh having predeceased him. This might have caused a succession crisis hinted at by the personal name chosen by Teti upon his accession to the throne: [...] "Seheteptawy" [...] meaning [...] "He who reconciles/pacifies the two lands". Teti's claim to the throne could have relied on his marriage to Iput, who may have been a daughter of Unas. This possibility is heavily debated, as the interpretation of Iput's titles that would indicate that she was the daughter of a king is uncertain. Furthermore, the idea that Teti could legitimate his claim by marrying into the royal family is rejected by many Egyptologists, including Munro, Dobrev, Baud, Mertz, Pirenne, and Robin, who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right to the pharaonic throne passed through the female line.|$|E
500|$|Sir Patrick Abercrombie was {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} progress, and in 1933 said [...] "There is not a single complete Ring Road in the County or Region of London". Plans for an improved South Circular were revisited as part of Abercrombie's County of London Plan of 1943, as the southern half of one of several ring roads around the capital. Abercrombie designated it as the [...] "C Ring" [...] (the third ring out from the city centre); however, the high-quality road was never built and the semi-circular route was assigned to existing roads through the southern suburbs; these roads retain their historic names. The current recognised route of the South Circular was created by local motoring organisations putting up strategically placed signposts to direct traffic. Sir Richard Sharples, then MP for Sutton and Cheam, felt this was inadequate and complained that [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the South Circular Road could be said to exist at all." ...|$|E

500|$|Biographer Robert Tate {{went further}} in his examination. During his {{research}} he contacted Professor Rafael Scheck, Head of History at Colby College. Scheck published Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940 {{and is an}} acknowledged expert on racial theory and in Nazi Germany. Without being familiar with Marseille, Scheck identified his friendship with Matthias was in direct contradiction to the Nazi mandate. Sheck doubted Marseille's [...] "acquisition" [...] of Matthais and his role as Marseille's [...] "batman", was done out of disrespect. Sheck said, [...] "I know of the camp commandant of the concentration camp of Mathausen, who held a black man as his personal servant. This was done out of disrespect, however. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> aspect was relevant for Marseille." [...] When questioned on Marseille's behaviour, Sheck said, [...] "I do not find it odd because I am accustomed to seeing many nuances among the Germans of the Third Reich. But his behaviour would probably be startling for many other researchers." [...] Tate also noted Marseille's penchant for Cuban rumba by Ernesto Lecuona, jazz and swing which he believes was another way of resisting Nazi ideals.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do have things I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than {{a foot and a half}} square?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The king started. 'O friend, Gopani-Kufa,' he said, 'ask {{anything}} but <b>that!</b> I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you would request {{that which is}} most precious to me.' ...|$|R
