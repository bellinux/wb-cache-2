The Journal of College Counseling was initiated in 1998 and has developed a strong reputation as a scholarly journal, with an orientation to the work of practitioners. The ACCA-L listserv, open to anyone interested in college counseling, provides an <b>electronic</b> <b>forum</b> for discussion of issues. Since 2002, ACCA has also sponsored a biennial national conference, co-hosted with one of its state divisions, in addition to its annual business meeting and other activities held at the ACA conference. Other professional development opportunities include 23 state divisions, public policy and legislation activities, on-line courses providing continuing professional education, research grants, professional awards, and emerging leader grants to support graduate student participation at ACA and ACCA conferences.|$|E
40|$|Abstract (Concepts of {{heat and}} work in an <b>electronic</b> <b>forum.</b> Effects of {{computer}} self-efficacy) The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the activity performance in an <b>electronic</b> <b>forum</b> on the concepts of work and heat, and their relationship with computer self-efficacy and other variables, with the aim of providing tools that incorporate the use of ICT in the teaching of thermodynamics. Thirty four university students who were in the course of Mechanics and Aircraft Maintenance Technology participated in the study. We used the Computer Self-Efficacy Inventory (IAC) adapted by Peinado and Ramírez (2010). Significant relationships were found between performance on the <b>electronic</b> <b>forum</b> and computational efficacy subscale and between basic skills and performance in the <b>electronic</b> <b>forum.</b> Te results suggest the need to consider the knowledge on electronic resources held by students to reinforce knowledge or training in new technologies, given that the more able to feel, they get better results in activities that involve the use of the computer...|$|E
