He said that if Riis had nothing better to <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> the New York News Association was looking for a trainee. After one more night and a hurried wash in a horse trough, Riis went for an interview. Despite his disheveled appearance he was sent for a test assignment: to observe and write about a luncheon at the Astor House. Riis covered the event competently and got the job.|$|E

25|$|Sufism also notices angels as {{messengers}} {{between the}} divine {{and the human}} realms. But additionally, angels are viewed as the original state of a soul, before it touches the earthly plane. Those who stay in heaven, remain as angels. Angels rank lower than humans, because they are, as already flawless and desireless beings, not capable to love God like humans <b>do.</b> <b>Then</b> humans die, they can return to the heavenly spheres with all deeds, experiences and thoughts accomplished on the earthen plane. Furthermore, angels can inspire the Sufi. These angelic inspirations are also related to Khidr encounters.|$|E
25|$|While being searched by the Spanish, Villers and {{his army}} passed through Eijsden and {{advanced}} upon Roermond. There, {{they tried to}} enter the town pretending to be soldiers of the King of Spain, but the town's inhabitants were not fooled. Then the rebels resorted to their weapons and attempted to seize the town's gates, only to be driven off. Fearing {{that they would be}} caught by the Spanish, Villers decided to withdraw, taking the road to the Guelders exclave of Erkelenz. There were some doubts on the Spanish side about what to <b>do</b> <b>then.</b> Londoño advised caution, but Dávila decided to pursue the rebels, seeking to gain a victory that would serve as a warning for them.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{mathematical}} empiricism, {{formulated by}} Quine and Putnam, is primarily {{supported by the}} indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and {{if we want to}} believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to say why light bulbs behave as they <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the {{question}} may be raised: Are corporations themselves mere grants of monopoly privilege? Some {{advocates of the}} free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's The Good Society. It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation {{to decide whether or not}} they will transact business with it. If they <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.|$|E
25|$|Undeterred, Jourdan {{spent one}} day reorganizing his {{defeated}} army and then advanced across the Sambre on 18 June, reinvesting Charleroi. The Prince of Orange's troops took position at Rouveroy {{to the west}} of Charleroi while Johann Peter Beaulieu's division blocked the road to the north at Quatre Bras. The overall Coalition commander Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld dithered over what to <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> finally decided to help the Prince of Orange. When Coburg's 52,000-man army reached the scene, it was too late; Charleroi had surrendered to the French. As on the 16th, Jourdan's 75,000 troops formed a semi-circle around Charleroi. In the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794 Coburg formed his army into five attacking columns. Dubois' cavalry was positioned near Ransart behind the center together with Jacques Maurice Hatry's infantry division. Again, Jourdan's right flank was swept away by the Coalition attack. Lefebvre wheeled back the right flank of his division and placed it under the orders of Jean-de-Dieu Soult. Some soldiers and cannons from the routed right wing rallied on it. Jourdan issued orders for a retreat but, finding that Lefebvre was still holding on, he countermanded the order. Championnet's division had just begun pulling out. Jourdan directed Dubois' cavalry to charge the enemy; the horsemen were repulsed, but Championnet's foot soldiers attacked next and regained their former positions. After a see-saw struggle on the left flank, the French managed to hold their ground there also. Coburg in person hurled his battalions at Lefebvre but every assault was beaten back. That evening Coburg conceded victory to the French and retreated to Braine-l'Alleud.|$|E

500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't have anything else to <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|While {{aboard the}} ship Greyhound, Newton gained notoriety for {{being one of}} the most profane men the captain had ever met. In a culture where sailors {{commonly}} used oaths and swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery. In March 1748, while the Greyhound was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before. After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours. After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, [...] "If this will not <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> Lord have mercy upon us!" [...] Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge.|$|E

The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy-tale like quality, leading the BolognaRagazzi Awards jury to speak of [...] "the great Secret (that) lurks in the story". It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation. The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh realities that adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings' writings, expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra [...] "Penny" [...] Baxter delivers to his son Jody {{at the end of}} The Yearling: [...] "Ever’ man wants life to be a fine thing, and [...] easy. ’Tis fine, boy, powerful fine, but ’tain’t easy.

[...] Unlike Jody, who realizes the magic of his childhood is [...] "gone forever" [...] with the death of his fawn, Calpurnia retains the secret river and the magic in her mind.|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after Edgardo's birth, the Mortara family engaged a new servant: Anna [...] "Nina" [...] Morisi, an 18-year-old Catholic from the nearby village of San Giovanni in Persiceto. Like all her family and friends, Morisi was illiterate. She {{had come to the}} city, {{following}} her three sisters, to work and save money towards a dowry so she could eventually marry. In early 1855, Morisi became pregnant, as was not uncommon for unmarried servants in Bologna at this time. Many employers would simply sack girls in such situations, but the Mortaras did not; they paid for Morisi to spend the last four months of her pregnancy at a midwife's home and deliver the child, then had her return to work with them. To protect Morisi and themselves from embarrassment, they told neighbours that their maid was sick and recuperating at home. Morisi gave her newborn baby to an orphanage, as the Papal States required unwed mothers to <b>do,</b> <b>then</b> returned to work with the Mortaras. She remained there until she was hired by another Bologna family in 1857; soon after that she married and moved back to San Giovanni in Persiceto.|$|E
500|$|The {{measures}} adopted were insufficient {{to prevent the}} influx of these perceived undesirables, so harsher measures were enacted. Repeat offenders were to be punished by having ears cut off, and, on the third offense, to have the tongue [...] "bored through with a hot iron". By 1658 the punishment for the third offense had been raised to death, [...] "except they <b>do</b> <b>then</b> and there plainly and publicly renounce their said cursed opinions and devilish tenets." [...] In October 1658 {{the death penalty was}} enacted for the second offense in Massachusetts. One year later, three Quakers were arrested and sentenced to death under this law. Two of them, Marmaduke Stephenson and William Robinson, were hanged, while the third, Mary Dyer, received a reprieve at the last minute. Dyer returned to the colony in 1660, and, under questioning by Endecott and the other magistrates, refused to either recant her beliefs or agree to permanent banishment from the colony. She was hanged on 1 June 1660; she, Stephenson, Robinson, and William Leddra (hanged in 1661) are now known as the Boston martyrs. The severity of these acts was recognized by the colonists as problematic, and the laws were changed so that execution was the penalty for the fifth offense. (The poor treatment of Quakers and other religious dissenters would be cited as {{one of the reasons for}} revocation of the colonial charter in 1684.) ...|$|E
