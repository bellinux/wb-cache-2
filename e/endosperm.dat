5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the <b>endosperm.</b> Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the <b>endosperm.</b> This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The <b>endosperm</b> is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to <b>endosperm)</b> depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds are light brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white <b>endosperm,</b> which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of mannanase, a cell-wall-degrading carbohydrase, {{can be manipulated}} in isolated lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv Grand Rapids) <b>endosperms</b> by changes in the volume of buffer {{in which they are}} incubated. The enzyme is produced when <b>endosperms</b> are incubated in a large volume, but not when incubated in a small volume, which is suggestive that an endogenous, diffusible inhibitor of mannanase production is being lost from the <b>endosperms</b> in a large volume (JD Bewley, P Halmer 1980 / 1981 Israel J Bot 29 : 118 - 132). We have investigated the possibility that the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in this regulation of mannanase production in isolated lettuce <b>endosperms.</b> We find several correlations between the presence of the endogenous inhibitor and of ABA, i. e. (a) a `leachate' prepared from isolated lettuce <b>endosperms</b> induces synthesis of ABA-specific proteins in barley aleurone layers, indicating that incubation of <b>endosperms</b> in a large volume results in the diffusion of ABA therefrom into the surrounding medium; (b) fractionation of the components of a leachate by either polyvinylpyrrolidone-chromatography of C 18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography fails to separate the endogenous inhibitor from authentic ABA; and (c) changes in the incubation volume of <b>endosperms</b> result in changes in the amount of extractable ABA in the <b>endosperms,</b> as detected by ELISA. These results are consistent with a role for endogenous ABA in the regulation of mannanase production in isolated lettuce <b>endosperms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Changes in glucose {{utilization}} into CO 2 and ethanol-insoluble material {{were followed}} in whole seeds, embryos, and <b>endosperms</b> of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) which had reached {{different levels of}} deterioration through accelerated aging treatments. Excised embryos from deteriorated wheat seeds had reduced respiration and glucose utilization into ethanol-insoluble material but not into CO 2. These treatments {{had no effect on}} respiration of excised <b>endosperms,</b> although they reduced utilization of glucose into ethanol-insoluble material and CO 2. Changes in metabolic activity of whole seeds in response to deterioration treatments are difficult to interpret because they represent the sum of the changes that take place in the embryos and <b>endosperms.</b> Changes in respiration and glucose utilization in these two tissues neither proceed at the same rate nor go in the same direction during deterioration...|$|R

5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored peas and cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The weevil {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest and lays eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow {{their way into the}} seed, feeding on the <b>endosperm.</b> The weevil develops into a sexually mature adult within the seed. An individual bruchid will lay 20–40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E
5|$|Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of {{mammalian}} chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in vitro, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), {{which is}} able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin {{as well as several}} blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the <b>endosperm.</b> It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.|$|E

40|$|An early-maturity {{indica rice}} variety Zhefu 49, whose grain quality and starch {{structure}} {{are sensitive to}} environmental temperature, was subjected to different temperatures (32 °C for high temperature and 22 °C for optimum temperature) at the grain filling stage in plant growth chambers, and the different expressions of three isoform genes (SBEI, SBEIII and SBEIV) encoding starch branching enzyme (SBE) in the <b>endosperms</b> were studied by the real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) method. Effects of high temperature on the SBE expression in developing rice <b>endosperms</b> were isoform-dependent. High temperature significantly down-regulated the expressions of SBEI and SBEIII, while up-regulated the expression of SBEIV. Compared with SBEIV and SBEIII, the expression of SBEI gene in Zhefu 49 rice <b>endosperms</b> was more sensitive to temperature variation at the grain filling stage. This study indicates that changes in weather/climate conditions especially temperature stress influence rice grain formation and its quality as evidenced by isoform expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hydration}} temperature on anti-oxidative capacity in sh- 2 corn (Zea mays L.) seeds during hydration and re-drying processes were evaluated. Seeds were incubated in moistened vermiculite at 10 or 20 degrees C for 36 h and subsequently air-dried at 25 degrees C for 48 h. Seeds were sampled during the hydration and re-drying periods and tested for germination and physiological measurements. Hydration and re-drying increased germination percentage but reduced germination speed. Marked decreases in malondialdehyde (MDA) and total peroxide contents and {{significant increases in}} reducing sugar were also observed in the embryos and <b>endosperms</b> during hydration. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutahione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were enhanced in hydrated embryos and <b>endosperms.</b> Re-drying resulted in increases in MDA, total peroxides and reducing sugars. Significant declines {{in the activities of}} SOD, CAT, APX, GPX and GR also occurred in dehydrated embryos and <b>endosperms.</b> Moreover, re-drying decreased ascorbate and reduced glutathione contents. Hydration temperature plays a crucial role in affecting the extent of lipid peroxidation in the treated embryos and <b>endosperms.</b> 10 degrees C-hydrated seeds contained lower contents of peroxidative product and reducing sugar and maintained higher activities of ROS scavenging activity than 20 degrees C-hydrated seeds. These results may explain in part why 10 degrees C-hydrated seeds have better initial seed quality and potential storability than 20 degrees C-hydrated seeds...|$|R

25|$|In addition, the <b>endosperm</b> forms {{a supply}} of {{nutrients}} for the embryo in most monocotyledons and the endospermic dicotyledons.|$|E
25|$|In most {{monocotyledons}} (such as {{grasses and}} palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) dicotyledons (such as castor beans) the embryo {{is embedded in}} the <b>endosperm</b> (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination. In the non-endospermic dicotyledons the <b>endosperm</b> is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no <b>endosperm</b> and are also referred to as exalbuminous seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds. All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.|$|E
40|$|Embryo-endosperm graftings {{have been}} made in order to {{investigate}} the possible asexual transmission of cytoplasmic male sterility in wheat using normal (B-lines) and male sterile (A-lines) plants. Fertility analyses carried out in the offspring of grafted plants show that neither male sterile <b>endosperms</b> influence the fertility of fertile embryos nor fertile <b>endosperms</b> restore the fertility of male sterile embryos. Several plants expected to be sterile yielded some seeds having 42, 43 and 35 chromosomes in their somatic cells. A parthenogenetic origin is postulated.

40|$|Protein-rich {{subcellular}} particulates {{were isolated}} by zonal centrifugation from homogenates of <b>endosperms</b> of normal, opaque- 2, and floury- 2 mutant corn (Zea maize) kernels {{at different stages}} of development. In early stages the high lysine mutants vary from normal corn by greater production of a glutelin protein not associated with the matrix. This protein is high in lysine and may become a component of matrix glutelin at later stages of maturity. Differences in size and structure of zein-rich protein bodies were observed in the mutant strains when compared with normal corn. Enhanced production of nonmatrix glutelin as well as the reduction in synthesis of lysine-deficient zein is responsible for the improved lysine content of the mutant <b>endosperms</b> at early stages of development...|$|R

25|$|Inside the ovary/ovaries are {{one or more}} ovules {{where the}} {{megagametophyte}} contains the egg cell. After double fertilization, these ovules will become seeds. The ovules are fertilized {{in a process that}} starts with pollination, which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of flowers. After pollination, a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the megagametophyte. Within the megagametophyte one of the two sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote, and the second sperm enters the central cell forming the <b>endosperm</b> mother cell, which completes the double fertilization process. Later the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed, and the <b>endosperm</b> mother cell will give rise to <b>endosperm,</b> a nutritive tissue used by the embryo.|$|E

40|$|Maize (Zea mays) seed is {{deficient}} in protein and lysine content. Many {{studies have been}} made to improve the nutritional quality of maize seeds. Previously, we reported the role of a natural lysine-rich protein gene SBgLR in increasing protein and lysine content. However, how the SBgLR improves lysine and protein content remains unclear. Here, the reasons and possible mechanism for SBgLR in protein and lysine improvement have been analyzed and discussed. Through seed-specific expression of SBgLR, we obtained transgenic maize with the simultaneously increased lysine and protein contents. High-protein and high-lysine characters were stably inherited across generations. The expression of SBgLR in maize kernels increased the accumulation of both zeins and non-zein proteins. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the number of protein bodies (PBs) was increased obviously in SBgLR transgenic immature <b>endosperms</b> with the morphology and structure of PBs unchanged. The proteinaceous matrix was more abundant in transgenic mature <b>endosperms</b> under scanning electron microscopy. The stabilities of zein and lysine-rich non-zein genes were also increased in transgenic <b>endosperms.</b> Finally, the potential application of SBgLR in maize nutrient improvement was evaluated.

However, endopeptidase activity (hydrolysis of azocasein or hemoglobin) is relatively much higher in the latter group. Comparison of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) -soluble products derived from the hydrolysis of hemoglobin showed that carboxyterminal amino acids (histidine, arginine, and tyrosine), are released when extracts from wheat and barley <b>endosperms</b> are used. With extracts from corn <b>endosperms,</b> much more TCA-soluble ultraviolet- absorbing material is released, but very little is released as free amino acids within the first 2 hours and the expected C-terminal amino acids of hemoglobin are not detected in significant amounts.

The objective of the current study was to analyze expression of the &# 946;-tubulin (TUB) and endo-&# 946;-mannanase (MAN) genes during different phases at the end of development and in different tissues of Coffea arabica seeds. The transcription levels of the TUB and MAN genes were quantified in a relative manner using qRT-PCR in whole seeds, and dissected into embryos and <b>endosperms</b> at different developmental stages. Greater expression of MAN was observed in whole seeds and in <b>endosperms</b> during the green stage, and in the embryo during the over-ripe stage. High TUB gene expression was observed in whole seeds during the green stage and, in the embryos, there were peaks in expression during the over-ripe stage. In <b>endosperms,</b> the peak of expression occurred in both the green stage and in the cherry stage. These results suggest participation of endo-&# 946;-mannanase during the initial seed developmental stages, and in the stages of physiological maturity in the embryo tissues.

25|$|A similar {{imprinting}} {{phenomenon has}} also been described in flowering plants (angiosperms). During fertilisation of the egg cell, a second, separate fertilization event {{gives rise to the}} <b>endosperm,</b> an extraembryonic structure that nourishes the embryo in a manner analogous to the mammalian placenta. Unlike the embryo, the <b>endosperm</b> is often formed from the fusion of two maternal cells with a male gamete. This results in a triploid genome. The 2:1 ratio of maternal to paternal genomes appears to be critical for seed development. Some genes are found to be expressed from both maternal genomes while others are expressed exclusively from the lone paternal copy. It has been suggested that these imprinted genes are responsible for the triploid block effect in flowering plants that prevents hybridization between diploids and autotetraploids.|$|E
