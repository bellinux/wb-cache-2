He {{had decided not to}} {{continue}} in the role if Norwich had remained in The Championship, and would have tried to land a job with Norwich that would have allowed more time to be spent with his family. However, [...] "Relegation was a failure and I felt I couldn’t quit then. I felt I had to do <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to put things right, if I was given the chance.

I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.' So I made sure I did." ...|$|E
500|$|After the December 7, 1941 {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, {{blackout}} conditions were imposed on San Simeon {{because of its}} nearness to the ocean and associated likelihood of Japanese shelling, so before Christmas Hearst moved to Wyntoon with his lover, actress Marion Davies. There, the two lived in Bear House at the river's edge with their pet dachshunds. Davies' cherished dachshund named Gandhi, 15 years old, fell gravely ill during this time; a veterinarian was called and the animal put down by injection. Distraught, Davies raged through Bear House, later writing: [...] "I broke <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> lay my hands on." [...] Hearst's favorite dog Helen died in his arms at Wyntoon; he buried her on a hillside covered with flowers, the spot marked by a stone inscribed, [...] "Here lies dearest Helen– my devoted friend." ...|$|E

The scene they always cut out is the scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine's body and dances in the {{moonlight}} and on the beach with it. I think you can't get much more operatic or passionate than that. I was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life. I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love, not just enchanted and happy with it. It was about the dark side of love; about the ability to be resurrected by it... I just tried to put <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> into it, and I'm real proud of it.|$|E
500|$|Taylor's {{high-profile}} {{verbal and}} physical clashes with Huff were well-noted. [...] "He was always hooting his mouth {{off on the}} field," [...] Huff said of Taylor. [...] "He'd tell me, 'Yeah, you're just a big talker.' He brought the best out in you. He was an unusual player, a great player, but an agitator ... I did <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to that sonofabitch." [...] The 1962 championship game between the Packers and Giants featured hard hitting and skirmishes throughout by both players, after which Taylor acknowledged there were [...] "some hard feelings" [...] between the two. Boxing promoter Al Flora, after watching the game on television, offered Taylor and Huff $2,000 for a four-round boxing match {{to be held in}} Baltimore on January 28, 1963. His offer was turned down, however.|$|E
500|$|Ricky Lee and Doug {{departed}} in June 1992 due {{to creative}} differences. According to Richard, Ricky Lee's tenure as lead vocalist was [...] "a bad time" [...] {{for the band}} given his opposition to Richard's opinions, although Richard was still surprised to hear of the brothers' departure, and said, [...] "I tried <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{to get them to}} stay." [...] Ricky Lee, meanwhile, said that he [...] "was a country singer more than anything" [...] and wanted to eliminate most of the band's hard rock sounds. He and Doug then founded Brother Phelps, which had a more mainstream country sound than The Kentucky Headhunters did. Brother Phelps released two albums for Asylum Records and charted in the country top 40 with [...] "Let Go" [...] and [...] "Were You Really Livin'," [...] which peaked at number 6 and 28 respectively.|$|E

500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> I worked like crazy these past twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted {{to honor the}} people who died during the sinking, so he spent six months researching all of the Titanics crew and passengers. [...] "I read <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of the last night of its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it." ...|$|E
500|$|The next month, Humphrey's rival Robert Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in Los Angeles, {{prompting}} the Vice-President {{to return to his}} home in Minnesota and [...] "think about the next stage." [...] Shaken by the event, Humphrey took off two weeks from campaigning. He met with President Johnson, and the two talked about [...] "everything" [...] during a three-hour meeting. The assassination all but guaranteed Humphrey the nomination. He commented that he [...] "was doing <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to win the nomination...but God knows I didn't want it that way." [...] A large number of Kennedy delegates switched to Humphrey, but he lost money from Republican donors concerned about a Kennedy nomination, and popular opinion polls shifted in favor of Senator McCarthy. In fact, Humphrey was booed before 50,000 people on June 24 at the Lincoln Memorial as he was introduced at a Solidarity March for civil rights. Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson described the response as ironic, given that Humphrey was booed at the 1948 Democratic National Convention after advocating a civil rights plank. He tried to defend his record against the liberal detractors, but often encountered anti-war protesters and hostile crowds while campaigning. At the end of June, Republican Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon assessed the race, arguing that Humphrey would be the party's nominee for president but criticized him for being too closely aligned with Johnson's policies. Humphrey asked for Johnson's permission to deviate from the administration's position on the war for a plan that included a bombing halt and drawback of forces, but Johnson refused, explaining that it would disrupt the peace process and endanger American soldiers. He relayed to Humphrey that the blood of his son-in-law who was serving in Vietnam, would be on his hands if he announced the new position.|$|E

Approximately two years later, when she left school, Bates moved in with Smith {{at his home in}} Furnival Road, Gorton. She had concealed the relationship from her parents. Bates' mother said of her first meeting with Smith after the two began living together: [...] "As soon as I saw Smith the hairs {{on the back of my}} neck went up.

[...] She grew up in Salinas as a Southern Baptist who became interested in skepticism in the 1990s. [...] "I had never heard the word atheist until I was in my late teens," [...] Gerbic told Skeptical Inquirer editor Benjamin Radford. [...] "Once I found out there were other people who felt the way I did, I read <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> on the subject". In 2000, Gerbic discovered that there was a community of skeptics and went to her first conference, Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon a month later.

2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun....

2500|$|Hall {{was offered}} the {{starring}} role in the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket {{in a conversation with}} Stanley Kubrick, but after an eight-month negotiation, a financial agreement could not be reached. [...] "It was a difficult decision, because in that eight-month period, I read <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> about the guy, and I was really fascinated by him," [...] Hall said when asked about the film. [...] "I {{wanted to be a part}} of that film, but it didn't work out. But all sorts of stories circulated, like I got on set and I was fired, or I was pissed at him for shooting too long. It's all not true." [...] He was replaced with Matthew Modine. His next film would be 1988's Johnny Be Good, in which he worked with Uma Thurman and fellow Saturday Night Live cast member Robert Downey, Jr. The film was a critical failure, and some critics panned Hall's performance as a high school football star, claiming that he, the movies' reigning geek, was miscast for the role. A review for The Washington Post claimed that the film was [...] "crass, vulgar, and relentlessly brain-dead." ...|$|E
