25|$|Early on, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that, while Mar Saba manuscript may indeed be a genuine old manuscript, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> contain an ancient or medieval forgery, based on canonical texts. Nor is it established whether the letter derives from Clement of Alexandria or not. Linguistic indications speak for authenticity. However, differences of substance compare with Clement's other writings have been noted. The text contains none of the errors typical in the manuscript tradition. Charles Murgia (1975) followed Quesnell's allegations of modern forgery with further arguments.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} non-literary but graphic {{indication that}} people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth (or perhaps the world) was a sphere is the use of the orb (globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested {{from the time of the}} Christian late-Roman emperor Theodosius II (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the Reichsapfel was used in 1191 at the coronation of emperor Henry VI. However the word 'orbis' means 'circle' and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west till that of Martin Behaim in 1492. Additionally <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> be a representation of the entire 'world' or cosmos.|$|E
25|$|Casey {{could have}} {{commissioned}} the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Billy McMahon, as acting Prime Minister or Caretaker prime minister, {{but instead he}} appointed John McEwen, the leader of Liberals' coalition partner, the Country Party. In this he was following a precedent set in 1939, when Sir Earle Page was appointed Prime Minister {{following the death of}} Joseph Lyons. But it was later alleged that Casey appointed McEwen to prevent McMahon having an advantage in the Liberal Party's ballot for a new leader, since he shared the view of some Liberals that McMahon would not be a suitable successor. This matter was aired in a 1969 book, The Power Struggle, by veteran political journalist Alan Reid. Casey's biographer, W.J. Hudson says (in his 1986 book Casey) that Casey was concerned to preserve the Liberal-Country Party coalition, and that he knew (because McEwen had told him) that the Country Party would not serve under McMahon. (McEwen publicly confirmed his party's position on McMahon the day after his swearing-in.) If this was his motive for commissioning McEwen rather than McMahon, it suggests that he did take political considerations into account in making his decision. On the other hand, if the coalition were to disband, {{there would have been no}} party that could command a majority in the parliament and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> have become unworkable.|$|E

500|$|Stylistic {{comparisons}} {{place the}} relief {{at the earliest}} into the Isin–Larsa period, or slightly later, {{to the beginning of}} the Old Babylonian period. Frankfort especially notes the stylistic similarity with the sculpted head of a male deity found at Ur, which Collon finds to be [...] "so close to the Queen of the Night in quality, workmanship and iconographical details, that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> have come from the same workshop." [...] Therefore, Ur is one possible city of origin for the relief, but not the only one: Edith Porada points out the virtual identity in style that the lion's tufts of hair have with the same detail seen on two fragments of clay plaques excavated at Nippur. And Agnès Spycket reported on a similar necklace on a fragment found in Isin.|$|E

Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even if you think you know what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Polka Party! {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Allmusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that [...] "just about anyone could feel let down by this album." [...] Chadbourne was largely {{critical of the}} parody choices, noting {{that many of the}} original versions would be forgotten in [...] "fifteen years". Christopher Thelen from The Daily Vault gave Polka Party! an F and described it as an album that [...] "seemed like <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> have been the 'last call' for Yankovic." [...] Thelen heavily criticized the record, writing that both the parodies and originals were not good and that [...] "Yankovic [...] going through the motions". Rolling Stone awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, tying it with the 1992 album Off the Deep End and the 1999 release Running with Scissors as Yankovic's best-rated album. Although it was not a critical success, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1987, but lost to Bill Cosby's Those of You with or Without Children, You'll Understand.|$|E

500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties. Martin said {{the song was}} [...] "a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's {{powerhouse}} vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come. This song just feels good to listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's a world away from the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E

Amiga Format said of the game: [...] "with a little more foresight and planning, {{it could have been}} a lot more fun", as the reviewer was irritated by the fact that fuel, armour and ammunition levels were displayed on map screen. However the magazine also wrote: [...] "The bottom line though, is that Jungle Strike is an incredibly good game". Amiga Power called the game [...] "an appreciable shoot 'em up" [...] but said it was [...] "clearly tailored for the shorter attention span" [...] of a console gamer. CU Amiga Magazine wrote: [...] "This blend of shooting and thinking action blends together seamlessly and in the process creates a classic blaster well worth a ride". The One Amiga magazine wrote: [...] "Jungle Strike's a fine game, which will prove both a challenge for Desert Strike-ophiles, and a good solid blast for first bloods". ACAR observed the game's [...] "Good graphics, okay sound, smooth animation and tough game play." [...] Amiga Power complained that [...] "Throughout the game you're battered with uneasily right-wing US politics", while Amiga Format said [...] "jingoism" [...] was [...] "rife" [...] throughout the game. Amiga CD32 Gamer called the plot [...] "typically 'ugly American' idiocy".|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "Saw VI is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. It's {{the first one}} that's more or less {{consumed}} by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." [...] He said, [...] "If {{your goal is to}} do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit, then this may be the movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time." [...] Rob Nelson of Variety wrote, [...] "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with Saw VI, a film so frighteningly familiar <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> be called 'Saw It Already'. At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition", but added, [...] "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous Saw pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best...." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that [...] "while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, Saw Ⅶ will no doubt mark the time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get the ax".|$|E

500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28, 2004, {{when the game}} {{was linked to the}} murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17-year-old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, which police had seized as evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated [...] "I think that I heard some of Warren's friends say that he was obsessed by this game. To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, not a game, and it encourages brutal killing. If he was obsessed by it, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy." [...] Stefan's father, Patrick, added [...] "they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done." [...] Patrick continued [...] "The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops." [...] A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers' Association (ELSPA) responded to the accusations by stating [...] "We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah. However, we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt. The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore its copies should not be in the possession of a minor. Simply being in someone's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events." ...|$|E

By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event.

2500|$|Godfrey and Hemsoll {{point out}} that ancient authors never refer to Hadrian's Pantheon with the word aedes, as they do with other temples, and the Severan {{inscription}} carved on the architrave uses simply [...] "Pantheum," [...] not [...] "Aedes Panthei" [...] (temple of all the gods). It seems highly significant that Dio does not quote the simplest explanation for the name—that the Pantheon was dedicated to all the gods. In fact, Livy wrote {{that it had been}} decreed that temple buildings (or perhaps temple cellae) should only be dedicated to single divinities, so that it would be clear who would be offended if, for example, the building were struck by lightning, and because it was only appropriate to offer sacrifice to a specific deity (27.25.7-10). Godfrey and Hemsoll maintain that the word Pantheon [...] "need not denote a particular group of gods, or, indeed, even all the gods, since <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>well</b> have had other meanings…. [...] Certainly the word pantheus or pantheos, could be applicable to individual deities….
