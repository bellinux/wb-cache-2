Now you know you can’t change the world, but you can’t sit back and watch it implode either, so you’ll do your part, have your own little victory, and so will the next guy and the next, and maybe things will start to change.|$|E

25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else.

500|$|... "Army of Me" [...] is an up-tempo dance-pop [...] and euro-dance song which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of [...] (three minutes and 26 seconds).

[...] Although Aguilera is heartbroken by the decision to split up with her ex-boyfriend, she is not a broken person. The lyrics [...] "One of me is wiser/ One of me is stronger/ One of me's a fighter/ And there's a thousand faces of me/ We're gonna rise up for <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> broke me/ You're gonna face an army of me" [...] are similar to those performed by Aguilera on [...] "Fighter", although of [...] "Army of Me" [...] does not sample any of the song. Aguilera sings [...] "Now that I'm wiser/ Now that I'm stronger/ Now that I'm a fighter/ There's a thousand faces on me" [...] over a [...] "thumping" [...] beat, and belts the line [...] "We're gonna rise up for <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> broke me" [...] on the chorus.|$|E

However, Diefenbaker proved a gadfly and an annoyance to Mackenzie King. Angered by the words of Diefenbaker and fellow Conservative MP Howard Green in seeking to censure the government, the Prime Minister referred to Conservative MPs as [...] "a mob".

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "heartbroken ballad", where Spears {{declares}} on the introduction, [...] "You tell me you're {{in love with me}} / That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me / It's not that I don't wanna stay / But <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> come too close I move away".

500|$|... "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] was {{released}} as the B-side to [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] on December 2, 1968.

Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E
500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> have an injured player. You know I have the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E

These snug 'apartments' exclude the draughty passages and staircases, which threaten your life <b>every</b> <b>time</b> that <b>you</b> run to your bedroom for a pocket-handkerchief in England.

500|$|BioShock uses {{a heavily}} {{modified}} Unreal Engine 2.5 {{with some of}} the advanced technologies from Unreal Engine 3. Irrational had previous experience with modifying and expanding on the Unreal Engine in SWAT 4, and continued this advancement of the engine within BioShock. One major improvement they added was improved water effects, given the nature of the game's setting, hiring a programmer and artist just to focus on the water effects. This graphical enhancement has been lauded by critics, with GameSpot saying, [...] "Whether it's standing water on the floor or sea water rushing in after an explosion, it will blow you away <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> see it." [...] BioShock also uses the Havok Physics engine that allows for an enhancement of in-game physics, the integration of ragdoll physics, and allows for more lifelike movement by elements of the environment. The Windows version was built to work in both Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) and DirectX 9, with the DirectX 10 version supporting additional water and particle effects.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Wallabies coach Robbie Deans and {{selectors}} wagered {{the potential}} returns in finishing games with two openside flankers {{on the field}} {{as a way to}} counter McCaw. In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin, then South African coach Heyneke Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen. Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw's and Dan Carter's career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> go there. The challenge for the other guys now is to try and become as great as him and Dan.” ...|$|E
500|$|Ratchet & Clank was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from critics upon release. After playing {{a preview of the}} game, GameSpot described it as having [...] "excellent graphics, varied gameplay, and tight control". The game's use of weapons, rather than simple melee attacks, was cited as one of the main features that made it stand out from other platform games; Computer and Video Games said that [...] "Going berserk with your giant ratchet [...] is seriously satisfying [...] <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> thump an enemy with the hefty tool, it looks, sounds and feels remarkably solid. [...] What's more, {{the same can be said}} for all the other weapons you collect and use over the course of your intergalactic adventure". GameSpot noted that the player does not need to follow the same paths multiple times, as was common in platformers at the time. Gameplanet said that it was [...] "Quite simply the best platform game on the PS2 right now and possibly the best on any format!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Muskie was {{critical}} of the commission decrying the [...] "over-obsession with secrecy," [...] noting that [...] "there are occasions when it's necessary to hold closely informa- tion about especially covert operations, but even possibly other operations of the Government.

[...] While underfunded, the commission did find that the Regan administration ran a parallel policy directive {{at the same time}} they were publicly condemning negotiating for hostages.|$|R
