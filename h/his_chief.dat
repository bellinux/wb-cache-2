5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in <b>his</b> <b>chief</b> contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's {{advance on}} Dresden, and ordered it {{to pull back}} and secure the breach. On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th {{remained}} near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev. Konev also sent <b>his</b> <b>chief</b> of staff, General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov, and <b>his</b> <b>chief</b> of operations, General Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev, {{to look at the}} situation. Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge. Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence. To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions. Soviet 14th and Soviet 95th guards rifle divisions, as well as the Soviet 4th Guards Tank Corps, were ordered to attack toward Kamenz, Königswartha and Sdier to stop the Germans from advancing further north. The 2nd Air Army was also assigned to this theater.|$|E

5|$|Mansur was {{regularly}} {{assigned the}} tax farms of the nawahi of Keserwan, Jbeil, Batroun, Bsharri, Kura and Dinniyah. Mansur installed {{members of the}} Hubaysh clan as <b>his</b> <b>chief</b> agents in Keserwan, particularly investing sheikhs Yusuf and Sulayman Hubaysh as his stewards. Mansur also became the patron of the Turkmen Sayfa clan, who entered the region as Ottoman levend (auxiliary troops) in 1528. He installed the Sayfas as his subordinate tax farmers in Akkar, provoking opposition from Muhammad Shu'ayb, who was killed by Mansur later that year. Mansur subsequently had Shu'ayb replaced with Yusuf Sayfa as <b>his</b> <b>chief</b> agent in Tripoli. Mansur proceeded to eliminate his Muslim rivals between then and 1541. Among those killed were the Kurdish Ottoman official in charge of Batroun, a couple of Shia sheikhs from Keserwan, a rival Turkmen clan in Keserwan and the sheikhs of the Bedouin Ibn al-Hansh tribe; the latter were executed at a reception held by Mansur in Ghazir.|$|E

5|$|The emperor had the {{exclusive}} right {{to modify the}} law code and issue new laws {{in the form of}} imperial edicts (zhao 詔) and decrees (ling 令).

Any lawsuits which a county administration, then commandery administration, and then Minister of Justice could not resolve were deferred to the emperor.|$|E
5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury {{there were only two}} guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed <b>his</b> <b>Chief</b> Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E
5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (<b>his</b> <b>chief</b> disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of the foundational texts of Jainism.|$|E
