50|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of opposition, either by Iraqi {{planning}} or luck, was the flight path took them directly between the control zones of the US Navy and US Air Force, causing a large delay in either of them acting on the intruding enemy aircraft.

The airfield had been supposedly seized by VII Corps some hours earlier. However Safwan had not been taken by US troops as he had assumed. This caused <b>General</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> to become enraged at General Frederick M.

5000|$|Days {{before the}} {{cessation}} of hostilities, an SAS operator {{was shot in the}} chest and killed in an ambush. The Regiment had operated in Iraq for some 43 days, despite the poor state of mapping, reconnaissance imagery, intelligence and weather; additional problems such as the lack of essential kit such as night-vision goggles, TACBE radios and GPS units, they appear to have been instrumental in stopping the SCUDs. There were no further launches after only two days of SAS operations in their assigned [...] "box," [...] despite this, significant questions remain over how many SCUDs were actually destroyed either from the air or on the ground, the Iraqis had deployed large numbers of East German-manufactured decoy vehicles and apparently several oil tankers were erroneously targeted from the air.

Undoubtedly, the Regiment succeeded in forcing SCUDs {{to move out of the}} [...] "SCUD Box" [...] and into north-west Iraq and the increased distances, for an inaccurate and unreliable missile system effectively eliminated the SCUD threat. <b>General</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> sent a personal message thanking the Regiment and Delta Force saying [...] "You guys kept Israel out of the war."
