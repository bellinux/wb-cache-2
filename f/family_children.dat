25|$|Alcoholism {{does not}} have uniform effects on all families. The levels of {{dysfunction}} and resiliency of the non-alcoholic adults are important factors in effects on children in the <b>family.</b> <b>Children</b> of untreated alcoholics score lower on measures of family cohesion, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, and independence. They {{have higher levels of}} conflict within the family, and many experience other family members as distant and non-communicative. In families with untreated alcoholics, the cumulative effect of the family dysfunction may affect the children's ability to grow in developmentally healthy ways.|$|E
25|$|The Xenopol {{brothers}} were of foreign origins: their father, {{known locally as}} Dimitrie (and allegedly born Xenopoulos), was a British and Greek subject of the Protestant faith, who settled in the port of Galați and converted to Romanian Orthodoxy. According to various sources, including Junimea memoirist Iacob Negruzzi and literary historian George Călinescu, {{he may have been}} Greco-Jewish. Dimitrie opened the way for his son's political, literary and diplomatic career: he was a Dragoman for the Prussian mission to Moldavia, a tutor of the Rosetti <b>family</b> <b>children,</b> a boarding house manager, and ultimately a prison warden. The Xenopols' mother, née Vasiliu, was of Greco-Romanian origins.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>family</b> <b>child</b> {{care has}} the {{potential}} to offer young children individual attention and customized, educational programs to help them thrive, the quality of these programs is dependent upon a workforce that is {{at the bottom of the}} occupational status and pay hierarchy. This report examines ways to promote high quality in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care programs. Part 1, "Family Child Care Today, considers the demographics of <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care, its strengths and liabilities, and the role of education. Part 2, "Strategies for Supporting Quality in <b>Family</b> <b>Child</b> Care, " examines characteristics of appropriate training and incentives for training <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers; ways to ensure small group size and low adult-child ratio; <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care regulations; methods of ensuring continuing professional development among providers; and infrastructure support such as provider associations, resource and referral agencies, and food programs.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care provider characteristics and those of the <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care physical activity environment, determine whether <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers and <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care physical activity environmental resources meet national guidelines for physical activity practices; and explore how providers’ indoor space and portable equipment resources, physical activity self-efficacy and health training, are related to time provided for child physical activity. It is worth noting that many <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers do not meet expert recommendations in a number of important areas for physical activity promotion in child care settings. This study contributes to the emerging literature that demonstrates a need for effective programs to promote physical activity in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care (Temple et al. 2009; Gunter et al. 2012; Rice and Trost 2014).|$|R

25|$|In 2007, major {{retrospective}} of Leibovitz's work {{was held at}} the Brooklyn Museum, The retrospective was based on her book, Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer's Life, 1990–2005 and included many of her professional (celebrity) photographs as well as numerous personal photographs of her <b>family,</b> <b>children,</b> and partner Susan Sontag. This show, which was expanded to include three of the official portraits of Queen Elizabeth II, then went on the road for seven stops. It was on display at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from October 2007 to January 2008 and at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco from March 2008 to May 2008. In February 2009, the exhibition was moved to Berlin, Germany. The show included 200 photographs. At the exhibition, Leibovitz showed that she doesn't have two lives, career and personal, but has one wherein assignments and personal pictures are all part of her works. This exhibition and her talk focused on her personal photographs and life.|$|E

30|$|A {{convenience}} sample of participants was recruited through the local child care resource and referral agency and licensed <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers were invited through flyers and emails {{to take part in}} an online or paper survey. Interested licensed <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers were screened for eligibility (e.g., they had to be licensed <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers and not center providers) and informed consent was obtained according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the sponsoring university.

30|$|Many <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care {{providers}} {{in this study}} were not meeting recommendations for promoting children’s physical activity. While some of these gaps {{may be related to the}} constraints of the home environment, tailored training can help <b>family</b> <b>child</b> {{care providers}} capitalize on opportunities to enable preschoolers’ physical activity by adapting their practice within the constraints of their physical space. Specific strategies include: (1) develop tailored activities that promote physical activity in the tight confines of <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care homes and yard; (2) develop trainings that can influence the integration of suitable portable play equipment in the space constraints of <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care homes (3) Propose creative ideas for active free play even when in a shared space; (4) prioritize providing separate play areas by age group and strategize ways to do this in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care contexts (for example, alternate access to spaces by age); (5) engage providers and children in joint activities that increase provider and children’s physical activity self-efficacy and physical activity participation; and (6) promote health and physical activity among <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers themselves.|$|R
25|$|In 1910 {{the wealth}} of the late Robert Bourbon-Parma was divided among the <b>family.</b> <b>Children</b> from the first marriage, and {{especially}} Élie, custodian of his handicapped siblings, were allocated most of the real estate; Robert’s second wife and children from the second marriage were earmarked hefty financial compensation, usufruct rights and minor properties. Already on his own, Xavier was based in Paris but cruised across Europe. One reason was family business, often with political background; e.g. in 1911 Xavier travelled to Austria to attend the wedding of his sister with archduke Karl Habsburg, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne; in 1912 he travelled via Spain to Portugal, accompanying his aunt during a Portuguese legitimist plot. Another reason was following his personal interest. Xavier seemed heavily influenced by Sixte, who developed a knack for geographical exploration. In 1909 both brothers travelled to the Balkans; in 1912 they roamed across Egypt, Palestine and the Near East. In 1914 they intended to travel to Persia, India and possibly the Himalayas.|$|E

30|$|This study {{sought to}} explore factors that may impact the {{provider}} practice of providing time for children’s physical activity in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care. <b>Family</b> <b>child</b> care homes vary widely in their physical environment and are subject to little oversight and routinization imposed from a director, given that <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers are typically independent business owners. The characteristics and practices of the individual provider may matter even more in this context than in centers.|$|R
30|$|Among other {{physical}} environment characteristics, indoor play spaces and portable play equipment are {{especially important in}} promoting children’s physical activity in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care settings (Fees et al. 2009; Gunter et al. 2012). Like other aspects of <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care environments these are likely to vary widely, {{and we need to}} better understand how variations in these factors are related to variations in children’s physical activity patterns in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care settings (Cosco 2006).|$|R

2500|$|The {{first day}} of Tết is {{reserved}} for the [...] nuclear <b>family.</b> <b>Children</b> receive a red envelope containing money from their elders. This tradition is called mừng tuổi (happy new age) {{in the north and}} lì xì in the south. Usually, children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional Tết greetings before receiving the money. Since the Vietnamese believe that the first visitor a family receives in the year determines their fortune for the entire year, people never enter any house on the first day without being invited first. The act of being the first person to enter a house on Tết is called [...] xông đất, xông nhà or đạp đất, {{which is one of the}} most important rituals during Tết. According to Vietnamese tradition, if good things come to the family on the {{first day of}} the lunar New Year, the entire following year will also be full of blessings. Usually, a person of good temper, morality, and success will be the lucky sign for the host family and be invited first into the house. However, just to be safe, the owner of the house will leave the house a few minutes before midnight and come back just as the clock strikes midnight to prevent anyone else entering the house first who might potentially bring any unfortunate events in the new year to the household.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian subcontinent (encompassing India, Pakistan {{and other}} {{countries}} of South Asia) has a long jewellery history, which went through various changes through cultural influence and politics for more than 5,000–8,000 years. Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years. One {{of the first to}} start jewellery making were the peoples of the Indus Valley Civilization (encompassing present-day Pakistan and north and northwest India). By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic bangles. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the bead trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the <b>family.</b> <b>Children</b> of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age. [...] Persian style also played a big role in India’s jewellery. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.|$|E
6000|$|After dinner (as I {{need not}} tell the keen {{observer}} of human nature who peruses this) the human mind, if the body be in a decent state, expands into gayety and benevolence, and the intellect longs to measure itself in friendly converse with the divers intelligences around it. We ascend upon deck, and after eying {{each other for a}} brief space and with a friendly modest hesitation, we begin anon to converse about the weather and other profound and delightful themes of English discourse. We confide to each other our respective opinions of the ladies round about us. Look at that charming creature in a pink bonnet and a dress of the pattern of a Kilmarnock snuff-box: a stalwart Irish gentleman in a green coat and bushy red whiskers is whispering something very agreeable into her ear, as is the wont of gentlemen of his nation; for her dark eyes kindle, her red lips open and give an opportunity to a dozen beautiful pearly teeth to display themselves, and glance brightly in the sun; while round the teeth and the lips a number of lovely dimples make their appearance, and her whole countenance assumes a look of perfect health and happiness. See her companion in shot silk and a dove-colored parasol; in what a graceful Watteau-like attitude she reclines. The tall courier who has been bouncing about the deck in attendance upon these ladies (it is his first day of service, and he is eager to make a favorable impression on them and the lady's-maids too) has just brought them from the carriage a small paper of sweet cakes (nothing is prettier than to see a pretty woman eating sweet biscuits) and a bottle that evidently contains Malmsey madeira. How daintily they sip it; how happy they seem; how that lucky rogue of an Irishman prattles away! Yonder is a noble group indeed: an English gentleman and his <b>family.</b> <b>Children,</b> mother, grandmother, grown-up daughters, father, and domestics, twenty-two in all. They have a table to themselves on the deck, and the consumption of eatables among them is really endless. The nurses have been bustling to and fro, and bringing, first, slices of cake; then dinner; then tea with huge family jugs of milk; and the little people have been playing hide-and-seek round the deck, coquetting with the other children, and making friends of every soul on board. I love to see the kind eyes of women fondly watching them as they gambol about; a female face, be it ever so plain, when occupied in regarding children, becomes celestial almost, and a man can hardly fail to be good and happy while he is looking on at such sights. [...] "Ah, sir!" [...] says a great big man, whom you would not accuse of sentiment, [...] "I have a couple of those little things at home;" [...] and he stops and heaves a great big sigh and swallows down a half-tumbler of cold something and water. We know what the honest fellow means well enough. He is saying to himself, [...] "God bless my girls and their mother!" [...] but, being a Briton, is too manly to speak out in a more intelligible way. Perhaps it is as well for him to be quiet, and not chatter and gesticulate like those Frenchmen a few yards from him, who are chirping over a bottle of champagne.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to learn whether an index derived from a {{telephone}} survey from the Midwest Child Care Research Consortium was as predictive of quality in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care homes as assessed by the Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS; Harms 2 ̆ 6 Clifford, 1989) and the Caregiver Interaction Scale (CIS; Arnett, 1989). The index was used to examine the relationships between the licensing status, regulatable characteristics, as well as non-regulatable characteristics and the <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care quality as measured by the FDCRS and the CIS. The function of characteristics that cannot be regulated was examined. Correlations revealed statistically significant relationships between the index and the FDCRS and the CIS scores. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that the non-regulatable characteristics partially mediate the licensing status as well as the regulatable characteristics in predicting quality in <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care homes as measured by the FDCRS and the CIS and that licensing was the single most important factor that predicted the quality of <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care homes in this study. The index established from this research may serve as guidelines/criteria for policy makers when making decisions on regulations for <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care homes. In addition, the index may serve as a screening tool for parents to identify high-quality <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care homes when making decisions for child care arrangements.

40|$|Increases in {{the number}} of parents in the paid labor force and welfare reform have {{resulted}} in more <b>families</b> requiring non-parental <b>child</b> care. Most often this care is provided in environments outside of the child's own home. There is also a trend to promote the inclusion of young children with disabilities in community-based settings. <b>Families</b> of <b>children</b> with disabilities often prefer <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care programs. However, limited research has been conducted on <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers who include children with disabilities in their programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the experiences and perspectives of <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers who care for young children with disabilities, using the following research questions: (a) What factors encourage <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers to accept young children with disabilities? (b) What strategies do <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers use to include young children with disabilities? (c) What supports do <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers receive while caring for young children with disabilities? (d) What barriers are reported by <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers who care for young children with disabilities? A multiple case study design was used. Data collection involved: (a) interviews with licensed <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers, parents of children with disabilities and administrators involved in training and licensure; (b) observations of <b>family</b> <b>child</b> care providers; and (c) a review of documents. Case summaries were written for each provider. Then a cross-provider analysis was conducted. All of the providers had some experience or exposure to children with disabilities in the past. They believed that all children were unique and special and demonstrated a positive attitude toward inclusion. Providers engaged in pre-service and in-service disability-related training. Providers and the parents established strong collaborative relationships. Strategies to include the children with disabilities ranged from using specialized equipment to simple modifications. Early childhood special education staff supported the providers in including the children. Other sources of support included membership in associations, as well as smaller informal networks. Barriers reported were related to lack of training opportunities and funding for specialized equipment, the needs of the child with a disability, and factors associated with the business...|$|R
