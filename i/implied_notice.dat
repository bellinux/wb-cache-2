50|$|A {{more general}} class of {{examples}} {{is given by}} the Boolean algebra of all binary relations on a set X, namely the power set of X2, made a residuated lattice by taking the monoid multiplication • to be composition of relations and the monoid unit to be the identity relation I on X consisting of all pairs (x,x) for x in X. Given two relations R and S on X, the right residual R\S of S by R is the binary relation such that x(R\S)y holds just when for all z in X, zRx <b>implies</b> zSy (<b>notice</b> the connection with implication). The left residual is the mirror image of this: y(S/R)x holds just when for all z in X, xRz implies ySz.|$|R

40|$|The Bill {{proposed}} {{consolidation of}} existing DUI laws in Georgia {{and the addition}} of new sections to the Georgia Code that would address perceived ambiguities caused by recent Georgia court decisions. Specifically, the bill was intended to facilitate the collection of admissible evidence by law enforcement officers in DUI cases. For example, the bill proposed the availability of implied consent chemical testing where there is 2 ̆ 2 probable cause 2 ̆ 2 to believe that a suspect is operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of of alcohol, drugs, or other substances in certain circumstances. Further, the bill would have allowed for the admissibility of chemical test results where the defendant driver did not consent to testing, but a valid warrant was obtained. Additionally, the bill would have allowed for the admissibility of chemical test results where the law enforcement officer misread or failed to read portions of the <b>implied</b> consent <b>notice...</b>|$|R

She was a legitimate successor who entered reunion after the suspicious death of her grandfather. She was powerful enough to be considered a potential rival of Vera, but was killed in a match with Guhoo. Her death was the catalyst for the conflict between Rud and Guhoo.Later in Guhoo's flashback it was revealed that Yuri was the reason why Anachelli lost her match, by secretly interrupting the match using her ranged technique without anyone <b>noticing,</b> <b>implying</b> that Guhoo could not have possibly won without Yuri's assistance.|$|R
40|$|Employment {{protection}} laws {{abound in}} the developed world; in Canada they primarily {{take the form of}} advance notice requirements of up to four months for layoffs. Recent research on the partial-equilibrium effects of such notice requirements reveals that they are effective in reducing the unemployment experienced by displaced workers; unfortunately however these effects dissipate rather quickly over time, <b>implying</b> that advance <b>notice</b> has little effect on long-term unemployment. Also, there appear to be few incremental gains to raising mandatory notice periods much beyond one month. Research on the general-equilibrium effects of employment protection laws on national employment, unemployment, and wage rates is much scarcer and at this point rather inconclusive. Interactions between employment protection laws and the unemployment insurance system are identified as an important topic for future research. ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{example of}} Neyman–Pearson {{hypothesis}} testing {{can be made}} by a change to the radioactive suitcase example. If the [...] "suitcase" [...] is actually a shielded container for the transportation of radioactive material, then a test might be used to select among three hypotheses: no radioactive source present, one present, two (all) present. The test could be required for safety, with actions required in each case. The Neyman–Pearson lemma of hypothesis testing says that a good criterion for the selection of hypotheses is the ratio of their probabilities (a likelihood ratio). A simple method of solution is to select the hypothesis with the highest probability for the Geiger counts observed. The typical result matches intuition: few counts imply no source, many counts imply two sources and intermediate counts <b>imply</b> one source. <b>Notice</b> also that usually there are problems for proving a negative. Null hypothesis should be at least falsifiable.|$|R

Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A-, 2 B-, 2 C-, and 3 A-like proteins were detected using anti-rat CYP polyclonal antibodies in hepatic microsomal fractions. Significant (p < 0. 05) positive correlations between hepatic TEQs and CYP 1 A or CYP 3 A-like protein expression levels were <b>noticed,</b> <b>implying</b> induction of these CYP isozymes by TEQs.

Without a loser pays rule, it's cheaper for the defendants to pay trial lawyers protection money to go away. Because no one has an incentive to object, the settlements get rubber-stamped, and the trial lawyers go on to file the next extortionate lawsuit. And we all pay higher prices as a result.In other cases, the lawsuit has merit, but the class lawyers would prefer to maximize their share of the settlement than do what is right for their putative clients: they structure the settlement in tricky ways that will minimize the total cost to the defendant while making it seem like their own outsized fees are justified. The defendant just wants the suit to go away as cheaply as possible, and doesn't care whether lawyers or consumers get the money. The class notice might be misleading: we successfully objected in one case where the <b>notice</b> <b>implied</b> that the class would get $9.5 million (thus making the $1.05 million attorney fee seem reasonable), when the class in fact got about $117,000.CCAF hopes to change this by giving consumers another option: object, with a lawyer standing behind them to explain to a court why the law doesn't permit such an extortionate settlement that fails to benefit consumers." [...] —Frank on the purpose of the CCAF. CCAF has objected to settlements throughout the United States, in cases where class action lawyers receive cash payments but the plaintiff class receives only discount coupons for further products and services from the defendant company. CCAF argues in those cases that few of the coupons are ever used, so the actual payment to plaintiffs is much lower than the stated amounts. [...] In 2010, CCAF successfully objected to a coupon settlement in a Central District of California class action alleging consumer fraud in the sale of Honda Civic Hybrids; the settlement would have provided $2.95 million in attorneys' fees, but only coupons to the class.Frank and the CCAF's position against coupon settlements was expressed in his written objection to the case in which he stated that they often do not provide meaningful compensation to class members, they often fail to disgorge ill-gotten gains from the defendant, and they often require class members to do future business with the defendant in order to receive compensation.|$|R
