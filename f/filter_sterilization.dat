40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} developing a hydroponic recycling system using a visible light–reactive titanium dioxide (TiO_ 2) photocatalyst. We made a sterilization system for the nutrient solution by utilizing {{the features of the}} filters coated with visible light–reactive titanium dioxide photocatalyst. The system is composed of a photocatalyst filter (300 × 300 × 20 mm), a 4 –tier stair type processing channel (305 mm wide, 2, 100 mm long, 30 mm high), a supply tank, a catchment tank, a water pump, a circulation control facility, an insolation sensor, and a data log. We also evaluated the sterilization performance using a number of filters, the initial density of spores in the nutrient solution, the species of spores, flow rates, and the amount of insolation. In the experiment with 20 <b>filters,</b> <b>sterilization</b> performance per 1 filter was 20. 3 % higher than one per 5 <b>filters.</b> <b>Sterilization</b> performance at a low initial density of spores (26 counts/ 0. 9 mm^ 3) is 23. 9 % higher than at a high initial density of spores (440. 3 counts/ 0. 9 mm^ 3). Colletotrichum was more sensitive to the photocatalyst than Fusarium, and the slow flow rate (0. 5 L/min) has more sterilization effects (9. 0 %) than the fast flow rate (1. 0 L/min). The logarithmic relation of the average insolation and lethal intensity of unit spore density is correlated as 0. 926 of the coefficient of determination (R^ 2).

This present study was focused on demonstrating how the model (updated version with uncertainty and variability separated and 2 (nd) order Monte Carlo procedure run) could be used to assess quantitatively the influence of management options. This assessment was done in three steps: pinpoint which process step had the highest influence on the risk, identify which management option(s) could be the most effective to control and/or reduce the risk, and finally evaluate quantitatively the influence of changing process setting(s) on the risk. For Bacillus cereus, it was identified that during post-process storage in an aseptic tank, there was potentially an air re-contamination due to filter efficiency loss (efficiency loss due to successive in-place sterilizations after cleaning operations), followed by B. cereus growth. Two options were then evaluated: i) reducing by one fifth of the number of <b>filter</b> <b>sterilizations</b> before renewing the filters, ii) designing new UHT-aseptic lines without an aseptic tank, i. e. without a storage period after the thermal process and before filling. Considering the uncertainty in the model, {{it was not possible to}} confirm whether these options had a significant influence on the risk associated with B. cereus. On the other hand, for Geobacillus stearothermophilus, combinations of heat-treatment time and temperature enabling the control or reduction in risk by a factor of ca. 100 were determined; for ease of operational implementation, they were presented graphically in the form of iso-risk curves. For instance, it was established that a heat treatment of 138 °C for 31 s (instead of 138 °C for 25 s) enabled a reduction in risk to 18 × 10 (- 8) (95 % CI=[10; 34]× 10 (- 8)), instead of 578 × 10 (- 8) (95 % CI=[429; 754]× 10 (- 8)) initially.

The {{aim of this}} investigation was to test gamma irradiation for its suitability to sterilize saliva and to investigate the treatment’s influence on the composition and integrity of salivary proteins in comparison to <b>filter</b> <b>sterilization.</b> For inhibition of bacterial growth by gamma irradiation, a sterility assurance level of 106 was determined to be reached at a dose of 3. 5 kGy. At this dose, the integrity of proteins, as measured by fluorescence, circular dichroism, and gel electrophoretic banding pattern, and the enzymatic activities of salivary amylase and lysozyme were virtually unchanged. Filtration reduced the total protein concentration to about half of its original value and decreased lysozyme activity to about 10 %. It can be concluded that irradiation is suitable for sterilizing whole saliva in its native form. Saliva, a complex biological fluid, is essential for the pro-cessing of food and maintenance of health in the oral cavity and the upper digestive tract (20). Many of these beneficial functions are mediated by the numerous proteins present in saliva (12, 41) that also modulate the microbial colonization o...|$|E
30|$|PAR was {{measured}} as photon flux density (PFD) inside the greenhouse {{next to the}} culture tubes using a quantum sensor (400 – 700  nm) LI-COR model LI- 190 SA instrument (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). The daily light integral (DLI) {{is the sum of}} photons received during the day and has the unit mol day− 1  m− 2 (Mortensen and Gislerod 2014). CO 2 enriched air, 3  ±  0.2  % CO 2, was provided to the cultures via a capillary tube after <b>filter</b> <b>sterilization</b> (Acro® 37 TF Vent Devices, 0.2  µm) and the CO 2 {{was measured}} by a gas analyzer (WHA- 4, PP systems). The environmental parameters; PFD, temperature and CO 2 were logged with a modified Campell CR 10 logging and controlling system (Campell Scientific, Inc.) that also controlled the CO 2 level. The inoculums were prepared using diluted SL and growing them inside the greenhouse at each level of temperature control. The start concentration was 20  ×  106 cells mL− 1 and the cultivation period was 6 and 9  days for experiment 1 and 2, respectively. For the other experiments, the start concentration was 95  ×  106 cells mL− 1 and the cultivation period was 3  days. The higher cell concentration and shorter time period was chosen to compare the cultures in the linear growth phase (Richmond 1999).|$|E

40|$|A report {{describes}} {{an adaptation of}} a filter assembly to enable it {{to be used to}} filter out microorganisms from a propulsion system. The filter assembly has previously been used for particulates greater than 2 micrometers. Projects that utilize large volumes of nonmetallic materials of planetary protection concern pose a challenge to their bioburden budget, as a conservative specification value of 30 spores per cubic centimeter is typically used. Helium was collected utilizing an adapted filtration approach employing an existing Millipore filter assembly apparatus used by the propulsion team for particulate analysis. The filter holder on the assembly has a 47 -mm diameter, and typically a 1. 2 - 5 micrometer pore-size filter is used for particulate analysis making it compatible with commercially available <b>sterilization</b> <b>filters</b> (0. 22 micrometers) that are necessary for biological sampling. This adaptation to an existing technology provides a proof-of-concept and a demonstration of successful use in a ground equipment system. This adaptation has demonstrated that the Millipore filter assembly can be utilized to filter out microorganisms from a propulsion system, whereas in previous uses the filter assembly was utilized for particulates greater than 2 micrometers...|$|R
40|$|Microbial detection, identification, {{and control}} are {{essential}} for the maintenance and preservation of spacecraft water systems. Requirements set by NASA put limitations on the energy, mass, materials, noise, cost, and crew time that can be devoted to microbial control. Efforts are being made to attain real-time detection and identification of microbial contamination in microgravity environments. Research for evaluating technologies for capability enhancement on-orbit is currently focused {{on the use of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analysis for detection purposes and polymerase chain reaction (peR) for microbial identification. Additional research is being conducted on how to control for microbial contamination on a continual basis. Existing microbial control methods in spacecraft utilize iodine or ionic silver biocides, physical disinfection, and point-of-use <b>sterilization</b> <b>filters.</b> Although these methods are effective, they require re-dosing due to loss of efficacy, have low human toxicity thresholds, produce poor taste, and consume valuable mass and crew time. Thus, alternative methods for microbial control are needed. This project also explores ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs), surface passivation methods for maintaining residual biocide levels, and several antimicrobial materials aimed at improving current microbial control techniques, as well as addressing other materials presently under analysis and future directions to be pursued...|$|R
40|$|Aerated compost teas (ACTs) are organic {{products}} obtained by forced aeration of composts suspended in liquid phase. These products may be biological control tools alternative to synthetic fungicides, because ACTs contain antagonistic microorganisms. In this study, soilborne disease suppressive ability of seven water ACTs, extracted from five horticultural residue-based composts, from an animal waste anaerobic solid digestate {{and from a}} commercial municipal waste compost, was assessed using in vitro and in vivo systems. All the ACTs inhibited in vitro growth of Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia minor, Sclerotium rolfsii and Botrytis cinerea. <b>Filter</b> or thermal <b>sterilization</b> eliminated in vitro suppression, suggesting that microorganisms play key roles in pathogen inhibition. Drenching applications of raw ACTs have potential to reduced disease symptoms caused by R. solani on savoy cabbage, S. minor on lettuce and S. rolfsii on pepper, improved the biomass production and did not show any sign of phytotoxicity. Both in vitro and in vivo suppressiveness of ACTs {{may be explained by}} antagonistic  bacterial communities that provide general suppression activities. The metabolic BIOLOG GN and GP profiles reflected the functional potential of the numerically dominant members of the microbial communities used as inoculum. This study has demonstrated that useful resident microorganisms, including mainly Gram-positive and Gram-negative antagonistic bacteria, are likely to be responsible for biological control activity of ACTs. </p...|$|R
