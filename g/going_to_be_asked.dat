25|$|For a {{young or}} green (inexperienced) horse, longeing {{is used to}} teach a horse to respond to voice {{commands}} and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to {{the feel of a}} saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.|$|E
500|$|On 4 November 2012, it was {{announced}} that McGregor would be returning to Neighbours for one month. TV Week's Erin Miller stated, [...] "Fans of Scott's character, Detective Mark Brennan, will be overjoyed to discover he didn't die in witness protection as they'd been led to believe – and his return could potentially see him reunite with ex-girlfriend Kate". Brewer revealed that Mark's return scenes had to be filmed within a week because McGregor was only in Australia for a brief time. The actress explained that they had to film five weeks worth of episodes in one week, before McGregor flew back to Los Angeles. McGregor told a reporter for The Newcastle Herald that he had a feeling he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> back eventually, but it still came as a surprise to him. McGregor [...] added that he could see himself staying for a longer time, but {{it would have to be}} right for himself and the show.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack for Monaco was {{composed}} by Grammy-nominated Austin Wintory, {{who had previously}} worked as the composer for games such as flOw and Journey. The original soundtrack and a remixed album called Gentleman's Private Collection were released on April 24, 2013. The soundtrack incorporates pianos and drums into what Christian Donlan (Eurogamer) thought was one of Wintory's best works yet. The Gentleman's Private Collection contains remixes of the original soundtrack by other notable composers, including Peter Hollens, Tina Guo who played the violin in the Journey soundtrack, and Chipzel who composed the soundtrack for Super Hexagon. When Wintory was approached by Schatz, he was excited by the request because it involved using humorous [...] "old-timey piano". [...] "When else am I ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to write anything remotely like this?", he exclaimed. Schatz originally wanted to use licensed music thinking that the project {{was too small to}} warrant its own soundtrack, but after discussions, Wintory persuaded him that an original soundtrack was warranted. The full soundtrack and Gentleman's Private Collection were released onto Wintory's Bandcamp microsite.|$|E
2500|$|On October 4, 2011, Fortuño {{announced}} that his administration would hold a local status referendum after H.R. 2499 failed to {{advance in the}} US Senate. In the project proposed and later approved, voters were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> two questions: (1) whether they agreed to continue with Puerto Rico's territorial status and -if not- (2) to indicate the political status they preferred from three possibilities: [...] "Statehood", [...] "Independence" [...] or a [...] "Sovereign Associated Free State". The referendum was set for November 6, 2012, the same day of the general elections. In February [...] 2012, the government board led by García Padilla announced the strategy of the conservative leadership {{to participate in the}} referendum, to vote [...] "Yes" [...] to continuing under the territorial clause and to not vote for any of the non-territorial options listed in the second question. However, the soberanistas countered by openly promoting a vote for the [...] "Sovereign Free Association" [...] option, while adhering to the leadership's mandate to vote [...] "Yes" [...] in the first question. However, García Padilla temporarily suspended Rep. Charlie Hernández when the {{announced that}} he would also vote for the [...] "No" [...] option was made.|$|E

Torontoist also thinks {{it would be really}} enjoyed by kids. (Although a character says [...] "douche" [...] at one point. Can kids hear the word [...] "douche"? Is [...] "mommy, what’s a douche?"

5000|$|On 25 June 2014, {{major news}} media outlets began {{reporting}} that Robert Roche would {{file a lawsuit}} against the Cleveland Indians organization in July. Roche would be suing the team in excess of $9 billion. According to Roche, compensation would be sought based on the length of time and exploitation which has occurred from the use of the mascot. [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> for $9 billion and we're basing it on a hundred years of disparity, racism, exploitation and profiteering," [...] Roche said. [...] "It's been offensive since day one. We are not mascots. My children are not mascots. We are people." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Beat the Buzzer round was {{a general}} {{knowledge}} round, played with hands on plungers. Questions were worth one, two or three points.

If nobody answered a question correctly, the next question was described as [...] "a general knowledge question" [...] and worth one point — but was in fact the next question that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> anyway.

5000|$|Originally, Monaco {{developer}} Andy Schatz {{sought out}} licensed {{music as a}} backdrop to the game's setting, feeling that the style of music needed was too esoteric to hire a composer. Wintory, however, was able to convince Schatz that he could create an original score that fit the project's vision. Likening 2D sprite-based games to the silent film era, Wintory agreed {{with the notion that}} the soundtrack to a game like Monaco should have an earnest yet self-aware nostalgic feeling, stating [...] "There's no way to just objectively listen to that style of music without automatically being like 'This reminds me of a bygone era.'" [...] Wintory was excited at the chance to create an old-timey score with wit and humor, stating [...] "when else am I ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to write anything remotely like this?" ...|$|E

5|$|The Allied {{occupation}} of Japan began soon after. On November 19 the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers issued {{an arrest warrant}} for Matsui on suspicion of war crimes.

He should also be asked whether he approves of comments like this: [...] "A Godless theology of hate that no one dared try to stop for a thousand years produced a harvest of hate."That quote is proudly cited by David Brog in his recent book, Standing with Israel. Both Brog and Hagee clearly identify the Roman Catholic Church as spawning a [...] "theology of hate".This is nothing if not hate speech. There are so many good evangelical leaders in this country — Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Richard Land, Tony Perkins, Gary Bauer, Dr. Al Mohler, Chuck Colson — and none has ever insulted Catholicism.|$|E
50|$|Maintenance {{rehearsal}} has {{the potential}} to assist in long-term memory in certain situations. In a previous study, researchers looked at the difference in recall for a set of words between participants who knew they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to recall the words, in which they repeated the words multiple times and the participants who did not know they were going to recall the words, in which they only repeated the words once. The group that were told they would have to recall the words at a later date, did significantly better than those who were not told they would have to recall (Baddeley, 2009). There is also a positive correlation between the meaningfulness of words and how much an individual will remember them (Baddeley, 2009). The more meaning an individual associates with a certain word or a list of words, the more likely and easier it will be for them to remember them if asked to repeat them at a later date.|$|E

She worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson in her first film credit, the Stephen King-penned thriller, The Running Man, {{in which she had}} played [...] "Mrs. McArdle" [...] and had to say a certain 12 letter hyphenated vulgarism.

I don't know what's so attractive about that, but every old lady knows she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>asked</b> to say the 'F' word sooner or later."
