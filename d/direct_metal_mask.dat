40|$|The {{quality of}} pixels on {{displays}} and semiconductors {{is directly related}} to the surface quality of the patterned <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> used. Burrs generated on the patterned <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> can degrade the quality of pixels on microelectronic devices during the deposition process. In this study, experimental observations of abrasive deburring along with large pulsed electron beam (LPEB) irradiation were performed to evaluate the deburring effects on patterned <b>metal</b> <b>masks.</b> Numerical modeling of LPEB irradiation approximately predicted melting depths and the experimental studies revealed limitations in the size of burrs removed by LPEB irradiation. Thus a LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was developed to eliminate burrs of <b>metal</b> <b>masks</b> regardless of their size. The size of burrs remaining after the LPEB-assisted hybrid deburring process was reduced to approximately 7. 2 μm which was much less than the results of abrasive deburring alone (38. 01 μm). The burr size distribution was reduced by 85 % and surface roughness (Ra) was decreased from 640 nm to 121 nm, indicating a uniform surface texture. close...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Basing on an inert {{perforated}} <b>metal</b> <b>mask,</b> {{a hybrid}} electrochemical fabrication combining electroforming and mask electrochemical machining was proposed to manufacture metal through-hole array with double tapered openings. The feasibility of this novel process was investigated experimentally. The effects of pattern parameters of inert <b>metal</b> <b>mask,</b> such as wall angle, α, substrate thickness, H, hole spacing, L and hole size, D, on {{profiles of the}} resulting holes were analyzed.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a novel}} class of microgrippers is demonstrated by means of bulk microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology using silicon on insulator wafer substrates and deep reactive ion etching. Hard masking is implemented to maximize the selectivity of the bulk etching using sputtered aluminum and aluminum–titanium thin films. The microroughness problem related {{to the use of}} <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> is addressed by testing different mask combinations and etching parameters. The O 2 flow, SF 6 pressure, wafer temperature, and bias power are examined, and the effect of each parameter on micromasking is assessed. Sidewall damage {{associated with the use of}} a <b>metal</b> <b>mask</b> is eliminated by interposing a dielectric layer between silicon substrate and <b>metal</b> <b>mask.</b> Dedicated combdrive anchors are implemented to etch safely both silicon sides down to the buried oxide, and to preserve the wafer integrity until the final wet release of the completed structures. A first set of complete devices is realized and tested under electrical actuation...|$|R

The Ni and Ni-Co alloys electroforming processes are used to produce fine pitch <b>metal</b> <b>masks</b> with high accuracy, which is difficult to achieve by an etching process. However, the shape stability of the Ni and Ni-Co alloy electroformed masks are not sufficient for the vapor deposition of EL material because thermal expansion of the masks made of Ni and Ni-Co alloys is comparatively higher.

Microcontact {{printing}} techniques employing self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers {{in the production}} of <b>metal</b> <b>masks</b> have been combined with CFalOz reactive ion etch for subsequent pattern transfer to sil icon. Sil icon feature sizes of about 300 nm have been demonstrated.

Pafiicularly, nickel etch control and metal feature edge definit ion remain problems to be solved if the process is to be employed in submicron feature production. Nickel patterns produced in the process and used as masks without the gold overlayer were successful as masks in the reactive ion etching (RlE) process. They also appear to give a somewhat improved edge definit ion over processes in which the gold layer remains. 1. lntroduct ion The continued drive to denser packing in integrated semiconductor devices has resulted in a broad and intensive exploration of various means of pattern generation fo...|$|R
