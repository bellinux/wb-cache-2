5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} <b>history</b> <b>as</b> backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence {{of the human heart}} – and its effect on history.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural <b>history</b> <b>as</b> the dominant mode of research.|$|E

Furthermore, the paper shows the appropriateness of Life <b>Histories</b> <b>as</b> a tool to assess the influence of SL in students, as long as the results provide and deepen on certain personality traits, family and professional context, and learning and development staff. The conclusions obtained indicate that SL develops social skills and values in the participating pupils.
