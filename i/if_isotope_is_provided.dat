Samples taken during the incubation of these cultures were analyzed by proton nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy, and proton signals were correlated with the corresponding aromatic compounds or their metabolic descendants. This approach allowed the identification and quantitation of metabolites which accumulated during growth. This in vivo metabolic monitoring facilitated studies of catabolism {{in the presence of}} multiple carbon sources, a topic about which relatively little is known. A. calcoaceticus initiates aromatic compound dissimilation by forming catechol or protocatechuate from a variety of substrates. Degradation proceeds via the beta-ketoadipate pathway, comprising two discrete branches that convert catechol or protocatechuate to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. As shown below, when provided with several carbon sources simultaneously, all degraded via the beta-ketoadipate pathway, A. calcoaceticus preferentially degraded specific compounds. For example, benzoate, degraded via the catechol branch, was consumed in preference to p-hydroxybenzoate, degraded via the protocatechuate branch, when both compounds were present. To determine if this preference were governed by metabolites unique to catechol degradation, pathway mutants were constructed. Studies of these mutants indicated that the product of catechol ring cleavage, cis,cis-muconate, inhibited the utilization of p-hydroxybenzoate in the presence of benzoate.

The second reaction is the proton-transfer reaction between nitroethane and acetate ions in water, and the total kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects <b>were</b> obtained. In both cases, the computational results are in accord with experimental results, and the findings provide further insight into the mechanism of these reactions in water. 1...|$|R
40|$|Pinus resinosa {{stands in}} Minnesota, USA were {{surveyed}} and fine and coarse roots from stands were analysed for nitrogen isotopes {{in an attempt}} to determine if fire effects nitrogen cycling. Fire increased the % nitrogen of coarse roots and changed the ratio of C: N. It may also decrease the depth of the A-horizon. It did not however affect the nitrogen isotope ratio of stands. Isotope values of coarse roots were affected by the depth of the A-horizon, which is consistent with other studies. A correlation between the ¹⁵N values of coarse and fine roots was found however fine roots were enriched proportionately to coarse roots. This suggests that they may be using a more enriched source of nitrogen such as ammonia although this is not conclusive. A PCA performed on site variables and isotope values determined the two major axes for sites were bum history and nitrogen cycle openness but that burning did not affect the second axis. A stepwise backwards regression showed the best predictors of a roots <b>isotope</b> value <b>were,</b> in decreasing order, the isotope value of coarse roots for fine roots and vice versa, the % nitrogen of roots and the age of stands. Coarse and fine roots showed opposite trends with % nitrogen. As the % nitrogen increased, fine roots were more ¹⁵N enriched, again pointing to different nitrogen sources for coarse and fine roots. Older stands do appear to have a more open nitrogen cycle, as roots were ¹⁵N enriched in these stands. The availability of different forms of nitrogen may influence the ¹⁵N signal of roots especially if fine roots are preferentially using ammonia. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} say <b>if</b> <b>isotope</b> values <b>are</b> due to stand openness, or due to different resources use by roots...|$|R
40|$|The {{systematics}} of excited {{states in}} the neutron-deficient even-mass Pt <b>isotopes</b> <b>are</b> shown to <b>provide</b> evidence that a strongly deformed configuration {{is present in the}} ground states of these <b>isotopes.</b> This configuration <b>is</b> proposed to be due to (pi h/sub 9 / 2 /) /sup 2 /, based on proton intruder state systematics and the importance of valence neutrons and protons in producing deformation. It is suggested that this phenomenon is unprecedented and, for the present, unique to the neutron-deficient even-mass Pt isotopes. A simple test of this picture using the blocking effect of an h/sub 9 / 2 / proton coupled to the /sup 186 /Pt core, as observed in /sup 187 /Au, is discussed. The consequences of this intruder state structure in the neutron-deficient Pt isotopes on other observable quantities in this region are considered. (29 refs) ...|$|R
