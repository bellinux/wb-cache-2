[...] As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism: [...] "I have {{a son and a}} daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women's rights, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>son</b> too—I believe in human rights." ...|$|E

His grace is the greatest gentleman in Europe, and I’ll try and make him happy; and, when the king comes back, you may count on my protection, Cousin Esmond—for come back the king will and shall: and I’ll bring him back from Versailles, if he comes under my hoop.” ...|$|E

6000|$|DEAR SIR:--Reaching home yesterday, I found yours of the 23d March, inclosing a {{slip from}} The Middleport Press. It {{is not true}} that I ever charged {{anything}} for a political speech in my life; but this much is true: Last October I was requested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in Mr. Beecher's church, in Brooklyn--two hundred dollars being offered in the first letter. I wrote that I {{could do it in}} February, provided they would take a political speech if I could find time to get up no other. They agreed; and subsequently I informed them the speech {{would have to be a}} political one. When I reached New York, I for the first time learned that the place was changed to [...] "Cooper Institute." [...] I made the speech, and left for New Hampshire, where <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>son</b> at school, neither asking for pay nor having any offered me. Three days after a check for two hundred dollars was sent to me at New Hampshire; and I took it, and did not know it was wrong. My understanding now is--though I knew nothing of it at the time--that they did charge for admittance to the Cooper Institute, and that they took in more than twice two hundred dollars.|$|E
60|$|Some {{men when}} they are under the guilt and {{conviction}} of their evil life, will {{do what they can}} to look any ways, and that on purpose to divert their minds, and to call them off from thinking on what they have done; and by their thus doing, they bring many evils more upon their own souls: for {{this is a kind of}} striving with God, and a shewing a dislike to his ways. Would not you think, if when you are shewing your son or your servant his faults, if he should do what he could to divert and take off is mind from what you are saying, that he striveth against you, and sheweth dislike of your doings. What else means the complaints of masters and of fathers in this matter? I have a servant, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>son,</b> that doth contrary to my will. O but why do you not chide them for it: The answer is, so I do; but they do not regard my words; they do what they can, even while I am speaking, to divert their minds from my words and counsels. Why, all men will cry out this is base, this is worthy of great rebuke; such a son, such a servant deserveth to be shut out of doors, and so made to learn better breeding by want and hardship.|$|E
