25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying cause, if any.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the formation of dilated lateral intercellular spaces in the medullary collecting duct of the rat kidney following water deprivation or infusion of vasopressin. Dilation is conspicuous under these conditions, by comparison with normally hydrated controls, but its appearance is prevented by prior treatment of rats with antiserum raised against urinary (renal) hyaluronidase. Antiserum against testicular hyaluronidase is without effect. The presence or absence of dilatations in the lateral intercellular space correlates closely with previous findings on the ability or <b>inability</b> of rats <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> their urine under identical experimental conditions.

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{regulation}} of the galactose/melibiose regulon rests on a dosage-dependent functional interplay between the positive regulator of transcription, the GAL 4 protein, and the negative regulator, GAL 80 protein. We have used this interplay to select in vitro generated fusions between the yeast ADH 1 promoter and GAL 4 coding sequence that overproduce GAL 4 protein, allowing the identification of GAL 4 protein in crude extracts from yeast. One type of these constructions produces a GAL 4 protein that lacks its normal NH 2 terminus. This protein is unable to complement a gal 4 lesion but still retains a domain that functionally antagonizes the negative regulatory protein. One defect in this truncated protein is its <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> be <b>concentrated</b> in the nucleus. However, the nuclear localization defect is complemented by full-length GAL 4 protein. The truncated protein also appears to effect changes in the relative transcriptional levels of the structural genes. These observations imply that GAL 4 protein consists of several domains, including ones for nuclear localization, interaction with the negative regulatory protein, and, possibly, separable transcriptional activation domains for the structural genes...|$|R
25|$|About {{one third}} of the women {{experienced}} sexual dysfunction, which may lead to women's loss of confidence in their sexual lives. Since these women had sexual problems, their sexual lives with their partners became a burden without pleasure, and eventually, they may completely lose interest in sexual activity. Some of the women found it hard to be aroused mentally; however, some had physical problems. Several factors can affect female dysfunction, such as situations in which women do not trust their sex partners. The environment where sex occurs is crucial, since being in an extremely public or extremely private place may make some women feel uncomfortable. <b>Inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> on the sexual activity due to a bad mood or burdens from work may also cause a woman's sexual dysfunction. Other factors include physical discomfort or difficulty in achieving arousal, which could be caused by aging or changes in the body's condition.|$|E

40|$|International audienceConformational {{diseases}} {{result from}} protein misfolding and/or aggregation and constitute {{a major public}} health problem. Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus is a typical conformational disease. In most of the cases, it is associated to inactivating mutations of the renal arginine-vasopressin V 2 receptor gene leading to misfolding and intracellular retention of the receptor, causing the <b>inability</b> of patients <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> their urine {{in response to the}} antidiuretic hormone. Cell-permeable pharmacological chaperones have been successfully challenged to restore plasma membrane localization of the receptor mutants and to rescue their function. Interestingly, different classes of specific ligands such as antagonists (vaptans), agonists as well as biased agonists of the V 2 receptor have proven their usefulness as efficient pharmacochaperones. These compounds represent a potential therapeutic treatment of this X-linked genetic pathology...|$|R

AQP 2 is redistributed to the apical membrane of collecting duct cells through activation of a cAMP signaling cascade initiated by the binding of vasopressin to its V 2 -receptor. Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of AQP 2 has been proposed to be essential in regulating AQP 2 -containing vesicle exocytosis. Cessation of the stimulus is followed by endocytosis of the AQP 2 proteins exposed on the plasma membrane and their recycling to the original stores, {{in which they are}} retained. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) and actin cytoskeleton organization regulated by small GTPase of the Rho family were also proved to be essential for AQP 2 trafficking. Data for functional involvement of the SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 in AQP 2 targeting has recently been provided. Changes in AQP 2 expression/trafficking are of particular importance in pathological conditions characterized by both dilutional and concentrating defects. One of these conditions, hypercalciuria, has shown to be associated with alteration of AQP 2 urinary excretion. More precisely, recent data support the hypothesis that, in vivo external calcium, through activation of calcium-sensing receptors, modulates the expression/trafficking of AQP 2. Together these findings underscore the importance of AQP 2 in kidney pathophysiology...|$|R

50|$|Diagnosis of {{vertebral}} osteomyelitis {{is often}} complicated {{due to the}} delay between {{the onset of the}} disease and the initial display of symptoms. Before pursuing radiological methods of testing, physicians often order a full blood test to see how the patient's levels compare to normal blood levels in a healthy body. In a complete blood test, the C-reactive protein (CRP) is an indicator of infection levels, the complete blood count (CBC) evaluates the presence of white and red blood cells, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) tests for inflammation in the body. Anomalous values that lie outside the acceptable ranges in any of these subcategories confirm the presence of infection in the body and indicate that further diagnostic measures are necessary. Blood tests may prove inconclusive and may not serve as enough evidence to confirm the presence of vertebral osteomyelitis. Diagnosis can also be complicated due to the disease's similarity to discitis, commonly known as an infection of the disc space. Both diseases are characterized by a patient's <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> walk and <b>concentrated</b> back pain; however, patients with vertebral osteomyelitis often appear more ill than those with discitis. Additional measures may be called upon to rule out the possibility of discitis; such approaches include diagnosing the disease through various medical imaging techniques.|$|R

40|$|Objective To predict {{functioning}} after 3 {{years in}} patients with recently diagnosed multiple sclerosis (MS). Design Inception cohort with 3 years of follow-up. At baseline, predictors were obtained from medical history taking, neurologic examination, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Setting Neurology outpatient clinic. Participants Patients with MS (N= 156); 146 with complete follow-up. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures <b>Inability</b> <b>to</b> walk at least 500 m, impaired dexterity, cognitive impairments, incontinence, <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> drive a car or use public transportation, social dysfunction, and reliance on a disability pension. Results Clinical prediction rules were constructed for the models that were well calibrated (sufficient agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, based on visual inspection of calibration curves) and that showed sufficient discrimination (area under the receiver operation characteristic curve >. 70) after internal bootstrap validation. The models for the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> walk at least 500 m, impaired dexterity, and cognitive impairments were well calibrated. Discrimination was sufficient for all 7 models, except the one predicting social dysfunction (. 67). The <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> walk at least 500 m was predicted by the perceived ability to walk, impairment of the cerebellar tract, {{and the number of}} MRI lesions in the spinal cord. Impaired dexterity was predicted by the perceived ability to use the hands, impairments of the pyramidal, cerebellar, and sensory tracts, and the T 2 -weighted infratentorial lesion load. Cognitive impairment was predicted by age, gender, the perceived ability <b>to</b> <b>concentrate,</b> and the T 2 -weighted supratentorial lesion load. Conclusions <b>Inability</b> <b>to</b> walk at least 500 m, impaired dexterity, and cognitive impairments can be predicted with predictors that are derived from medical history taking, neurologic examination, and MRI shortly after a definite diagnosis of MS has been made. ...|$|R
