The scientifically-methodical creation principles of Control System of Temperature (CST) for the parts of motor-vehicle Diesel engine, the design procedure, which allows to determine the main characteristics of cooling system, have been developed. The made recommendations to design the CST for the wall of cylinder liner allow to minimize its realization period; the experimental data are interesting for the enginebuilding organizations. The results are in use at the ZIL (the Works named after Likhachyov) and at the Zavolzh'ye Engine Works during the design and during the development of outlook internal-combustion engines, during the up-dating of production-type enginesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

In April 1904 a Gobron-Brillié car driven by Louis Rigolly and powered by the opposed piston engine was the first car ever to exceed 150km/h with a [...] "World's Record Speed" [...] of 152.5km/h and on 17 July, again driven by Rigolly, the first to exceed 100 mph for the flying kilometre.|$|R
40|$|A {{permanent}} {{race for}} achieving low pollutants emissions in exhaust gases from the IC engines {{is characterized by}} introduction of new technical and technological solutions in fuel injection systems, improvement of combustion process, after treatment of exhaust gases, {{as well as the}} use of alternative fuels. An advantage in use of alternative fuels with IC <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> propulsion has fuels which do not require greater modifications of the IC engines. In this scope, bio fuels and LPG are the best fuels, especially LPG where good supply infrastructure exists. Use of petrol and LPG fuels operated IC engines, simultaneously, represents the best solution for powering of the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Besides ecological aspects, the most important parameter for additional setting of LPG installation is economical, due to price of this fuel which is significantly lower when compared to petrol. Although manufacturers of LPG systems offer a swift change of petrol to LPG use on IC engines and viceversa, a question on how LPG system influences the basic IC engine characteristics could be asked. Results of research related with the basic IC engine characteristics in case of petrol and LPG use, for pointed vehicle, are presented in the paper. In order to determin mentioned engine characteristics, the measurements of vehicle dynamics characteristics was carried out and afterwords the determination of the IC engine characteristics was done by calculation. The decisive role on these characteristics has the way of introduction of LPG in the combustion chamber and setting of system’s parameters. 1...|$|R

A filling station that sells only electric energy {{is also known as}} a charging station, while a typical filling station can also be known as a fuelling station, garage (South Africa, United Kingdom and Ireland), gasbar (Canada), gas station (United States and Canada), gasoline stand (Japan), petrol pump or petrol bunk (India), petrol garage, petrol station (Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, United Kingdom and Ireland), service station (Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom), a services (United Kingdom), or servo (Australia).|$|R

40|$|Further {{improving}} {{energy efficiency}} in internal combustion (IC) engines is the research-topic {{for a large}} number of investigators. This project covers the integration of an IC-based cogeneration with a vapor-absorption chiller. Heat from the cogen is fed to the generator of the absorption chiller. It is to improve performance and efficiency of internal combustion <b>engines</b> <b>for</b> use in <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Less than one third of the total energy in a given amount of fuel is transferred into the rotational motion that drives vehicles forward. The remainder is either used to overcome friction and drive mechanical devices such as the alternator and water pump or is rejected as heat through engine cooling and exhausted gas. The heat rejection from the exhaust is due to the Carnot law and it is low grade heat that cannot be efficiently converted t...|$|R
