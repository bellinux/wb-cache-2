In this research, a total of 19 <b>fashion</b> <b>designers,</b> educators and students were interviewed. Five on-site observations of <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> and educators were done.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} the diverse roles <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> {{play in the}} contemporary fashion industry. Taking Finland as a case, it particularly investigates how <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> are involved in regional identity formation. By conceptualizing the place-making ability of <b>fashion</b> <b>designers,</b> it adds {{a new perspective on}} the expanded roles of <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> recognized in design research. This is done through exploration of Pre Helsinki, a platform launched in 2013 seeking to internationalize Finnish fashion. This platform, created and operated mostly by <b>fashion</b> <b>designers,</b> serves as a vivid example of the different roles that designers can play. The study is based on qualitative methods, namely, semi-structured interviews and ethnographic observation. Five characteristics of Pre Helsinki and five <b>fashion</b> <b>designers?</b> corresponding roles were identified, based on thematic analysis of the data. This paper concludes with suggestions for further investigation on <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> to establish a dialogue between fashion and design research...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fashion</b> <b>designers</b> {{may work}} {{full-time}} for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', {{which owns the}} designs. They may work alone {{or as part of}} a team. Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers. The garments bear the buyer's label. Some <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed. Some <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> are self-employed and design for individual clients. Other high-end <b>fashion</b> <b>designers</b> cater to specialty stores or high-end fashion department stores. These designers create original garments, as well as those that follow established fashion trends. Most <b>fashion</b> <b>designers,</b> however, work for apparel manufacturers, creating designs of men's, women's, and children's fashions for the mass market. Large designer brands which have a 'name' as their brand such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Justice, or Juicy are likely to be designed by a team of individual designers under the direction of a design director.|$|R
