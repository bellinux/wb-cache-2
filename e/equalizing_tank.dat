The dam is masonry and of earthen construction, with {{a height of}} 34 feet and a length of 680 feet. The water surface covers an area of about 65 acres and the capacity is about 271,700,000 gallons. It has a maximum discharge of 744 cubic feet per second and drains an area of 2.2 square miles. The water from this reservoir flows by gravity to the southern, low level district of the city. There is a steel <b>equalizing</b> <b>tank</b> 34 feet high by 44 feet in diameter connected with this system on high ground 2 {{miles south of the}} dam.|$|E

The level of BOD in the water must be reduced before the water can be released into a sewer system. Currently, wastewater streams are screened to remove large particulate material. The remaining BOD-rich water is collected in a large <b>equalizing</b> <b>tank</b> to help stabilize pH values and control peak flows. Generally, waste streams high in BOD are treated with a metal salt coagulant, some type of polymer as a flocculent, and air bubbles to float the particles {{so that they can}} be skimmed off to 1 Contribution from the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station Journal Series 12, 446.

25|$|In {{the iron}} lung {{by means of}} a pump, the air is {{withdrawn}} mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure. This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs. As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the <b>tank</b> <b>equalizes</b> to that of the ambient pressure, and the elastic coil of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation. However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access. The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.|$|R
40|$|MBR, Membrane BioReactor, is a {{relatively}} new wastewater treatment technique using membrane filtration to separate particles from the biologically treated water. By means of analyzing analysis results from KARV, the existing wastewater treatment plant in Kalmar, from the recent six years and assuming that PO 4 -P in the water from the secondary settling <b>tank</b> <b>equalizes</b> with total effluent phosphorus in an MBR, the opportunity of an MBR to reach future effluent requirements could be assessed. The future effluent requirement for phosphorus is expected to be 0. 2 mg/L or 0. 1 mg/L. Today the phosphorus effluent requirement in Kalmar is 0. 3 mg/L total phosphorus as annual average. Results from data analysis presented in figures shows that with the same operation strategy as during the six evaluated years, the future requirements would not be reached. Phosphorus is essential for yield and performance of biomass in the biological treatment step. The starting position for the work is that the way of operation during the six recent years would have given exactly the right amount of P to the bacteria in the biological treatment step. An increased dose of chemicals for phosphorus removal could lead to P-deficiency in the biological treatment step and thus decreased efficiency. This effect could be an essential aspect in the design of a future MBR in Kalmar...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} development has brought prosperity {{to millions of}} people, but has also left a legacy of polluted environment that continues to impact our natural resources, and ultimately, human well being. Nowadays, many synthetic organic chemicals are of growing concern, because of their high toxicity and high persistence in the environment and in biological systems. Furthermore, the high lipophilicity {{of many of these}} xenobiotics greatly enhances their bioaccumulation, thereby posing potential health hazards. On the other hand, sewage treatment plants (STPs) are the barriers of the environment, where the undesired xenobiotic compounds dissolved in sewages are biotranformed and/or sorbed to sludge. The most common method of sludge disposal in Europe is stabilization by anaerobic treatment, thickening, and spreading on agricultural land or landfills. This yields valuable biogas, and recycles nutrients to agriculture, as well as conditioning of the soil. Problems related to agricultural recycling of sludge include the presence of pollutants, including priority pollutants identified in the EU urban water directives. These include metals, halogenated organics, pharmaceuticals, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APE), phthalic acid esters (PAE), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Metals are currently managed by precipitation, while halogenated aromatics are readily removed by anaerobic dehalogenation. However, pharmaceuticals, LAS, APE, PAE, and PAH are often present in significant quantities in the sludge. Additionally, due to their low solubility most of the compounds will fractionate to the solids portion (i. e., sludge), rather than to the soluble portion (i. e., effluent). As another factor, many of these compounds are inhibitory, and the impact on digester performance is unknown. In this work, we identify the impact of these pollutants on the anaerobic process itself, as well as degradation of the target compounds. For the pharmaceuticals we used a glucose based synthetic medium and continuous reactors operated in a draw and fill mode. For the other compounds we used different types of biological sludge (primary, secondary and mixture) and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Additionally in order to assess their impact in anaerobic digestion process batch experiments took place, for all xenobiotics. Furthermore, organic acids are widely recognised as the most appropriate process indicator. To assess comparative impact separately, the (CSTR) reactors were simulated using a widely used model (ADM 1), and the kinetics were assessed statistically by estimating uncertainty in key parameters. The response of the reactors to each pharmaceutical was different. In particular, triclosan and ofloxacin seemed to inhibit the anaerobic digestion process, increasing the dissolved COD concentration rapidly, This upset lasted for some days, but afterwards, the reactor came back to normal levels of performance. Specific methanogenic activity tests showed that triclosan and propranolol inhibited the methanogenesis step significantly, on the other hand clofibric acid and sulfamethoxazole seemed not to affect methanogenesis even at high concentrations. The relative toxicity of the pharmaceuticals may be different at different concentrations. All pharmaceuticals found to be persistent under anaerobic conditions with the exception of sulfamethoxazole. The other target toxic organic compounds had no statistical impact on performance in the contaminated reactors, as compared to an uncontaminated control. This was not only observed in gas flow, but also by statistical analysis of the dynamic removal of acetate and propionate. However, LAS, NPEO, NP and phenanthrene were highly persistent, with no demonstratable removal. DEHP was partially degraded. The mass transfer rate was rate limiting for DEHP removal, meaning that, the solids functioned as a <b>tank</b> <b>equalizing</b> the concentration of the DEHP throughout the solid particle and responded to the changes in the surface concentration at a slower rate than that attributed to biodegradation. Finally it was demonstrated that applying a post-aeration method for anaerobically digested sludge it is possible to reduce some of the selected organic micropollutants. ...|$|R
