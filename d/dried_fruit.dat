40|$|<b>Dried</b> <b>fruits</b> {{consumption}} has {{not received}} much research attention, although these foods are associated with potential health benefits. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to compare fresh <b>fruits</b> and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> on measures of health, convenience and consumer feelings. An on-line questionnaire that measured consumers' perceptions of the health benefits and convenience characteristics and their feelings about the consumption of both fresh fruits (apples and plums) and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (e. g., raisins, dates, and apricots) was completed by 693 respondents (Polish, French, and Dutch). Generally, fresh fruits were perceived to be healthier and less convenient than <b>dried</b> <b>fruits.</b> Consumers also reported more positive feelings about the consumption of fresh <b>fruits</b> compared to <b>dried</b> <b>fruits.</b> The more that the respondents were willing to sacrifice for their health, the more positively they rated the health aspects of both fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits,</b> as well as several perceptions of convenience of both fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits.</b> Health preoccupation was unrelated to most of the convenience perceptions and was associated with lower scores on several perceptions of healthiness. Recommendations for the consumer-oriented development of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> are also provided...|$|R

5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E

The free fatty acid content of <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was oleic acid (1.95%), followed by linoleic acid (1.68%) and palmitic acid (1.69%).|$|E

Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Traditional English dessert dishes include apple pie or other fruit pies; spotted dick – all generally served with custard; and, more recently, sticky toffee pudding. Sweet pastries include scones (either plain or containing <b>dried</b> <b>fruit)</b> served with jam and/or cream, <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> loaves, Eccles cakes and mince pies as well as a wide range of sweet or spiced biscuits.

5|$|English tastes evolved {{during the}} sixteenth century {{in at least three}} ways. Firstly, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Secondly, butter becomes an {{important}} ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Thirdly, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and <b>dried</b> <b>fruit,</b> together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes alongside familiar Medieval recipes.|$|E

5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E
5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or <b>dried</b> <b>fruit)</b> or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

40|$|The {{dominating}} carbohydrates in fruits are monosaccharides like fructose, glucose, sorbose and mannose. In dehydrated fruits, {{concentration of}} monosaccharides {{is higher than}} in fresh fruits resulting {{in the formation of}} sugar crystallites. In most of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits,</b> crystalline fructose, and glucose dominate and appear in proportion near to 1 : 1. Irradiation of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> stimulates radiation chemical processes resulting in the formation of new chemical products and free radicals giving rise to multicomponent EPR signal which can be detected {{for a long period of}} time. For that reason, it is used as a marker for the detection of radiation treatment of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits.</b> It has been found that EPR spectra recorded in dried banana, pineapple, papaya, and fig samples resemble the EPR spectrum obtained by computer addition of fructose and glucose spectra taken in proportion 1 : 1. The decay of radiation induced EPR signals proceeds in <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> fast during the first month of observation and becomes much slower and almost negligible after prolonged storage. However, it remains intense enough for EPR detection even one year after processing. The radiation induced EPR signal is easily detected in <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> exposed to 0. 5 kGy of gamma rays. Thus, the EPR method of the detection of irradiated fruits can be used for the control of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> undergoing quarantine treatment with 200 - 300 Gy of ionizing radiation...|$|R
