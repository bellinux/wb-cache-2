2500|$|The border {{regions of}} Angola, Namibia and Zambia are {{dominated}} by small rivers which flood regularly {{during the rainy season}} from December to April. [...] Floods in 2008 lasted from February to March and affected 250,000 people in Namibia with 42 people losing their lives. [...] The floods this year have primarily been caused by heavy rain; more rain has fallen on the region since December than fell in the entire five-month rainy season of last year. [...] As a result, the flooding this year has been worse than that usually experienced. [...] It has been reported that the floods could be the worst in the area for four decades. [...] The Angolan National Institute of Meteorology has placed the cause of the heavy rain with a large <b>equatorial</b> <b>depression</b> which is expected to remain over the country until April when it will start to move southwards. [...] One report has blamed the continuing heavy rain on the effects of the meteorological phenomenon La Niña.|$|E
40|$|Cassini-based stereo-derived {{topography}} of Saturn’s moon Enceladus (diameter 500 km) reveals {{the nature of}} large-scale surface depressions. The most pronounced depression detected so far (the topographic model still covers {{less than half of}} the body) is located in a region close to the equator (15 °S, 210 °E). It is elongated with dimensions of 240 km (NW-SE direction) and 150 km (perpendicular to that), respectively, and up to 1. 5 km deep. In contrast, the depression centered on Enceladus’ active south polar region is approximately circular, has an average depth of 700 m, and extends to 65 °S (220 km diameter). While the south polar depression is young the <b>equatorial</b> <b>depression</b> must be old. It comprises both young resurfaced terrain, which has formed regardless of the boundaries of the depression, and older cratered terrain. We favor an endogenic origin of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>depression.</b> It may have formed involving plume related local melting of a 20 km thick water ice layer below a relatively thin (as compared to the dimensions of the depression) lithosphere. Alternatively, it may have formed in response to an intrinsic density anomaly in Enceladus’ core or, even likely, to an irregularly shaped core, which has to have a bulge of 0. 5 - 1 km (which is less than 1...|$|E
40|$|The MPTE/CCE {{magnetic}} field experiment {{has been used}} to obtain a quantitative evaluation of the frequency and extent of {{magnetic field}} distortion in the near-tail region at less than 8. 8 earth radii. The variation of this distortion with Kp, radial distance, longitude, and near-equatorial latitude is reported. It has been found that taillike distortions from the dipole field direction may reach 80 deg near the MPTE/CE apogee of 8. 8 earth radii. The Bz field component in dipole coordinates was always positive within 0. 5 earth radii of the equatorial current sheet, indicating the neutral lines were never seen inside of 8. 8 earth radii. Fields were most taillike near midnight and during times of high Kp. At 8. 5 earth radii the <b>equatorial</b> field magnitude <b>depressions</b> were roughly half the dipole field strength of 51 nT. These depressions are larger at lesser distances, reaching - 40 nT at 3. 4 earth radii for Kp of 2 - or less and - 80 nT and Kp of 3 + and greater...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of an {{extensive}} survey of the magnetic field observations in the inner magnetosphere using 30 years of magnetospheric magnetic field data from Polar, Cluster, ISEE, and AMPTE/CCE missions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the magnetic field evolution during the recovery phase of geomagnetic storms, and its implication to the ring current recovery and loss mechanisms of ring current particles. It is now commonly believed that a strong partial ring current is formed during the storm main phase due to the enhanced earthward convection of energetic ions from nightside plasma sheet. But the presence of a strong partial ring current throughout the recovery phase remains controversial. The magnetic field generated by the ring current inflates the inner magnetosphere and causes magnetic field <b>depressions</b> in the <b>equatorial</b> magnetosphere. During the storm recovery phase, we find that the distribution of the <b>equatorial</b> magnetic field <b>depression</b> exhibits similar local time dependence as the ring current distribution obtained from the combined dataset in the earlier study. It shows that a strong partial ring current is a permanent feature throughout the recovery phase. In the early recovery phase, the partial ring current peaks near the dusk terminator as indicated by the peak of the magnetic field depression. As the recovery phase progresses, the partial ring current decays most quickly near the dusk and results in a dusk-to-midnight moving of the peak of the partial ring current. Thus the loss mechanisms work most effectively near the dusk. The magnetic field depression increases the gyroradius of ring current protons to a scale greater or comparable to the thickness of the magnetopause, which increases the chance of ion drift loss near the dusk magnetopause at larger L-shell (L greater than 5). But the drift loss mechanism alone cannot explain the loss of ring current ions especially in the smaller L-shell (L less than 5). The precipitation loss due to wave-particle interaction is most likely the dominant loss mechanism in the small L-shell as it works most effectively at the same local time...|$|R
