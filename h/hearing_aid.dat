40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>aids</b> for auditorily {{handicapped}} {{people have}} been designed and developed with strong importance place on aspects of functionality, such as clearness and miniaturization. Miniaturizatuion has allowed the easy introduction of <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> However, there are still hearing-impaired people who have an equipment-complex because of the social prejudice against the people who wear <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> We hope that {{in the near future}} <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> will be socially recognized to the same degree as eyeglasses. In order to improve the recognition of <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> as well as to reduce the wearer's equipment-complex, we have considered that <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> need a variety of appearances regarding such aspects as shape, color and so on. This study designs some novel <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> aimed at projecting a pleasant appearance and discusses the necessity of such <b>hearing</b> <b>aids...</b>|$|R
25|$|Disposable <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> are <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> {{that have}} a {{non-replaceable}} battery. These aids are designed to use power sparingly, so that the battery lasts longer than batteries used in traditional <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Disposable <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> are meant to remove the task of battery replacement and other maintenance chores (adjustment or cleanings).|$|R
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive {{when it comes to the}} license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E
5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this report}} is to explain the current concept of hearing {{restoration}} using <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> At present the main issues of conventional <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> are the relative benefits of analogue versus digital devices and different strategies {{for the improvement of}} hearing in noise. Implantable <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> provide a better sound quality and less distortion. The lack of directional microphones is the major disadvantage of the partially implantable <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> commercially available. Two different clinical studies about fully implantable <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> have been started in 2004. One of the most-promising developments seems to be the electric-acoustic stimulation...|$|R

25|$|The <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> of {{this type}} was {{developed}} by Etymonic Design. A little later, Mangold and Lane created a programmable multi-channel <b>hearing</b> <b>aid.</b> A similar approach was applied by Similarly, Graupe with co-authors for developing of an adaptive noise filter on a single crystal. This relatively small chip had low power consumption and fit {{in the case of}} ordinary BTE or ITC <b>hearing</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{reliable}} method {{for assessing the}} correct adjustment of a <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> is through real ear measurement. Real ear measurements (or probe microphone measurements) are {{an assessment of the}} characteristics of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> amplification near the ear drum using a silicone probe tube microphone.|$|E
25|$|While {{the design}} {{approach}} {{is attractive to}} a general <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> user, open-fit devices can by their design have problems when connected to Assistive Listening Devices (ALD's). This problem has been addressed by manufacturers, who provide assistive listening devices that can be paired with the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Workers {{may want}} to wear their <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> under an earmuff. According to OSHA, <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> {{should not be used}} in areas with {{dangerous}} noise levels. However, OSHA allows for the professional(s) in charge of the hearing loss protection program to decide on a case-by-case basis if a worker can wear their <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> under an earmuff in high-level noise environments. However, workers are not permitted to wear their <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> (even if they are turned off) instead of using HPD. OSHA specifies that <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> are not [...] "hearing protectors" [...] and do not attenuate enough sound to be used instead of HPD.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{research}} is to seek the user oriented distribution system of <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> and discuss the effective supply systems in assistive technology. Several tasks for the existing system are suggested by this research. 1. Establishment of certification of <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> fitting specialists. 2. Establishment of accreditation of specialist shops. 3. Public regulation of production and distribution and self standards by the <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> industry. 4. Additional development and reformation of <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> 5. Reformation of public supply systems. A non profit organization should be established, which deals with hearing impairments and <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> as its priority, collects and analyzes information on <b>hearing</b> <b>aids,</b> and proposes a strategy about hearing impairments. It should be independent from any stake holders and should coordinate relative matters in a cross-sectoral manner. 本研究は、ユーザーの生活支援の視点に立った補聴器の供給システムのあり方を検討することを通して、福祉用具の供給システムのあり方を検討することを目的とする。わが国の補聴器供給システムにおける課題として、 1. 補聴器専門技術者の資格制度の確立、 2. 補聴器専門店の認定方式の確立、 3. 補聴器の製造及び販売に関する公的規制および補聴器業界の自主基準ルールの明確化、 4. 補聴器の開発・改良のさらなる進展、 5. 公的給付制度のみなおしの必要性が認められた。聴覚問題に特化し、最優先事項として補聴器供給にかかる関係重要情報の総括的な収集と分析を行い、聴覚障害の対策戦略の策定提言を目的とし、かついずれのグループからも独立して横断的にコーディネイトする公益団体が必要である...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: The {{effect of}} {{different}} commercial <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> {{on the ability}} to resolve front-back confusions and on sound localization in the frontal horizontal and vertical plane was studied. Design: Commercial <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> with a microphone placed in-the-ear-canal (ITC), behind-the-ear (BTE), and in-the-pinna (ITP) were evaluated in the frontal and full horizontal plane, and in the frontal vertical plane. Study Sample: A group of 13 hearing-impaired subjects evaluated the <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Nine normal-hearing listeners were used as a reference group. Results and Conclusions: Differences in sound localization in the front-back dimension were found for different <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> A large inter-subject variability was found during the front-back and elevation experiments. With ITP or ITC microphones, almost all natural spectral information was preserved. One of the BTE <b>hearing</b> <b>aids,</b> which is equipped with a directional microphone configuration, generated a sufficient amount of spectral cues to allow front-back discrimination. No significant effect of <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> on elevation performance in the frontal vertical plane was observed. Hearing-impaired subjects reached the same performance with and without the different <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> In the unaided condition, a frequency-specific audibility correction was applied.

ObjectiveTo assess {{the benefits and}} degree of satisfaction of adult and elderly patients fitted with <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> in a service accredited by the Brazilian Public Health Service. MethodThis descriptive cross-sectional study included 34 individuals with bilateral hearing loss aged 18 and above {{who had never been}} offered <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Scales “Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults” and “Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Version” were used to assess the benefits yielded by the <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Scale “Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life” was used to gauge patient satisfaction. The first two were applied on the day the patients were fitted with <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> and one month later, whereas the third was applied only one month after the patients had been fitted with the <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> ResultsAfter the subjects were offered <b>hearing</b> <b>aids,</b> significant reductions were seen in the difficulties they experienced as a consequence of hearing loss. The scores in the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life scale indicated a high degree of satisfaction among patients. These results were not statistically different when gender and age (adult/elderly) subgroups were compared.
