40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the Leisure Orientation Scale as an instrument, to apply {{quantitative}} and qualitative methods, and to better understand sports participants’ leisure orientation amongst sport college students. The investigation was carried out on December 11, 2006 and the subjects were 115 male and 58 female first grad students in 2006. From the results of factor analysis concerning the leisure orientation scale of 34 items, we discovered six factors. The factors that emerged include：（ 1 ）sociableness,（ 2 ）long-term perspective,（ 3 ）leadership,（ 4 ）altruism,（ 5 ）nature-oriented,（ 6 ）vigorousness. In the next stage of analysis, based upon the mean scores of <b>factor</b> <b>composition</b> items, all subjects were divided into several different groups reflecting their own characteristics or profile of leisure orientation using a procedure of hierarchial cluster analysis. As a result of cluster analysis, five groups were identified. From this was indicated that“the passive group” had a low score regarding all <b>factor</b> <b>composition</b> items,“the optimal group”had a high score of all <b>factor</b> <b>composition</b> items,“the quasi-optimal group”had an average score of all <b>factor</b> <b>composition</b> items,“the self-advancement group”was characterized by selfhood, and“the hedonism/ pleasure loving group”was characterized by sociableness. Due to the nature of the scale and considering the range between positive leisure or negative leisure a gradual strength in the orientation could be measured. It revealed that sports participants maintained different attitudes to leisure, such as regarding sport as leisure as opposed to sport not as leisure...|$|E

Our characterization of constrained efficiency uses the first-order condition of a constrained planner's problem. This condition highlights the margins of relevance for whether capital is too high or too low: the <b>factor</b> <b>composition</b> of income of the (consumption-) poor. Using three calibrations commonly considered in the literature, we illustrate that there can be either over- or underaccumulation of capital in steady state and that the constrained optimum {{may or may not be}} consistent with a nondegenerate long-run distribution of wealth. For the calibration that roughly matches the income and wealth distribution, the constrained inefficiency of the market outcome is rather striking: it has much too low a steady-state capital stock...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{empirical}} {{tests have}} found that, {{contrary to the}} conclusions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, the <b>factor</b> <b>composition</b> of traded goods fails to reveal relative factor abundance rankings. Using a nonparametric approach, this paper discusses the refutability {{of two of the}} assumptions of the HO model: that countries have identical homothetic preferences and identical constant returns to scale production functions. We find that, for two countries, the assumption on preferences cannot be refuted with expenditure data alone. However, the assumption on technologies is refutable even when some factor prices (such as the rental rate on capital) are unobserved. Finally, we consider the refutability of Deardorff's (1982) more general HO model, the main result of which is that the value of net factor exports at (intrinsically unobservable) autarky factor prices is negative. We show that, in the 2 × 2 case, this model can be refuted using just observed data, i. e. data from the observed situation under trade. ...|$|E

The negative wage impact is largest when the South has an intermediate capital-labour ratio, since it is then a more efficient producer.

This study examined the measurement structure of the standard DRS and of an abbreviated DRS form in a homogenous sample of 171 patients with Alzheimer's disease using (a) confirmatory factor analysis and (b) cor-relation of factors identified in the best fitting model with supplementary neuropsychological tests.

Little is known, however, of either the extent or dynamics of Eα occupancy by nuclear factors during T cell development. Using dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in vivo footprinting, we demonstrate extensive Eα occupancy, encompassing both previously identified and novel sites, not only in T cells representing a developmental stage where Eα is known to be active (CD 4 +CD 8 +–DP cells), but surprisingly, also in cells at an earlier developmental stage where Eα is not active (CD 4 –CD 8 ––DN cells). Partial occupancy was also established in B-lymphoid but not non-lymphoid cells. In vivo DNase I footprinting, however, implied developmentally induced changes in nucleo-protein complex topography. Stage-specific differences in <b>factor</b> <b>composition</b> at Eα sequences were also suggested by EMSA analysis.
