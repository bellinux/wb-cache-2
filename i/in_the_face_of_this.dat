5|$|The first subplot {{involves}} the courtship of Mary Lowther, {{a childhood friend}} of the vicar's wife. Harry Gilmore, a Bullhampton squire {{and a friend of}} the Fenwicks, falls deeply in love with her. Mary recognises that Gilmore is a good man, but she fears that she does not adore him as a woman should adore the man she marries. The Fenwicks and her guardian aunt all urge her to accept his proposal, telling her that the affection she does not now feel will come after marriage. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> advice, she does not reject Gilmore outright, but asks for time to consider.|$|E
5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} prosecution witness, a servant {{of one of}} the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E

5|$|By late 1916, most {{settlers}} in the colony who were inclined to volunteer had already done so. To free up white manpower, some suggested the recruitment of older men for local service so more of the younger volunteers could go overseas. In 1917, the Chartered Company set up a committee to consider the question of national defence both {{during the war and}} thereafter; its report, released in February 1918, described reliance on volunteers as inefficient, and recommended the institution of compulsory service for whites, even after the war (no mention was made of using black troops in the future). The Company published proposals the following month to register all white males aged between 18 and 65 with a view to some form of conscription, but this provoked widespread and vocal dissent, particularly from farmers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> opposition the administration vacillated until it quietly dropped the idea after the armistice.|$|E
5|$|Melgares was {{the first}} to arrive at the village. His journey north had not been easy. Mutiny had broken out and been {{suppressed}} among his New Mexican militia; and many of his horses had gone lame, or had been stolen by Pawnee raiders. He had left 240 of his men on the Arkansas in southern Kansas before turning northward with the other half of his force. In the Republican village, he met with Kitkehahki and Chaui leaders, to whom he presented gifts, including Spanish flags. The Pawnees agreed to expel Americans from their territory, but also opposed the Melgares expedition's continuing to the Missouri River. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> opposition, and with no supply lines and a force too large to live off the country, Melgares returned to the Arkansas and thence to Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{knew that}} the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a {{head-to-head}} battle, so he planned to lure {{it away from the}} English Channel through diversionary tactics. The main strategic idea involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threatening to attack the West Indies. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken their defense of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet {{to take control of the}} channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade. However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805. French Admiral Villeneuve then retreated to Cádiz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|On 21 January 1984 the Yorkshire Club committee, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> rising pressure, {{agreed to}} offer Boycott a {{contract}} for 1984. Several members of the committee, including Trueman, Billy Sutcliffe and Ronnie Burnet, resigned. Of the replacement members, 17 were from the Members 84 Group, and Boycott himself was elected, leaving him with both {{a position on the}} team and on the Yorkshire Club committee. The 1984 season was, however, not the most prolific for Boycott. McKinstry records that he scored slowly in several matches: 60 in 52 overs against Somerset; 53 in 51 overs against Hampshire; 17 in 26 overs against Leicestershire; 77 in 67 overs against Sussex. This was coupled with continued friction between himself and both players and club members. In particular, Boycott's place on both the team and the committee led to feelings of distrust from both – though Boycott denies this – which led to the loss of support from long-term ally Sid Fielden.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body {{responsible}} for local government) was already engaged in a debate {{about the future of the}} city's defensive walls. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.|$|E
5|$|Early on 7 April, {{reconnaissance}} {{units of}} the XLVI Motorised Corps crossed the Mura at Letenye and Mursko Središće and captured Čakovec. Ustaše propaganda led the bulk of two regiments from the 42nd Infantry Division Murska to revolt; only two battalions deployed to their allocated positions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> German advance, Yugoslav border troops withdrew towards the Drava. The following day, {{in the areas of}} the 42nd Infantry Division Murska and Detachment Ormozki on the left flank of the 4th Army, the Germans cleared the territory north of the Drava, and border guard units were withdrawn south of the river. On this day, the 39th Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 42nd Infantry Division Murska from the Detachment Ormozki, and the 36th Infantry Regiment of the former joined the 27th Infantry Division Savska. The Mura sector was quiet on 9 April. The 42nd Infantry Division Murska took the 39th Infantry Regiment under command, but another of its infantry regiments and the border guards in the divisional sector began to disintegrate due to desertions. With the deteriorating situation on the right flank of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska, 4th Army headquarters ordered it and Detachment Ormozki to withdraw from the Drava to behind the Bednja river to conform to the line being held by the 27th Infantry Division Savska on its immediate right flank.|$|E
