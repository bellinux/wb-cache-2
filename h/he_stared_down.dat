60|$|Seeing him relapse into silence, I did not speak. For {{the space}} of half an hour <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> the river, and I {{knew that he was}} looking vainly for the Willing.|$|E
6000|$|Peter was puzzled. He {{showed it}} as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at Mrs. Teeter {{just in front}} of him. [...] "I don't see any nest or eggs or anything," [...] said he rather testily.|$|E
6000|$|Thurston's tone carried {{conviction}} with it, but Savine cut him short. [...] "It is {{the practical}} aspect {{that appeals to}} me," [...] he said. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at the river for several minutes before he asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Then, motionless, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> at his brother's open, [...] sightless eyes. Suddenly he wets {{his finger}} and holds it to the [...] girl's lips, then to LARRY'S.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He raves, alas!" [...] said Catharine. [...] "Haste to call some help. He {{will not}} harm me; but I fear {{he will do}} evil to himself. See how <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> on the roaring waterfall!" ...|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{postcard}} of "corrida de toros. " Two matadors, a banderilleros {{and two men}} {{on horseback}} are in the ring with the bull who has a banderilla sticking in its neck. The banderilleros holds two additional banderillas above his head as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> the bull. A crowd watches from behind a stick fence in the background...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{long time}} Conger said nothing. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at the bones, dimly visible in the recess of the wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he be stalked, brought down? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remarked to}} Mr. Pike {{that the men}} seemed thinner and weaker than when they came on board, and he delayed {{replying}} for a moment while <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at them with that cattle-buyer's eye of his.|$|E
6000|$|Corporal Westerburg hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at the floor, {{then out}} the window at the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up, getting slowly to his feet. [...] "I can't even tell you that, sir," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{is notable}} for the catchphrase, [...] "Go ahead, make my day", which is uttered by Clint Eastwood's gun-wielding {{character}} {{in the beginning of}} the film as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> an armed robber who is holding a hostage. That phrase, although in its Italian localization [...] "Coraggio... fatti ammazzare" [...] ("come on, let me kill you"), was also chosen as the title for the Italian version of the film.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes he poised {{himself in}} the air, {{listening}} intently with {{his hand to his}} ear, and again <b>he</b> would <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again.|$|R
50|$|Enraged, Gerardo {{attempts}} to throw Miranda from the cliff, only {{to realize he}} cannot bring himself to take a life. Paulina apparently accepts the confession, and they both leave Miranda on the cliff as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> at the water. The camera simulates someone falling off the cliff as seen from his own point of view. In the final scene, Paulina and Gerardo are at the same concert where the film began with Miranda also present, looking down {{with his wife and}} sons. Paulina and Miranda cast uncomfortable glances at each other, and look away. Miranda glances down at the couple again as the camera shows Gerardo glancing up towards the balcony at the now off-screen Miranda.|$|R
6000|$|Ezra Girdlestone {{remained}} behind, stretching {{his legs}} In {{front of the}} empty grate. [...] "The governor is a hard nail," [...] he soliloquized, as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at the shining steel bars. [...] "Depend upon it, though, he feels this more than he shows. Why, it's the only friend he ever had in the world--or ever will have, in all probability. However, it's no business of mine," [...] with which comforting reflection he began to whistle as he turned over {{the pages of the}} private day-book of the firm.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> {{the long}} dark doorway a minute. Then {{he made up}} his mind. [...] "I'll go down and make Peter a call, and I won't bother to knock," [...] he chuckled, and poked his head inside the doorway. But that {{was as far as}} Jimmy Skunk went. Yes, Sir, that was just as far as Jimmy Skunk went. You see, no sooner did he start to enter that old house of Johnny Chuck's than he was met by a lot of those Yellow Jackets, and they were in a very bad temper.|$|E
6000|$|So it {{had come}} to this--and she had not seen it coming. She looked into the glowing {{recesses}} of the fire before her and controlled her voice by an effort. [...] "I'd be glad for you to do it, dear--if you loved her," [...] she said very quietly. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at her for a moment; then he knelt down beside her and took her hand and kissed it. [...] "My dear," [...] she whispered softly, stroking his head, and her tears came streaming. For a time they said no more.|$|E
60|$|Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled {{expression}} on her face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she {{did not seem to}} be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> blankly <b>down</b> the staircase.|$|R
60|$|Jim's eyes bugged out, and <b>he</b> {{begun to}} <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> {{with no end}} of interest, because that was where his originals come from; but I didn't more than half believe it. I couldn't, you know; it seemed too awful far away {{for us to have}} traveled.|$|R
5000|$|As a player, Miller {{was known}} for his {{unconventional}} style. He would often drive to the basket, seemingly out of control, and put up one-handed shots high off the backboard. Other times, <b>he</b> would <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> his defender as if he was about to penetrate, only to launch a quick three-pointer instead. [...] In February 2006, Miller was named to Butler's [...] "Team of the Sesquicentennial", an honorary team of the university's 15 all-time greatest players, marking the school's 150th anniversary.|$|R
60|$|I {{think of}} young Caddles always {{as he was}} seen in the New Kent Road, the sunset warm upon his perplexed and staring face. The Road was thick with its varied traffic, omnibuses, trams, vans, carts, trolleys, cyclists, motors, and a marvelling crowd--loafers, women, nurse-maids, {{shopping}} women, children, venturesome hobble-dehoys--gathered behind his gingerly moving feet. The hoardings were untidy everywhere with the tattered election paper. A babblement of voices surged about him. One sees the customers and shopmen crowding in the doorways of the shops, the faces that came and went at the windows, the little street boys running and shouting, the policemen taking it all quite stiffly and calmly, the workmen knocking off upon scaffoldings, the seething miscellany of the little folks. They shouted to him, vague encouragement, vague insults, the imbecile catchwords of the day, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at them, at such a multitude of living creatures as he had never before imagined in the world.|$|E
60|$|Gale {{found his}} legs shaking under him; {{and he sat}} down, trying {{to take all the}} bits of stone into his lap. His fingers were all thumbs as with knife blade he dug into the black pieces of rock. He found gold. Then <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> the slope, down into the valley with its river winding forlornly away into the desert. But he did not see any of that. Here was reality as sweet, as wonderful, as saving as a dream come true. Yaqui had led him to a ledge of gold. Gale had learned enough about mineral to know that this was a rich strike. All in a second he was {{speechless}} with the joy of it. But his mind whirled in thought about this strange and noble Indian, who seemed never to be able to pay a debt. Belding and the poverty that had come to him! Nell, who had wept over the loss of a spring! Laddy, who never could ride again! Jim Lash, who swore he would always look after his friend! Thorne and Mercedes! All these people, who had been good to him and whom he loved, were poor. But now they would be rich. They would one and all be his partners. He had discovered the source of Forlorn River, and was rich in water. Yaqui had made him rich in gold. Gale wanted to rush down the slope, down into the valley, and tell his wonderful news.|$|E
6000|$|So {{he looked}} past {{them into the}} temple halls; into a lustrous abyss of cool green shade, {{deepening}} on and inward, pillar after pillar, vista after vista, into deepest night. And dimly through the gloom he could descry, on every wall and column, gorgeous arabesques, long lines of pictured story; triumphs and labours; rows of captives in foreign and fantastic dresses, leading strange animals, bearing the tributes of unknown lands; rows of ladies at feasts, their heads crowned with garlands, the fragrant lotus-flower in every hand, while slaves brought wine and perfumes, and children sat upon their knees, and husbands by their side; and dancing girls, in transparent robes and golden girdles, tossed their tawny limbs wildly among the throng.... What was the meaning of it all? Why had it all been? Why had it gone on thus, the great world, century after century, millennium after millennium, eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, and knowing nothing better.... how could they know anything better? Their forefathers had lost the light ages and ages before they were born.... And Christ had not come for ages and ages after they were dead.... How could they know?.... And yet {{they were all in}} hell.... every one of them. Every one of these ladies who sat there, with her bushy locks, and garlands, and jewelled collars, and lotus-flowers, and gauzy dress, displaying all her slender limbs-who, perhaps, when she was alive, smiled so sweetly, and went so gaily, and had children, and friends, and never once thought of {{what was going to happen}} to her--what must happen to her.... She was in hell.... Burning for ever, and ever, and ever, there below his feet. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> on the rocky floors. If he could but see through them.... and the eye of faith could see through them.... he should behold her writhing and twisting among the flickering flame, scorched, glowing.... in everlasting agony, such as the thought of enduring for a moment made him shudder. He had burnt his hands once, when a palm-leaf but caught fire.... He recollected what that was like.... She was enduring ten thousand times more than that for ever. He should hear her shrieking in vain for a drop of water to cool her tongue.... He had never heard a human being shriek but once.... a boy bathing on the opposite Nile bank, whom a crocodile had dragged down.... and that scream, faint and distant as it came across the mighty tide, had rung intolerable in his ears for days.... and to think of all which echoed through those vaults of fire-for ever! Was the thought bearable!--was it possible! Millions upon millions burning forever for Adam's fall .... Could God be just in that?....|$|E
6000|$|... “My own {{notion is}} that Dan {{began to go}} mad in his head from that hour. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> up and <b>down</b> like a stuck pig. Then he was all for walking back alone and killing the priests with his bare hands; which he could have done. ‘An Emperor am I,’ says Daniel, ‘and next year I shall be a Knight of the Queen.|$|R
50|$|Gonzalo's family {{witnesses}} the CIA-backed {{military coup}} of 1973, where Salvador Allende commits suicide and Augusto Pinochet takes over. After Father McEnroe {{is removed from}} the now militarized school, he visits the worship performed by a new priest, consumes the sacramental bread to save it from desecration and declares the ground to be desecrated. Machuca leads the other students in honoring the priest and is expelled. Gonzalo tries to visit the shantytown where Pedro and Silvana live but arrives to find it being destroyed by the soldiers. He then witnesses a soldier murdering Silvana. Himself being dragged into the conflict, Gonzalo convinces a soldier that he is not from the shantytown due to his nice clothing and fair complexion, and is forced to abandon his friend. He returns to his family's new home, which is now even more opulent thanks to his mother's lover and the new redistribution of wealth under the new government. He remains distraught over the events he has witnessed as he remembers his friends as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> at the ruins of their homes. The 17 years of Chilean dictatorship, in which 250,000 Chileans were detained, have begun.|$|R
60|$|If a rag-picker {{had offered}} to do a {{diplomatic}} service for the Emperor of Russia, the monarch {{could not have been}} more astounded than the mate was. He even stopped swearing. <b>He</b> stood and <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at me. It took him ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again. Then he said impressively: 'Well, if this don't beat hell!' and turned to his work with the air of a man who had been confronted with a problem too abstruse for solution.|$|R
50|$|When Avacyn's thaumaturgy reached him, Garruk {{regained his}} senses. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at his arms, {{watching}} the black veins receding from his skin. He was overcome with joy at the sudden absence {{of pain and}} sickness. But the relief was short-lived. Within seconds the veins reappeared, his blood seemed to thicken to tar, and his back bent {{under the weight of}} the Veil's curse once again. The Cursemute was enough to bring him back from madness and death, but it was not enough to cure him.|$|E
5000|$|Alex Hardy in The Times {{was less}} critical, giving the show four stars {{out of five}} and saying that [...] "this fact-based drama managed to balance tragedy with optimism", but added that it [...] "inevitably {{contained}} elements of soap". The Daily Mail gave it five stars out of five, praising it because, [...] "Unlike so many detective dramas, Code Of A Killer managed to avoid mortuary porn. There was no naked body on a morgue slab. In fact, we never saw the victims - just Threlfall’s face as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at the corpses, his mouth twisting in anger and disgust. That {{was so much more}} chilling." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{they get}} onto the {{elevator}}, Lester stops {{the elevator door}} {{at the last second}} and enters. He demands that Malvo recognize him, saying the [...] "new Lester" [...] will not let things slide as easily. Malvo tells him to stop talking, and <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> Lester <b>down</b> and asks if this is what he wants. Lester is confused and Malvo repeats the question, asking [...] "Yes or no?". Lester says yes, and Malvo shoots Burt, Louise, and Jemma in the head. He tells Lester that their deaths are on him. As they continue to ride the elevator, Malvo explains that he had been working Burt for six months {{in order to get to}} his brother, who apparently has a $100,000 bounty which has now gone to waste. The elevator arrives at a service floor and Malvo asks Lester to help move the bodies to the dumpster. Instead, Lester hits Malvo with his award and runs away. Malvo, smiling, watches Lester run away and says that he'll see him soon.|$|R
50|$|Film Comment did {{say some}} {{positive}} things:Almost {{all that remains}} is Hill-mounted and obviously well-directed. The dialogue has the snap of his rewrites; the action plays with an extraordinary vividness {{and a sense of}} grim veracity; the performances transcend genre, a Hill trademark. The cinematography... is clean, handsome, sparkling, tight. And the visual effects complement the story, a sci-fi rarity; they're glowing, ethereal and fibulating, matching the movie's dreamy psychosexual drama. In short, the released Supernova is still a good movie - not nearly the artistic disaster prophesied, indeed, preordained by the studio when it jettisoned its own product into cold space... However Coppola's version disconnects Hill's delicately drawn relationships and ruptures the film's thematic and stylistic unity. Coppola loses sight of Hill's visual echoes... Kaela's become a typically less interesting Coppola woman, rather than a strong dame in the Hill style. Vanzant's roughneck bearing, fearlessness and slightly alienated seething places him squarely in Hill's heroic tradition, but the changes alter the audience response to him too, weakening a literal turning point, when <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>down</b> Troy/Karl, defending the honor of the crew and distinguishing their mission of mercy from his greed.Coppola's cruelest cuts eviscerate Hill's action direction, desecrate his modern transitional flow and emasculate the fight sequences. Somebody had to finish the movie, but getting Coppola to improve Hill's action is trading one director's proven strength for another's historic weakness. In Hill's manner, as edited by the amazing Freeman Davies (who also removed his name), the fights are properly built up, interconnected seamlessly and finished with Hill's trademark punishing violence: twofisted skull-busts, point-blank bullets to the face, men thrown through parallel planes of glass. Hill's movie climaxes to conclusion; Coppola's peters out. It took only a few months for Coppola's apocalypse to write the takeover, makeover and manifest destiny of Hill's Supernova, which has been consigned to the void.. MGM's befuddling dismissal of Hill's superior version makes his current voluntary hiatus - prompted by his dismay at Hollywood's insistence on dumping down its own product - perfectly understandable. If this is the future of filmmaking in America, to hell with it all.|$|R
50|$|Galesh (First Appearance: AJB Vol. 1 #2) is an Angel {{who gave}} up his wings to walk the Earth among men centuries ago. During a raid on a Caravan he got hit {{over the head with}} a rock and forgot all about his angelic nature. He was taken Prisoner by a king, and bled to prolong the King's daughters' life. After {{escaping}} he vowed to take revenge on man for the crimes against him. He joined up with Strohm, the architect of the tower of Babel, and set out to create a tower of Babel in reverse to end humanity. He got stopped and entombed but the bad news is he's out and about again, and honestly I'd be more than a little worried. During the Island of Maru incident <b>he</b> had a <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> with Gabe and stole his leather jacket and Gabe's vowed to get it back.|$|R
5000|$|The American {{nation was}} {{at risk in}} the most serious crisis of the Jacksonian era. The [...] "Nullification Crisis" [...] of 1828-1832 merged issues of {{sectional}} strife with disagreements over tariffs and escalated into threats of secession by one state or military intervention by President Jackson. Southern politicians complained that high tariffs imposed by the new tariff (the [...] "Tariff of Abominations" [...] they called it) on imports of common manufactured goods made in Europe made those goods more expensive than ones from the northern U.S., raising the prices paid by planters in the South. Southern politicians argued that tariffs benefited northern industrialists {{at the expense of}} southern farmers. The issue escalated to a major crisis when Vice President Calhoun, in the South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, supported the claim of his home state, South Carolina, that it had the right to [...] "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828, and more generally the right of a state to nullify any Federal laws that went against its interests. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. <b>He</b> tried to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> Calhoun, and found himself trying to <b>stare</b> <b>down</b> the entire state of South Carolina.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> at {{the open}} sea, his arms crossed, with a {{reflective}} fierceness. His very appearance made him utterly different from everyone on board that vessel. The grey shirt, the blue sash, one rolled-up sleeve baring a sculptural forearm, the negligent masterfulness of his tone and pose were very distasteful to Mr. Travers, who, having {{made up his mind}} to wait for some kind of official assistance, regarded the intrusion of that inexplicable man with suspicion. From the moment Lingard came on board the yacht, every eye in that vessel had been fixed upon him. Only Carter, within earshot and leaning with his elbow upon the rail, <b>stared</b> <b>down</b> at the deck as if overcome with drowsiness or lost in thought.|$|R
