5|$|The Sanremo Music Festival is an {{important}} venue for popular music in Italy. It has been held annually since 1951 and is currently staged at the Teatro Ariston in Sanremo. It runs for one week in February, and gives veteran and new performers a chance to present new songs. Winning the contest has often been a springboard to industry success. The festival is televised nationally for three <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> is hosted by the best-known Italian TV personalities, {{and has been a}} vehicle for such performers as Domenico Modugno, perhaps the best-known Italian pop singer of the last 50 years.|$|E
5|$|Skelton was a {{prolific}} writer of both {{short stories and}} music. After sleeping only four or five <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> he would wake up at 5a.m. and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies {{by the time of}} his death. He wrote commercials for Skoal tobacco and sold many of his compositions to Muzak, a company that specialized in providing background music to stores and other businesses. Skelton was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated bonsai trees at his home in Palm Springs, California.|$|E

25|$|Though Carson's {{program was}} based in Burbank {{beginning}} in 1972, NBC's editing and production services for the program were located in New York, resulting in the requirement that Carson's program be transmitted from Burbank to New York. In 1976, NBC used the Satcom 2 satellite to do this, feeding the live taping (which usually {{took place in the}} early evening) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the normal broadcast. This live feed lasted usually from two to two-and-a-half <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> and was uncensored and commercial-free. During the commercial breaks, the audio and picture would be left on, capturing at times risqué language and other events that would certainly be edited out later going out over the feed.|$|E

The film was entirely shot in the Greater Los Angeles Area {{over a period of}} 77 nights. Producer Steven-Charles Jaffe said that the city was generally very cooperative, except for the subway scene as the team only had four <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> to film it. Jaffe, however, remarked that Bigelow [...] "was so well prepared that what would have taken another director several weeks to do, she did in a matter of days." [...] The production team also received permission from the West Hollywood film commission to film on Sunset Boulevard for a two-day period, which required the shut down of several lanes of traffic.|$|E
500|$|For Santopietro, Sinatra was the {{personification}} of America in the 1950s: [...] "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full {{of the sense of}} possibility". Barbara Sinatra wrote that [...] "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor". [...] Cary Grant, a good friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra was the [...] "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke [...] "a simple truth, without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances. [...] Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed [...] "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive was [...] "enormous". A workaholic, he reportedly only slept for four <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> on average. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that [...] "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation". Barbara Sinatra stated that he would [...] "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor", while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was [...] "best to disappear".|$|E
500|$|The new candle {{sustained}} {{some minor}} damage over its first few years. On November 20, 1970, heavy rain and inclement weather snapped a wire helping keep the structure in place, and firefighters had to install additional braces the next day. Also that year, about 75 lights {{were stolen from}} the decorative Christmas trees set up around the candle's base. In 1971, the building where the Peace Candle was stored was broken into and the fiberglass paneling was vandalized. Easton officials {{declined to discuss the}} extent of the damage, but Henry Schultz dismissed the vandals as [...] "kids". In 1974, the Peace Candle was only lit a few <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> and not at all on some nights, due to an ongoing energy crisis, which prompted the Metropolitan Edison Company to ask its Easton area customers not to use Christmas lights that year. Since the Peace Candle was seldom lit, charitable donations dropped in 1974, resulting in an $800 defect for the Easton Area Christmas Committee. Additionally the committee [...] spent $1,700 in Peace Candle Christmas cards meant to bring in donations, but only 500 packs were sold at $1 each. The use of less electricity to light the Peace Candle did not help the committee because the city paid the lighting bill.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the effect of sleep deprivation on the dribbling skills of football players. To this end, 22 students of Sahand University, with age range (20 - 24 years) performed dribbling skill in the pre-test and post test stages. In this study to assess this skill, the test "Mor - Christian" has been used. In the first step, subjects conducted the dribble test as pre-test after 8 <b>hours</b> sleep <b>a</b> <b>night.</b> 10 days later, to ensure the validity of tests and test results on the learning effect, subjects did the same test again after 8 <b>hours</b> sleep <b>a</b> <b>night.</b> In the third stage, 36 hours of sleep deprivation as an independent variable imposed on the subjects and then the test was repeated and experimental test results were compared as recorded using paired t-test. The findings showed that 36 hour sleep deprivation decreases dribble implementation skills (p < 0. 001). Therefore, the findings showed that sleep deprivation can be a devastating effect on dribbling skill...|$|R
500|$|In 1998, {{one of the}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts at}} the ballooning record ended with a five-mile (8km) plummet into the Coral Sea {{off the coast of}} Australia that nearly killed Fossett; he waited 72 hours to be rescued, at a cost of $500,000. The first attempt began in the Black Hills of South Dakota and ended outside Hampton, New Brunswick [...] later. The second attempt, launched from Busch Stadium, cost $300,000 and lasted [...] before being downed halfway in a tree in India; the trip set records at the time for duration and distance of flight (with Fossett doubling his own previous record) and was called Solo Spirit after Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. Fossett slept an average of two <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> for the six-day journey, conducted in below-zero temperatures. After taking too much fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean and circling Libya for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace, Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight. That year, Fossett flew farther for less money than better-financed expeditions (including one supported by Richard Branson) in part due to his ability to fly in an unpressurized capsule, a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes. The Solo Spirit capsule was put on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum across from the Apollo 11 command module.|$|E
500|$|Bilinda Butcher's vocals {{have been}} {{referred}} to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything and Loveless, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said [...] "influenced [...] sound" [...] by making them [...] "more dreamy and sleepy". The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described an androgynous sound to the band's vocals. My Bloody Valentine's lyrics are mostly written by Shields. However, Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn't Anything and Loveless, but has referred {{to a lot of the}} lyrics as [...] "plain nonsense." [...] According to Butcher, she [...] "didn't have a plan and never thought about lyrics until it was time to write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment." [...] Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: [...] "He [...] never sang any words on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words." [...] Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night</b> writing lyrics, even though few changes actually resulted, as Shields believed [...] "there's nothing worse than bad lyrics." [...] Spin writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band's lyrics often contain sexual themes, which are [...] "a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness".|$|E
500|$|Development of Super Meat Boy {{began in}} January 2009. Initially {{announced}} for WiiWare and PC, {{the game was}} set {{to be released in}} the first quarter of 2010. The release date was pushed back to the fourth quarter because the developers wanted more time to create extra levels, such as the dark worlds. A picture released on Team Meat's Twitter page on February 22, 2010, revealed that the game would also be released for XBLA. The next day, they announced that, while all versions would be released in the same month, the game would be released for XBLA first due to [...] "contractual obligations". In August 2010, the developers were contacted by Microsoft with the prospect of inclusion in Microsoft's 2010 Fall GameFeast XBLA promotion two months later. As they were almost out of money, they did not believe that they could financially support themselves until the Spring event, but felt they had four months' worth of work left to complete on the game. For the final two months of development they worked daily, slept five <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> and frequently forgot to eat—a process that McMillen said he [...] "would never voluntarily go through" [...] again. According to McMillen, due to Microsoft's low expectations for the game, Super Meat Boy was lightly promoted. The level of promotion was not increased during the GameFeast, though the game greatly outsold the rest of the games in the event. The team described the effort required to finish the game for the promotion as [...] "by far the biggest mistake [...] made during SMB's development". Their development struggle is depicted in the documentary [...] The game was released on XBLA in October 2010 and on PCs via Steam and Direct2Drive a month later. McMillen noted that the PC release was more heavily promoted than the XBLA version. A version for Mac OS X was released in November 2011, while another version for Linux operating systems was released in December 2011 as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4 game pack.|$|E
