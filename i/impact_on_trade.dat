5|$|Jardine {{threatened}} to withdraw his {{team from the}} Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims {{about the danger of}} Bodyline and {{threatened to}} call off the tour. The series had become a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation. Alexander Hore-Ruthven, the Governor of South Australia, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to J. H. Thomas, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that this would cause a significant <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the third Test, and England won the final two matches to win the series 4–1.|$|E

40|$|Brexit {{has caused}} {{considerable}} concern in Africa regarding its potential <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>trading</b> and investment relations {{with both the}} United Kingdom and the European Union. This paper looks at the empirical evidence about the existing strength and depth of those links.

We also focus <b>on</b> the potential <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> a sub regional block - the East African Community (EAC). The paper finds that a) direct links through trade and investment {{are unlikely to be}} impacted substantially and indeed may even benefit marginally b) indirect links, through Brexit’s <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the global economy, may be more important and c) a reduction in UK development cooperation is extremely likely over the mid- to long term, which could represent a serious problem for aid-dependent countries. Finally, we argue that the real impact could be in a negative ‘demonstration’ effect, undermining confidence in ‘deep’ regional integration processes like that of the EAC...|$|R
25|$|Two {{national}} epidemics framed Hamilton's tenure: {{the yellow}} fever epidemic of 1878 that raged along the Mississippi River Valley and the Asiatic cholera epidemic of 1892, which hit New York City with particular ferocity. Sanitary cordons, or quarantine, {{were the primary}} response to yellow fever, to block the progress of disease believed to be conveyed not only on boats and foot traffic but also now by railroad. Instituting quarantines, however, meant Federal intervention into what was widely held to be state police powers and met resistance in the southeastern United States where the issue of yellow fever, and its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade,</b> were most critical.|$|E
25|$|Economist {{and social}} {{reformer}} Henry George opposed sales taxes and protective tariffs for their negative <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> He also {{believed in the}} right of each person to {{the fruits of their}} own labour and productive investment. Therefore, income from labour and proper capital should remain untaxed. For this reason many Geoists—in particular those that call themselves geolibertarian—share the view with libertarians that these types of taxation (but not all) are immoral and even theft. George stated there should be one single tax: the Land Value Tax, which is considered both efficient and moral. Demand for specific land is dependent on nature, but even more so on the presence of communities, trade, and government infrastructure, particularly in urban environments. Therefore, the economic rent of land is not the product of one particular individual and it may be claimed for public expenses. According to George, this would end real estate bubbles, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency for financing public goods because those raise land value.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} his arrival in New York, Burnet had the {{assembly}} pass a law banning the Albany-Montreal trade. [...] This action earned him opposition from merchant interests that traded directly with New France, including the Huguenot Stephen DeLancey and other Albany merchants. [...] Two vocal merchants, Adolph Philipse and Pieter Schuyler, sat on the governor's council, and were removed by Burnet in 1721. [...] The law was fairly easily circumvented: the merchants routed the trade goods through nearby Mohawks who then carried goods to and from Montreal. [...] A law stiffening enforcement of the trade ban was passed in 1722.

500|$|The {{situation}} escalated into {{a diplomatic}} incident. Figures {{high up in}} both the British and Australian government saw bodyline as potentially fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The Governor of South Australia, Alexander Hore-Ruthven, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs James Henry Thomas that this would cause a significant <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> between the nations. The standoff was settled when the Australian prime minister, Joseph Lyons, met {{with members of the}} Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Following considerable discussion and debate in the English and Australian press, the Australian Board sent a cable to the MCC which, while maintaining its opposition to bodyline bowling, stated [...] "We do not regard the sportsmanship of your team as being in question". Even so, correspondence between the Australian Board and the MCC continued for almost a year.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the third}} Test, {{strongly}} worded cables passed between the Australian Board of Control and the M.C.C. at Lord's. The Australian Board accused the English team of unsportsmanlike tactics, stating that [...] "Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace {{the best interests}} of the game, making protection of the body the main consideration." [...] The M.C.C. responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims about the danger of Bodyline and threatened to call off the tour. The series was becoming a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong.

Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions that his team were receiving. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using Bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting Jardine and the Bodyline tactics. It was subsequently revealed that several of the players had private reservations, but they did not express them publicly at the time. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{countries}} in the European continent are {{related to each other}} by a Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) that includes services. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the pattern of trade in services in Europe. In considering the three main important RTAs in force in Europe, I find that all the RTAs do not have similar <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> in services. Indeed, European Union and European Economic Area are trade creating while European Free Trade Association (EFTA) does not have a significant <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> intra-members <b>trade</b> and is more trade diverting than the other RTAs.

40|$|This paper explores whether {{countries}} that have a federal Constitution engage in more international trade. We identify two possible mechanisms through which political fragmentation of nation-states, namely federalism, might <b>impact</b> positively <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> globalization processes: domestic market fragmentation and the free trade strategy pursued by certain separatist regions in federal countries. We use a gravity equation running panel regressions to estimate the <b>impact</b> of federalism <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> The Poisson estimator proposed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) is used to handle the null trade flows. We test our predictions on a large data set of 148 countries on the 1980 - 2002 period. After controlling for determinants of trade potentially correlated with federalism, a federalist system is found to increase international trade. We also find that separatism and linguistic fractionalization <b>impact</b> positively <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> openness. ...|$|R

2500|$|Development of the St. Lawrence River {{which serves}} as a border between Canada and the United States was in its early stages in 1871 when the Treaty of Washington was signed, which in part demarcated the St. Lawrence River as a {{boundary}} and offered Americans greater use of the Canadian side of the river for shipping. In 1895 the Deep Waterways Commission was established to explore expanded use of the river for navigation. International shipping on the river would have a positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> between the two countries. The early St. Lawrence Seaway was proposed but railway companies in the United States stopped its construction because they felt it would reduce their profits. The Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 further solidified cooperation between the U.S. and Canada on the river, allowing [...] "free and open" [...] navigation and establishing the International Joint Commission (IJC) to resolve disputes. In 1931, New York's Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Power Authority Act which allowed the development of the St. Lawrence River for power use. A primary site was just below the Long Sault Rapids. Despite the cooperation, the U.S. Federal Government was unable to open up the river for increased navigation and development due to political issues. Upset with this, Canada unilaterally passed two acts in 1951 which allowed projects on the St. Lawrence for power and navigation purposes. They pressured the U.S. to act and in 1952, President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a hydroelectric dam on the river. The next year a proposal for a hydroelectric dam and navigation lock was submitted to the IJC for approval. In October 1952 the project was approved.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} causes of the transpacific trade {{imbalances}} using an empirical global model. It also evaluates the impact of various policies to reduce these imbalances. We find the fundamental cause of trade imbalance since 1997 is changes in saving-investment gaps, attributed to the surge of the U. S fiscal deficits and the decline of East Asia's private investment after the 1997 financial crisis. Our simulation results show that a revaluation of East Asia's exchange rates by 10 percent (effectively a shift in monetary policy) cannot resolve the imbalances. We find East Asia's concerted efforts to stimulate aggregate demand can have significant <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> balances globally, but the <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the US <b>trade</b> balance is not large. US fiscal contraction is estimated to have large <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the US <b>trade</b> position overall and <b>on</b> the bilateral <b>trade</b> balances with East Asian economies. These results suggest that in order to improve the transpacific imbalance, acroeconomic adjustment will need to be made {{on both sides of the}} Pacific. ...|$|R
