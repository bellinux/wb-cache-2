40|$|This study {{presents}} an energy efficient ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter {{based on the}} novel transmitted reference pulse cluster (TRPC) modulation scheme. The TRPC-UWB transmitter integrates wideband active baluns, a wideband IQ modulator based on up-conversion mixers, and a <b>differential-to-single-ended</b> converter. The integrated circuits of the TRPC-UWB front end are designed and implemented in a low-cost 130 -nm CMOS process. The measured worst-case carrier leakage suppression is 22. 4 dBc, whereas the single sideband suppression is greater than 31. 6 dBc, operating at a frequency from 3. 1 to 8. 2  GHz. With an adjustable data rate of 10 to 300 Mbps, the transmitter achieves good energy efficiency of 38. 4 pJ/pulse and a maximum current consumption of 24. 5 mA from a 1. 2 -V power supply...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{optimisation}} of the low-frequency response of a multi-stage bioelectric amplifier {{intended for use}} in the measurement of the human electrocardiogram (ECG) using high-impedance un-gelled electrodes. The frequency response was optimised to meet international performance requirements for electrocardiographic recorders, in particular the International Electrotechnical Commission 60601 standards [1, 2]. The pole and zero locations of a multi-stage amplifier configuration were optimised to meet both time and frequency domain specifications. The optimum assignment for a three stage amplifier, having two differential stages and a <b>differential-to-single-ended</b> conversion stage was established by evaluating the performance of a number of circuit configurations. The optimum configuration was found to be two differential stages with a gain of 20 dB each and a differential-to single-ended output stage with unity gain. The - 3 dB pole is placed at 0. 028 Hz and a zero at 0. 0028 Hz in the first and second stages to give an overall - 3 dB bandwidth of 0. 043 Hz. In addition, the pole of the input ac coupling network was placed at 0. 0028 Hz {{in order to meet the}} undershoot and recovery slope requirements in the narrow pulse response...|$|E

The optimum design for a three stage amplifier, having two differential stages and a <b>differential-to-single-ended</b> conversion stage was established in the context of low-power ambulatory ECG monitoring. The optimum configuration was found to be two differential stages with a gain of 20 dB each and a differential-to single-ended output stage with unity gain. The − 3 dB pole is placed at 0. 013 Hz and a zero at 0. 0013 Hz in the first and second stages to give an overall − 3 dB low cut-off frequency of 0. 02 Hz. In addition, the pole of the input ac coupling network was placed at 0. 0013 Hz in order to cancel the zero in the non-inverting front-end stage. This ensured that undershoot and recovery slope performance requirements in response to a narrow pulse of 3 mV amplitude and 100 ms duration were met...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{has emerged}} as a very {{promising}} technology for short-range communication systems. The ultrashort duration of UWB waveforms gives rise to the potential ability to provide high-precision ranging and localization. Accurate distance measurements between sensor nodes used for localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are very attractive for advanced wireless health-care applications. Over the years, several localization methods like received signal strength intensity (RSSI), angle of arrival (AoA) and time based approaches such as time-of-arrival (ToA) and time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) exist for distance measurement between sensor nodes. The dominant RSSI is simply estimating the node distance by measuring the strength of the received signal. However, precision is too low with this method. ToA ranging approach is simple but require synchronization to give good precision. Clock synchronization between the transceivers is limiting the accuracy of the ToA estimation and hence increases the design challenges of the UWB ranging system. To our best knowledge no high-precision localization solution suitable for in-body tracking is reported. Impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) has been an interesting area of research for lowpower short-range applications. Several studies indicate time-of-flight (ToF) measurements combined with the good temporal resolution of IR-UWB can give good precision. Typical distances between sensor nodes are in the order of ten meters that requires distance measurement is approximately one centimeter. Since radio waves propagate with approximately the speed of light, the time differences of less than 30 ps are required. With traditional clock driven circuit solutions, we need a clock rate of more than 30 GHz, which is not easy in standard technology. Using the new circuit solutions that are still in digital value but continuous in time (Continuous-Time Binary Value–CTBV), it is possible to find effective solutions for precise distance measurement in combination with communication, all are integrated on a single chip. The main goal of this thesis is to develop an IR-UWB receiver front-end covering the frequency band of 3 – 5 GHz for the CTBV ranging system. The front-end consists of an antenna, a low noise amplifier, a band-pass filter, a downconversion quadrature mixer, a low-pass filter, a <b>differential-to-single-ended</b> converter and a continuous-time quantizer. These building blocks are assembled with other circuit elements of a functional impulse-based radio chip that is demonstrated at short distances. To reduce complexity and to minimize the power consumption, the proposed IR-UWB receiver front-end has been implemented as an energy threshold detector. The quantizer with tunable threshold acts as a single-bit ADC is implemented as a demodulation function. By avoiding using external components as well as high frequency sampling clock, the IR-UWB receiver front-end consumes less power and fully integrated is possible. The proposed IR-UWB receiver front-end is suitable for high-precision low-power low data-rate communication over a relative short range for WSN applications such as ranging and localization...|$|E
