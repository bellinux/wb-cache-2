50|$|Flexible {{plate is}} used in {{electric}} motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. <b>Heater</b> <b>plate</b> is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{we present}} a {{numerical}} study of heat transfer by natural convection in a two-dimensional closed room, containing air, {{in the presence of}} a thin <b>heater</b> <b>plate.</b> The vertical walls are kept adiabatic, while the horizontal ones are isothermal. The equations governing the natural convection in the room are solved using a finite difference technique based on the control volume approach and the SIMPLEC (Semi-Implicit-Method for Pressure-Linked Equations Corrected) algorithm. A non-uniform mesh in both directions, constructed by using a geometric progression, is adopted. The square room contains a thin heated plate located at the room center with an aspect ratio equal to 0. 5. The <b>heater</b> <b>plate</b> is positioned horizontally and has a higher temperature than the isothermal walls. The simulation results are obtained in terms of velocity vectors and isotherms for different Rayleigh numbers values ranging from 104 to 106. The symmetric boundary conditions produce a symmetric behaviour of temperature and velocity fields according to the central vertical plan. The increase of Rayleigh number leads to increasing importance of convection heat transfer relative to the conduction heat transfer. The fact is more marked for the regions above the <b>heater</b> <b>plate.</b> It is shown that for high Rayleigh numbers, heat transfer from the <b>heater</b> <b>plate</b> to the isothermal horizontal walls is mainly directed towards the top wall...|$|E

A detailed thermal model of the SAGE III payload, which consists of multiple subsystems, has been developed in Thermal Desktop (TD). Correlation of the thermal model is important since the payload will be expected to survive a three-year mission on ISS under varying thermal environments.

40|$|The {{selection}} of optimum pane spacing for glazing systems {{has been a}} topic of ongoing debate in the window manufacturing industry. Arguments are often based on speculation, intuition and results from tests not specifically designed {{to examine the effects}} of pane spacing. This study presents a set of measured centre-glass U-values taken from experiments where pane spacing was carefully varied while holding all remaining conditions unchanged. Heat flux measurements were made using a guarded <b>heater</b> <b>plate</b> apparatus. Glazing systems were all double glazed, air filled and tested in the vertical position. Measured centre-glass U-values were compared to calculated U-values. These calculations were performed using a version of the VISION glazing system thermal analysis program which was modified in order to model the guarded <b>heater</b> <b>plate</b> test conditions.

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{considerations}} {{in the evaluation of}} building components and construction materials used in energy efficient designs is in determining their thermal characteristics while operating under different temperature regimes. This is normally achieved by testing the product to determine its thermal conductivity or its overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) using the Guarded Hot Box method. In this method regulated heat flow is to be maintained through the specimen under a steady state condition. To achieve these conditions the metering box and the guard box are to be maintained at a constant temperature level so as to ensure as far as possible one dimensional heat flow only through the specimen sample. This is achieved through the monitoring and measurement of both surface temperatures and air temperatures in the guard box and the metering box which are used to control the various heating and air circulating devices to achieve the desired level of accuracy.

40|$|As {{shown by}} the Phoenix Mars Lander's Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP), contact {{measurements}} of thermal conductivity and diffusivity (using a modified flux-plate or line-source heat-pulse method) are constrained {{by a number of}} factors. Robotic resources must be used to place the probe, making them unavailable for other operations {{for the duration of the}} measurement. The range of placement is also limited by mobility, particularly in the case of a lander. Placement is also subject to irregularities in contact quality, resulting in non-repeatable heat transfer to the material under test. Most important from a scientific perspective, the varieties of materials which can be measured are limited to unconsolidated or weakly-cohesive regolith materials, rocks, and ices being too hard for nominal insertion strengths. Accurately measuring thermal properties in the laboratory requires significant experimental finesse, involving sample preparation, controlled and repeatable procedures, and, practically, instrumentation much more voluminous than the sample being tested (<b>heater</b> <b>plates,</b> insulation, temperature sensors). Remote measurements (infrared images from orbiting spacecraft) can reveal composite properties like thermal inertia, but suffer both from a large footprint (low spatial resolution) and convolution of the thermal properties of a potentially layered medium. In situ measurement techniques (the Phoenix TECP is the only robotic measurement of thermal properties to date) suffer from problems of placement range, placement quality, occupation of robotic resources, and the ability to only measure materials of low mechanical strength. A spacecraft needs the ability to perform a non-contact thermal properties measurement in situ. Essential components include low power consumption, leveraging of existing or highly-developed flight technologies, and mechanical simplicity. This new in situ method, by virtue of its being non-contact, bypasses all of these problems. The use of photons to both excite and measure the thermal response of any surface material to a high resolution (estimated footprint = 10 square centimeters) is a generational leap in physical properties measurements.

The effect of mass fraction on boiling heat transfer characteristics was studied for mass fractions varying from 0. 001 % to 0. 2 % for the heat flux range between 48. 7 and 134. 9 kW/m 2. The experimental {{results showed that the}} heat transfer performance was improved when TiO 2 nanoparticles were added to pure water, as base fluid.

A further increase in mass fraction still augments heat transfer compared to pure water, however, the amount of enhancement decreased with mass fraction. Furthermore, the performed visualization showed that the addition of nanoparticles into the base fluid, increased the number of nucleation sites, and the bubbles had a more spherical shape along with a decrease in their size. For CuO/water nanofluids, heat transfer was enhanced at mass fractions larger than 0. 001 %. This enhancement could be more than 35 % for the mass fraction of 0. 2 wt. %.
