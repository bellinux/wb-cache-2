30|$|The {{evolution}} of Vi-AF interventions towards land improvement through {{the establishment of}} pasture enclosures consisted of initially working on public land in schools and churches which after 3  years acted as <b>demonstration</b> <b>plots</b> for the local community. The transition from the establishment of <b>demonstration</b> <b>plots</b> on public land {{to the establishment of}} spontaneous enclosures is estimated to have taken about 7  years (1987 – 1994). Thereafter, Vi-AF conducted intensive extension on enclosures between 1995 and 2001 before phasing out the project in 2002. Enclosure categories were found to be significantly correlated to the age of household head (p ≤  0.01) with older households having older enclosures and which are likely to have been established or supported by Vi-AF.|$|R
40|$|Many {{small-scale}} sugarcane growers fail {{to prosper}} due to poor production practices, lack of resources, {{a shortage of}} technology and information, ageing ratoons and {{lack of access to}} low cost, disease-free seedcane. For these and other reasons, progress is slow and they remain trapped in economically non-viable activities, while they remain highly vulnerable to risk and suffer severe or on many occasions total economic losses. In the Noodsberg Mill supply area in the KZN Midlands, it was noticeable that a lack of access to information had hindered economic returns for small-scale growers in the area. Limited access to finance for suitable seedcane has become important because spatial expansion in the area has increased and has resulted in inappropriate cane from neighbouring fields being used as seedcane. <b>Demonstration</b> <b>plots</b> were introduced as sites for training and technology transfer while demonstrating the potential of the area to produce cane and evaluating varieties under local conditions. Small growers were reluctant to replant due to the expense of purchasing and transporting seedcane.

40|$|The {{profitability}} of different wheat production systems in Arsi Zone was investigated by comparing farmers' {{practices in the}} 1994 crop season with on-farm demonstrations led by both Sasakawa-Global 2000 and Kulumsa Research Center of the Institute of Agriculture Research. Overall, yields on the <b>demonstration</b> <b>plots</b> were higher than those on unsupervised farmers' plots; while farmers do plant improved wheat varieties, they tend to recycle seeds retained from their own stock rather than purchasing new seeds each year. Additionally, they use far less fertilizer and herbicide than either MOA extension agents; or researchers' recommendations. A breakdown of farmer practices {{by the amount of}} purchased inputs shows that the top 4 percent of the farmers surveyed were able to produce as much or more grain on their fields as on the <b>demonstration</b> <b>plots</b> with comparable or greater profits. On the whole, however, the <b>demonstration</b> <b>plots</b> offer yields and profits greater than those most wheat farmers in this region are achieving, even after adjusting for capital costs and possible price fluctuations. The results of the economic analyses suggest the need for broader testing of the experimental packages. At the same time, the inability of many farmers to adopt existing high-input packages indicates the need to decrease the costs and the difficulty of obtaining purchased inputs. Furthermore, the study pointed out an apparent deficiency in the research/extension package: high-cost herbicides must be targeted for wheat fields having weed densities greater than some economic threshold levels...|$|R

The effect fades over time, but fertilizer use remains permanently higher in this group. In contrast, we observe no evidence of social learning, either between neighbors or between farmers who report sharing experience about agriculture. Finally, a program that offered farmers the option to buy fertilizer at harvest time led to a 17 % increase in the adoption of fertilizer, an effect larger than that of a 50 % subsidy offered later in the season. This suggests that the ability to save {{over the course of the}} agricultural cycle is a barrier to the adoption of fertilizer. ...|$|R
