Unlike integrated <b>headsets,</b> internal <b>headsets</b> still employ cups between the bearings and the frame itself. Prominent standards in internal <b>headsets</b> include Chris King's InSet and Cane Creek's ZeroStack. These designs use a 44.0 mm internal headtube diameter.|$|R
5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung {{on opposite sides of the}} ship, and fed through an amplifier into a <b>headset</b> (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E

The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a <b>headset.</b> Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E
