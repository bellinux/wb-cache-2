5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{oral traditions}} about the castle survive. One of these {{involves}} a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing {{the key to}} her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres on a man called Gallon who was left {{in charge of the}} castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous has noted that in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the <b>Gallon</b> <b>of</b> this story.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the retail}} {{gasoline}} now sold in the United States contains about 10% fuel ethanol (or E10) by volume. Burning a <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> E10 produces about 17.68 pounds of CO2 that is emitted from the fossil fuel content. If the CO2 emissions from ethanol combustion are considered, then about 18.95 pounds of CO2 are produced when a <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> E10 is combusted.

25|$|The {{price of}} Hydrogen has since {{come down to}} $4–6/kg (without carbon sequestering) due to {{reduction}} {{in the price of}} Natural Gas as a feedstock for steam reforming owing to the proliferation of hydraulic fracturing of shales.

25|$|Preliminary {{calculations}} {{have shown}} that utilization of PEF technology would only account for $0.10 per <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> algae derived biofuel produced. In comparison, conventional drying and solvent-based extractions account for $1.75 per gallon.

Although a relatively new technology, PEF has been successfully used in both food decomtamination processes as well as waste water treatments.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to fill the aircraft with one <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> fuel and see how far they got.

Instead, each was fuelled over a gallon by a standard amount, landing when they judged they had insufficient fuel for another 12.5 miles. If they had used more than one gallon, the calculated consumption was pro rata; if they had used less than one gallon the consumption was nevertheless based on one gallon used.|$|E

25|$|Experienced aquarists warn against {{applying}} {{these rules}} too strictly {{because they do}} not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on. It is better to apply the overall mass and size of a fish per <b>gallon</b> <b>of</b> water, than simply the length. This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste. Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a trial and error approach.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} in 2007 that with increased worldwide prosperity and the competition of bio-fuel production for feed stocks, both the demand for {{and the price of}} milk had substantially increased worldwide.
