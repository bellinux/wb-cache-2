5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} Corfu alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years <b>earlier.</b> <b>To</b> facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E

5|$|Manchester's civic {{leadership}} {{has a reputation}} for business acumen. It owns two of the country's four busiest airports and uses its earnings to fund local projects. Meanwhile, KPMG's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal devolution has come <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> Manchester than to any other British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment.|$|E
5|$|Rojhaz {{is in fact}} Steve Rogers, {{the future}} costumed superhero known as Captain America. After {{fighting}} against a future fascist government dictatorship of the 21st century run by the President-For-Life, Rogers was captured. Wanting to dispose of Rogers so completely that not even his ashes would remain to inspire future rebellion, the President-for-Life had Rogers placed into a machine which should have killed him but instead sent him into the 1602 timeline. His presence not only brought about a rift that will destroy the universe, but it also caused the heroes {{of the twentieth century}} to appear centuries <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> counter the Forerunner's negative effects.|$|E

40|$|Calcareous nannofossils {{from two}} {{boreholes}} (Campo Bola and Sur Río Chico) in the subsurface of eastern Austral Basin, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, allowed {{the identification of}} <b>Early</b> <b>to</b> Middle Paleocene, <b>Early</b> <b>to</b> Middle Eocene and Late Eocene <b>to</b> <b>Early</b> Oligocene assemblages. These assemblages match the formations logged in the boreholes Campo Bola, Man Aike and Río Leona respectively, and represent three paleogene sedimentary cycles within the basin. These results permitted the reinterpretation of previous data from an adjacent borehole (Cerro Redondo). The southern boreholes (Cerro Redondo and Sur Río Chico) yield an <b>Early</b> <b>to</b> Middle Paleocene calcareous nannofossil assemblage and an almost continuous record of nannofossils from <b>Early</b> Eocene <b>to</b> <b>Early</b> Oligocene. A discontinuity is interpreted {{by the absence of}} Late Paleocene assemblages. The northern borehole (Campo Bola) yield only late <b>Early</b> Eocene <b>to</b> <b>Early</b> Oligocene assemblages.

5|$|The {{development}} {{staff from}} previous Metroid games – including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Super Metroid {{over the course}} of two years, with half a year <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions.|$|E

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, after Mulder is forced to accept that his mother’s death was by her own hand, he is led by a man whose son disappeared years <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> another truth: that his sister, Samantha, was among the souls taken by ‘walk-ins’, saving the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives.|$|E

5|$|A Chera coin {{with the}} {{portrait}} of a king wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse side of the silver coin has {{the portrait of}} a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939 {{and the ensuing}} outbreak of the Second World War, the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral, as they had done during the First World War 25 years <b>earlier.</b> <b>To</b> ensure this neutrality, the Dutch army was mobilised from 24 August and entrenched. Large sums (almost 900 million guilders) were spent on defence. It proved very difficult to obtain new matériel in wartime, however, especially as the Dutch had ordered some of their new equipment from Germany, which deliberately delayed deliveries. Moreover, a considerable part of the funds were intended for the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), much of it related to a plan to build three battlecruisers.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaty of Paris, the British {{government}} sought stronger {{ties with}} China. William Amherst, the diplomat chosen {{to inform the}} emperor of the peace in Europe and to offer Britain's friendship, specifically requested Maxwell and Alceste to accompany him. Maxwell, without a ship since HMS Daedalus was wrecked three years before, commissioned Alceste {{at the beginning of}} 1816. The journey out was uneventful; Alceste left Spithead for China on 9 February with Amherst aboard, and after stopping at Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope, Anyer, and Batavia, sailed through the Bangka Strait into the South China Sea. After calling to pay respects at Canton, Alceste transited the Straits of Formosa and hove-to in the Bohai Sea on 28 July. There she met the 10-gun brig-sloop, Lyra, despatched <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> herald the arrival of Britain's ambassador.|$|E

5|$|At {{the police}} station, Pang {{confirms}} that Alan {{is actually an}} undercover cop. Tequila tracks Alan down to his sailboat {{to try to make}} sense of the situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang. Tequila and Alan manage to kill their attackers just before Wong arrives, which allows Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes that one of his gangsters named Foxy (Tung Wei), is an informant for the police. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog (Philip Kwok) in front of Alan and Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although he secretly placed a cigarette lighter in Foxy's breast pocket <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> prevent the shot from being fatal. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is in the nearby Maple Group Hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong finds out that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill Foxy, as well as sending Mad Dog separately to cover Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of Wong's arsenal. While Alan and Tequila are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.|$|E
5|$|Following Ranavalona's death, {{her aunt}} Ramasindrazana left Algeria {{and moved to}} Alpes-Maritimes where she lived out the few {{remaining}} years of her life. The heir-apparent, Marie-Louise, had left Ranavalona's villa several years <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> study at a French high school and {{would go on to}} marry a French agricultural engineer named Andre Bosshard on June 24, 1921. Although she continued to receive a small pension from the French government throughout her lifetime, Marie-Louise chose to pursue a career as a nurse and was awarded the Legion of Honor for her medical services during World War II. After Bosshard and the childless Marie-Louise divorced, the young woman reportedly made the most of her new-found freedom as a flamboyant and vivacious socialite. Marie-Louise died in Bazoches-sur-le-Betz on January 18, 1948, without leaving any descendants, and was buried in Montreuil, France.|$|E
5|$|For a {{time after}} the fourth night, Robert cannot find the Number Devil in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where the Number Devil teaches him about {{triangular}} numbers {{through the use of}} coconuts. On the sixth night, the Number Devil teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of Fibonacci numbers, which the Number Devil shortens to Bonacci numbers, by counting brown and white rabbits as they reproduce multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother has noticed a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins going to sleep <b>earlier</b> <b>to</b> encounter the Number Devil. The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where the Number Devil presents Pascal's triangle and the patterns that the triangular array displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. The Number Devil arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about permutations, and what the Number Devil calls vroom numbers (factorials).|$|E
