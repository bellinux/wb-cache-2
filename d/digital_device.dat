This paper focuses on incorporating requirements for forensic readiness – designing in features and characteristics that support the use of the data produced by <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> as evidence. The legal requirements that such evidence must meet are explored in developing technical requirements for the design of <b>digital</b> <b>devices.</b> The resulting approach can be used to develop <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> and establish processes for creating digital evidence.

40|$|Since <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> such as {{computers}} {{are vulnerable to}} attack by criminals, digital forensics is increasing in importance. Understanding digital forensic procedures will help to capture vital information {{which can be used}} to prosecute a suspect that compromises a <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> or network. The majority of organizations rely deeply on <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> and the Internet to operate and improve their business, and these businesses depend on the <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> to process, store and recover data. A large amount of information is produced, accumulated, and distributed via electronic means. It is necessary for forensic experts to increase their abilities to gather evidence from <b>digital</b> <b>devices.</b> Also, deciding on the specific tools for computers or other <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> that is needed to correctly analyze evidence is crucial. The advancement of the digital forensic investigation requires a new design, improved mechanism and processes. Forensic experts are faced with growth in data. Huge amount of data has expanded and grown in recent years and attempts to consume the storage space available. Digital forensic techniques are used primarily by private organisations and law enforcement agencies to capture, preserve and analyze evidence on <b>digital</b> <b>devices.</b> <b>Digital</b> evidence collected at a crime scene has to be analyzed and connections between the recovered information need to be made and proven. The search for digital evidence is thus a tedious task that consumes time. An extremely large amount of evidence needs to be processed in a very limited time frame which leads to delay in processing schedules. This paper underscores the need to understand the importance of a digital forensic investigative framework...|$|R
25|$|A framebuffer is a <b>digital</b> <b>device</b> for {{computers}} which stores {{data in the}} so-called video memory (comprising an array of Video RAM or similar chips). This data goes either to three digital-to-analog converters (DACs) (for analog monitors), one per primary color, or directly to digital monitors. Driven by software, the CPU (or other specialized chips) write the appropriate bytes into the video memory to define the image. Modern systems encode pixel color values by devoting eight bits {{to each of the}} R, G, and B components. RGB information can be either carried directly by the pixel bits themselves or provided by a separate color look-up table (CLUT) if indexed color graphic modes are used.|$|E

500|$|The CSMIP Cape Mendocino {{station was}} {{installed}} in 1978 and was located just [...] from the epicenter on the slope of a ridge in the coast ranges. The instruments there had been mounted on a concrete platform adjacent to a roadway and remained firmly secured to the rock platform following the shocks. A landslide came within [...] of the device and left debris on the road, but a lack of large rocks close to the instrument and no cracking of the rocks near the platform left geologists with no clear explanation for the extraordinarily high vertical component reading of 1.85g. The tri-axial analog accelerometer that was in use was physically limited to that value and all three traces had uniformly significant values at three seconds into the recording. A post-earthquake lab test of the seismometer and an inspection of the photographically enlarged accelerogram revealed that the limit was hit twice, with a maximum deflection of 31mm, as the needle bounced off the unit's mass. An extrapolation of the vertical record led to a maximum acceleration estimate of 2.2g for that site, and the unit was eventually replaced with a higher capacity <b>digital</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The C64 {{retained}} the DE-9 joystick Atari joystick port from the VIC-20 and added another; any Atari specification game controller {{can be used}} on a C64. [...] The joysticks are read from the registers at $DC00 and $DC01, and most software is designed to use a joystick in port 2 for control rather than port 1, as the upper bits of $DC00 are used by the keyboard and an I/O conflict can result. [...] Although it is possible to use Sega gamepads on a C64, it is not recommended as the slightly different signal generated by them can damage the CIA chip. [...] The Start button on Sega Genesis controllers outputs a −5V signal; and the other buttons also pull the lines on the CIA low, which is different from the behavior of Atari spec controllers. Register $D419 is used to control paddles and is an analog input. Atari paddles are electrically compatible with the C64, but have different resistance values than Commodore's paddles, which means most software will not work properly with them. [...] However, only a handful of games, mostly ones released early in the computer's life cycle, can use paddles. In 1986, Commodore released two mice for the C64 and C128, the 1350 and 1351. The 1350 is a <b>digital</b> <b>device,</b> read from the joystick registers (and can be used with any program supporting joystick input); while the 1351 is a true mouse, read with the SID's analog-to-digital converter.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{intervene}} in debates about the digital and, in particular, framings that imagine the digital in terms of epochal shifts or as redefining life. Instead, drawing on recent developments in digital methods, we explore the lively, productive and performative qualities of the digital by attending to the specificities of <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> and how they interact, and sometimes compete, with older devices and their capacity to mobilize and materialize social and other relations. In doing so, our aim is to explore the implications of <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> and data for reassembling social science methods or {{what we call the}} social science apparatuses that assemble <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> and data to 'know' the social and other relations. Building on recent work at CRESC on the social life of methods, we recommend a genealogical approach that is alive {{to the ways in which}} <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> are simultaneously shaped by social worlds, and can in turn become agents that shape those worlds. This calls for attending to the specificities of <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> themselves, how they are varied and composed of diverse socio-technical arrangements, and are enrolled in the creation of new knowledge spaces, institutions and actors. Rather than exploring what large-scale changes can be revealed and understood through the digital, we argue for explorations of how <b>digital</b> <b>devices</b> themselves are materially implicated in the production and performance of contemporary sociality. To that end we offer the following nine propositions about the implications of <b>digital</b> data and <b>devices</b> and argue that these demand rethinking the theoretical assumptions of social science methods: transactional actors; heterogeneity; visualization; continuous time; whole populations; granularity; expertise; mobile and mobilizing; and non-coherence...|$|R
