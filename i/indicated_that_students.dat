50|$|In 1996/97, a {{research}} {{study was conducted}} on a large population of middle age students in the Cherry Creek School District in Denver, Colorado, USA. The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to rock-and-roll or Country music had moderately lower scores. The study further <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> who used classical music {{during the course of}} study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through the University of Colorado. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S.

5000|$|Depending on {{individual}} needs, students usually attend resource rooms {{three to five}} times per week for about forty five minutes per day. Some research has suggested these classrooms are of particular benefit to students with language-based learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Other research has <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> show growth in visuo-motor perception, arithmetic, spelling and overall self-perception through time in the resource room classroom. Students using these services are typically considered included—rather than segregated or mainstreamed—because they attend other classes with their peers, especially at the secondary level. At least one study has suggested students with learning disabilities in resource rooms have higher expectations regarding their academic success when they are in the class. This {{may be due to the}} familiarity with the resource room teacher, small group Direct Instruction or confidence within an area they are comfortable in. Researchers believe that explicit instruction that breaks tasks down into smaller segments is an important tool for learning for students with learning disabilities.

40|$|Problem-based {{learning}} (PBL) {{is one of}} {{the possible}} training strategies that could be more fully implemented in the South African formal education system. The intention to migrate from teacher-centred to learner-centred instructions in higher education institutions and schools makes PBL a plausible option. Geography education students might be exposed to PBL because their training implies the acquisition of abilities to solve real-world situations at various geographical scales. This paper explores the perception of second- and third-year students in a BEd programme in Potchefstroom, South Africa. The study uses a mixed-method research approach based on questionnaire application, students’ learning journal entries and field notes. Findings from the study <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> show very positive perceptions of PBL as a training strategy for teaching and learning.

5000|$|The Middle School {{curriculum}} {{has been}} carefully designed with the adolescent and pre-adolescent in mind. From fifth through eighth grade, students {{embark on a}} journey of learning that is augmented by electives, athletics and fine arts. Community is built around advisory groups, {{a small group of}} students assigned to one teacher. Studies have <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> are more successful when at least one adult in the school community knows them well, and St. David's caters to that idea of inclusivity, giving students multiple ways to get to know their instructors and coaches. In keeping with the St. David's faith tradition, students take a year long Bible Survey course in the seventh grade, which provides historical and social backgrounds to the Old and New Testament. In seventh and eighth grades, students are allowed to choose two academic electives to support their learning. Choices in the past have included the History of the Vietnam War, the 60s, and Short Story Writing, along with the Middle and Upper School combined Yearbook elective. iPads are integrated in the classroom, and all students grades five through twelve bring an iPad to school for educational use. Core subjects in the curriculum include English, History, Math (Including 3 math tracks), Foreign Language (Including Spanish, French, Latin, and Greek) and Science.|$|E
5000|$|That same month, various Canadian {{government}} {{and other political}} figures, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney and Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff all criticized IAW.

[...] He further <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> participating IAW were [...] "free ... to speak their mind" [...] but encouraged them to [...] "reflect on whether these activities are beneficial."

5000|$|... (1) Readiness {{refers to}} {{internal}} processes associated with maturation or beneficial environmental factors. This condition of readiness can aid a student's developmental growth {{if he or}} she is physically or psychologically ready. If not, it could limit their developmental growth. (2) Challenge refers to situations in which an individual does not have the skills, knowledge, or attitude to cope. (3) Support refers to buffers in the environment that help the individual to successfully meet challenges. Sanford speculated that if students are met with too much challenge, they could regress in their developmental growth and give up on the challenge at hand. For example, in a review by the University of California, Los Angeles, Chaves discussed the juggling of multiple challenges that adult student learners encounter such as integration into an institution, commuting to campus, social integration, and absence from school for a number of years that cause adult student learners to regress in their time to graduation or not graduate at all. [...] If students are met with excessive support, they may not understand what they need and their development would be limited. For example, in a qualitative study grounded in constructivist theory methodology, Marx concluded that college campuses provided too much support, limiting students' forward movement in their ability to internally define their own beliefs, identity, and relationships during college. [...] In both studies, the research <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> were unable to reach optimal developmental growth without the appropriate amount of challenge or support.|$|E

50|$|Research by Vaugh (1999) {{looked at}} the effects of {{uncertainty}} {{on the use of}} the availability heuristic. College students were asked to list either three or eight different study methods they could use in order to get an A on their final exams. The researchers also manipulated the time during the semester they would ask the students to complete the questionnaire. Approximately half of the participants were asked for their study methods during the third week of classes, and the other half were asked on last day of classes. Next, participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to get an A in their easiest and hardest classes. Participants were then asked to rank the difficulty they experienced in recalling the examples they had previously listed. The researchers hypothesized that students would use the availability heuristic, based on the number of study methods they listed, to predict their grade only when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. Students were not expected to use the availability heuristic to predict their grade at the end of the semester or about their easiest final. The researchers predicted this use of availability heuristic because participants would be uncertain about their performance throughout the semester. The results <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> used the availability heuristic, based on the ease of recall of the study methods they listed, to predict their performance when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. If the student listed only three study methods, they predicted a higher grade at the end of the semester only on their hardest final. If students listed eight study methods, they had a harder time recalling the methods and thus predicted a lower final grade on their hardest final. The results were not seen in the easy final condition because the students were certain they would get an A, regardless of study method. The results supported this hypothesis and gave evidence to the fact that levels of uncertainty affect the use of the availability heuristic.|$|E
