40|$|Correlative measurementsrr l ti r t EARLINET, the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network, {{offers a}} unique {{opportunity}} for the validation and full exploitation of the CALIPSO mission because of its geographic coverage and the deployment of advanced Raman aerosol lidars. EARLINET provides long-term, quality-assured aerosol data, which allows us to investigate a large variety of different aerosol situations with respect to layering, aerosol type, mixing state, and properties both in the free troposphere and the local planetary boundary layer. EARLINET started correlative measurements for CALIPSO since 14 June 2006, {{at the beginning of}} the operativity of CALIOP. A strategy for correlative measurements has been defined on the base of the analysis of the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> <b>data</b> provided by NASA. Based on the experience of the first 18 months of correlative observations, the strategy of correlative measurements has been consolidated in the frame of a dedicated ESA study aiming at a long-term aerosol and cloud data base from ground-based and satellite-borne lidars. Within this study, correlative measurements have been intensified especially taking into account the geographical distribution of participating stations. EARLINET correlative measurements are still in progress. After about 3 years of correlative observations, more than 6500 hours of correlative measurements have been performed and about 3100 correlative files are available for comparisons. A number of modelling tools is used for the aerosol type and source identification in addition to the information derived from the multi-wavelength lidar observations...|$|E
40|$|Lidar {{techniques}} {{represent the}} most suitable tool to obtain information on the aerosol vertical distribution and therefore to close this kind of observational gap. Lidar networks are fundamental to study aerosol on large spatial scale and to investigate transport and modification phenomena. These are the motivations why EARLINET, the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network, was established in 2000. At present, EARLINET consists of 25 lidar stations: 7 single backscatter lidar stations, 9 Raman lidar stations with the UV Raman channel for independent measurements of aerosol extinction and backscatter, and 9 multiwavelength Raman lidar stations (elastic channel at 1064 nm, 532 nm, 355 nm, Raman channels at 532 nm and 355 nm, plus depolarization channel at 532 nm) for the retrieval of aerosol microphysical properties. EARLINET data can significantly contribute to the quantification of aerosol concentrations, radiative properties, longrange transport and budget, and prediction of future trends on European and global scale. It can also contribute to improve model treatment {{on a wide range}} of scales and to a better exploitation of present and future satellite data. EARLINET is playing an important role in the validation and in the full exploitation of the CALIPSO mission. EARLINET started correlative measurements for CALIPSO since June 2006. A strategy for correlative measurements has been defined on the base of the analysis of the high resolution <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> <b>data</b> provided by NASA.

40|$|An {{unclassified}} analytical trajectory design, performance, {{and mission}} study {{was done for}} the 1982 - 86 joint NASA-USAF Shuttle/Centaur G upper stage development program to send performance-demanding payloads to high orbits such as Molniya using an unconventional orbit transfer. This optimized three orbital burn transfer to Molniya orbit was compared to the then-baselined two burn transfer. The results of the three dimensional trajectory optimization performed include powered phase steering data and coast phase orbital element data. Time derivatives of the orbital elements as functions of thrust components were evaluated and used to explain the optimization's solution. Vehicle performance {{as a function of}} parking orbit inclination was given. Performance and orbital element data was provided for launch windows as functions of launch time. <b>Ground</b> <b>track</b> <b>data</b> was given for all burns and coasts including variation within the launch window. It was found that a Centaur with fully loaded propellant tanks could be flown from a 37 deg inclination low Earth parking orbit and achieve Molniya orbit with comparable performance to the baselined transfer which started from a 57 deg inclined orbit: 9, 545 lb vs. 9, 552 lb of separated spacecraft weight respectively. There was a significant reduction in the need for propellant launch time reserve for a one hour window: only 78 lb for the three burn transfer vs. 320 lb for the two burn transfer. Conversely, this also meant that longer launch windows over more orbital revolutions could be done for the same amount of propellant reserve. There was no practical difference in ground tracking station or airborne assets needed to secure telemetric data, even though the geometric locations of the burns varied considerably. There was a significant adverse increase in total mission elapsed time for the three vs. two burn transfer (12 vs. 11 / 4 hrs), but could be accommodated by modest modifications to Centaur systems. Future applications were discussed. The three burn transfer was found to be a viable, arguably preferable, alternative to the two burn transfer...|$|E

40|$|GTARG, The TOPEX/POSEIDON Ground Track Maintenance Maneuver Targeting Program, was {{developed}} {{to assist in the}} designing of orbit maintenance maneuvers for the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite. These maneuvers ensure that the ground track is kept within 1 km of an approximately 9. 9 day exact repeat pattern. Targeting strategies used by GTARG will either maximize the time between maneuvers (longitude targeting) or force control band exit to occur at specified intervals (time targeting). A runout mode allows for ground track propagation without targeting. The analytic mean-element propagation algorithm used in GTARG includes all perturbations that are known to cause significant variations in the satellite ground track. These include earth oblateness, luni-solar gravity, and drag, as well as the thrust due to impulsive maneuvers and unspecified along-track satellite fixed forces. Merson's extension of Grove's theory is used for the computation of the geopotential field. Kaula's disturbing function is used to attain the luni-solar gravitational perturbations. GTARG includes a satellite unique drag model which incorporates an approximate mean orbital Jacchia-Roberts atmosphere and a variable mean area model. Error models include uncertainties due to orbit determination, maneuver execution, drag unpredictability, as well as utilization of the knowledge of along-track satellite fixed forces. Maneuver Delta-v magnitudes are targeted to precisely maintain either the unbiased ground track itself, or a comfortable (3 sigma) error envelope about the unbiased ground track. GTARG is written in VAX-FORTRAN for DEC VAX Series computers running VMS. GTARG output is provided in two forms: an executive report summary which is in tabular form, and a plot file which is formatted as EZPLOT input namelists. Although the EZPLOT program and documentation are included with GTARG, EZPLOT requires PGPLOT, which was written by the California Institute of Technology Astronomy Department. (For non-commercial use, the CalTech-copyrighted program PGPLOT is available via anonymous ftp at the following internet address: deimos. caltech. edu.) GTARG users without access to PGPLOT may want to use a standard spreadsheet program to produce plots of the tabular <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> <b>data</b> stored in the executive report summary. Alternatively, using information provided in the GTARG User's Reference Manual, GTARG users may write a graphics interpreter for the system of their choice. The standard distribution medium for GTARG is a 1600 BPI 9 -track magnetic tape in DEC VAX BACKUP format. It is also available on a TK 50 tape cartridge in DEC VAX BACKUP format.

A nineteen element state vector is used in Kalman filter to process the measurements. The acceleration components of the shuttle are taken to be independent exponentially-correlated random variables. Nine elements of the state vector are the measurement bias errors associated with range and two angles for each tracking station.

40|$|The {{dominant}} error {{source in}} estimating the orbital {{position of a}} satellite from <b>ground</b> based <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> is the modeling of the Earth's gravity field. The resulting orbit error due to gravity field model errors are predominantly long wavelength in nature. This results in an orbit error signature that is strongly correlated over distances {{on the size of}} ocean basins. Anderle and Hoskin (1977) have shown that the orbit error along a given <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> also is correlated to some degree with the orbit error along adjacent <b>ground</b> <b>tracks.</b> This cross track correlation is verified here and is found to be significant out to nearly 1000 kilometers in the case of TOPEX/POSEIDON when using the GEM-T 1 gravity model. Finally, it was determined that even the orbit error at points where ascending and descending ground traces cross is somewhat correlated. The implication of these various correlations is that the orbit error due to gravity error is geographically correlated. Such correlations have direct implications when using altimetry to recover oceanographic signals...|$|R

Consolidation of the two networks had been recommended by an all-Networks NASA planning group and presented to NASA top management in October of that year. The consolidated network of 1986 will make use of facilities that are now included in the Goddard <b>Ground</b> Spaceflight <b>Tracking</b> and <b>Data</b> Network as well as the existing JPL Deep Space Network. These facilities will be combined and modified to provide a consolidated network that is capable of supporting the set of planetary and high earth orbiter missions that are planned for that era. The drivers {{for the development of the}} consolidated network are both technical and economic. The consolidated network must provide the increased sensitivity needed to support the Voyager 2 spacecraft at its distant encounters with Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{with which}} orbits for the Global Positioning System (GPS) spacecraft, can be computed directly affects {{the accuracy of}} the resulting site coordinates and polar motion. Several groups routinely analyze GPS <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> to compute precise orbits and terrestrial reference frame solutions. In this paper, we infer {{the accuracy of the}} orbits of two of the GPS satellites by comparing to independent laser ranges of subcentimeter accuracy obtained by a small but reasonably well distributed network of tracking sites. We find that all seven International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS) analysis centers achieve range residual root mean square (rms) errors at or below the 100 mm level. The best orbit solutions, from JPL, CODE, and the IGS combined product, yield a residual rms of about 50 mm. These residuals are consistent with three dimensional orbit errors of less than 150 mm. Estimating yaw rates for the spacecraft during shadow events, and using these estimates to compute the laser residual, significantly improves the fit. A small mean residual value of - 15 to - 30 mm seems to exist for most centers and laser sites which is not fully explained at present, but may be due to uncertainties in the corrections to the laser data, such as the reflector to spacecraft center of mass vector or small reference frame differences between the SLR sites and the GPS orbits...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} the {{destruction}} of habitat connectivity can lead to species extinction by isolation of population. Identifying important habitat corridors to enhance habitat connectivity is imperative for species conservation by preserving dispersal pattern to maintain genetic diversity. Circuit theory is a novel tool to model habitat connectivity as it considers habitat as an electronic circuit board and species movement as a certain amount of current moving around through different resistors in the circuit. Most studies involving circuit theory have been carried out at small scales on large ranging animals like wolves or pumas, and more recently on tigers. This calls for a study that tests circuit theory at a large scale to model micro-scale habitat connectivity. The present study on a small South-Asian geoemydid, the Tricarinate Hill-turtle (Melanochelys tricarinata), focuses on habitat connectivity at a very fine scale. The Tricarinate has a small body size (carapace length: 127 – 175  mm) and home range (8000 – 15000  m 2), with very specific habitat requirements and movement patterns. We used very high resolution Worldview satellite data and extensive field observations to derive a model of landscape permeability at 1  :  2, 000 scale to suit the target species. Circuit theory was applied to model potential corridors between core habitat patches for the Tricarinate Hill-turtle. The modelled corridors were validated by extensive <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> collected using thread spool technique and found to be functional. Therefore, circuit theory is a promising tool for accurately identifying corridors, to aid in habitat studies of small species...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ground-level {{measurements of}} sonic boom signatures made {{as part of}} the SR- 71 sonic boom propagation experiment recently completed at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California. Ground level measurements were the final stage of this experiment which also included airborne measurements at near and intermediate distances from an SR- 71 research aircraft. Three types of sensors were deployed to three station locations near the aircraft <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> Pressure <b>data</b> were collected for flight conditions from Mach 1. 25 to Mach 1. 60 at altitudes from 30, 000 to 48, 000 ft. Ground-level measurement techniques, comparisons of data sets from different ground sensors, and sensor system strengths and weaknesses are discussed. The well-known N-wave structure dominated the sonic boom signatures generated by the SR- 71 aircraft at most of these conditions. Variations in boom shape caused by atmospheric turbulence, focusing effects, or both were observed for several flights. Peak pressure and boom event duration showed some dependence on aircraft gross weight. The sonic boom signatures collected in this experiment are being compiled in a data base for distribution in support of the High Speed Research Program...|$|R
40|$|Wildlife-based tourism, {{which is}} Kenya’s second largest {{economic}} sector, {{is threatened by}} the risk of extinction of many wildlife species in the country. The endemic roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus langheldi) now only survives in Ruma National Park (RNP) where its population has been declining continuously since 1976. This thesis investigates the roan’s habitat use and selection, causes of population decline and population viability in RNP {{with the aim of}} recommending scientifically-based management interventions for population recovery and sustainable conservation. Roan movement patterns and habitat use were investigated using 4 home range estimation techniques. Habitat selection was studied at multi-spatial scales using compositional analysis, logistic regression, and information-theoretic (IT) and multi-model inference (MMI) techniques. Data for this study consisted of population estimates for roans and other grazers, Landsat images, soil maps, digital terrain data, rainfall records, snare distribution records, and roan <b>ground</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>data.</b> Identification of causes of population decline was carried out using both multivariate and univariate techniques. A generic population viability analysis (PVA) package was used to (i) estimate the likelihood of roan extinction under various management options; and (2) rank the management alternatives for roan population recovery. All 4 home range estimators are useful in characterizing different aspects of the roan home range, but overall the local convex hull method produced the most realistic home ranges. The three habitat selection methods yielded similar results but the IT techniques demonstrated superior qualities as they identified important habitat variables and produced the most accurate model predictions. MMI averaged models coupled with GIS data developed very informative habitat suitability and poaching risk maps. Analysis of habitat selection indicated different usage in seasons and spatial scales depending on water availability, habitat composition and burned status, and distribution of eco-geographical features. High adult mortality due to poaching with snares was identified as the main cause of roan population decline. Other important factors included habitat change and rainfall variability with its associated droughts and floods. PVA showed that under the current conditions, the roan population cannot persist more than 3 decades. Several anti-poaching and prioritized management interventions to curb poaching and promote population recovery are described.
