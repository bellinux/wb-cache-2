While early tests of aptitude, such as Seashore's The Measurement of Musical Talent, sought to measure innate musical talent through discrimination tests of pitch, interval, rhythm, consonance, memory, etc., later research found these approaches to have little predictive power and to be influenced greatly by the test-taker's mood, motivation, confidence, fatigue, and boredom when taking the test.|$|E

500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court. [...] Sotomayor first noted {{that this was not a}} case of first impression, and that the court had ruled on a similar issue only seven years previously. [...] Sotomayor stated that Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt held that when the government makes a contractual promise to pay in return for services, the government is bound to pay for those services. [...] This was a long-standing principle of contract law, dating back to Ferris, and the [...] "principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States." [...] If the appropriation exceeds the amount of the individual contract, then the government is bound to honor the contract. [...] Sotomayor stated that although the situation that Congress placed the BIA in is frustrating, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> for Congress to resolve. [...] The Court affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court. [...] Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor's opinion.|$|E

[...] "Even people who are extremely critical of their own government, and there are many Chinese who are very critical of their own government, even those people are filled with a sense of pride that China is hosting these Olympics. Many of them have taken the view that those who would somehow boycott the Olympics are doing so out of a desire to keep China down and otherwise humiliate and embarrass China.

2500|$|According to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter. All the narrations {{regarding}} this are weak. As {{far as the}} claim of Shias is concerned, that when the verse of Holy Quran, [...] "And give the relative his right", was revealed, the Prophet gave Fadak to his daughter, then this argument is weak. First of all, this narration is weak because of the narrator Atiyah al-Awfi. Secondly, this verse was revealed in Makkah, and Fadak was conquered when Muslims were in Madinah. It is not possible that the verse regarding Fadak was revealed {{at a time when}} Fadak was not {{in the hands of the}} Muslims. This is not the case of the applicability of a law, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of the invalidity of a gift before it comes in the hands of a person. Moreover, Muhammad did not gave worldly things to his daughter. He even refused to give her a maid, hence it is not possible that he could give her a huge piece of land.|$|E
60|$|The {{national}} resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe, inexhaustible. The {{public purpose}} to re-establish {{and maintain the}} national authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable. The manner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful consideration of all the evidence accessible {{it seems to me}} that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good. He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union, precisely what we will not and can not give. His declarations to this effect are explicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He can not voluntarily reaccept the Union; we can not voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue is distinct, simple, and inflexible. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> which can only be tried by war and decided by victory. If we yield, we are beaten; if the Southern people fail him, he is beaten. Either way it would be the victory and defeat following war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause is not necessarily true of those who follow. Although he can not reaccept the Union, they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and reunion. The number of such may increase. They can at any moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national authority under the Constitution. After so much the Government could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain or allow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating only in Constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain, and other possible, questions are and would be beyond the Executive power to adjust; as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress and whatever might require the appropriation of money. The Executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within Executive control. In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past.|$|E
