25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese. But the Allies despatched envoys to Alexandria {{to demand that}} the Egyptian prince do precisely that. This left Muhammad Ali in a dilemma. On the one hand, as an experienced statesman, he knew that with the Great Powers backing Greek autonomy, the game {{was up in the}} Peloponnese. On the other, he was reluctant to be seen as betraying his overlord, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he had declared jihad, and also to inflict on his son Ibrahim the humiliation of a forced withdrawal. So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the hope that in the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies that would permit Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E

500|$|Chuck Kleinhans {{states that}} the {{difference}} between a guilty pleasure and a cult film {{can be as simple as}} the number of fans; David Church raises the question of how many people it takes to form a cult following, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> home video makes fans difficult to count. [...] As these cult films become more popular, they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as camp, irony, genuine affection, or combinations thereof. [...] Earnest fans, who recognize and accept the film's faults, can make minor celebrities of the film's cast, though the benefits are not always clear. [...] Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously. [...] Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious, artistic-minded films. [...] This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle, method-inspired acting. [...] Mark Chalon Smith of the Los Angeles Times says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas, such as camp or transgressive content. [...] Smith {{states that the}} early films of John Waters are amateurish and less influential than claimed, but Waters' outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema. [...] Films such as [...] Myra Breckinridge (1970) and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) can experience critical reappraisal later, once their camp excess and avant-garde filmmaking are better accepted, and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy. [...] Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them, as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic.|$|E

The so-called “Landigeist” (homeland spirit) flooded through the land and - coming shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War - gave people a feeling of an unbroken national will for independence against all the demands of Germany and the annexation of the German-speaking cantons into a Greater German Reich.

2500|$|Later that year, her {{writings}} on arson attacks in Frankfurt as {{protests against the}} Vietnam War resulted in her developing an acquaintance with the perpetrators, most significantly Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin. She stopped writing for konkret which had in her opinion evolved into a completely commercial magazine {{in the early part}} of 1969, and many other authors followed her. She stated that neither she nor her collaborators wanted to give a left-wing alibi to the magazine, that sooner or later [...] "would become part of the counter-revolution, a thing that I cannot gloss over with my co-operation, <b>especially</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible to deter its course". Later, they organised an occupation at konkrets office (along with several members of the [...] ), to distribute proclamations to the employees, something that failed since Röhl learned about it, and moved the employees to their homes to continue their work from there. Finally, Röhl's house was vandalised by some of the protesters. Meinhof arrived in Röhl's villa at 11:30, after police and journalists had already arrived. She was accused by Röhl (and subsequently described by the media) as the organizer of the vandalism. It was difficult to prove, as she was not there when it happened.|$|E

My attempt here is to analyse the relationship between happiness as a state of the individual and the states of the external world and the brain events related to (or, in some hypotheses, causally responsible for) its occurrence. It can be maintained that different degrees of realism are suitable to describe the states of happiness and this fact might have relevant psychological implications, namely for the so-called positive psychology.

More controversially, from 1888, when he became a Romanian delegate to the Paris World Fair, Claymoor was depicted as a political client of the ruling Conservative Party.

He takes up mountaineering, and goes off by himself periodically, leaving a bored and slightly paranoid Ginevra alone in their rural setting, with uncomfortable relations with her inlaws, including straightlaced and judgemental John. She travels to London frequently, to see girlfriends and drink away her worries. Robert confides to Ginevra that following a friend's death in a mountaineering accident, he is terrified of the prospect of dying, <b>especially</b> moreso <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Lionel is dead.

40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector in the}} Netherlands has {{lost much of its}} importance over the last 50 years {{in terms of the number}} of people involved and its relative contribution to the economy - even though production is still increasing. Yet, the area under agricultural use has changed relatively little: farmland still dominates the country. The question for the future is how expected further changes in agriculture will affect agricultural land use: how much land will be taken out of production and to what use it will be put. This is <b>especially</b> relevant <b>now</b> <b>that</b> the Dutch Government has decided to loosen its grip on spatial planning. Two opposing socio-economic scenarios are therefore drafted that offer a coherent view on agricultural change, external pressures and government intervention. Implementing these in a land use simulation model provides an initial answer to the possible future of agricultural land in the country. © 2005 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG...|$|R

40|$|Suspected sex {{offences}} {{are difficult}} to investigate and prosecute. In many instances the only evidence that exists is an account from a complainant and one from a suspect. This means that the way that these accounts are elicited with an investigative interview are critical. In this chapter we will outline {{what we know about}} effective strategies for interviewing both complainants and suspects. Effective interviewing of complainants can dramatically increase the volume of information a complainant provides and has the potential to increase the credibility of this evidence. This is <b>especially</b> relevant <b>now</b> <b>that</b> recorded police interviews can be provided as evidence-in-chief in some jurisdictions. Suspect interviewing can be enhanced by using non-judgmental approaches, allowing to the suspect to give his own account, and by other methods. We will draw together complainant and suspect interviewing to show how effective investigative interviewing can enhance the investigation and prosecution of sex crimes.

5000|$|In {{selecting}} {{an appropriate}} typeface, Mackiewicz focuses {{on what she}} calls [...] "typeface personality". She researches other technical communicators’ works {{to come up with}} a definition of typeface personality as [...] "that aspect of typeface that imbues it ‘with the power to evoke in the perceiver certain emotional and cognitive responses’" [...] and [...] "the ability to convey different feelings and moods…strength, elegance, agitation, silliness, friendliness, scariness, and other moods". Mackiewicz further explains that: [...] "increased attention to typeface personality is <b>especially</b> important <b>now</b> <b>that</b> students have access to thousands of typefaces, many of which can detract from or conflict with the seriousness, professionalism, and competency that students intend to convey". The selection of typeface is also important in situations where more than one typeface is present in a form or document. Mackiewicz says: [...] "if more than one typeface is being used within a document, students should also carefully consider the extent to which the personalities of the typefaces they have selected are concordant".|$|R
