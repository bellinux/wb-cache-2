50|$|The Kadu {{language}}s, {{also known}} as Kadugli-Krongo or Tumtum, are a small language family of the Kordofanian <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping,</b> once included in Niger-Congo but since Thilo Schadeberg (1981) widely seen as Nilo-Saharan. However, {{there is little evidence}} for either classification, and a conservative classification would treat the Kadu languages as an independent family.|$|E
50|$|The Kordofanian {{languages}} are a <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping</b> of five language groups spoken in the Nuba Mountains of the Kurdufan, Sudan: Talodi-Heiban languages, Lafofa languages, Rashad languages, Katla languages and Kadu languages. The first four groups are {{branches of the}} Niger-Congo family, whereas Kadu is now widely seen as {{a branch of the}} Nilo-Saharan family.|$|E
5000|$|Like Matisoff, van Driem {{acknowledges}} that the relationships of the [...] "Kuki-Naga" [...] languages (Kuki, Mizo, Meitei, etc.), both amongst {{each other and to}} the other languages of the family, remain unclear. However, rather than placing them in a <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping,</b> as Matisoff does, van Driem leaves them unclassified.He has proposed several hypotheses, including the reclassification of Chinese to a Sino-Bodic subgroup: ...|$|E

On January 6, 2009, President George Bush, in creating the monument, added both islands to the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, Roger Blench (2008) [...] has {{posited that}} the Adamawa {{languages}} are a <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping,</b> not a language family, and has broken up its various branches in his proposal of the Savannas family. He retained Boyd and Kleinewillinghöfer's Leko-Nimbari and Mbum-Day families, but gave them no special connection to each other. He removed Waja from the Waja-Jen branch and reassigned it with Kam isolate; {{the placement of}} Baa is not clear. Fali is excluded from Savannas altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Potawatomi is {{a member}} of the Algonquian {{language}} family (itself a member of the larger Algic stock). It is usually classified as a Central Algonquian language, with languages such as Ojibwe, Cree, Menominee, Miami-Illinois, Shawnee and Fox. The label [...] "Central Algonquian" [...] signifies a <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping</b> rather than the group of languages descended from a common ancestor language within the Algonquian family. Of the Central languages, Potawatomi is most similar to Ojibwe, but it also has borrowed a considerable amount of vocabulary from the Sauk.|$|E

5000|$|The Southeast Papuan or [...] "Bird's Tail" [...] {{languages}} are a <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping</b> {{of half a}} dozen small families of Papuan languages in the [...] "Bird's Tail" [...] (southeastern peninsula) of New Guinea: Koiarian, Kwalean, Manubaran, Yareban, Mailuan, and Dagan. They are all believed {{to be part of the}} Trans-New Guinea (TNG) phylum, but have not been shown to be any more closely related to each other than they are to other TNG families. However, they do all have in common ya for 'you' (plural) instead of proto-TNG *gi.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} Athabaskan language family is complex, and its exact shape is still a hotly debated issue among experts. The conventional three-way split into Northern, Pacific Coast, and Southern is essentially based on geography and the physical distribution of Athabaskan peoples rather than sound linguistic comparisons. Despite this inadequacy, current comparative Athabaskan literature demonstrates that most Athabaskanists still use the three-way <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping</b> rather {{than any of the}} proposed linguistic groupings given below, because none of them has been widely accepted. This situation will presumably change as both documentation and analysis of the languages improves.|$|E
50|$|Nuba is a {{collective}} term {{used for the}} various indigenous peoples who inhabit the Nuba Mountains of South Kordofan state in Sudan. Although the term is used to describe {{them as if they}} composed a single group, the Nuba is an umbrella term encompassing multiple distinct peoples that speak different languages, often belonging to unrelated language families. Estimates of the Nuba population vary widely; the Sudanese government estimated that they numbered 1.07 million in 2003. The term {{should not be confused with}} the Nubians, an ethnic group speaking the Nubian languages, some of whom form part of the Nuba <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping</b> of peoples (Hill Nubians).|$|E

50|$|The Bornean {{languages}} are a <b>geographic</b> <b>group</b> of Austronesian language families indigenous {{to the islands}} of Borneo and Madagascar, with the exclusion of Ibanic (Malayic Dayak) and other Malayic languages. There is little reason to think they form a genealogical clade.|$|R
50|$|Lelemi or Lefana (Lε-lεmi, Lε-fana) {{is spoken}} by the Buem {{people in the}} mountainous Volta Region of Ghana.

5000|$|Fula , {{also known}} as Fulani [...] or Fulah (Fula: Fulfulde, Pulaar, Pular; Peul), is a {{language}} spoken {{as a set of}} various dialects in a continuum that stretches across some 20 countries in West and Central Africa. Along with other related languages such as Serer and Wolof, it belongs to the Senegambian branch within the Niger-Congo languages, which does not have tones, unlike most other Niger-Congo languages. More broadly, it belongs to the Atlantic <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping</b> within Niger-Congo. It is spoken as a first language by the Fula people ("Fulani", Fulɓe) from the Senegambia region and Guinea to Cameroon and Sudan and by related groups such as the Toucouleur people in the Senegal River Valley. It is also spoken as a second language by various peoples in the region, such as the Kirdi of northern Cameroon and northeastern Nigeria.|$|E

40|$|Aggregate-level (macro) {{data are}} {{sometimes}} used when examining health care issues. Although {{they may be}} more accessible than individual (micro) observations, their interpretation is subject to ecological bias which in most cases is not measurable. This paper examines the implications of using aggregate-level data by conducting two separate analyses (micro and macro). Using as a database hospital episodes of care for the North Carolina Medicare aged population, regression models are developed from an examination of <b>geographic</b> <b>grouping</b> effects to explore the impact of extended care services, skilled nursing facility, and home health agency care on acute care hospital days. Specific problems encountered are: variable definition, collinearity, variance reduction, dilution of effect, spurious correlation, and observation influence. Stronger collinear (correlation among independent variables) relations occur at the macro-level than at the micro-level and spurious macro-correlations result from model specification and definition of interaction effects...|$|E
