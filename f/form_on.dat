5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum.

5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can <b>form</b> <b>on</b> planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

30|$|Similar to FF {{three factors}} that are {{constructed}} using the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and B/M equity ratio 4, the FF five factors are constructed on Chinese A-share stock market using the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and book-to-price (Size-B/P portfolios), the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and operating profitability (Size-OP portfolios), and the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and investment (Size-Inv portfolios). The Size-OP portfolios and Size-Inv portfolios are formed {{in the same way}} as the Size-B/M portfolios, except that the second sort variable is operating profitability or investment. At the end of each June, the intersections of two portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size, small (S) and big (B), and three portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> profitability, weak profitability (W), neutral profitability (N), and robust profitability (R), are constructed into six “Size-OP” portfolios: SW, SN, SR, BW, BN, and BR 5.

5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that <b>form</b> <b>on</b> the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E

5|$|A {{circulation}} {{began to}} <b>form</b> <b>on</b> June 18 {{in the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico, prompting gale warnings. It was declared Subtropical Depression One the same day. The depression made landfall {{on the morning of}} June 18 just north of Spring Hill, Florida and gained subtropical storm status over land. The storm was classified as Subtropical Storm One by the National Hurricane Center, as the rule was not to name subtropical storms. The subtropical storm moved to the northeast and crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19. Even though the minimum central pressures remained low, the circulation expanded and became distorted. The subtropical storm peaked at 70mph winds (110km/h) on June 18, but did not reach its minimum pressure until June 20, when it dropped to 984mbar (29.07inHg). The subtropical storm was declared an extratropical storm near the Canadian Maritimes the same day.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples <b>form</b> <b>on</b> the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
