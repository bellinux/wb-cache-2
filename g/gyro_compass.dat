25|$|Sailing from Argentia 14 January 1942, Jones joined Convoy HX 169, {{which was}} headed for Iceland. The convoy {{encountered}} a violent storm; heavy seas and winds of force 9 scattered its ships' convoy. Separated from the convoy, Jones steamed independently for Hvalfjörður, Iceland. Though hampered by a shortage of fuel, an inoperable <b>gyro</b> <b>compass,</b> an erratic magnetic compass, and the continuous pounding of the storm, Jones arrived on the 19th. Five days later, she escorted three merchant ships to Argentia. Once again heavy seas and fierce winds separated the ships, and Jones continued toward Argentia with one Norwegian merchantman. She detected and attacked another submarine 2 February 1942, but her depth charges yielded no visible results.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} the {{conversion}} was completed, BAVG-1 was transferred to and commissioned in the Royal Navy {{as part of the}} Lend-Lease program. On 23 December 1941, three US Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats landed on Archer for trials to the launch accelerator. The accelerator misfired, causing the first aircraft to dive into the sea as sufficient airspeed had not been gained. The remaining two aircraft were successfully flown off. Archer put into the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 December 1941 for repairs to the accelerator, which had been damaged in the misfire. On 2 January 1942, Archer successfully completed her sea trials. On 9 January, she sailed down the Delaware River bound for Norfolk, Virginia where she was to load aircraft for ferrying to the United Kingdom. Her <b>gyro</b> <b>compass</b> failed near Goose Island and then her engines developed problems. After repairs were effected she arrived at Norfolk and on 12 January she embarked eleven Grumman Martlets.|$|E

It also has two headlights in front of the hull and a searchlight on the right-hand side of the top of the turret. It lagged behind other Soviet armoured fighting vehicles because only the driver had a night vision device and also because it has no fire or NBC (nuclear, biological, chemical) protection systems, which significantly reduced its effectiveness. The lack of NBC protection ended with the PT-76B, which has the PAZ ("protivo-atomnaya zashchita") NBC protection system. Because only the driver has night vision equipment, the crew has a vision range of [...] by day and [...] at night.|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, the {{blizzard}} disrupted the initial day's operations {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains, where the scheduled first flight of the operation from Newark was cancelled. AACMO's actual first effort left from Kansas City, Missouri, carrying 39 pounds of mail to St. Louis. Kenneth Werrell noted of the first flight out of Cleveland: [...] "The pilot on the first air mail flight needed three tries and three aircraft to get aloft. Ten minutes later, he returned with a failed <b>gyro</b> <b>compass</b> and cockpit lights, and obtained a flashlight to read the instruments." [...] Snow, rain, fog, and turbulent winds hampered flying operations {{for the remainder of}} the month over much of the United States.

2500|$|On 7 March 1942, Archer {{embarked}} twelve Martlets {{for delivery}} to [...] {{and her own}} four Fairey Swordfish aircraft of 834 Squadron which had flown out from Jamaica. She sailed on 18 March for San Juan, Puerto Rico in company with [...] and two destroyers as part of Convoy AS 2. On 22 March Archer again had problems with her steering gear. She put into San Juan on 23 March and rejoined the convoy on 24 March. Anti-submarine patrols were carried out without a sighting, although one Swordfish was badly damaged on 30 March when it lost its tailhook {{and ended up in}} the safety barrier. Although her engines and <b>gyro</b> <b>compass</b> continued to give trouble, she arrived at Freetown. Sierra Leone on 3 April. On 9 April, Archers twelve brand new Martlets were transferred to Illustrious and two Martlets from Illustrious were transferred to Archer.|$|E
2500|$|She {{departed}} Norfolk on 13 January but {{was soon}} in trouble, as her steering developed a fault and her <b>gyro</b> <b>compass</b> failed. Repairs {{were made and}} she set course for Kingston, Jamaica. Later that day, Archer had a collision with the American owned, Peruvian flagged [...] SS Brazos some [...] east of Charleston, South Carolina (...) [...] Archer sustained damage to her bow, and eventually settled down at the bow by 5 degrees after the damage and flooding had been contained. Both ships were dead in the water. The 35 crewmembers of Brazos transferred to Archer in their own lifeboats and Brazos sank on 14 January. Archers captain had radioed for assistance and at first light started to make for the coast, but as her propeller was half out of the water, progress was minimal. On 16 January, Archer rendezvoused with US Coastguard tug Tallapoosa which unsuccessfully attempted to tow Archer. It was decided that Archer should continue under her own power until a more powerful tug could assist her. On 17 January, [...] reached her and proceeded to tow her to Charleston, where she arrived on 21 January. She entered dry dock on 28 January for repairs, which took about six weeks.|$|E

Upon graduation he was assigned a navigator aboard USCGC Pontchartrain, a newly delivered Lake-class cutter built at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation yards at Quincy, Massachusetts. In July 1930 he was transferred to USCGC Wainwright as the executive officer but was assigned in November to be the Coast Guard Representative at the Philadelphia Navy Yard while the USCGC Herndon was being readied for Rum Patrol duty. In May 1932, Richmond was reassigned to Coast Guard Headquarters with the assignment of assembling a Coast Guard marksmanship team at Camp Curtis Guild, Massachusetts that would compete at National Rifle Association matches held at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. After returning to Headquarters in August he was assigned as executive officer of [...] patrolling the waters of the Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The newly reporting executive officer was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 October 1932 and he continued to serve in that billet until being reassigned once again to Coast Guard Headquarters in September 1935. While working at headquarters, he enrolled at his alma mater, George Washington University as a law student. He graduated [...] "with distinction" [...] on 8 June 1938 with a Juris Doctor degree. The Coast Guard put Richmond's law degree to immediate use by assigning him duties in preparing law enforcement educational materials and assisting the Coast Guard Engineer-in-Chief with land records for property used by the Coast Guard. As the Coast Guard's first legal specialist he assisted in writing regulations for the recently formed Coast Guard Auxiliary, which at the time was known as the Coast Guard Reserve.|$|E

Conclusions: The mathematical model of the gimballed attitude and heading reference system including the vertical gyro and directional gyro is derived. The detailed expressions for control (correction) moments are obtained. The full analysis of the researched system kinematics was carried out.

40|$|Throughout the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Integration and Testing (I&T) {{phase of}} the project, the Attitude Control System (ACS) team {{completed}} numerous tests on each hardware component in ever more flight like environments. The ACS utilizes {{a select group of}} attitude sensors and actuators. This paper chronicles the evolutionary steps taken to verify each component was constantly ready for flight as well as providing invaluable trending experience with the actual hardware. The paper includes a discussion of each ACS hardware component, lessons learned of the various stages of I&T, a discussion of the challenges that are unique to the LRO project, as well as a discussion of work for future missions to consider as part of their I&T plan. LRO ACS sensors were carefully installed, tested, and maintained over the 18 month I&T and prelaunch timeline. Care was taken with the optics of the Adcole Coarse Sun Sensors (CSS) to ensure their critical role in the Safe Hold mode was fulfilled. The use of new CSS stimulators provided the means of testing each CSS sensor independently, in ambient and vacuum conditions as well as over a wide range of thermal temperatures. Extreme bright light sources were also used to test the CSS in ambient conditions. The integration of the two SELEX Galileo Star Trackers was carefully planned and executed. Optical ground support equipment was designed and used often to check the performance of the star trackers throughout I&T in ambient and thermal/vacuum conditions. A late discovery of potential contamination of the star tracker light shades is discussed in this paper. This paper reviews how each time the spacecraft was at a new location and orientation, the Honeywell Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU) was checked for data output validity.
