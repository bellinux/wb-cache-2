5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had <b>in</b> <b>days</b> previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, a {{much closer}} gold rush {{occurred}} in the San Bernardino Mountains when prospector William Holcomb discovered significant deposits, just over the northern drainage divide of the Santa Ana River. This discovery exploded into a full-scale gold mining operation <b>in</b> <b>days.</b> The Santa Ana River served as a conduit for miners traveling to the region {{and many of the}} forests in the upper basin experienced clearcutting {{as a result of the}} high resource demands of the boom. Gold was also discovered in Lytle Creek in that same year. Following the gold rush, the cultivation of citrus became the mainstay of the economy of the lower Santa Ana River area. Through the late 19th century, citrus fields covered much of the coastal plain and led to the naming of Orange County.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} <b>in</b> <b>Days</b> of Ruin is for {{the player}} to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, {{there are two ways}} to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across the different types of terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the visual range of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{expression}} for estrogen receptor subtype- 1 (ESR 1), interleukin- 1 beta (IL 1 B), and apoptosis-associated genes, {{as well as}} nitric oxide synthase activity, were examined in corpora lutea (CL) of rabbits after prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)) administration on either day 4 or day 9 of pseudopregnancy. By reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, the steady-state level of ESR 1 transcript was lower (P < 0. 01) and that of anti-apoptotic B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL 2) -like 1 (BCL 2 L 1) was greater <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 4 (P < 0. 01) than <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 9 CL. Western blot analysis revealed that BCL 2 -associated X protein (BAX) abundance was greater <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 4 (P < 0. 01) than <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 9 CL, whereas BCL 2 L 1 protein was undetectable at both luteal stages. After PGF(2 alpha), ESR 1 transcript decreased (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 9 CL, whereas IL 1 B mRNA showed a transitory increase (P < 0. 01) at both stages. The pro-apoptotic tumor protein p 53 (TP 53) gene had diminished (P < 0. 01) on day 4 and on day 9 after a transitory increase (P < 0. 01), whereas the BAX/BCL 2 L 1 expression ratio increased (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 9 CL 24 h after treatment. Following PGF(2 alpha), TP 53 protein increased (P < 0. 01) at both luteal stages, and BAX decreased (P < 0. 01) <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 4 CL but increased (P < 0. 01) 24 h later <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 9 CL; BCL 2 L 1 became detectable 6 h later <b>in</b> <b>day</b> 4 CL.

5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced <b>in</b> <b>Days</b> of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{aviation}} in Trøndelag {{started in}} 1937, when Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) started seaplane services from Ilsvika and Jonsvannet in Trondheim. These were terminated during World War II, but taken up {{again by the}} Royal Air Force and the Royal Norwegian Air Force {{during the summer of}} 1945. They were terminated in November due to the weather and RAF's withdrawal. The following year, DNL started services again, this time from Hommelvik. During winter, the route was not operated. The service was operated with a Short Sandringham flying boat to Oslo and Northern Norway, and a Junkers Ju-52 to Western Norway. The southbound and northbound Sandringhams and the Junkers all met at Hummelvik to exchange passengers. There was only room for two planes at the quay, so the third aircraft had to be anchored in the fjord. In 1947, the airport had 3,500 passengers. On 2 October 1948, the Bukkene Bruse Accident occurred, where a Sandringham aircraft crashed during landing, killing 19 people. In 1949, a reserve airport was built at Skogn, and people were transported from Hommelvik to Skogn along the Nordland Line in case the reserve airport was used. DNL became part of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 1951—the last year it used Hommelvik. Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap continued to use Hommelvik for some more year. Braathens SAFE started their route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu via Hamar Airport, Stafsberg and Røros Airport on 18 August 1953. However, they chose to operate their de Havilland Herons from Trondheim Airport, Lade, just a few kilometers outside of the city center, <b>in</b> <b>days</b> with clear weather. Braathens SAFE moved all services to Værnes in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, <b>in</b> <b>Days</b> of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E
