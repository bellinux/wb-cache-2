5|$|Male elk {{retain their}} antlers {{for more than}} <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> and {{are less likely to}} group with other males when they have antlers. Antlers provide a means of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} to examine <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> effect in Chinese stock markets by Statistical Methods. In Chinese stock markets, the stock rate of return which was got from <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> (January to June) is {{significantly}} higher than <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> year's(July to December). Also, the rate of return of <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> is highr than <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>year's</b> while <b>the</b> rate of return has been classified into two types which are daily {{rate of return on}} average and cumulative rate of return. <b>The</b> first <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> effect is independent existence because the stock rate of return in <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> is significantly above although classifying the rate of return from February to June which except January into daily rate of return on average and cu-mulative rate of return.

5|$|Tourist attractions in Omaha include history, sports, {{outdoors}} and cultural experiences. Its principal tourist attractions are the Henry Doorly Zoo and the College World Series. The Old Market in Downtown Omaha is another major attraction and {{is important to}} the city's retail economy. The city has been a tourist destination for many years. Famous early visitors included British author Rudyard Kipling and General George Crook. In 1883 Omaha hosted the first official performance of the Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show for eight thousand attendees.

5|$|Despite these numbers, not all {{the clergy}} were {{regularly}} present at the services in Elgin Cathedral. Absence was an enduring {{fact of life in}} all cathedrals in a period when careerist clerics would accept positions in other cathedrals. This {{is not to say that}} the time spent away from the chanonry was without permission, as some canons were appointed to be always present while others were allowed to attend on a part-time basis. The dean of Elgin was permanently in attendance; the precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, were available for <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The non-permanent canons had to attend continuously for three months. The chapter decided in 1240 to penalise persistently absent canons who broke the terms of their attendance by removing one seventh of their income. In the Diocese of Aberdeen and it is assumed in other bishoprics also, when important decisions of the chapter had to be taken, an absentee canon had to appoint a procurator to act on his behalf—this was usually one of the dignitaries who had a higher likelihood of being present. At Elgin in 1488, many canons were not abiding by the terms of their leave of absence, resulting in each of them receiving a formal warning and a summons; despite this, ten canons refused to attend and had a seventh of their prebendary income deducted. The bulk of the workload fell to the vicars and a smaller number of permanent canons who were responsible for celebrating high mass and for leading and arranging sermons and feast day processions. Seven services were held daily, most of which were solely for the clergy and took place behind the rood screen which separated the high altar and choir from lay worshipers. Only cathedrals, collegiate churches and large burgh churches were resourced to perform the more elaborate services; the services in the parish churches were more basic.|$|E

25|$|The {{rationale}} {{for building a}} railway through Solør was first and foremost tied to the large lumber resources in the area, especially in Finnskogen.

Glomma would need to receive several parallel canals and locks. The river is iced <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> and there are shifting sandbanks.

During this time Shore established a reputation for herself within the Canadian art community as a promising young painter. She taught classes, had solo shows at galleries in Toronto and showed in group exhibitions in Paris, London and Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|Formerly, {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the myth of Ishtar's descent took place {{after the death of}} Ishtar's lover Tammuz and that Ishtar had gone to the underworld to rescue him. However, the discovery of a corresponding myth about Inanna, the Sumerian counterpart of Ishtar, has shed some light on the myth of Ishtar's descent, including its somewhat enigmatic ending lines. In the Sumerian version of the story, Inanna can only return from the Underworld if someone else is taken there as her replacement. A horde of galla demons follow her out of the Underworld to ensure this. However, each time Inanna runs into someone, she finds him to be a friend and lets him go free. When she finally reaches her home, she finds her husband Dumuzid, the Sumerian equivalent of Tammuz, seated on his throne, not at all grieved by her death. In anger, Inanna allows the demons to take Dumuzid back to the underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid's sister Geshtinanna is grief-stricken and volunteers to spend <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> in the underworld, during which time Dumuzid can go free. The Ishtar myth presumably had a comparable ending, Belili being the Babylonian equivalent of Geshtinanna.|$|E
