I joined Dad's Army when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sixteen,</b> and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window. Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist?" ...|$|E
2500|$|With 19 Recordings {{continuing}} to manage him, DeWyze chose {{to take an}} optimistic view {{of the situation and}} saw it as an opportunity to finally make the record that he had always wanted to make. Feeling that he had been misunderstood as an artist, he returned to a folk rock sound, more comparable to what had been present on his independent albums. Many people were surprised to hear him release music in this style and drew comparisons to Mumford & Sons, but DeWyze responded, [...] "anyone can go back and listen to what I was doing when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sixteen</b> or seventeen years old, {{those are the kind of}} records that I was making then. I just wasn't able to put them out there like I am now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1861, Williamson {{worked for}} the local theatre company of Messrs. Hurd and Perkins as call-boy, general {{assistant}} and scenery and props maker. [...] There he made his official stage debut. [...] He later recalled: [...] "I used to act in amateur theatricals, and when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sixteen</b> I got an engagement with a company at the Milwaukee theatre. I was full of energy and enthusiasm, and did pretty well everything. My mornings were spent in learning fencing and dancing. In the afternoon I'd look after the box office, and at evening help the stage manager and take my part – sometimes three or four parts." [...] The next year, he joined the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Toronto, Canada and {{then moved on to}} New York where he found work as a dialect comedian and then played for several years at Wallack's Theatre. [...] From his seven-year apprenticeship there, Williamson emerged with a thorough knowledge of acting, play production and stage management. [...] He then played in a musical comedy at the Theatre Comique in New York under the management of W. H. Lingard. [...] Although Williamson was not a good singer, his talent for comedy carried him.|$|E

2500|$|RUTH: Yes, sir, I were; I {{were brought}} {{up to be a}} thief. Every soul as I knowed was a thief, and the best thief was the best thought on. Maybe a kid not long born ought to have knowed better. I dunno, I must ha' been born bad, for it seemed right enough to me. Well, it was in prison and out o' prison—three months here and six months there—till <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sixteen.</b> I {{sometimes}} thinks as if they'd bin half as ready to show me how to go right as they was to punish me for goin' wrong, I might have took the right turnin' and stuck to it afore this. At sixteen I got seven-year for shop-liftin', and was sent out to Port Phillip. I soon got a ticket and tried service and needlework, but no one wouldn't have me; and I got sick and tired of it all, and began to think o' putting an end to it, when I met a smooth-spoken chap—a gentleman, if you please—as wanted to save me from the danger afore me. Well, wot odds? He was a psalm-singing villain, and he soon left me. No need to tell the rest—to such as you it can't be told. I'm 'most as bad as I can be—as bad as I can be! ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place on}} the Sun Deck, where Teddy, {{reclining}} {{on one of his}} family's reserved deckchairs, reviews his recent diary entries. The document has been conscientiously edited and neatly written. It contains reminders to foster better relations with his father; commentary on a letter from a Professor of Literature; a list of vocabulary words to study and notes on his meditation schedule - all matters of self-improvement. While making his daily entry, he writes the following non sequitur: “It will either happen today or February 14, 1958 when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sixteen.</b> It <b>is</b> ridiculous to mention it even.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said quietly, [...] "it will {{lessen the}} ranks of the subalterns, for there must be a {{considerable}} number who are not many months older than <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> just <b>sixteen,</b> and <b>I</b> know there <b>are</b> some not older than that." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sixteen</b> I {{have been}} used to horses," [...] was the reply of Antonio to the {{question}} of Charles--Julia smiled at the ambiguity of the answer, and was confirmed in her impression that he had left college at that age to serve in the cavalry.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{could not}} go to the Church where the priests of the system exhorted such unconsidered vermin as I to resignation, I went to the secret {{societies}} as soon as I knew how to find my way. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sixteen</b> years old--no more, Razumov!

[...] "I should like {{everyone}} to be friends, and {{then there would be}} no need to have so many soldiers in Britain, and perhaps the emperor would order our legions home. Father says that we ought to look upon this as home now, for that the legion may remain here for years and years; but he said the other day that he thought that if everything was quiet here he should, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sixteen</b> years old, obtain leave from the governor, and go back to Rome for two or three years, and I think, though he has not said so outright, that he will perhaps retire and settle there." ...|$|R

60|$|ANNA--[Rising to her feet--brusquely.] Oh, cut it out! [Scornfully.] Little {{home in the}} country!

60|$|ANNA--I {{should say}} not! The {{old man of}} the family, his wife, and four sons--I had to slave for all of 'em.

60|$|But how I have {{anticipated}} my history!

6000|$|... "The first love-letter I ever wrote," [...] {{said the}} Minor Poet, [...] "was when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sixteen.</b> Her name was Monica; {{she was the}} {{left-hand}} girl in the third joint of the crocodile.

60|$|Before I {{was eleven}} I left the ranch {{and came to}} Oakland, where I spent {{so much of my}} time in the Free Public Library, eagerly reading {{everything}} that came to hand, that I developed the first stages of St. Vitus' dance from lack of exercise.

"I do {{not believe}} that the queen will forbid her {{subjects}} to give their aid to the people of the Netherlands; for she allowed many to fight in France for Conde and the Protestants against the Guises, and she will surely do the same now, since the sufferings of our brothers in the Netherlands have touched the nation far more keenly than did those of the Huguenots in France. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sixteen</b> now, and my father says that in another year he will rate me as his second mate, and methinks that there are not many men on board who can pull more strongly a rope, or work more stoutly at the capstan when we heave our anchor.
