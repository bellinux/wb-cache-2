Yet, we present findings that show that <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> propagation {{to the end of the}} beam depends on beam length. The practical question is: are beams about 1 m long optimal for assessing stability? Finite element modeling shows that the so called “far edge attraction ” becomes insignificant for beams longer than 2 m. In other words, <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> propagation be-comes independent of beam length when beams ≥ 2 m are used. To test the accuracy of 2 m tests for stability evaluation, we collected data on 135 side-by-side standard length ECTPs (full propagation) fol-lowed by 2 m ECTs. We only focused on ECTPs because we assumed 2 m ECTs would not propagate if standard length tests did not. These tests were preceded by an a priori stability assessment to reduce circularity or stability ratings based on test results. Our results show that the proportion of tests in agree-ment, i. e. ECTP and 2 m ECTP, increase with decreasing stability. We conclude that an ECTP followed by a 2 m ECTP is a clear red flag. The interpretation of an ECTP followed by a 2 m ECTN/X (no propaga-tion) is not clear. The main finding for practitioners is that a 2 m ECT can be used to give additional infor-mation about slope stability following an ECTP...|$|E

The goal {{of this research is}} to understand EFCP and inhibition for atmospheric conditions of important aerospace alloys: 7075 -T 651 (Al-Zn-Mg-Cu) and C 47 A-T 8 (Al-Cu-Li). A candidate chromate (CrO 42 -) replacement inhibitor, molybdate (MoO 42 -), is examined. MoO 42 - effectively inhibits EFCP in 7075 -T 651 stressed during full immersion in chloride solution; as understood by hydrogen environment embrittlement and film stability where MoO 42 - promotes crack tip passivity, thus reducing H uptake. MoO 42 - inhibition is promoted by reduced loading frequency and stress intensity range and potentials at or anodic to free corrosion. The inhibiting effect of MoO 42 - parallels that of CrO 42 -, but is shifted to lower frequencies suggesting the Mo-bearing passive film is less stable under crack tip deformation than the Cr-bearing.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in an experimental study of solder joint reliability is to determine when cracks occur in a solder joint or when a solder joint fails. Cracks in a real solder joint are difficult to identify using an X-Ray system. Cross-sectioning and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a destructive method. A common non-destructive test method is to monitor resistance increase in a solder joint or a daisy-chain. However, no scientific {{research has been done}} in establishing the relationship between the crack area of an interconnection and the change in resistance of the interconnection. This paper proposes a method of defining failure criteria as the resistance increase in a solder joint exceeding a threshold. The threshold is determined by k times the range over the natural variation in resistance measured by a measurement system. The natural variation by random cause is judged using X-bar and R charts. The principles of defining failure criteria are to be able to detect failure of solder joints as early as possible with minimum false detection due of measurement system error/variation. An experimental study confirmed that a <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> of an interconnection occurs when the increase of resistance in the interconnection is 10 times the natural variation of resistance change.

On days with <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in 1. 0 to 1. 5 m tests, we then made videos of tests 2 to 10 m long. We inserted markers for particle tracking to measure collapse amplitude, collapse wave speed, and wavelength.

We find that: (1) the proportion of tests with full propagation decreased with test length; (2) collapse was greater at the ends of the beams than in the centers; (3) collapse amplitudes in the longer tests were consistent with the shorter tests and did not reach a constant value; (4) collapse wavelengths in the longer tests were around 3 m, 2 × greater than what is predicted by the anticrack model. Based on our field tests and FE models, we conclude that the shorter tests fully propagated more frequently because of increased stress concentration from the far edge. The FE model suggests this edge effect occurs for PSTs up to 2 m long or a crack to beam length ratio ≥ 0. 20. Our results suggest that ECT and PST length guidelines may need to be revisited...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Corrosion-induced {{cracking}} of the con-crete cover poses {{a serious}} problem for serviceability of reinforced concrete structures. In the paper a new analytical model for predicting cover cracking due to corrosion of reinforcing steel is presented. In the model, concrete around a corroding reinforcing bar is considered as a thick-walled cylinder subjected to uniform pressure at its inner surface, which repre-sents expansion caused by corrosion products. The pressure leads to formation of radial cracks near the inner surface of the cylinder. In order to account for it, the cylinder {{is divided into two}} parts—a partially cracked inner cylinder and an uncracked outer one. Cracks in the inner cylinder are taken into account by gradually reducing its tangential stiffness along the radial direction. The model ensures a consistent stress-strain description within both inner and outer cylinders and complete continuity of stresses and strains on the boundary between the cylinders that distinguish it from previously published analytical models. The model is calibrated using available experimental data and then employed to estimate the amount of corrosion products penetrated into concrete pores before <b>full</b> <b>cracking</b> of the concrete cover.

Perhaps {{one of the most}} important parameters characterising bone quality is the toughness behaviour of bone. Particularly, fracture toughness, is becoming a popular means for evaluating bone quality. The method is moving from a single value approach that models bone as a linear-elastic material (using the stress intensity factor, K) towards <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> extension resistance curves (R-curves) using a non-linear model (the strain energy release rate in J-R curves). However, for explanted human bone or small animal bones, there are difficulties in measuring crack-extension resistance curves due to size constraints at the millimetre and sub-millimetre scale. This research proposes a novel "whitening front tracking" method that uses videography to generate full fracture resistance curves in small bone samples where crack propagation cannot typically be observed. Here we present this method on sharp edge notched samples (< 1 mm× 1 mm×Length) prepared from four human femora tested in three-point bending. Each sample was loaded in a mechanical tester with the crack propagation recorded using videography and analysed using an algorithm to track the whitening (damage) zone. Using the "whitening front tracking" method, full R-curves and J-R curves could be generated for these samples. The curves for this antiplane longitudinal orientation were similar to those found in the literature, being between the published longitudinal and transverse orientations. The proposed technique shows the ability to generate full "crack" extension resistance curves by tracking the whitening front propagation to overcome the small size limitations and the single value approach...|$|E

It is composed of microscopic ceramic tablets arranged in layers and tightly stacked to form a three-dimensional brick wall structure, where the mortar is {{a thin layer of}} biopolymers (20 – 30 nm). Although mostly made of a brittle ceramic, the structure of nacre is so well designed that its toughness is several order of magnitudes larger that the ceramic it is made of. How the microstructure of nacre controls its mechanical performance {{has been the focus of}} numerous studies over the past two decades, because such under-standing may inspire novel composite designs though biomimetics. This paper presents in detail uniaxial tension experiment performed on miniature nacre specimens. Large inelastic deformations were observed in hydrated condi-tion, which were explained by sliding of the tablets on one another and progressive locking generated by their micro-scopic waviness. Fracture experiments were also per-formed, and for the first time the <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> resistance curve was established for nacre. A rising resistance curve is an indication of the robustness and damage tolerance of that material.

Moreover, specific features of the microstructure and their relevance to associated toughening mechanisms were identified. These features and mecha-nisms, critical to the robustness of the shell, were finely tuned over millions of years of evolution. Hence, they are expected to serve as a basis to establish guidelines for the design of novel man-made composites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{accuracy}} of an adopted cohesive zone model (CZM) {{can affect the}} simulated fracture response signifi-cantly. The CZM has been usually obtained using global experimental response, e. g., load versus either crack opening displacement or load-line displacement. Apparent-ly, deduction of a local material property from a global response does not provide full confidence of the adopted model. The difficulties are: (1) fundamentally, stress cannot be measured directly and the cohesive stress distribution is non-uniform; (2) accurate measurement of the <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> profile (crack opening displacement at every point) is experimentally difficult to obtain. An attractive feature of digital image correlation (DIC) {{is that it allows}} relatively accurate measurement of the whole displacement field on a flat surface. It has been utilized to measure the mode I traction-separation relation. A hybrid inverse method based on combined use of DIC and finite element method is used in this study to compute the cohesive properties of a ductile adhesive, Devcon Plastic Welder II, and a quasi-brittle plastic, G- 10 /FR 4 Garolite. Fracture tests were conducted on single edge-notched beam specimens (SENB) under four-point bending. A full-field DIC algorithm was employed to compute the smooth and continuous displace-ment field, which is then used as input to a finite element model for inverse analysis through an optimization proce-dure. The unknown CZM is constructed using a flexible B-spline without any “a priori ” assumption on the shape. The inversely computed CZMs for both materials yield consis-tent results.

40|$|This is the author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] toughness of wood and wood composites has traditionally been characterized by a stress intensity factor, an initiation strain energy release rate (G[subscript init]) or a total energy to fracture (G[subscript f]). These parameters provide incomplete fracture characterization for these materials because the toughness changes as the crack propagates. Thus for materials such as wood, oriented strand board (OSB), plywood and laminated veneer lumber (LVL), it is essential to characterize the fracture properties during crack propagation by measuring a <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> resistant or R curve. This study used energy methods during crack propagation to measure full R curves and then compared the fracture properties of wood and various wood-based composites such as, OSB, LVL and plywood. The effect of exposure to elevated temperature on fracture properties of these materials was also studied. The steady state energy release rate (G[subscript SS]) of wood was lower than that of wood composites such as LVL, plywood and OSB. The resin in wood composites provides them with a higher fracture toughness compared to solid lumber. Depending upon the internal structure of the material the mode of failure also varied. With exposure to elevated temperatures, G[subscript SS] for all materials decreased while the failure mode remained the same. The scatter associated with conventional bond strength tests, such as internal bond (IB) and bond classification tests, renders any statistical comparison using those tests difficult. In contrast, fracture tests with R curve analysis may provide an improved tool for characterization of bond quality in wood composites...|$|E

Through the aid of scanning electron microscopy the fracture mechanisms observed during interaction testing were compared with the mechanisms present during constant temperature, constant amplitude testing. One block alternating temperature interaction testing grew significantly faster than the non-interaction prediction, while ten block alternating temperature interaction testing also grew faster but not to the same extent. One hundred block alternating testing grew slower than non-interaction predictions. It was found that as the number of alternating temperature cycles increased, changes in the gamma prime morphology (and hence deformation mode) caused changes in the environmental interactions thus demonstrating the sensitivity of the environmental interaction on the details of the deformation mode. SEM fractography was used to show that at low alternating cycles, 316 °C crack growth was accelerated due to crack tip embrittlement caused by 649 °C cycling. At higher alternating cycles the 316 °C cycling quickly grew through the embrittled crack tip but then grew slower than expected due to the possible formation of Kear-Wilsdorf locks at 649 °C. Overload interaction testing led to <b>full</b> <b>crack</b> retardation at 2. 0 x overloads for both 316 °C and 649 °C testing. 1. 6 x overloading at both temperatures led to retarded crack growth whereas 1. 3 x overloads at 649 °C created accelerated crack growth and at 316 °C the crack growth was retarded.

40|$|We {{describe}} an efficient technique, “Terminal Chop,” for full thickness nuclear segmentation in mature hard cataracts. Terminal chop utilizes {{the principle of}} secondary rock breakage system with stress concentration to break these hard nuclei. In this technique consonant to drag picks, a specially designed chopper “Terminator” is used to initiate a unique dispersive mechanical force to create a <b>full</b> thickness nuclear <b>crack</b> (crack formation) at the weakest soft and thin equator, which automatically traverses through the center and to the equator on the other side. Lateral separation of both the instruments placed at the equator, propagates the initial <b>full</b> thickness nuclear <b>crack</b> (crack propagation), breaking the entire nucleus into two complete pieces including the posterior plate. The direction of splitting follows the cleavage plane in a more direct manner, thus requiring least fracture force, least manipulation and stress, much lower than compressive stress, causing minimal trauma, and highly satisfactory postoperative results...|$|R
40|$|In the {{literature}} is possible to find an extense variety of syndromes associated with cleft palate, so in patients with this condition is essential to ask if the damage is or not associated with some syndrome. Necessary to provide adequate treatment. Case report: To the Service of Orthodontics, Las Higueras Hospital was derived a female patient, born on June 22 th, 2012. Clinical diagnosis was cleft lip and <b>full</b> <b>cracked</b> palate with a GAP of 17 mm, left and right macrostomia, malformed ears, epibulbar cyst in left eyeball, serie of oral papillomas and headphone level, apparently associating this condition {{to some kind of}} syndrome. It was made an acrylic plate for the patient can feed and initiates the treatment presurgical orthopedics. The mother recounts in the clinical History suffer diabetes, one of his sons has cognitive delay, not associated to syndrome. Imaging test shows mild hydrocephalus, jaw fully formation, normal audiometry. All changes are in facial area at {{the rest of the body}} is shown within normal parameters. Was performed a complete clinical and imaging examination and request help from geneticist, who collected all the facts confirm the presumptive diagnosis of Goldenhar syndrome. Many syndromes that manifest cleft palate are associated with genetic component, except that even Goldenhar syndrome of unknown cause. It is important to note that there are syndromes expressing varying degrees of severity of cracked palate to also give the patient a full treatment...|$|R
