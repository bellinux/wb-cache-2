This scheme mainly utilizes the available routing information in the existing AOMDV protocol. As a result, during the computation of maximum nodal residual energy in the routing, it significantly increases the routing control overhead and end-to-end latency.|$|E

We present NBLAST, a sensitive and rapid algorithm, for measuring pairwise neuronal similarity. NBLAST considers both position and local geometry, decomposing neurons into short segments; matched segments are scored using a probabilistic scoring matrix defined by statistics of matches and non-matches. We validated NBLAST on a published dataset of 16, 129 single Drosophila neurons. NBLAST can distinguish neuronal types down to the finest level (single identified neurons) without a priori <b>information.</b> <b>Cluster</b> analysis of extensively studied neuronal classes identified new types and unreported topographical features. Fully automated clustering organized the validation dataset into 1, 052 clusters, many of which map onto previously described neuronal types.

Transmittance and reflectance based devices were developed and both configurations generated sensitive and reliable data.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for the classification of molecules that uses a similarity matrix based on the graphs generated by each molecule. It {{is applied to the}} classification of five aliphatic alcohols. The inspection of the number of occurrence of each subgraph in an alcohol gives the alcohols which are similar. The similarity index results from dividing this number by the greatest value for each subgraph. Several distances d are defined and the similarity is calculated as sij = 1 dij. The molecular classification is carried out by neural network NevProp. The classification obtained is represented by the following scheme with successive branchings: (a,b,c,d,e) →(a,b,c,d) (e) →(a,b,c) (d) (e) →(a,c) (b) (d) (e) →(a) (b) (c) (d) (e). Single- and complete-linkage hierarchical cluster analyses perform a binary taxonomy of the parameters that is represented by the same scheme. Moreover, the split decomposition shows a great similarity in class (a,b,c), which is the class best defined by NevProp and cluster analysis. Therefore, NevProp classification is proposed as the best one. Key-Words:- neural network, molecular classification, subgraphs <b>information,</b> <b>cluster</b> analysis, split decomposition...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of cultural values on accounting uniformity and consistency among Arabic nations. Design/methodology/approach – A combination of a survey and analysis of published data on accounting <b>information.</b> <b>Cluster</b> analysis is used to classify the countries on the basis of accounting consistency and uniformity. Findings – The study indicates that the Hofstede-Gray hypothesis of accounting uniformity in Arab countries is supported by actual examination of accounting practice.

Nevertheless, the finding should be of interested to global investors, international accounting organizations (e. g. IFAC) and other academics who are researching accounting in the Middle East. Practical implications – The study indicates that in Arabic nations with a Muslim majority, cultural factors affect accounting development generally and accounting uniformity particularly. The study also shows that accounting practice in Saudi Arabia is less strict in term of uniformity in comparison with other Arabic countries.
