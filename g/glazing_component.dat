The applicability of existing models will be extended through additional characterization of the multilayer optical components from global spectrophotometric (UV–vis–NIR) measurements. A more complete interlayer film characterization, including reflectivity in the film–glass interface, will be provided. Singular solutions of the related equation systems will be derived for situations involving components with very low or null transmissivity. As {{a contribution to the}} fundamentals of the formalism, the condition relating the symmetry of the transmittance of the system with the symmetry of the transmissivity of its optical components will be studied. Finally, with the extension for the calculation of energy fluxes through the components of a multilayer system, analytical expressions for the components absorptivity will be derived. These results are particularly useful to quantify differences in energy absorption of the constituents of a laminated glass, as a tool to define, from the glazing design phase, the thermal and mechanical processing needed for each <b>glazing</b> <b>component.</b> Additionally, the model provides a procedure for the calculation of the absorptivity of encapsulated photovoltaic cells, which is directly related to cell efficiency in each particular configuration.

40|$|The IMAGE (IMplementation of Advanced Glazing in Europe) {{project was}} funded by the European Commission and {{involved}} glass manufactures, consultants and research organisations (see acknowledgements). The aims were to encourage appropriate applications of advanced glazings, to raise awareness of existing products amongst designers and to improve building simulation in relation to combined thermal and lighting appraisal [IMA 1998]. A principal outcome of the project was the release of a PC application 2 ̆ 013 hereinafter termed the IMAGE tool - for use by the glass industry to assess the impact on energy use, thermal comfort, daylight availability, glare, etc. of applying any advanced <b>glazing</b> <b>component</b> to any building type in any climate. The IMAGE tool comprises a user interface, which gives access to databases of building types, glazing components and climates.

40|$|AbstractVacuum glazing units (VGUs) {{are thought}} to be a type of glazing system with {{superior}} effective insulation performance. However, the differential pressure between the outside and the inner spaces and the supporting pillars create a high pre-existing stress field in the constituent glass during fabrication and hence make the units highly susceptible to breakage, even under small applied loads. In order to address this problem, a novel hybrid vacuum/triple glazing system with a pressure equalisation design has been devised and is reported in this paper. In this system, a VGU is enclosed by two glass panels to form a triple glazing unit system. This new design creates an equalised air pressure {{on both sides of the}} VGU hence subjects the VGU to no additional loads apart from the inherent fabrication stresses. This results in a high thermal and sound insulation as well as a more durable safety performance of the hybrid <b>glazing</b> <b>component.</b> Pressure tests were undertaken on the novel glazing system to confirm its reliability. Results show that under various loading levels, the stresses and deflections in the VGU of this novel glazing system always remain at a marginal level, and hence the likelihood of breakage for VGUs can be reduced significantly...|$|E

40|$|To aid escape in an {{emergency}} from a vehicle fitted with seemingly indestructible glazing, a laminate system has been developed that permits directional impact failure to be induced in polycarbonate glazing components. Test components exhibit near-full impact resistance when impacted from one side, but fail at much lower energy levels when impacted from the other. Thus, any <b>glazing</b> <b>component</b> made from this material system will exhibit excellent intruder resistance from the outside, whilst emergency escape becomes much easier from the inside. The system comprises a combination of polymer layers with the polycarbonate {{on the inside of}} the vehicle and a second polymer laminate on the outside. Additional features can be incorporated into the polymer laminate such as extra UV and chemical protection, i. e. areas where polycarbonate is less resilient than other materials. The mechanism of directional failure depends on the outside laminate containing a series of small flaws, generated during the manufacturing process, that close up when impacted from the outside. When impacted from the inside, the outer laminate is placed into tension and these flaws initiate cracks, which propagate rapidly backwards through the component inducing premature failure. The level of inside impact resistance can be varied by altering the processing conditions under which a component is made so that the interfacial strength between the polycarbonate and laminate is weakened...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} and use of innovative glazing systems that utilize Phase Change Material (PCM) to achieve dynamic and responsive behaviour. The coupling of a PCM and glass panes could be a way of improving the low thermal inertia of fenestrations and could be an effective way of collecting, storing and exploiting solar energy at a building scale. In the present work, a simple prototype of a PCM glazing system has been proposed and its energy performance has been analysed and compared with a conventional fenestration. The two glazing technologies were installed on an south facing outdoor test cell, in a temperate sub-continental climate. The surface temperatures, transmitted irradiances and heat fluxes of both the PCM glazing and the reference fenestration were measured during an extensive experimental campaign. Summer, Mid-season and Winter days were considered during the analysis, in both sunny and cloudy weather conditions, in order to assess the energy performance of the PCM glazing under different boundary conditions. The experimental results have highlighted a good ability of the PCM glazing to store solar energy and to smooth and delay peak values of the total heat flux. In summer the PCM prototype allows the energy gain to be lowered by more than 50 %, compared to the traditional fenestration. In winter, a suitable reduction in the heat loss during the day can be observed, but the direct solar gain is also drastically reduced and the application of this technology for passive solar heating purpose might not always be effective. The obtained results have pointed out the promising performance of PCM glazing, even though a careful integration of the PCM <b>glazing</b> <b>component</b> with the control strategies of the indoor air temperature (e. g. night cooling) is necessar...|$|E

In the summer season, when the aim of the glazing system is to reduce the solar gain and to allow daylighting the energy performance is very promising. When compared to the reference technology, both the prototypes are able to reduce to a great extend the direct transmitted solar energy, as well as to smooth the peak indoor surface temperature of the glazing. In particular, one of the two configurations lowers down the solar energy gain under all boundary conditions, while the other configuration presents a slightly worse performance than the other prototype when high solar irradiation occurs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the development of building envelope design for improved energy performance of a controlled indoor agricultural growing center in a cold climate zone (Canada, 54 ° N). A parametric study is applied to analyze the effects of envelope parameters on the building energy loads for heating, cooling and lighting, required for maintaining growing requirement as obtained in the literature. A base case building of rectangular layout, incorporating conventionally applied insulation and <b>glazing</b> <b>components,</b> is initially analyzed, employing the EnergyPlus simulation program. Insulation and glazing parameters are then modified to minimize energy loads under assumed minimal lighting requirement. This enhanced design forms a base case for analyzing effects of additional design parameters—solar radiation control, air infiltration rate, sky-lighting and the addition of phase change materials—to obtain an enhanced design that minimizes energy loads. A second stage of the investigation applies a high lighting level to the enhanced design and modifies the design parameters to improve performance.

40|$|Glass {{curtain walls}} {{are used in}} modern {{buildings}} as envelopes for wide surfaces due to a multitude of aspects. In glass curtain walls, tensile brittle panels are connected - through mechanical or adhesive joints - with steel frameworks or aluminum bracing systems, and due to the interaction of several structural components, the behaviour of the so assembled system is complex to predict, especially under exceptional loading conditions such as explosive events. In the paper, glazing curtain walls are investigated by means of Finite-Element (FE) numerical simulations, under the effect of air blast pressures of variable intensity. Their typical dynamic behaviour and criticalities under high-strain impact loads are first analyzed. By means of extended nonlinear dynamic FE parametric studies, innovative devices are applied to traditional curtain walls, at their support points, {{in order to improve}} their expected dynamic response. Two possible solutions, namely consisting of viscoelastic (VE) or elasto-plastic (PL) dampers, are proposed as passive control systems for the mitigation of maximum effects in the façade components deriving from the incoming blast pressures. As shown, although characterized by specific intrinsic mechanical behaviours, either VE or PL dampers can offer beneficial structural effects. In the first case, major advantages for the façade components derive from the additional flexibility and damping capacities of VE devices. In the latter case, PL dampers introduce additional plastic energy dissipation in the traditional curtain wall assembly, hence allowing preventing severe damage in the <b>glazing</b> <b>components.</b> It is thus expected that the current outcomes could represent a valid background for further experimental validation as well as detailed assessment and optimization of the proposed design concept...|$|R

When glazing {{elements of this}} type are applied to mass walls, their strong insulating effects will be further increased by additional passive solar gains. In {{the average of the}} heating period, transparent insulated walls convey more gains from the outside to the inside than heat is lost. Experimental investigations have been performed on south facing walls with a glazing unit composed of two 4 mm glass panes and a 12 mm layer of granulated aerogel sandwiched in between. This unit was mounted on a concrete wall of 0. 2 m thickness. The wall construction has an overall U-value of 0. 97 W/(m 2 K). The U-value of the glazing unit is 1. 1 W/(m 2 K) and the transmittance 0. 5. During the monitoring period from February through May 1986 the concrete wall experienced maximum exterior surface temperatures of 44 °C; for the entire measurement period, the effective U-value of this wall construction amounts to - 0, 5 W/(m 2 K). This period is characterised by 1712 degree days (respectively 3761 Kd for the heating period) and a mean insolation of 2. 1 kWh/(m 2 d) incident on the south facing wall which are typical values for the Central European climate. But even with negative effective U-values, transmission heat losses cannot be prevented altogether. There are periods with very high amounts of surplus heat, and there are also times that allow only for a reduction of transmission losses.

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of large window surfaces could be preferable during the heating season when solar gains through the <b>glazed</b> <b>components</b> can overcome heating losses from the same surfaces, during the cooling season more attention has to be paid in order to limit the inlet of solar radiation which causes the increment of cooling load. Generally the optimal tradeoff for energy optimization, as already underlined in a previous paper by the authors, is using low thermal transmittance and high solar factor glazing, even if higher solar transmittance considerably worsens the cooling performance. However, the choice of glazing type and the design of windows on a façade may depend on comfort consideration besides energetic evaluations. Thermal sensation of an individual is mainly related to the whole thermal balance of the human body. Comfort limits can in this case be expressed by two indexes proposed by Fanger in 1970 : the Predicted Mean Vote, PMV, and the correlated Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied, PPD. The PMV depends on four environmental parameters (air temperature, air humidity, air velocity and mean radiant temperature) and two variables connected with human being (physical activity and clothing). The air temperature, the air humidity and the air velocity inside a building are directly under the system control. In contrast, the mean radiant temperature is strongly conditioned by the envelope surface temperature, and in particular, by {{the presence}} of glazed surfaces whose insulating performance is lower than the opaque components one. In this paper the study of heating and cooling energy needs of an open-space office with different windows’ characteristics has been carried out controlling the internal comfort conditions with appropriate setpoint of the system. An office module with windows on a single façade, or on opposite façades, oriented towards 3 different orientations has been simulated, varying the glazed area (2 sizes), the glazing systems (4 types) and considering three localities of central and southern Europe. The PMV have been calculated for each hour of occupation of the whole year assuming two season as regards the setpoint conditions and clothing level.

The accurate determination, phenomenological based, of the buildings thermal response leads to determining the climatic parameters representative for the climatic zones and for the buildings structure. Unlike the EN 12831 : 2003 European Regulation, the design outdoor temperature in the conditions of Romania’s various zones was determined by the identification of the thermal response specific to the transient conditions of the heat transfer through the composite structures of the opaque and <b>glazing</b> closing <b>components</b> with the thermal response in idealized, steadystate conditions; thus, the design outdoor temperature was determined, which is conditioned by an acceptable discomfort during the coldest pentads of a 48 years climatic statistics (1961 - 2008).

Special attention is given to the heat transfer at the building-soil boundary, in the form of various practical solutions (buildings the basement of which is not directly heated, equipped or not with heating systems, directly heated and occupied, as well as buildings on plinths); in all the cases, the solutions approached are specific to the envelope which is or not thermally insulated...|$|R

For red mud, two applications were explored: geopolymers and clinker/cement. According to this study, only after 14 days the effects of addition of red mud are translated into technological properties of geopolymers. Moreover, in small proportions the mechanical strength was improved at 28 days curing, certainly due to the high alkaline nature of the waste. Belitic clinkers with balanced amounts of cementitious phases were produced at 1, 350 degrees C. Mortars cured for 10 days produced from those clinkers/cements show mechanical strength that tends to increase when high amounts of C 3 S are formed. The relative content of C 2 S is also important in the hardening process. With the addition of red mud, the technological properties of the mortars were enhanced due to the pozzolanic reactivity of this sludge. The tionite was selected to be recycled as ceramic pigment. The colorimetric parameters of tionite pigment calcined at 1, 200 degrees C and its application in transparent glaze show a light brownish colour, due to the strong brightness (L*).
