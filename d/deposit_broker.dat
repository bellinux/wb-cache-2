2500|$|One {{source of}} {{deposits}} for banks is <b>brokers</b> who <b>deposit</b> {{large sums of}} money on behalf of investors through trust corporations. This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms, often better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being <b>brokered</b> <b>deposits.</b> Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or [...] "hot money" [...] as it is sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the <b>brokered</b> <b>deposits.</b> This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the global financial crisis had, on average, four times more <b>brokered</b> <b>deposits</b> as a percent of their deposits than the average bank.

50|$|In March 2008, OTS Director John M. Reich {{stated that}} the Savings and Loan {{industry}} remained vibrant due {{to the effectiveness of}} regulators. Reich blamed Indymac's 11 July 2008 failure on $1.3bn of withdrawals in the fortnight following concerns raised from Senator Chuck Schumer over the bank's solvency. Schumer faulted the OTS.

IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, IndyMac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below [...] "well capitalized" [...] (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to [...] "adequately capitalized" [...] (8-10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might {{no longer be able to}} use <b>brokered</b> <b>deposits</b> as a source of funds.|$|R
40|$|According to {{the modern}} theory of {{financial}} intermediation, liquidity creation is an essential role of banks. Chapter 1 investigates the relationship between diversification of activities conducted by banks and bank liquidity creation. We show that despite the passage of GLBA act in 1999, banks increased their specialization in the traditional loan market and thus became less diversified from 2004 {{until the end of}} 2008. In addition, we find evidence that more specialized banks tend to create more excess liquidity during normal times, suggesting too much specialization in mortgage and other types of loans created abundant liquidity leading up to the financial crisis. Chapter 2 calculates the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as defined in Basel III for virtually all US commercial banks during the 2001 - 2013 period. Compared to traditional liquidity risk measures and the NSFR estimated in the related literature, the NSFR based on our calculation is more comprehensive in evaluating funding liquidity risk on banks 2 ̆ 7 balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities and also is superior in capturing the changes in liquidity risk over time. In addition, we graphically show that the deseasonalized and detrended NSFR based on our estimation is able to detect the excessive liquidity risk taking behavior of the banking sector in advance of financial stress. Furthermore, we examine the policy related issue of the effect of stricter capital requirements on bank funding liquidity risk. We find that large and medium banks with higher capital positions tend to increase exposure to liquidity risk during both normal times and the financial crisis. On the other hand, small banks with higher capital ratios tend to have lower liquidity risk exposure. Chapter 3 applies a small variation to the NSFR measure to account for the liquidity risk of <b>brokered</b> <b>deposits</b> and examines the advantage of using the <b>brokered</b> <b>deposits</b> adjusted NSFR (adj. NSFR) in detecting bank financial distress during the period of 2007 - 2013. The in-sample test results show that the adj. NSFR measure does add significantly incremental explanatory power to the models relying on traditional liquidity ratios. However, its superior ability to identify failures is not so pronounced in the out-of-sample periods...|$|R

50|$|IndyMac backdated an $18 million {{contribution}} from {{its parent company}} {{in order to preserve}} the bank's appearance as a “well-capitalized” institution. Mr. Dochow allowed IndyMac Bank to receive $18 million from its parent company and book the money as if it had arrived {{by the end of the}} March 31 quarter when, in fact, it had arrived on May 9, only three days before IndyMac filed the 10-Q for that March 31 quarter. Had Mr. Dochow not allowed this irregular, retroactive contribution to capital, Indymac would have been forced to report that its capital had already slipped below the minimum level that regulators require for classifying banks as well capitalized, thus putting $6.8 billion in <b>brokered</b> <b>deposits</b> - or 37 percent of Indymac's total deposits - at risk, as noted in the previous section. It also would have prevented IndyMac from luring new customers by offering deposit rates which exceeded the limitations prescribed in FDIC regulations.

Indymac concluded that these downgrades would have negatively impacted the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, Indymac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based.

Indymac further warned that if its level of deposit liquidity was reduced in this way, the bank anticipated that it would reduce its assets and, most likely, curtail its lending activities. This statement was comparable to those adopted by other Southern California banks that were experiencing liquidity problems, such as Pomona First Federal (PFF) and Vineyard Bank.|$|R
