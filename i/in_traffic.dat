5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT {{conservatively}} {{identified a}} 0.7% reduction <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS {{review of the}} DOT study found no differences <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E

5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Hrvatske autoceste, operator of the motorway, and results are published by Hrvatske ceste. The largest annual {{average daily traffic}} (AADT) volume is often recorded in the Sveta HelenaKomin section, although all sections between Sveta Helena and Varaždin display similar AADT. AADT data for sections north of Varaždin show considerable drops <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> volume. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Ivanja RekaSveta Helena, {{is not included in}} the report. However, since the section {{is a part of the}} Zagreb bypass, it carries significantly heavier traffic than any other sections of the A4 motorwayin 2004, traffic volume along the toll-free section of the A4 motorway was approximately 24,000vehicles per day (AADT) between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Sveta Helena interchanges and nearly 41,000vehicles per day between the Kraljevečki Novaki and Ivanja Reka interchanges. Traffic volume measured on the Ivanja RekaIvanić Grad section of the A3 motorway increased by 30%, hinting at a similar increase <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> volume on the A4 route south of Sveta Helena.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{reduction}} <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> caused by Cromer's decline in popularity as a holiday destination after World War II, and {{the closure of}} many Norfolk railway lines in the 1950s, {{a decision was made}} to concentrate all passenger traffic into a single station.

Therefore, all passenger services were diverted into Cromer Beach (renamed Cromer) and the other stations closed.

40|$|It is {{frequently}} assumed that organised criminal groups are heavily implicated <b>in</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> persons. However, this assumption remains relatively untested.
