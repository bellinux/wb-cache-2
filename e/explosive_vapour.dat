Some of the public source information suggests that there are some possibilities for terahertz radar, which lies between mm wave radar and long infra-red in the electromagnetic spectrum. Namely, there is at least some penetration with terahertz radar as it is used for thickness and density measurement and biomedical scanning, and is suggested for detecting weapons under clothing.

40|$|The {{detection}} of explosives {{continues to be a}} pressing global challenge with many potential technologies being pursued by the scientific research community. Luminescence-based {{detection of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>vapours</b> with an organic semiconductor has attracted much interest because of its potential for detectors that have high sensitivity, compact form factor, simple operation and low-cost. Despite the abundance of literature on novel sensor materials systems there are relatively few mechanistic studies targeted towards vapour-based sensing. In this Perspective, we will review the progress that has been made in understanding the processes that control the real-time luminescence quenching of thin films by analyte vapours. These are the non-radiative quenching process by which the sensor exciton decays, the analyte-sensor intermolecular binding interaction, and the diffusion process for the analyte vapours in the film. We comment on the contributions of each of these processes towards the sensing response and, in particular, the relative roles of analyte diffusion and exciton diffusion. While the latter has been historically judged to be one of, if not the primary, causes for the high sensitivity of many conjugated polymers to nitrated vapours, recent evidence suggests that long exciton diffusion lengths are unnecessary.

40|$|The Ph. D. project aims at {{developing}} novel fluorescent nanomaterials for fast, sensitive, selective, {{reliable and}} cost-effective detection of nitro-explosives. Early research {{focused on the}} pyrene-doped polymer systems. Firstly, pyrene-polystyrene fluorescent nanoporous films have been prepared through a simple dip-coating process, and used for <b>explosives</b> <b>vapour</b> detection with ultra-sensitivity and selectivity. Morphology investigations revealed that films consisted of a large-surface, three-dimensional nanopores and the possible molecular origin of fluorescence quenching was investigated through structural XRD studies and electronic structures. Later, super-hydrophobic fluorescent sand was prepared and applied for buried explosives detection. In order to detect nitro-explosives in aqueous phase, pyrene-polyethersulfone electrospun nanofibers were synthesized through electrospinning using mixed solvents. The current sensor demonstrated excellent sensitivity, selectivity and reusability to nitro-explosives detection and static quenching mechanism. An ultrafast and facile method for the preparation of fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) has also been developed from a single precursor under microwave conditions. The obtained CNPs showed strong blue fluorescence, which could be quenched by picric acid sensitively and selectively. Furthermore, fluorescent carbon dots co-doped with nitrogen and phosphorus were prepared with high quantum yield and dual fluorescence emission, and applied as ratiometric sensors for explosives detection. Finally, a fully biodegradable and environmental-friendly protein showed sensitive, selective and rapid detection of picric acid, and its excellent sensing performance was attributed to the synergistic effect of electron transfer, energy transfer as well as acid-base interactions.

A hybrid device taking the advantage of high power inorganic light emitting diodes (LEDs) and low threshold organic distributed feedback lasers is demonstrated to realize a LED pumped organic laser. When the drive current is higher than 152 A, a sharp peak is clearly observed in the laser output spectrum, implying the LED successfully pumps the polymer laser above threshold. This is the first time an incoherent LED has been used as the excitation source for an organic semiconductor laser. A strategy for further improving the performance of the hybrid device is explored {{with the use of a}} luminescent concentrator made of a dye doped SU 8 film, to intensify the power density from the inorganic LED. The luminescent concentrator is capable of increasing the incident power density by a factor of 9 and reducing the lasing threshold density by 4. 5 times. As a preliminary investigation towards mode-locked polymer lasers, the impact of a solid state saturable absorber on a solution based organic semiconductor laser is explored. The dye doped polystyrene thin film saturable absorber exhibits a saturation intensity of a few MW/cm². When it is placed into the laser cavity, a train of short pulses is generated and the underlying mechanism is discussed.

40|$|In {{the current}} world {{political}} climate, rapid and reliable detection of explosive compounds {{has become increasingly}} important. While {{there are many different}} types of explosive, nitroaromatic explosives are amongst the most common. 2, 4, 6 -Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is arguably one of the most well known explosives in the world. It {{is one of the most}} important explosives for blasting charges of all weapons and is still used as a major component of anti-personnel landmines. Many different technologies exist for the detection of explosives including: trained animals, such as sniffer dogs; X-ray and neutron imaging; chromatographic separation and detection of mixtures of compounds; mass-based detection, such as ion mobility spectrometry (IMS); and various spectrometric and colorimetric techniques. However, while many of these technologies are highly sensitive in a laboratory setting they often lack the portability and robustness required to develop a hand-held device for the real-time detection of <b>explosive</b> <b>vapours.</b> Oxidative fluorescence quenching, in which the fluorescence of a sensing material is quenched by a high electron affinity explosive analyte, offers a potential route to such portable devices. Over recent years fluorescent sensors for explosives have become a popular area of research. However, there are still significant improvements to be made in order to allow the technology to be implemented in suitably portable and reliable real-world devices. This thesis investigates fluorescent conjugated dendrimers as new materials for the detection of trace quantities of explosives, and aims to provide an understanding of some of the interactions and structure-property relationships that are involved in fluorescent sensors for explosives. The convergent synthesis of two first-generation, fluorescent conjugated dendrimers is described. The dendrimers comprise bifluorene-based chromophores, biphenyl-based dendrons and 2 -ethylhexyloxy surface groups. The first dendrimer (D 1) is relatively planar with only one chromophore at its core, while the second (D 2) has four of the bifluorene-based chromophores held in a three-dimensional arrangement around an adamantane centre. The dendrimers, along with the second-generation variant of D 1 (D 3) were tested as sensors for explosives in solution. Nitroaromatic, nitroaliphatic and non-nitrated aromatic control analytes were studied. Steady-state Stern-Volmer experiments showed that D 2 had higher quenching constants with all of the analytes tested than the more planar dendrimers. However, time-resolved Stern-Volmer measurements showed that the mechanism of quenching (static or collisional) was invariant with the different dendrimers and instead depended on the structure of the analyte. The more aromatic rings present in the analyte, the higher the static component of the quenching. Finally, fluorescence depolarisation anisotropy measurements showed that the greater quenching ability of D 2 was likely caused by an amplification effect of having multiple emissive chromophores per dendrimer. Interaction of one analyte with one chromophore could quench an exciton formed on any of the four chromophores. The dendrimers were all solution-processed into thin films, which were suitable for detection of <b>explosive</b> <b>vapours.</b> D 1 and D 2 were exposed to atmospheres saturated with analyte vapours and the fluorescence intensity monitored. In general D 2 was quenched more rapidly than D 1 with the desired analytes and had reduced signals from the control analytes. A pronounced difference was seen in the rates of fluorescence recovery after the analyte was removed with the fluorescence of D 1 recovering intensity significantly faster than D 2. The quenching rates for D 1 and D 2 were comparable to or better than those reported in the literature for the same analytes. Films of D 1, D 2 and D 3 were then tested with the transient exposure quenching method, in which 1 second exposures of analytes, at sub-saturated concentrations in a carrier gas, were used to quench the fluorescence of the films. Under these conditions it was found that all three dendrimers underwent similar levels of quenching and D 2 still showed the slowest recovery of fluorescence intensity. Importantly, a Stern-Volmer-like analysis of the results showed all three dendrimers were more sensitive to nitroaromatic analytes than the non-nitrated controls. For the three dendrimers, the detection limit for a 1 second exposure to 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene was less than 1 part per billion. Finally, neutron reflectometry (NR) was used to probe the distribution and concentration of the analytes within films of D 1 and D 2. It was found that, upon exposure to the analytes, films of both dendrimers swelled to incorporate the nitroaromatic analyte molecules, which were able to penetrate throughout the dendrimer films. Also, films of D 2 sequestered approximately twice as much of these analytes as films of D 1. The concentration of analyte molecules in the films was calculated and it was shown that one analyte was able to quench more than one chromophore. Comparison of the solid-state quenching and the NR results are consistent with the more open film morphology of D 2 leading to reduced inter-dendrimer interactions. Consequently, ingress of the analytes disrupts the dendrimer-dendrimer pi-stacking in the films of D 2 less than those of D 1, hence the slower fluorescence recovery and rate of analyte removal for D 2 compared to D 1...|$|R

When a small {{drop of water}} is dropped onto a very hot frying pan, it skitters around and takes up to a minute to evaporate. On initial contact, the hot surface vaporises part of the drop and creates an insulating vapour layer between the drop and the hot surface, much like the air gap in a double-glazed window. This vapour layer can only be sustained if the hot surface is above the so-called Leidenfrost temperature. It also acts as an efficient lubricant and can reduce the drag on a hot sphere travelling through water by up to 85 %.

If in place of small drops of water in a hot frying pan, we have a hot kettle filled with water, the Leidenfrost vapour layer will collapse when the kettle cools below the Leidenfrost temperature, resulting in an explosion of vapour bubbles as the water makes direct contact with the (still) hot surface.
