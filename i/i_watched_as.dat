5000|$|Wilhelm {{resisted}} {{attempts by}} his parents (especially his mother) to educate him in British attitudes towards democracy. Instead, he agreed with his German tutors' support of autocratic rule, and gradually became thoroughly Prussianized under their influence. He thus became alienated from his parents, suspecting them of putting Britain's interests first. The German Emperor, Wilhelm <b>I,</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> his grandson, guided principally by the Crown Princess Victoria, grew to manhood. When Wilhelm was nearing twenty-one the Emperor {{decided it was time}} his grandson should begin the military phase of his preparation for the throne. He was assigned as a lieutenant to the First Regiment of Foot Guards, stationed at Potsdam. [...] "In the Guards," [...] Wilhelm said, [...] "I really found my family, my friends, my interests — everything of which I had up to that time had to do without." [...] As a boy and a student, his manner had been polite and agreeable; as an officer, he began to strut and speak brusquely in the tone he deemed appropriate for a Prussian officer.|$|E

Today, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> a community member from Borneo stood {{up in front of}} oil palm producers, NGOs, and technocrats, identified himself as a victim of oil palm expansion, and tore apart the falsity that some of the world's richest businessmen desperately want us to believe; the falsity that oil palm helps the world's poor:"They say oil palm is development. They say Malaysia has cars and big cities because of oil palm. But it is not oil palm, it is from other things, like our oil and our logging.

50|$|In 1975 José de Jesús's father {{joined with}} wrestling {{promoter}} Francisco Flores and investor Benjamín Mora, Jr. {{to form a}} new wrestling promotion called Universal Wrestling Association in direct competition with EMLL. One of the reasons behind the split was that Mendoza felt EMLL were not giving his sons enough opportunities in the ring. All three of the Villanos followed their father to the newly formed UWA. While Villano III became a singles competitor and pushed {{as one of the top}} stars of the promotion, Villano I and Villano II continued to work as a tag team or as an occasional trio with their younger brother. Villano II began appearing less and less in the wrestling ring as the 1970s wore on, usually explained by the promoters that he was injured. By 1983 José de Jesús' younger brothers had taken the names Villano IV and Villano V and became the regular partners of Villano I. On August 10, 1986, Villano I won his first ever singles championship as he defeated Fishman to win the UWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, a title both his father and his younger brother Villano III had previously held. He reigned as champion for 160 days before being defeated by Zandokan. Villano I along with Villano IV and V won the UWA World Trios Championship in 1988, although it is not confirmed who they defeated for the title. Los Villanos also became embroiled in a storyline feud with another wrestling family known as Los Brazos ("The Arms"), in this case the three oldest brothers Brazo de Oro, Brazo de Plata, and El Brazo. The feud saw the trios clash several times, usually with at least one or more of the participants bleeding when the match was over. The feud between the two families led to a Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match, between the two sets of siblings. On October 21, 1988, in Monterrey, Nuevo León Los Villanos defeated Los Brazos and forced them to unmask after the match. This was the biggest Apuesta win of Villano I's career and one of the biggest Apuetas matches in Lucha Libre. Los Villanos regained the UWA Trios Championship in 1990 but lost the title to Los Brazos a few months later. The protracted feud between Los Villanos and Los Brazos saw Villano I defeat El Brazo in an Apuesta match where El Brazo's hair was on the line. Following the match Villano <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> El Brazo was shaved bald. Later on Los Villanos regained the Trios title from Los Brazos. In early 1991 Los Villanos became involved in a feud with The Hawaiian Beasts (Fatu, Great Kokina, and The Samoan Savage). The Trios traded the title on April 7, 1991, and then back again on May 31, 1991. Los Villanos' fourth and final reign as UWA World Trios Champions lasted 275 days and ended when they were defeated by Black Power II, Negro Navarro and El Signo. On July 19, 1991, Los Villanos defeated Los Mercenarios Americanos (Tim Patterson, Bill Anderson, and Louie Spicolli) in an Apuesta match to unmask them. This ended up being Villano I's last major in-ring success as he began focusing more on training wrestlers at UWA's school than wrestling. When the UWA closed in January 1995 Villano quietly retired from wrestling.|$|E

"Who wouldn't want to live there with all those green hills, the blossoming apple trees, and quaint weatherboard farmhouse," I thought, knowing full well that as a foster kid I had longed for Anne's life. Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert had decided to take on an orphanage boy whose job it would be to assist the ageing Matthew on the farm. Since Anne had been mistakenly sent to the farm instead, her future hangs in the balance for a time until, appalled by stories of brutality and over work that little Anne had experienced in orphanages and foster care, Marilla finally agrees with Matthew and the pair adopt the child.
