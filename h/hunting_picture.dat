40|$|Of {{the many}} game birds {{introduced}} to the North American continent only two, the European or Hungarian partridge, Perdix perdix, and the ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, have been successful thus far. Recent introductions of the chukar partridge, Alectoris graeca, also show promise of being successful. The {{pros and cons of}} animal introductions have been discussed in a number of papers. It is definitely true that rabbits in Australia, starlings in America and the mongoose in Hawaii have become pests. But the garre birds introduced in North America cannot fairly be classed as pests; they have been welcomed {{in a number of states}} and provinces; actually partridges and pheasants have completely altered the <b>hunting</b> <b>picture</b> in many areas, and it is difficult to realize the amount of hunting left if these birds were removed. King (1942), although generally opposed to the introduction of the partridge and the pheasant in America, mentions that probably 90 percent of the upland bird shooting in Oregon is produced by the partridge and pheasant; and the importance of the pheasant as a game bird in the cornbelt needs no elaboration...|$|E

5000|$|Hunt's {{painting}} was less controversial than Millais's companion piece, but Hunt was still heavily criticised for the odd composition and the contorted poses of the figures.

Had slipped down {{to the foot of}} the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.|$|R
60|$|There {{is indeed}} an {{important}} school of sculpture in Spain, {{directed to the}} same objects, but not demanding at present any special attention.

5000|$|Bloxam was {{appointed}} by his college to the vicarage of Upper Beeding, near Steyning in Sussex, in February 1862, and vacated his fellowship in 1863. Newman paid several visits to him there, and he was probably {{the last of the}} cardinal's Oxford circle. Frederic Rogers, 1st Baron Blachford, called Bloxam [...] "the grandfather of the ritualists". He died at Beeding Priory, Upper Beeding, on 21 January 1891, having enjoyed good health almost until the last, and was buried in Beeding churchyard. He is a prominent figure in William Holman <b>Hunt's</b> <b>picture</b> of the ceremony on Magdalen College tower on May day morning.|$|R

A sequel, Peter-No-Tail in Americat, followed in 1985, {{with much of}} the same cast but Erik Lindgren voicing Peter. In 1997, Sveriges Television produced the Nordic Christmas calendar Peter-No-Tail with Björn Kjellman portraying Peter. This was followed in 2000 by the animated feature Peter-No-Tail and the Great Treasure <b>Hunt.</b> <b>Picture</b> books as well as two editions as a comics series have also been published; one comic ran between 1965 and 1972.|$|R

50|$|Medieval <b>hunting</b> <b>pictures</b> {{generally}} {{show the}} limer as a hound of similar type to the running hounds, but {{larger and more}} heavily built. In England the Bloodhound was so typically associated with the function of being a limer that George Turberville uses the term “Bloodhound” (in preference to “limer”, which was becoming archaic) for the French word “limier” throughout his 1575 translation of La Venerie de Jaques du Fouilloux. For instance, du Fouilloux says limiers of the St Hubert kind are good, so that when Turberville translates ‘limiers’ as ‘bloodhounds’ he is not saying that St Huberts and bloodhounds are the same breed, only that they work well as leash hounds.|$|R

[...] "The Path of Roses" [...] was written soon after the Crimean War, when the name of Florence Nightingale had already become a household-word. [...] "Only a Woman's Hair" [...] was suggested by a circumstance mentioned in The Life of Dean Swift, viz., that, after his death, a small packet was found among his papers, containing a single lock of hair and inscribed with those words. [...] "After Three Days" [...] was written after seeing Holman <b>Hunt's</b> <b>picture,</b> The Finding of Christ in the Temple.|$|R

The treasury was empty when Jan Wellem, as he was called in Düsseldorf, died. Most of this collection is now at the Munich Gallery, but the paintings of Van der Werff moved to the cellar.His pupils were his daughter Maria Weenix and Dirk Valkenburg.Jan Weenix lived towards {{the end of his life}} in a house on the Amstel river, and was buried in Nieuwezijds Kapel a nearby church on the Rokin.|$|R

6000|$|He was, in fact, {{a man of}} weak fibre, {{who allowed}} himself to sponge upon his friends, such as Talfourd, Haydon, and Shelley.

6000|$|... "As far {{as regards}} the {{technical}} qualities of Mr. Hunt's painting, I [...] would only ask the spectator to observe this difference between true [...] Pre-Raphaelite work and its imitations. The true work represents all [...] objects exactly as they would appear in nature, in the position and [...] at the distances which {{the arrangement of the}} picture supposes. The [...] false work represents them with all their details, as if seen [...] through a microscope. Examine closely the ivy on the door in Mr. [...] <b>Hunt's</b> <b>picture,</b> and there will not be found in it a single clear [...] outline. All is the most exquisite mystery of color; becoming [...] reality at its due distance. In like manner, examine the small gems [...] on the robe of the figure. Not one will be made out in form, and yet [...] there is not one of all those minute points of green color, but it [...] has two or three distinctly varied shades of green in it, giving its [...] mysterious value and lustre. The spurious imitations of [...] Pre-Raphaelite work represent the most minute leaves and other [...] objects with sharp outlines, but with no variety of color, and with [...] none of the concealment, none of the infinity of nature." ...|$|R
