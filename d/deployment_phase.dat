25|$|As {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} one, the {{delivery}} phase is in between the release phase and the <b>deployment</b> <b>phase.</b> A software vendor develops and releases a software product and afterwards it has to be transported to the customer. This phase is the delivery process. This process is highly complex because the vendor often has to deal with a product which has multiple versions, variable features, dependency on external products, and different kinds of distribution options. The CCU method helps the software vendor in structuring this process.|$|E

Talking through signal nodes, MSE established a seamless connection from the battlefield even back to commercial telephone lines. Significant to the Signal soldiers, MSE was fielded on the backs of Humvee, rather than on the larger, less-mobile M35 2-1/2 ton cargo trucks—the [...] "deuce and a half".|$|E
40|$|From {{the widely}} use of {{component}} middleware, developers can reuse existing components not only developed by in-house development but also provided by other organizations. Some components developed {{in an organization}} can be deployed in other organizations via the Internet. Developers need to handle the dependency information between such components in both of development and <b>deployment</b> <b>phases.</b> We propose a system called J 2 DEP to generate and manage such information in the development phase, and to automate the deployment of components. J 2 DEP copes with configuration management systems to manage components and the information. It manages the dependency information between in-house components and third vendor components, and provides a consistent set of components in the release and <b>deployment</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the major}} {{concerns}} in wireless sensor networks is improving the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new energy provisioning model and investigate {{the relationship between the}} network lifetime and the network density by using both simulations and analytic models. We show that the average amount of energy required to report an event to the sink decreases when sensor network density increases. Moreover, we demonstrate that the speed of increasing the network lifetime goes up faster than that of the network density. Based on this result, we prove that nodes must be deployed {{at the same time and}} not over different <b>deployment</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R

50|$|Each full turn {{starts with}} the <b>deployment</b> <b>phase.</b> In this phase, players deploy one card from their decks face up {{to each and every}} {{unclaimed}} sector. Players then draw a hand of six cards and alternate deploying cards face down from their hand to any unclaimed sector, one a time. There is no limit to how many cards may be deployed to each sector, but a relative imbalance may lead to an advantage in one sector with a corresponding disadvantage in another sector. Following deployment, the attacking player chooses a sector to contest, and a battle for that sector commences. Once the battle ends, the result may be that one of the two players has claimed the sector, or that neither player has, but once a sector is captured, it is out of play. After the battle selected by the attacker, the defending player chooses a different sector to contest (if any other sector remains unclaimed). Following the conclusion of the two battles, the turn ends and a new turn begins with the <b>deployment</b> <b>phase</b> being repeated.|$|E
