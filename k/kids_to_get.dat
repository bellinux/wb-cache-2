25|$|Newborn {{screening}}: Newborn screening is used {{just after}} birth to identify genetic disorders {{that can be}} treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth {{and sent to the}} lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn screening procedure varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in kids and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> put on a special diet right away to avoid the effects of the disorder.|$|E
