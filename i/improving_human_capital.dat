Nations do not necessarily need wealth to gain health. For example, Sri Lanka had a maternal mortality rate of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today. It reduced it to 0.5-0.6% in the 1950s and to 0.6% today. However, it was spending less each year on maternal health because it learned what worked and what did not.

The paper is a critical review of the concepts of adolescent sexual and reproductive health and its implication for <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> development. It reviews the conceptual framework of Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on factors that promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health; and constructs a framework that presents mechanisms through which socioeconomic development is achieved through <b>improved</b> <b>human</b> <b>capital</b> development.

30|$|Some studies {{concluded}} that the crowding-out effect of resource endowment on human capital is not inevitable, as some countries that have successfully avoided the resource curse {{have higher levels of}} human capital. Bravo-Ortega and Gregorio (2005) claimed that high levels of human capital can reduce the negative effect of natural resource dependence on the rate of economic growth. The empirical research performed by Stijns (2006) indicated that resource abundance is positively correlated with human capital. Moreover, the previously reported negative correlation between resource wealth and human capital is not robust. Stijns believed that the rational allocation of resource income is a prerequisite for the promotion of human capital accumulation in countries with abundant resources. Dahlman et al.

30|$|The dual {{economic}} structure in China’s {{urban and rural}} areas has continuously been strengthened, and this has raised many challenges for China’s urbanization and rural development. Since 2003, a large number of processing and manufacturing enterprises have faced the difficult situation of a shortage of experienced and skilled workers, while the development of agricultural areas has also faced the reality of the “hollowing” of rural areas—specifically, a lack of young and middle-aged labor with higher education.

This paper derives, theoretically and empirically, that land has substitution and income effects on education and tests the hypothesis that only if the scale of managed land is large enough can the allocation of land and education be optimized and household income will increase.|$|E

Total factor productivity improvement is the only route to sustain economic growth in the long run. After a brief review of economic growth and productivity dynamics of the Philippine economy in the past fifty years, the paper provides an estimation of the determinants of total factor productivity and labor productivity.

The effective management of human poses new challenges in the organization for leadership and managerial capabilities. The current study aims to analyze the factors that are closely associated with employee satisfaction in both Vietnamese state-owned enterprise and foreign-owned enterprise in order to understand the difference of management practices. The response was taken from a sample of 250 respondents in either two types of business and the data are carried out by using multiple statistical analyses, including exploratory factor analysis, reliability test, mean point value, and multiple linear regressions. The results indicate that for the state-owned enterprise, recruitment process is the most important factor that helps to improve the satisfaction of employee.

Data from the national Demographic and Health Survey are used to improve measurement of poverty in Kenya in four ways: First, the paper constructs a composite wealth index (CWI). Second, it applies the Alkire and Foster (2007) approach to the measurement of multidimensional poverty based on the CWI and health status. Third, stochastic dominance approaches are used to make poverty orderings across groups. Fourth, the probability of being poor in assets, health or both is explored using a bivariate probit model. The {{results show that the}} distribution of poor women and children differs across groups, space and time. We also find that the CWI and residence in a rural area respectively contribute more to multidimensional poverty than health and residence in an urban area.
