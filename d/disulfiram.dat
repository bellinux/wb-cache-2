5|$|Calcium carbimide {{works in}} the same way as disulfiram; it has an {{advantage}} in that the occasional adverse effects of <b>disulfiram,</b> hepatotoxicity and drowsiness, do not occur with calcium carbimide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disulfiram</b> (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, <b>disulfiram,</b> or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E

25|$|Acamprosate, <b>disulfiram</b> and {{topiramate}} (a novel anticonvulsant sulphonated sugar) {{are also}} used to treat alcohol addiction. Acamprosate has shown effectiveness for patients with severe dependence, helping them to maintain abstinence for several weeks or months. <b>Disulfiram</b> (also called Antabuse) produces a very unpleasant reaction when drinking alcohol that includes flushing, nausea and palpitations. It is more effective for patients with high motivation and some addicts use it only for high risk situations.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{medications}} {{used to help}} prevent a return to drinking: <b>disulfiram,</b> naltrexone, and acamprosate. They are used after withdrawal has occurred.|$|E
25|$|The drug <b>disulfiram</b> (Antabuse) {{prevents}} the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid. Antabuse is sometimes {{used as a}} deterrent for alcoholics wishing to stay sober.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{have been approved}} {{for the treatment of}} substance abuse. These include replacement therapies such as buprenorphine and methadone as well as antagonist medications like <b>disulfiram</b> and naltrexone in either short acting, or the newer long acting form. Several other medications, often ones originally used in other contexts, have also been shown to be effective including bupropion and modafinil. Methadone and buprenorphine are sometimes used to treat opiate addiction. These drugs are used as substitutes for other opioids and still cause withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde (systematic name ethanal) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl). It {{is one of}} the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke. Consumption of <b>disulfiram</b> inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body.|$|E
500|$|In the United States {{there are}} four {{approved}} medications for alcoholism: <b>disulfiram,</b> two forms of naltrexone, and acamprosate. [...] Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "tippler's bane" [...] {{is derived}} from its ability to create acute {{sensitivity}} to alcohol, similar to <b>disulfiram</b> (Antabuse). Other common names include common ink cap and inky cap. The black liquid that this mushroom releases after being picked was once used as ink.|$|E
500|$|The {{evaluation}} of a bee model for ethanol inebration of vertebrates has just begun, but appears to be promising. The bees are fed ethanol solutions and their behavior observed. Researchers place the bees in tiny harnesses, and feed them varying concentrations of alcohol introduced into sugar solutions. Tests of locomotion, foraging, social interaction and aggressiveness are performed. Mustard has noted that [...] "Alcohol affects bees and humans in similar ways—it impairs motor functioning along with learning and memory processing." [...] The interaction of bees with antabuse (<b>disulfiram,</b> a common medication administered {{as a treatment for}} alcoholism) has been tested as well.|$|E
500|$|Consuming Coprinopsis atramentaria {{within a}} few hours of alcohol results in a [...] "disulfiram syndrome". This {{interaction}} has only been known since {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5mg/dL, and prominent at concentrations of 50–100mg/dL. [...] <b>Disulfiram</b> has, however, been known to cause myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes. Rarely, a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia, may develop.|$|E

Sertraline concentrate contains alcohol, {{and is therefore}} contraindicated with <b>disulfiram</b> (Antabuse). The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment [...] "must be approached with caution." [...] Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may {{be as high as}} three times the average exposure for the same dose.|$|E
2500|$|Psychopharmacological {{intervention}} in disorders of impulsivity has shown evidence of positive effects; common pharmacological interventions {{include the use}} of stimulant medication, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. ADHD has a well-established evidence base supporting the use of stimulant medication for the reduction of ADHD symptoms. Pathological gambling has also been studied in drug trials, and there is evidence that gambling is responsive to SSRIs and other antidepressants. [...] Evidence based pharmacological treatment for trichotillomania is not yet available, with mixed results of studies investigating the use of SSRIs, though Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown positive effects. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is most often treated with mood stabilizers, SSRIs, beta blockers, alpha agonists, and anti-psychotics (all of which have shown positive effects). There is evidence that some pharmacological interventions are efficacious in treating substance use disorders, though their use can depend on the type substance that is abused. [...] Pharmacological treatments for SUD {{include the use of}} acamprosate, buprenorphine, <b>disulfiram,</b> LAAM, methadone, and naltrexone.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{studies using}} animal models {{have begun to}} {{elucidate}} the effects of ethanol on the nervous system. Traditionally, many studies have been performed in mammals, such as mice, rats, and non-human primates. However, non-mammalian animal models have also been employed; in particular, the Ulrike Heberlein group at UC San Francisco has used Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, taking advantage of its facile genetics to dissect the neural circuits and molecular pathways, upon which ethanol acts. The series of studies carried in the Heberlein lab has identified insulin and its related signaling pathways as well as biogenic amines in the invertebrate nervous system as being important in alcohol tolerance. The value of antabuse (<b>disulfiram)</b> {{as a treatment for}} alcoholism has been tested using another invertebrate animal model, the honey bees. [...] It {{is important to note that}} some of the analogous biochemical pathways and neural systems have been known to be important in alcohol's effects on humans, while the possibility that others may also be important remains unknown. Research of alcohol's effects on the nervous system remains a hot topic of research, as scientists inch toward understanding the problem of alcohol addiction.|$|E

50|$|The drug <b>disulfiram</b> (Antabuse) {{prevents}} the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid {{and is used}} in the treatment of alcoholism. ALDH1 is strongly inhibited by <b>disulfiram,</b> while ALDH2 is resistant to its effect. The cysteine residue at 302 in ALDH1 and 200 in ALDH2 is implicated as a <b>disulfiram</b> binding site on the enzyme and serves as a disfulfiram sensitive thiol site. Covalent binding of <b>disulfiram</b> to the thiol blocks the binding of one of the cysteine residues with iodoacetamide, thereby inactivating the enzyme and significantly lowering catalytic activity. Activity can be recovered by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, although not with glutathione.|$|E
