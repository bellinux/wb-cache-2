5|$|Major urinary {{proteins}} (Mups), {{also known}} as α2u-globulins, are a subfamily of proteins found in abundance in the urine and other secretions of many animals. Mups provide a small range of <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> about the donor animal, when detected by the vomeronasal organ of the receiving animal. They belong to a larger family of proteins known as lipocalins. Mups are encoded by a cluster of genes, located {{adjacent to each other}} on a single stretch of DNA, that varies greatly in number between species: from at least 21 functional genes in mice to none in humans. Mup proteins form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a ligand-binding pocket that accommodates specific small, organic chemicals.|$|E

25|$|Revenge porn began garnering {{international}} media attention when Hunter Moore launched the website IsAnyoneUp in 2010. The site featured user-submitted pornography, {{and was one}} of the first sites to adopt the model initiated by Beaver Hunt: IsAnyoneUp often included <b>identifying</b> <b>information,</b> such as the subjects' names, employers, addresses and links to social networking profiles. Activist Charlotte Laws was the first person to speak out against Moore and one of the first people to publicly support revenge porn victims. This prompted backlash from some of Moore's devotees, who stalked Laws and sent her death threats.|$|E
25|$|The CODIS {{software}} contains multiple different databases {{depending on}} the type of information being searched against. Examples of these databases include, missing persons, convicted offenders, and forensic samples collected from crime scenes. Each state, and the federal system, has different laws for collection, upload, and analysis of information contained within their database. However, for privacy reasons, the CODIS database does not contain any personal <b>identifying</b> <b>information,</b> such as the name associated with the DNA profile.

25|$|The Common Reporting Standard {{requires}} each signatory {{country to}} gather the full <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> of each bank customer, including additional nationalities and place of birth. Prior {{to the implementation of}} CRS, there had been no other method of fully and globally identifying immigrants and emigrants and citizens by way of their identification numbers, birthplaces, and nationalities. Each participating government is tasked with collecting and storing the data of all its citizens and immigrants and of transferring the data automatically to participating countries. CRS is capable of transmitting person data according to the demands of either Residence Based Taxation or Citizenship Based Taxation (CBT) or Personhood-Based Taxation.|$|E
25|$|Web {{crawlers}} typically {{identify themselves}} to a Web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request. Web site administrators typically examine their Web servers' log and use the user agent field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server and how often. The user agent field may include a URL where the Web site administrator may find out {{more information about the}} crawler. Examining Web server log is tedious task, and therefore some administrators use tools to identify, track and verify Web crawlers. Spambots and other malicious Web crawlers are unlikely to place <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> in the user agent field, or they may mask their identity as a browser or other well-known crawler.|$|E
25|$|The USA Department of Justice {{coordinates}} {{programs to}} track and prosecute child pornography offenders across all jurisdictions, from local police departments to federal investigations, and international cooperation with other governments.

25|$|The {{activity}} of the Perverted-Justice website consists of online volunteers who carry out sting operations posing as children or teenagers (the age range chosen for the decoys is 10–15) on chat sites and waiting for adults to approach them. After obtaining <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> of adults posing as minors, who may offer their telephone numbers and other details so that meetings can be arranged, the organization passes the information on to law enforcement. Perverted-Justice's methods are controversial, {{and a number of}} critics have labeled these actions harassment and possibly legal entrapment. The site additionally attracted media attention, both laudatory and critical, {{as a result of their}} collaboration with Dateline NBC on a series of televised sting operations called To Catch a Predator.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the NDCBU in a community or business center is extremely important, since neighborhood cluster box installations located in remote or poorly lighted areas invite large-scale mail theft or vandalism. Even when located in a high-traffic location or inside a gated community, the NDCBU is a tempting target for thieves attracted {{by the possibility of}} recovering checks, cash, <b>identifying</b> <b>information,</b> or other valuables from multiple victims. A 2008 RAND Corporation study, citing USPS statistics collected between 2004 and 2007, found that NDCBU thefts constituted 52.7% of all urban neighborhood mail thefts and 76.6% of all rural neighborhood mail thefts from locations with more than one mailbox, with higher-income ZIP code zones having a substantially higher number of thefts than low-income ZIP code zones.|$|E
25|$|Open {{adoption}} allows <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> to {{be communicated}} between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person. Rarely, {{it is the}} outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States). Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child. As of February 2009, 24 U.S. states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements {{to be included in}} the adoption finalization.|$|E
