40|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> is an {{integral}} part of the management process, utilised to motivate participants to achieve business objectives. Many employers are actively seeking ways of increasing the value of <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> in the employment process for the perceived benefits it would have for the business and participants. Over the past decade <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> has become a significant component of the employment offer that contributes to the attraction and retention of highly sought-after employees. It has grown in importance, but simultaneously has also become a major employment cost. In the absence of a validated generic methodology, the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> methodologies applied by employers are intuitive and most often lack any scientific basis. The purpose of the study was to design and validate a <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> methodology that will allow managers, or scheme designers, to develop <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> schemes that will be able to deliver outcomes that would be attributable to the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> scheme and not to factors outside the control of the scheme participants or within the greater organisational context. Based on a literature survey covering three bodies of knowledge; motivational theory, <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> concepts, and the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> life cycle, propositions regarding <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> were formulated. These propositions were converted into 99 items making up a questionnaire dealing with <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> constructs. The questionnaire was applied to thirty different types of <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> schemes in a bank assurance group. Six hundred and thirty two scheme participants completed the questionnaire that assessed the thirty schemes. Independently from the scheme assessments, scheme owners and/or designers evaluated scheme outcomes. First and second order factor analyses were performed on the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> scheme questionnaire that produced three adequately determined factors. The factors had highly acceptable internal reliabilities. These factors were: Congruency, Instrumentality and Performing. The respective relationships between the Independent Variables: Congruency, Instrumentality and Performing, the Moderator Variables: Scheme Type and Job Level and the Independent Variable: Scheme Outcome, were investigated by means of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Multiple Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), Analysis of Co-Variance (ANCOVA) as well as Multiple Regression Analysis. An empirically determined generic <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> methodology was arrived at, consisting of three constructs and eleven dimensions, which explained 34, 5 % of the variance of <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> scheme outcomes and is depicted in the figure below.

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} decades, {{there has been}} a massive {{increase}} in the level of CEO remuneration, which has not been in line with the growth in company earnings and firm size. This massive increase in particularly <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> {{was one of the main}} causes to the financial crisis during 2007 - 2008. As a result of the financial crisis, the issue of excessive CEO remuneration has become increasingly highlighted. Thus, the regulators have been striving to come up with new regulations to align the long-term interest of the banks with the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration.</b> A regulation that has been implemented by the EU countries to combat this issue is the bonus cap that is an amendment to CRD IV. The bonus cap limits the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> to 100 % of the fixed remuneration, with the exception that it can be raised to 200 % if approved by shareholders. However, the bonus cap has not been as efficient as expected. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine how the bonus cap has affected the <b>variable</b> CEO <b>remuneration.</b> This will be done by analysing and comparing the total remuneration within the 20 largest banks in EU. The investigation is concentrated on the time period 2012 - 2015. Method:  A sample of 20 banks has been chosen based on three criterions, namely the banks with the largest amount of assets, banks with EU headquarters and banks that provide the information necessary for the research. When collecting the data needed to fulfil the purpose, quantitative data in form of numbers from the banks financial reports was retrieved from their respective website. Conclusion: The results show that the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> has increased since the implementation of the bonus cap. This increase is likely driven by the increase in fixed remuneration. Another consequence of the bonus cap is that the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> has become more constant in relation to the fixed remuneration. The last observed consequence is a diminished correlation between performance and pay, meaning that the <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> has had a weakened dependence on the performance of the bank. The results of the development in <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> provide an insight about the effectiveness of the bonus cap, what impact it has had and that an improvement of the bonus cap is desirable...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} managers’ perception about the effectiveness of the linkage between the Balanced Scorecard and <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration.</b> Kaplan and Norton (1996, 2000) propose to use the Balanced Scorecard not only as a tool for communicating and monitoring strategy but also as a tool for evaluating and rewarding managers. So far little research has been performed on the effectiveness of Balanced Scorecard-based reward systems. This paper reports on the perceived impact of linking <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> to the Balanced Scorecard using an exploratory field study in a Belgian manufacturing division of a Danish petrochemical company. The study first reviews the management control literature addressing reward systems, performance target setting and the impact of performance measurement attributes on manager’s motivation. Then we analyze the empirical data collected via in-depth interviews, supplemented with an in-company survey. Based on these data we were able to formulate hypotheses and build a model on the motivational impact of a BSC-based <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> system...|$|R

In its report, the Committee paid special attention to the influence of remuneration on the crisis. In its final report, three of the twenty five recommendations concerned remuneration. Not only in the Netherlands was there attention for the incentives of remuneration and their role in the credit crisis, but also {{in the rest of the}} world. There are three different theories which try to explain the existence of variable remuneration: the agency theory, the market theory and the corporate governance theory. This article describes the European and Dutch rules on <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> of executive board members and where possible also of employee remuneration. However, these rules are not always clear-cut. In this article, discrepancies between the European and the Dutch rules will be discussed.

It is also intends to offer recommendations and solutions to the problem of setting levels and Structures of remuneration in Saudi Arabia, an area which is currently neglected despite its importance. Remuneration is a crucial tool in solving the agency problem between shareholders and managers in public companies where the separation of ownership and control exists by providing incentives. However, in Saudi Arabia this practice shows a tendency towards high fixed <b>remuneration</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> set without any clear links between this and performance, causing <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> to become another salary. Since inadequate laws and regulation {{have been found to be}} at least partially responsible for this state of affairs, solving this problem requires careful analysis of the most important jurisdictions which have developed laws and regulations. Thus, the thesis adopts a comparative legal study of the relevant laws and regulations within a descriptive and analytical framework, presenting a detailed discussion of remuneration regulation in the UK, EU and USA. Moreover, informal discussions have been conducted with individuals in the public sectors of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and the Capital Market Authority (CMA), in order to complement the black letter law analysis of the research, by providing a realistic insight into the nature of the challenges in formulating the policy process in Saudi Arabia.

The empirical evidence suggests that, on average, banks with stronger risk officers, less independent boards, and executives with less <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> incurred fewer losses. There is no evidence that institutional shareholders opposed aggressive risk-taking. The Financial Stability Board published Principles for Sound Compensation Practices in 2009, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued principles for enhancing corporate governance in 1999, 2006, and 2010. The reports have in common that shareholders retain residual control and executive pay continues to be aligned with shareholder interests.

These pension schemes allocate various risks (i. e., real interest rate, expected inflation and stock market risk) to the policyholders {{on the basis}} of complete contracts. We show how these variable annuities can be valued in a market-consistent fashion and how the insurer can adopt the principle of liability-driven investment. Market-consistent valuation is important for ensuring generational fairness and avoiding conflicts between the policyholders of the insurer. We show that the costs of variable real annuities may be less sensitive to the nominal interest rate than the costs of fixed nominal annuities, thereby reducing the nominal interest rate duration of the intertemporal hedging portfolio. This is especially so if stochastic variations in risk aversion impact equity risk premia and a lack of financial assets results in an incomplete financial market...|$|R

40|$|In an ever-changing higher {{education}} (HE) environment, institutions {{are seeing the}} involvement of parents in students' education increasing. This may partly be due to tuition fees {{and the introduction of}} <b>deferred</b> <b>variable</b> tuition fees ("top-up fees") from 2006, and also because of the increased number of students choosing to remain in the family home for the duration of their studies. Many students see their families as the most important source of motivation and advice right through from school age to when they make decisions about HE.

Methods: A qualitative, {{follow up study}} was conducted on a previously recruited cohort of aspiring dietetic students who had graduated as dietitians over the preceding decade. Participants completed an individual, semi-structured telephone interview which focused on retrospectively exploring factors inﬂuencing career pathways, perceptions of career success and satisfaction and the competencies required for effective practice. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and underwent qualitative descriptive and triangular analysis. Results: Career pathways were opportunistic rather than planned, inﬂuenced more by actual employment opportunities and lifestyle preferences (particularly location) than initial career preferences and plans. Most acknowledged that initial unfamiliarity of the profession, employment realities and pragmatic career decision-making explained the misalignment of plans with actual career pathways. Participants rated competencies of communication, teamwork, counselling and speciﬁc disciplinary knowledge as most relevant to effective practice. Despite some participants acknowledging that their career was not as originally anticipated, there was a consistent theme of career success and satisfaction determined more by intrinsic factors (helping people, effective in job, being acknowledged as a specialist) than extrinsic <b>variables</b> (<b>remuneration</b> level, management progression). Retention in the dietetic work-force appeared to be high, particularly when opportunities to specialise or undertake research were realised.

40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the impact of APS 510 {{standard}} on CEO remuneration-performance association in Australian Authorized deposits taking institutions (ADIs). Using panel data GLS and dynamic GMM estimation models, a key objective of this research is to investigate the role of regulatory standards on the empirical association between executive compensation and firm performance. The research uses data from 45 listed Australian financial institutions for the period 2004 - 2015. We observe no statistically significant evidence to show that CEO cash bonus is excessive in banking sector as claimed by various financial press and business media. Further analyses reveal the differing but substantial functions of APS 510 in shaping the association between a firm&# 039;s CEO short -term incentives and corporate performance depending on the nature and characteristics of the firm (ADIs vs non-ADIs). As the regulatory standard is legally binding for all ADIs and not necessarily for non-ADI companies, CEO&# 039;s ann ual <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> for the ADI category is somehow lower. This implies that the standard plays a critical role in reducing the level of CEO short-term incentives in the ADI group of firms. Empirical results show no significant statistical influence of the standard in shaping the relationship between CEO long-term incentive and market based performance of the Australian banking system. Our findings here are consistent with prior studies in developed countries such as the US. Policy-wise, we conclude that regulators should encourage corporate board of firms to increase long-term incentives in CEO remuneration in order to align managements&# 039; actions and shareholders interest of enhancing firm value...|$|R
40|$|A {{guaranteed}} minimum income benefit (GMIB) is a long-dated {{option that}} can be embedded in a <b>deferred</b> <b>variable</b> annuity. The GMIB is attractive because, for policyholders who plan to annuitize, it offers protection against poor market performance during the accumulation phase, and adverse interest rate experience at annuitization. The GMIB also provides an upside equity guarantee that resembles the benefit provided by a lookback option. We price the GMIB, and determine the fair fee rate that should be charged. Due to the long dated nature of the option, conventional hedging methods, such as delta hedging, will only be partially successful. Therefore, we are motivated to find alternative hedging methods which are practicable for long-dated options. First, we measure the effectiveness of static hedging strategies for the GMIB. Static hedging portfolios are constructed based on minimizing the Conditional Tail Expectation of the hedging loss distribution, or minimizing the mean squared hedging loss. Next, we measure the performance of semi-static hedging strategies for the GMIB. We present a practical method for testing semi-static strategies applied to long term options, which employs nested Monte Carlo simulations and standard optimization methods. The semi-static strategies involve periodically rebalancing the hedging portfolio at certain time intervals during the accumulation phase, such that, at the option maturity date, the hedging portfolio payoff is equal to or exceeds the option value, subject to an acceptable level of risk. While {{we focus on the}} GMIB as a case study, the methods we utilize are extendable to other types of long-dated options with similar features...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of board {{structures}} on risk taking-CEO pay association in Australian financial institutions. Using a panel data of 45 listed Australian financial institutions for the period 2004 - 2015, we examine the empirical relationship between firms expected default probability and CEO pay. Our results show that deposit taking institutions with {{a greater number of}} nonexecutive directors on the board generally have an expected default probability (EDP) that is more sensitive to CEO short-term employee benefits. However, a lower response of EDP to changes in CEO short-term employee benefits in non-deposit taking institutions is observed. To a large extent, this phenomenon is explained by the existence of moral hazard problem in banking industry. As depositors are insured against losses, nonexecutive directors may fail to monitor executives taking on risky investments that generate short-term gains in order to boost their cash bonus and other short-term risk remuneration. Our results suggest that boards associated with more nonexecutive directors&# 039; increase (reduce) the responsiveness of expected default probability to changes in CEO short-term employee benefits (long-term <b>variable</b> <b>remuneration</b> pay). We observe that Australian financial institutions with large boards are linked to EDP which is sensitive to both CEO short-term and long-term remuneration incentives. Institutions with larger boards motivate their CEOs to invest in high risk financial assets, consequently escalating the level of CEO risk-taking. Finally, independence of the board members plays a critical role in reducing the level of CEO risk-taking only if CEO remuneration is largely made of long-term incentives remuneration such as options and share restricted payments. In line with other studies from US, boards should use long-term incentives in CEO remuneration to reduce agency costs and increase firm value...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. Although {{there has}} been {{extensive}} research done on agency theory {{and in particular the}} relevance of agency predictions on executive remuneration, the focus of these studies has generally been on public companies. These research studies have mainly centred on quantitative methods using regression analysis techniques to explore the relationship between various financial performance <b>variables</b> and <b>remuneration</b> <b>variables.</b> The consistency of the findings with agency theory in these studies suggests the importance of remuneration schemes in the agency conflict. In relation to state owned enterprises (SOEs), {{the extent to which the}} predictions of agency theory can be applied in determining the relationship between financial performance and executive remuneration within these entities is limited. This study is therefore aimed at determining the relationship between financial performance and executive remuneration in South African SOEs within the context of agency theory using (net) profit, revenue and total assets as measures of financial performance. The findings show that in line with previous studies, the positive relationship between financial performance and executive remuneration in South African SOEs is consistent with the tenets of agency theory. Significantly, the results obtained in such a study could have pertinent policy applications in ensuring the negative impact of the principal-agent relationship in SOEs is minimised and executive remuneration schemes are designed to alleviate some of the costs arising from the agency relationship by aligning as far as possible the interests of the principal (the Government) and the agent (executive management) ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the life {{insurance}} sector has been {{faced with a}} number of challenges that emerged {{as a result of the}} growing longevity and stagnating birth rates for highly developed societies. In the field of actuarial application one could therefore ask for the implications of (long-term) mortality trends and (short-term) population fluctuation on an insurer's pricing and reserving of pension contracts, particularly in interaction with uncertainty in the capital markets. The first part of the thesis focuses on the mathematical description and projection of the mortality of homogeneous populations or insurance cohorts. Besides a survey of the most important representatives, a comprehensive analysis and comparison of stochastic and deterministic mortality forecasting models is carried out. In the second part a full stochastic model approach for two typical old-age provision products is set up and applied in terms of a management of longevity risk. On the one hand, a deferred conventional life annuity is analysed with regard to the combined effects of stochastic mortality and interest rates on different premium principles and risk capital allocation. On the other hand, a modern unit-linked annuity insurance, namely a <b>deferred</b> <b>variable</b> annuity contract, with an additional guaranteed minimum death benefit during the deferment period and a minimum income benefit at retirement is discussed. Mathematically, the guarantees represent options on the greater of the net asset value and a predetermined insurance benefit. For this reason, the existence and uniqueness of an extra fair percentage guarantee charge is proven. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the fair charge and risk neutral option prices concerning different model parameters is considered and several profitability and risk measures are determined...|$|R

The dependent <b>variable,</b> executive <b>remuneration,</b> comprises fixed pay, superannuation, fringe benefits and bonuses.
