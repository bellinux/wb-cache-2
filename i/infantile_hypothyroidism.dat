40|$|Serum IgA {{concentrations}} in five children with <b>infantile</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> fell {{soon after the}} start of treatment with thyroxine. In one child the IgA concentration fell appreciably (to less than 0. 01 g/ 1) and remained reduced; in the four others it returned to normal. IgM and IgG concentrations were roughly normal throughout. The deficiency in IgA concentrations may have been due to stimulation by thyroxine treatment of a T cell suppressor system that, in the original hypothyroid state, was less than normally active...|$|E
40|$|Fetuses whose {{mothers are}} treated with radioiodineafter {{approximately}} 10 â€“ 12 weeks of pregnancy {{are at high risk}} of developing iatrogenic hypothyroidism (1). Other than this well-documented occurrence, {{there is no evidence of}} harm to others from radiation originating from patients treated with radioiodine. Given that radioiodine is concen-trated in breast milk and radioiodine has been documented to be taken up by the thyroid in nursing newborns whose mothers were given diagnostic activities of radioiodine (2), discontinuing lactation before radioiodine therapy and avoiding breastfeeding after radioiodine treatment is justified despite the lack of a case report of <b>infantile</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> ascribed to radioiodine ingestion from breastfeeding. Aside from circumstances relating to pregnancy and lactation, the harm that a radioiodine-treated patient could inflict upon another person while following common sense instruction...|$|E
