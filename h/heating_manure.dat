40|$|Modelling is a {{relevant}} tool to study both environmental and economical performances of livestock systems. The {{aim of this}} paper is to present MOLDAVI, a model of broiler farming systems management under animal performances, environmental and economical issues. The system is a combination of four sub-models representing the animals, the poultry house, the manure and the outdoor run for free-range systems. Animal performances (growth, feed intake, mortality) are simulated in relation with birds’ characteristics (growth rate), feeding (nutrient composition) and rearing environment (temperature, animal density). Concerning environmental issues, the model predicts NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from manure and outdoor droppings as well as abiotic CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel use (e. g. propane for <b>heating).</b> <b>Manure</b> characteristics are estimated using a mass balance approach between animal excretion and gaseous losses. Energy and water use from the system are also estimated. Economical performances are calculated from bio-technical results (animal performances, energy and water use) simulated by the model and economical references (€ per kg of live weight produced, price of feed) given as model inputs. In order to improve broiler farming systems performances, MOLDAVI has been developped to be sensitive to a large panel of farming practices including flock management (animal density, feeding strategies…), housing characteristics (type of ventilation, outdoor access…) and manure management (manure type…). Simulations could help understanding complexity in broiler farming systems and stress synergical or compensation effects. As an example, the decrease of feed nitrogen content could lead to a decrease in nitrogen excretion and gaseous losses, but it could aleviate growth performances and therefore economical profit. Moreover, to take into account indirect environmental impacts associated to feed production, MOLDAVI outputs could be used in combination with Life Cycle Assessment...|$|E

It considered tobacco seedlings production in semi hot hotbed, which has been <b>heated</b> with <b>manure.</b> Tobacco seedlings' production in qualitatively new way considers seed sowing in Todd's systems. The goal of this kind of researches is to compare these two ways of seedlings' production in economic way, i. e. determination of production's total costs when product is produced by traditional and by modern way, in Todd's systems...|$|R
40|$|Tetracyclines such as {{oxytetracycline}} (OTC) {{are widely}} used veterinary chemicals. They are often poorly absorbed with a significant fraction being excreted in manure that can subsequently result in environmental contamination. In many countries throughout South East Asia swine manure is not composted, but sun-dried. Using sunlight to <b>heat</b> <b>manure</b> has been suggested as an effective and low-cost strategy to reduce OTC contamination, but this has previously been unexplored. Such conditions have {{also been shown to}} reduce bacterial numbers inmanuremeaning abioticOTC degradation processesmay become more significant. This work investigated for the first time, the role of temperature, illumination and pH in the abiotic degradation of OTC in sterilized swine manure. OTC loss from laboratory-based experiments simulating conditions likely to be experienced in sun-drying were assessed using simple first order and availability-adjusted loss models. ANOVA results suggested that neither model was superior to the other. In addition, pH and light had little influence. Temperature was shown to be the main factor influencing OTC loss. Kinetic results showed reductions in OTC concentrations of 65 % after 100 h at 40 ?C based on the availability-adjusted loss model, regardless of pH and illumination. Such temperatures are likely to be attained during the process of sun-drying. Therefore this may be a useful and practical means of reducing OTC contamination in manure. No Full Tex...|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from <b>heated</b> <b>manure.</b> One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|R
40|$|Manure from cattle feedlots is a {{renewable}} energy source which {{has the potential of}} supplementing the existing fossil fuels, but the <b>heat</b> content of <b>manure</b> is rather low. Since, the fluidized bed combustion technology has been used for the energy conversion of marginal fuels, such a technology is being explored for the combustion of feedlot manure. A fluidized bed combustor of 0. 15 m (6 in.) diameter was used for the combustion tests on manure. Experiments were conducted with - 20 to + 20 percent excess air and at bed temperatures ranging from 600 ?C (1112 ?F) to 800 ?C (1472 ?F). Experimental data revealed that the gasification efficiencies ranged from 90 to 98 percent, while the combustion efficiencies varied from 45 to 85 percent...|$|R
5000|$|Zhang et al., at the University of Illinois, {{report on}} a hydrous {{pyrolysis}} process in which swine manure is converted to oil by <b>heating</b> the swine <b>manure</b> and water {{in the presence of}} carbon monoxide in a closed container. For that process they report that a temperatures of at least [...] is required to convert the swine manure to oil, and temperatures above about [...] reduces the amount of oil produced. The Zhang et al. process produces pressures of about 7 to 18 Mpa (1000 to 2600 psi - 69 to 178 atm), with higher temperatures producing higher pressures. Zhang et al. used a retention time of 120 minutes for the reported study, but report at higher temperatures a time of less than 30 minutes results in significant production of oil.|$|R
40|$|Farmer {{motivation}} for building and operating anaerobic digesters has expanded from solely energy benefits to include manure treatment cost savings, nutrient conversion, odor and pathogen control, and byproduct recovery. The AgSTAR Program {{is sponsored by}} the SEPA, USDA and USDOE to encourage farm methane recovery from anaerobic digestion. AgSTAR has provided technical assistance to seven farms to assist them through the development, installation, start-up and operating phases of their anaerobic digestion projects. Three dairy plug flow digesters (NY, CT, OR), three covered pig manure lagoons (NC, VA, IA) and one <b>heated</b> mixed pig <b>manure</b> digester (IL) have been placed in operation since January 1997 with AgSTAR technical assistance. The farms and their digester systems are described. The cost of the digester systems are summarized. Biogas recovery and use in boilers or engine-generators is discussed for each farm. Start up and operational lessons learned are presented. References and calculations are included...|$|R
5000|$|A {{magazine}} {{published in}} Britain during WWII described an incubator as [...] "a wooden box, hot water, and a curtain". One {{of the first}} recorded methods of incubating included using the <b>heat</b> of rotted <b>manure</b> to warm the eggs. The Egyptians had a better method of incubating that used a cylindrical building that had a fire {{at the bottom of}} the building. The eggs that were incubating were placed on an inverted cone that was partially covered in ash. The eggs were placed in a woven basket that sat on top of the ashes. The building also had a roof that allowed smoke to escape, but it kept the rain out. In 400 B.C. Mechanical incubating was not invented until the year of 1749 by Reamur in Paris, France. Lyman Byce created a coal lamp incubator in 1879. [...] The first commercial machine was made by Hearson in the year of 1881.|$|R
40|$|A bovine {{enterovirus}} and a bovine parvovirus seeded into liquid {{cattle manure}} were rapidly inactivated by anaerobic digestion under thermophilic conditions (55 degrees C), {{but the same}} viruses survived for up to 13 and 8 days respectively under mesophilic conditions (35 degrees C). The enterovirus was inactivated in digested liquid <b>manure</b> <b>heated</b> to 70 degrees C for 30 min, but the parvovirus was not inactivated by this treatment. The enterovirus, seeded into single cell protein (the solids recovered by centrifugation of digested liquid manure), was inactivated by a gamma irradiation dose of 1. 0 Mrad, but the parvovirus survived this dose. When single cell protein seeded with bovine enterovirus or bovine parvovirus was ensiled with cracked corn, the enterovirus was inactivated {{after a period of}} 30 days, while the parvovirus survived for 30 days in one of two experiments. Neither the enterovirus nor the parvovirus survived composting for 28 days in a thermophilic aerobic environment when seeded into the solid fraction of cattle manure. It was concluded that, of the procedures tested, only anaerobic digestion under thermophilic conditions appeared to be reliable method of viral inactivation {{to ensure the safety of}} single cell protein for refeeding to livestock. Composting appeared to be a suitable method for the disinfection of manure for use as a soil conditioner...|$|R
40|$|Reduction {{of ammonia}} and {{greenhouse}} gas emissions is a major goal in countries where the livestock sector has a high social and economic importance. Estimates of emissions per building and per annum usually have uncertainties higher than the reduction targets. Therefore, mitigation strategies and public funding efficiency will benefit from progress and standardisation in measuring and modelling emissions from livestock buildings. Quantification of livestock emissions requires accurate measurements of trace gas concentrations. Infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy {{has been used for}} decades because of its selectivity, reduced drift in calibration, the existence of industrial analysers ease of use and the reduced cost per measurement. Its use can be further improved through better knowledge of measurement uncertainty. Although the infrared bands selected by optical filters are narrow, the risk of interference bias exists due to the high number and diversity of gas species. The emitted gases depend on the management of animals, feed, <b>manure,</b> <b>heating</b> and motorised equipment. Non-compensated interferences between gases induce an overestimation of gas concentrations, and a cascade effect induces underestimation. This study demonstrates two examples in broiler and dairy cow buildings, which lead either to overestimation (e. g. 12 instead of 2 mg [NH 3] m(- 3) and 4 instead of 1 mg [N 2 O] m(- 3) or underestimation (e. g. 2 instead of 4 mg [CH 4] m(- 3)). The detection of interference bias and the reduction of uncertainty in concentration measurements are discussed. These results can be used to provide uncertainty estimates for previously published emission factors that were based on infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy. (C) 2013 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Numerous {{gasification}} {{experiments were}} conducted and proved that with proper moisture content (usually near 10 %) animal manure can be gasified using the TAMU fluidized bed gasifier. In summary the following has been established. ? The heating value of dairy manure on a dry basis {{was found to}} be 15. 93 + 0. 26 MJ/kg (6, 863 + 112 Btu/lb), typical of most agricultural biomass. The heating value was around 14. 09 MJ/kg (6, 070 Btu/lb), on an ?as received? basis (around 13 % moisture). ? The heating value of synthesis gas from gasification of animal manure was estimated to be around 4. 2 MJ/m 3 (113 Btu/ft 3). This value is very similar to most synthesis gas from agricultural residues. ? Synthesis gas production per unit weight of manure was estimated to be 2. 11 m 3 /kg. The gas production energy efficiency was estimated to be around 55. 6 % (i. e. 55. 6 % of the energy was contained in the synthesis gas). ? Char production was on the average around 20 % of the feed input. The average <b>heating</b> value of <b>manure</b> char was around 19 MJ/kg (8, 816 Btu/lb). Thus, the char energy conversion efficiency was approximately 24 % (i. e. 24 % of the energy was still contained in the char). ? Twenty percent (20 %) of the energy from the biomass was used during the gasification to maintain the temperature of the reactor. Gasification is a continuous, endothermic process and thus, no external fuel is needed other than that used during startup. Natural gas was used during start-up and would last around 30 minutes. After the initial heating of the reactor, part of the biomass materials were used to maintain the operating temperature and the natural gas fuel source was shut off. ? The chemical formula for dairy manure during combustion is shown below. This formula was used only for stoichiometric calculation purposes only. ? Eutectic point analysis of the manure ash showed that the inorganic ash components will start to melt at around 600 ?C (1112 ?F). This was established using compressive strength as an indicator of fusion reactions. ? When used for power generation, it was expected to generate at least 25 kW of electrical power output for a 30 cm diameter pilot facility (i. e. at 1. 6 tonnes/day (1. 8 tons/day)) of feed input. The assumed conversion efficiency was roughly 15 % (from synthesis gas to electrical power in a natural gas-type engine-generator) ...|$|R
60|$|We {{know that}} self-fertilised {{seedlings}} are inferior {{in many respects}} to those from a cross; and as with plants {{in a state of}} nature pollen from the same flower can hardly fail to be often left by insects or by the wind on the stigma, it seems at first sight highly probable that self-sterility has been gradually acquired through natural selection in order to prevent self-fertilisation. It is no valid objection to this belief that the structure of some flowers, and the dichogamous condition of many others, suffice to prevent the pollen reaching the stigma of the same flower; for we should remember that with most species many flowers expand at the same time, and that pollen from the same plant is equally injurious or nearly so as that from the same flower. Nevertheless, the belief that self-sterility is a quality which has been gradually acquired for the special purpose of preventing self-fertilisation must, I believe, be rejected. In the first place, there is no close correspondence in degree between the sterility of the parent-plants when self-fertilised, {{and the extent to which}} their offspring suffer in vigour by this process; and some such correspondence might have been expected if self-sterility had been acquired on account of the injury caused by self-fertilisation. The fact of individuals of the same parentage differing greatly in their degree of self-sterility is likewise opposed to such a belief; unless, indeed, we suppose that certain individuals have been rendered self-sterile to favour intercrossing, whilst other individuals have been rendered self-fertile to ensure the propagation of the species. The fact of self-sterile individuals appearing only occasionally, as in the case of Lobelia, does not countenance this latter view. But the strongest argument against the belief that self-sterility has been acquired to prevent self-fertilisation, is the immediate and powerful effect of changed conditions in either causing or in removing self-sterility. We are not therefore justified in admitting that this peculiar state of the reproductive system has been gradually acquired through natural selection; but we must look at it as an incidental result, dependent on the conditions to which the plants have been subjected, like the ordinary sterility caused in the case of animals by confinement, and in the case of plants by too much <b>manure,</b> <b>heat,</b> etc. I do not, however, wish to maintain that self-sterility may not sometimes be of service to a plant in preventing self-fertilisation; but there are so many other means by which this result might be prevented or rendered difficult, including as we shall see in the next chapter the prepotency of pollen from a distinct individual over a plant's own pollen, that self-sterility seems an almost superfluous acquirement for this purpose.|$|R
