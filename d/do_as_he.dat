5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Leon obtains {{two tickets}} to a music festival in France {{and plans to}} take ZsaZsa, but he tells Fatboy he slept with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber), leaving Fatboy unsure of what to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{does not want to}} hurt ZsaZsa. He tells Mercy, who then tells ZsaZsa, who dumps Leon and takes Fatboy's van to France. Leon decides to go to France anyway, leaving Fatboy sad at the loss of two of his best friends, however, Leon and Fatboy stay in contact. He joins the local church choir but fears he will be unable to perform at their event as he felt {{pressured}} into joining by Dot and cannot sing very well. Mercy tells him he should just mime, but then Dot and the choir leader Edward Bishop (Frank Barrie) decide to give Fatboy a solo. Fatboy is unable to go through with it and walks out of the performance, so Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) takes over. At a New Year's Eve party, Fatboy kisses Mercy to put Kim off flirting with him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others <b>do,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E

25|$|When the Phoenix Force {{returned}} to Earth, Wolverine {{sided with the}} Avengers and went with them to Utopia to take Hope Summers into custody (as they suspected her of being the Phoenix Force's intended host). Wolverine found this particularly difficult to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was forced to fight those he once thought of as family.|$|E

25|$|The Pollard script, {{also known}} as Pollard Miao is an abugida invented by Methodist missionary Samuel Pollard. Pollard {{credited}} the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabics, saying, “While working out the problem, we remembered {{the case of the}} syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had done”.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{in spring}} that year, Fei Yi was assassinated by Guo Xiu (郭脩), a former Wei {{officer who had}} {{surrendered}} to Shu.

After learning of the Wu attack on Wei in the east {{in the summer of}} 253, Jiang Wei led tens of thousands of Shu troops from Shiying (石營; northwest of present-day Xihe County, Gansu) to besiege Didao (狄道; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu).|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, the Reformed {{tradition}} did not modify the medieval {{consensus on the}} doctrine of God. God's character is described primarily using three adjectives: eternal, infinite, and unchangeable. Reformed theologians such as Shirley Guthrie have proposed that rather than conceiving of God {{in terms of his}} attributes and freedom to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pleases, the doctrine of God is to be based on God's work in history and his freedom to live with and empower people.|$|E

25|$|The Fifth Dalai Lama's Regent or Desi, Sonam Rapten was, in fact, a fanatical Gelugpa {{supremacist}} {{as well as}} {{a shrewd}} and canny political operator with an eye for the main chance. Being 22 years the Dalai Lama's senior he dominated him as he raised him from the age of 5. In his autobiography The Dukula the lama repeatedly remarks how he had to defer to the Desi, or had to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said, and even as an adult he rarely got his way if he disagreed with Sonam Rapten's wishes.|$|E
25|$|During the Curragh {{incident}} in March 1914 Chetwode was offered {{command of the}} 3rd Cavalry Brigade when Hubert Gough threatened to resign. He {{knew that he would}} be “looked upon by all his brother officers as a scab” but thought it “his duty as a soldier to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was ordered & not to meddle in politics”. In the event Gough kept his command and Chetwode remained with the London Mounted Brigade, but his willingness to replace Gough caused some ill feeling. Promoted to temporary brigadier-general on 15 May 1914, he was given command of the 5th Cavalry Brigade in August 1914.|$|E
25|$|Eli goes on {{to train}} Samuel. When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and that there is nothing {{that can be done to}} prevent it. Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> judges best.|$|E

25|$|The French III and X corps counter{{attacked}} {{but were}} beaten further back. Lanrezac’s countermanding orders never reached X Corps. Lanrezac’s Fifth Army was now attacked on its {{right by the}} German Third Army; although these attacks were held, Lanrezac asked Joffre for permission to retreat. Lanrezac asked for the BEF to attack the German Second Army in flank, although, contradicting himself, he also reported that the BEF was still in echelon behind his own left flank, which if true {{would have made it}} impossible for the BEF to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> asked. Sir John, who had cancelled his own planned advance on news that Lanrezac had asked to fall back, agreed to hold his position.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, while Gunn {{was out of}} town, Bogan again went on a rampage. When Gunn returned, and learned of this, he went looking for Bogan, and warned him that if this {{happened}} again, he would arrest Bogan. To this, Bogan replied that he would <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pleased. Constable Gunn had a reputation, which he had shown on several occasions, {{as a man who}} would not back down nor be intimidated, and was known to have killed two men while holding that office. Gunn was a former Texas Ranger, who'd made his way up to Wyoming from Texas. Bogan hated Gunn, who had reprimanded him on several occasions by this point. However, by later witness accounts, Bogan feared Gunn, which probably led to what happened next.|$|E
25|$|This United Order was {{an attempt}} to {{eradicate}} poverty and promote a sense of unity and brotherhood within Latter Day Saint communities. In this expectation they indulge no vague dream of communism, encouraging individual irresponsibility and giving the idler an excuse for hoping to live {{at the expense of the}} thrifty; but rather, a calm trust that in the promised social order, such as God can approve, every man will be a steward in the full enjoyment of liberty to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> will with the talents committed to his care; but with the sure knowledge that an account of his stewardship shall be required at his hands.}} The LDS Church's view is that the doctrine and the various attempts at practicing it should not be seen as part of the 19th-century utopian movement in the United States, and is distinct from both Marxist communism and capitalism.|$|E

25|$|On {{his first}} day in office as acting chief judge, Sinfield summons the mayor to his office and orders him to raise taxes and cut back on his popular social programmes, {{to make up for}} the {{shortfall}} in the city's budget caused by the expensive mutant township project. When the mayor protests, Sinfield threatens to undermine his re-election campaign if he does not <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is told. Furious, Maybe decides to assassinate Sinfield, and infects him with deadly fungal spores. When Sinfield unexpectedly survives, Maybe covertly injects him with deadly bacteria, but again Sinfield pulls through. Realising that somebody is trying to kill him, Sinfield decides he wants the city's best judge to investigate, and puts Dredd in charge of the case, knowing that even though Dredd wants Sinfield to resign, his sense of duty will ensure that he is diligent in finding the assassin. Dredd brings Beeny with him to assist him.|$|E
25|$|On 26 April 1940 Lieutenant Colonel Dannevig was {{informed}} that the Germans were about to capture the town of Otta, cutting off the Otta Valley. The commander of the 2nd Division, General Jacob Hvinden Haug, authorized Dannevig to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> saw best with the forces at his command. Dannevig decided to evacuate the camp and march his troops and prisoners over the mountains to join the Norwegian 4th Division in Sogn. All the prisoners were taken along, while {{about half of the}} Norwegian soldiers were dismissed because of insufficient skiing skills. The march westwards began at 1000hrs on 27 April, the German prisoners dragging ski sleds across the snow-clad mountains. The first night was spent at Krosbu. Many prisoners soon suffered from snow blindness and exhaustion, some having to be left behind at the hotel Turtagrø, where the column spent the second night, to be retrieved later by snow sleds. Over several days the prisoners were brought by boat to Vadheim in Sogn. By the time the prisoners reached Vadheim resistance in the southern parts of Norway was ending and the Germans were left to themselves. Dannevig's militia unit was disbanded on 1 May 1940.|$|E
25|$|Republic. This {{regime is}} {{ruled by a}} philosopher king, and thus is {{grounded}} on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses {{throughout much of the}} Republic, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work. In Book VIII, Plato states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character. In his description, Plato has Sparta in mind. Oligarchy is made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy are in control. In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> likes. Democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of rich and poor. It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression.|$|E
