40|$|CONTEXT: Endoscopic mucosal {{resection}} is {{an established}} modality for excision of sessile lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Submucosal fluid injection creates a cushion and may prevent thermal injury and perforation. OBJECTIVES: This blind {{study investigated the}} performance of three different solutions to create submucosal fluid cushions in porcine stomach. METHODS: Three solutions were injected in the stomach of nine pigs BR 1 : normal saline solution, carboxymethylcellulose 0. 5 % and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> 0. 25 %. In each pig, submucosal injections with 6 mL per test-solution were performed. One drop of methylene blue was added to all injections for better visualization. The time for the bleb to disappear was recorded. RESULTS: The overall median time of visible submucosal cushion was 37 minutes (range 12 - 60 min) for <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose,</b> 31 minutes for carboxymethylcellulose (range 10 - 43 min) and 19 minutes for normal saline solution (range 8 - 37 min). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} neither between normal saline solution and carboxymethylcellulose (P = 0. 146) nor carboxymethylcellulose and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> (P = 0. 119) but the median duration of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> was significantly longer than normal saline solution (P = 0. 039). CONCLUSIONS: The length of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> submucosal fluid cushion is longer in comparison with normal saline solution.

They are found in numerous applications within; drug delivery, hygiene products, food industry, analytical chemistry, etc. In addition, polymeric hydrogels have promising future applications as; cell scaffolds, implants, sensors, etc. One of the critical parameters {{for the performance of}} hydrogels in different applications is their structure. One such structural feature is the heterogeneity of the material, where the term heterogeneity applies to many different types of structural variations. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how different kinds of heterogeneities can be introduced into hydrogels, and how the presence of the different heterogeneities can be related to swelling and mechanical properties of such materials. The materials investigated were; polyacrylic acid neutralized with calcium hydroxide, polysodium acrylate superabsorbents with microfibrillated cellulose utilized as a filler and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> with heterogeneous distribution of the substituents. It was found that the presence of calcium ions during the synthesis of crosslinked polyacrylic acid introduces heterogeneities, both in network structure and in the form of phase separation, with dramatic impact on gel properties. Microfibrillated cellulose was found to even in small amounts cause significant changes to the swelling and shear modulus of crosslinked polysodium acrylate superabsorbents. The effect of the microfibrillated cellulose was similar as if an equivalent mass of covalent crosslinker had been used, but with improved resistance to fracture. For <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> it was found that a heterogeneous distribution of the substituents causes increased interactions within the material, as determined from the glass transition temperature.

40|$|PURPOSE: To use a novel porcine dry eye model (pDEM) {{to study}} the effect of various {{artificial}} tears on corneal abrasion and epithelial cell death under severe "dry eye" conditions. METHODS: A 60 -second lacrimation-blink interval, which simulates a severe dry eye condition, was set up with our novel pDEM. The corneal protective effect of lubricating the eye for 4 hours with Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, as control; n = 20) and with 3 types of commercially available artificial tears (n = 17 for each) that contained different lubricating agents was studied. Effect was determined {{in terms of the}} change in fluorescein staining grade (on a 0 - 4 point scale with 0. 5 increments) of the cornea and the number of dead cells (by trypan blue staining) on the corneal surface. RESULTS: Median increase in fluorescein grading (median) in corneas treated for 4 hours with artificial tears containing sodium hyaluronate or <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> was significantly (P < 0. 002) smaller than with artificial tears containing balanced saline with an unknown demulcent or the DPBS control. The numbers of dead epithelial cells in the central corneas lubricated with artificial tears containing sodium hyaluronate or <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>methylcellulose</b> (229 ± 71 and 221 ± 65 [SD], respectively) were also significantly (P < 0. 005) smaller than those in the corneas of eyes lubricated with artificial tears containing balanced saline with an unknown demulcent or DPBS alone (328 ± 106 and 341 ± 113, respectively).

Phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens was performed in all the patients. 2 % <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>Methylcellulose</b> (HPMC) was used in one group and 1 % Sodium Hyaluronate (NaHa) was used in the other group. IOP was measured pre-operatively as well as 24 hours and 7 days post-operatively. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the pre-operative intraocular pressure between the two groups (p= 0. 483). Twenty four hours after surgery, the mean IOP increased by 2. 84 ±SD 2. 12 mm Hg in 2 % <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>Methylcellulose</b> group and 4. 54 ± 2. 07 mm Hg in 1 % Sodium Hyaluronate group. The increase was significantly higher in 1 % Sodium Hyaluronate group as compared to 2 % <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> <b>Methylcellulose</b> group (p= 0. 003). Seven days after surgery the mean intraocular pressure returned to near pre-operative levels in both the groups. Conclusion: Sodium Hyaluronate causes significantly higher increase in intraocular pressure in early post-operative period after cataract surgery inspite of maximum aspiration of viscoelastic substance from the eye following phacoemulsification surgery...|$|E
