5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL <b>house-style.</b> This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|With {{the funds}} {{available}} from the UERL, construction began in July 1902 at Knightsbridge, before the formal approval of the merger of the B and GN Work proceeded quickly, enabling the UERL to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the tunnels had been completed and that track laying was about to begin. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL <b>house-style.</b> This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor.

Among the relatively new, yet still historic, is a 1929 cottage built from a kit bought from the Sears, Roebuck catalogue.|$|R
40|$|Principal-agent {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} contemporary evidence on venture capital investment. The investor (as principal) and investee (as agent) are analysed in terms of risk management, information handling and the trading of risk and information. Investors and investees were paired in 'dyads', with each party being subject to separate face-to-face interviews. The paper develops the appropriate principal-agent models for dealing with incentives for entrepreneurial effort and issues of information and monitoring. The way in which investees and investors seek contract optimality is then examined, using qualitative data. It is shown that the evidence provides striking confirmation of {{the applicability of the}} principal-agent model to the venture capital financing of mature small firms. The most crucial feature of contract optimality was perceived to be the propoer choice of capital structure. This established ownership entitlement, created incentives for effort, and apportioned risk eficiently. Many investor-investee relations were perceived to be at or close to contract optimality. These optima were specific to time and place situations and strongly reflected individual <b>house-styles</b> of investors. Investor reputations were strongly attached to house styles. principal-agent model, entrepreneurship, mature small firms, venture capital, risk-bearing, information handling, contract optimality...|$|R
40|$|Defense date: 18 December 2009 Examining Board: Adrienne Héritier (EUI/RSCAS), Anker Brink Lund (Copenhagen Business School), Gianpietro Mazzoleni (University of Milan) (External Co-Supervisor), Alexander H. Trechsel (EUI) (Supervisor) François Mény Prize for the Best Comparative Study of Political Institutions, 2010. In this thesis, I {{demonstrate}} {{that the degree of}} political independence that a public service broadcaster has depends on the degree of legal protection given to it, and {{on the size of the}} market for news in that country. The latter affects broadcaster independence by creating more standardized and professionalized news, which in turn reduces politicians’ incentives to intervene in the broadcaster. The former affects broadcaster independence by making it less likely that such intervention will be effective. I demonstrate these claims in two ways. First, I conduct a large-N statistical analysis of 36 public service broadcasters (PSBs), in which I {{demonstrate that}} legal protection news market size are statistically significant predictors of PSB independence (as I operationalize it), and that other suggested explanatory factors — party system polarization and bureaucratic partisanship — have no effect. Second, I carry out a comparative historical analysis of six European PSBs—Radiotelevisione Italiana, Radiotelevisión Española, Radio Telefís Éireann (Ireland), the British Broadcasting Corporation, Danmarks Radio, and Sveriges Radio and its associated companies (Sweden) — and substantiate the claims made in my statistical analysis. In particular, I demonstrate that where the market for news was bigger, broadcasters capitalised on pre-existing journalistic experience, adopting the <b>house-styles</b> of press agencies and learning from journalists’ associations. Conversely, where the market was small, that experience could not be drawn on, and broadcast journalism attracted political intervention.

500|$|The South Melbourne Football Club was {{established}} in 1874 {{and was one of}} the founding clubs in the VFL/AFL.

In 1982, South Melbourne transferred to Sydney, dropping its old place name but retaining its nickname as the Sydney Swans. The swan, however, is no longer a black swan but a white swan, derived from existing red and white colours of South Melbourne and the lake-bound white swans of Albert Park near its original home ground. The white swan is often combined with, or replaced by, a white Sydney Opera <b>House-style</b> logo.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the number}} of collaborations, the album touches on several other styles. [...] "Waiting Room", a song written and sung with Prince for Return of Saturn, evokes his R style over a drum and bass beat. [...] "Hella Good", an electro-rock song co-written with hip hop {{production}} duo The Neptunes, is inspired by the funk songs of the late 1970s such as Queen's [...] "Another One Bites the Dust" [...] and the Commodores' [...] "Brick House". William Orbit, best known for his work on Madonna's electronica-oriented Ray of Light, incorporates trance music in the production of [...] "Making Out". [...] "Detective", one of the five tracks produced by Hooper, takes slight influence from pop music. The album's title track closes the album by tying together the many musical themes. It is a slow dub song, with acid <b>house-style</b> bleeps and moans.|$|E
500|$|Erotica is {{a concept}} album about sex and romance, on which she {{incorporated}} an alter-ego named Mistress Dita, heavily inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Musically, it is a pop and dance record which incorporates elements from classic disco, modern house, techno and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album played on innuendos and double entendres instead of explicit words. [...] "Erotica" [...] is the opening track from the album. Starting with Madonna saying [...] "My name is Dita", she invites her lover to be passive, while she tells him to [...] "do as I say" [...] and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. It deals with sex hang-ups, and {{has been described as}} [...] "an ode to S". Her cover version of [...] "Fever" [...] follows the title track. It is described as a [...] "sassy, <b>house-style</b> remake" [...] of the pop standard. The third track, [...] "Bye Bye Baby," [...] starts with the declaration, [...] "This is not a love song," [...] and goes on to ask questions of a lover she is about to abandon. At one point, Madonna asks angrily: [...] "Does it make you feel good to see me cry?" [...] The fourth track from Erotica, [...] "Deeper and Deeper," [...] is described as one of the [...] "pure disco" [...] moments of the album. Its bridge features a flamenco guitar, and its lyrics talk about sexual obsession.|$|E

2500|$|Minnesota's fraternities and sororities {{built up}} their housing {{prospects}} in three distinct phases, {{according to the}} 2003 Minneapolis Historical Commission Study. Before 1900, most early chapters served their membership with rented private homes. Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular building spree which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding <b>house-style</b> clapboard and stucco homes, to the many Fraternity Row mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue [...] "Sorority Row," [...] all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It {{is a testament to}} the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s financial bubble, having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest. , now digitally available, often picture these buildings, some with addresses and photos or professionally crafted etchings. A final wave of chapter building, usually in the Modernist style, occurred during the period 1950 to 1973.|$|E
