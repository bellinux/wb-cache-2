50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>fund</b> <b>transfers</b> (<b>EFT)</b> are {{the most}} common method of {{non-cash}} payment in Australia. EFT transactions between bank accounts use the Direct Entry system. For transfers using the Direct Entry System, BSB and bank account numbers must be given for the accounts to be debited {{as well as for the}} account to which funds are to be transferred. Electronic transactions are processed under the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) (also known as CS2) drawn up by APCA. The requirement for two-sided BSBs is eased in transactions involving payment cards, such as credit cards or debit cards, and in BPAY transactions, in which one side of the transfer is an account which includes the BSB electronically linked to the card and BPAY biller.|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} innovations {{applied to the}} systems of payment have been tremendous these two last decades. A system of payment is a whole of mechanisms whose {{the objective is to}} transfer the various forms of scriptural money between the economic agents.

Public Key Cryptosystems are also known as RSA coding, which are used often because the internet runs on open networks. Public Key Cryptosystems are used with open systems mainly because there are higher risks than with older forms of e-commerce that run on closed networks such as electronic data interchange (EDI) or <b>electronic</b> <b>fund</b> <b>transfer</b> (<b>EFT).</b> Open networks create a variety of security challenges such as {{the integrity of the}} information being transmitted, the confidentiality of private or personal information, the authenticity of the communicating parties, and the assurance that the communicating parties have the authority to enter into the transactions.

30|$|A major {{financial}} institution in an OECD country donated two de-identified samplings of their data that were collected {{over the period}} between July 2014 and July 2015. The samples comprise demographic information, credit card transactions, money <b>transfers,</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>fund</b> <b>transfers</b> (<b>EFT)</b> of over 100 thousand (Sample-A) and 60 thousand (Sample-B) customers. Sample-A and Sample-B contain in total roughly 45 millions and 22 millions of transactions, respectively. Both samples were drawn from a much larger sampling of 450 thousand customers who were located in a major metropolitan city, updated their home and work addresses since January 2012, and made at least one credit card transaction during the sampling period. Sample-A was drawn randomly from this larger set whereas Sample-B was drawn from the same set such that each customer has at least 10 credit card transactions, and in total around 60 % of all the credit card transactions were performed with point of sale (POS) machines of the bank donating the data. Bank officials reported that de-identification of Sample-A and B was done independently precluding determination {{of the number of}} customers contained by both of the samplings. Customers may prefer to use their credit cards on the POS machines of other banks. In that case, some part of the transaction information such as location cannot be collected by the bank issuing the credit card.

40|$|The {{liability}} of banks in <b>electronic</b> <b>fund</b> <b>transfer</b> (<b>EFT)</b> transactions {{is discussed in}} this thesis under the British and the United States law. The thesis covers banks’ liability in electronic credit and debit transfers. It covers banks’ liability in <b>Electronic</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Transfer</b> at the Point Of Sale (EFTPOS), Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) and home and office banking. Liability of banks in credit card transactions and cheque truncation falls {{outside the scope of}} this thesis. In the absence of British legislation in this area, an analogy is made with the traditional methods of payment. An attempt is also made to extract the applicable rules from the general principles of law and the banking practice. The discussion, under the United States law, relies on analysing the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Transfer</b> Act of 1978 and Article 4 A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which concern banks’ liability in consumer and commercially based EFT transactions. The thesis starts by analysing the legal nature of payment orders. In particular, whether a payment order is a negotiable instrument, a creation of trust funds, an assignation or merely a mandate from a customer to his bank. Chapter two discusses banks’ liability for failure to make an EFT transaction. This encompasses banks’ liability for complete failure to effect an EFT transaction and for improper implementation of such a transaction. Chapter three discusses the right to stop payment, completion of payment, irrevocability and banks’ liability for failure to stop payment. Chapter four discusses banks’ liability for erroneous EFT transactions. This includes allocation of losses resulting from errors in payment orders and errors committed by banks during the execution process of such orders. Chapter five discusses banks’ liability for unauthorised EFT transactions. Issues such as authentication of payment orders, security measures adopted by banks and allocation of losses resulting from unauthorised transactions are discussed in this chapter. Chapter six discusses the recoverability of damages for banks’ failure to implement customers’ instructions properly. It discusses what measures of damages are applicable in certain situations such as banks’ complete failure to make an EFT transaction, failure to <b>transfer</b> <b>funds</b> on time etc. The thesis is completed by summary and conclusion...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2001, the Department of the Treasury made 764 million payments valued at $ 549 billion to beneficiaries of federal programs, primarily programs administered by the Social Security Administration. Of these payments, 76 percent were made using <b>electronic</b> <b>funds</b> <b>transfers</b> (<b>EFTs),</b> potentially saving the government {{millions of dollars in}} costs associated with disbursing paper checks. In 1996, Congress passed legislation which required that federal payments except tax refunds be made electronically as of January 1999. The act also required that each person affected by this mandate have access to an account at a financial institution at a reasonable cost and with certain consumer protections. To meet this requirement, Treasury developed the Electronic Transfer Account (ETA). Most recipients of federal benefits have their payments deposited electronically. The number of recipients using EFT climbed steadily throughout the 1990 s, rising from around half to more than three-quarters of all beneficiaries. Treasury and the Social Security Administration (SSA) have undertaken activities to increase the use of direct deposit, including developing marketing material and directly notifying check recipients of the advantages of using EFT, particularly safety and convenience. Although information describing the characteristics of these EFT users is limited, GAO determined that participation rates are highest for those 65 and older. The primary obstacle to using EFT was that many federal check recipients did not have a bank account. GAO's analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation's 1998 data indicated that 11 million benefit recipients, over half of all federal benefit check recipients in 1998, were unbanked. The ETA has not been widely accepted by banks or unbanked beneficiaries despite Treasury's efforts to promote it. Since initiation of the program in 1999, 36, 000 ETAs have been opened, representing fewer than 1 percent of unbanked beneficiaries. Based on discussions with representatives from Treasury, SSA, financial institutions, and consumer groups, GAO identified several approaches that Treasury could consider to increase the use of electronic transfers. These approaches include increasing cooperation between banks and local SSA offices to more effectively enroll beneficiaries for ETAs; exploring other electronic payment options besides the ETA to deliver benefits; partnering with banks to provide information on the general availability of low cost banking products, especially in areas with low ETA coverage; and conducting further research to determine why certain states have low direct deposit participation rates. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{past thirty}} years have seen rapid {{advances}} in the technological component of banking services {{and as a consequence}} new legal issues have come to the fore, especially with regard to <b>Electronic</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>Transfers</b> (<b>EFTs)</b> which are now used to transfer money around the world, and have made fund transactions between payers and payees easier, faster and more secure. The method involves risks for both banks and customers, due to the possibility of unauthorized payments risks, credit and insolvency problems, and confidentiality issues. Most contracts and obligations now depend on the new technology, although there is a variety of methods for dealing with the concomitant risks. EFTs share a number of similarities with paper-based <b>funds</b> <b>transfers</b> in regard to methods of regulation, and the careful observer can identify patterns and themes. Today, the business world depends heavily on EFT systems for its procedures; and government and academia have also taken a keen interest in EFTs. This thesis reviews and examines the existing legal position of liability of banks and customers for risks associated with EFT transactions: unauthorized EFT instruction and the problem of customer identity, credit risk and privacy, especially, the systems employed for safeguarding the customer’s transactions and data. The thesis also makes recommendations for change. The rules for the allocation of risk are based on the various mechanisms used to access the account. Also, due to the complexities of EFT, consumer protection becomes a paramount goal and is a subject of much concern, {{particularly when it comes to}} determining liability for losses. The UK government implemented the Payment Services Directive 2007 by adopting the Payment Services Regulations 2009, to regulate the system. However, such Regulations do not constitute a comprehensive regime that applies to all legal issues arising in the context of the EFT system. This study argues the necessity for a re-examination of existing laws and proposes a model for the future approach to the issues associated with EFT payment. Different approaches to EFT will be assessed, and the comparative and contrasting elements will be analysed in order to propose a comprehensive solution to the deficiencies in the current framework. Central to the problem is the absence of any uniform standard: individual banks offer differing contractual terms and conditions and different means of accessing accounts. Consequently it is time to formulate new and comprehensive rules for the allocation of liability of risks associated with EFT transactions.

40|$|In South Africa, {{the robust}} banking sector may be {{overwhelming}} to its clients {{and may even}} leave them vulnerable to their business practice. Banks support card purchases but some are reticent about their role in chargebacks. The Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 provides for some very noble refund remedies but if these remedies are not enforced by banks, they prove ineffective. The banks own the credit transfer process but neither the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 nor the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 compels them to chargeback credit card transactions and the consumer is therefore left without protection. This means that if a customer buys a service using his credit card and seeks a chargeback from his bank for a valid reason, there is no recourse for the customer {{in terms of the}} contract with the bank and the customer is left {{at the mercy of the}} bank and the rules and regulations of the credit card operator with whom the customer does not have a contract. Similarly debit card purchases and <b>electronic</b> <b>fund</b> <b>transfers</b> (<b>EFT)</b> also fall short of protection as the banks? reticence follows through to these as well. The bank is under no obligation to assist the client with disputed transactions and this can be appreciated from the wording in card agreements, some more notably than others. That been said, the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 does contemplate payment for goods and services using a credit or a debit card but fails to call on the banks to assist the consumer. The code of banking practice does not come to the aid of the consumer either as the voluntary commitments are limited to some aspects of cheques, debit orders, foreign exchange, internet telephone and cell phone banking. The aforementioned payment services have chargeback references or provisions which protect the customer; however the code makes no mention of payment services linked to debit and credit card payments. In practice, a third party card operator attends to dispute resolution and chargebacks but accrues no contractual responsibility towards the client, nor are the card operators subject to South African law and jurisdiction. In this paper, the client bank relationship is also examined as the bank is in the precarious position of having to make or break a client. The mechanics behind the real time gross settlement system of South Africa in order to understand what can and cannot be done is also discussed. Coming back to the refund provisions in the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 only two of them stipulate a timeline within which to effect the refund but the international card operator is not bound by these timelines. Also, there is no visibility as to the debit and credit mechanisms between the client?s bank and the merchant?s bank and if a dispute is resolved within 3 or 4 days there is nothing preventing the merchant?s bank or the client?s bank from taking 120 days to credit the client. The banks would then have the opportunity to create a healthy cash flow at the expense of the aggrieved customer. This dissertation also calls on the Competition Commission to test the code of banking practice against prohibited practices and it calls on the legislator to address consumer chargeback rights in appropriate legislation. Lastly a recommendation with regard to wording that must be introduced into the code of banking practice to enforce chargeback rights is made as well as a suggestion to the utilization of existing Ombudsman and registered paralegals.
