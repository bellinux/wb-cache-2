40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the {{trade-off}} conditions between battery saving opportunities at the user terminal and Long Term Evolution network performance. To achieve the goal Voice over IP with <b>discontinuous</b> <b>reception</b> and a vast amount of different settings, including on duration, inactivity and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>reception</b> cycle timers, have been studied. An adaptive <b>discontinuous</b> <b>reception</b> with synchronizing the on duration time with the Voice over IP packet arrival has been proposed to minimize the delays caused by <b>discontinuous</b> <b>reception.</b> In addition, a channel quality indicator preamble time has been introduced to enable channel quality indicator update prior the on duration period. The quality of service and battery saving opportunities have been evaluated with a dynamic system simulator enabling detailed simulation of multiple users and cells with realistic assumptions. It can be concluded that high battery saving, i. e. increased talk-time opportunities, can be achieved without compromising the performance when discontinuous re-ception is properly adapted. Adaptive <b>discontinuous</b> <b>reception</b> and channel quality indicator preamble can effectively mitigate the capacity loss when more stricter DRX settings enabling higher energy efficiency at the terminal are applied...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{universal}} {{mobile telecommunications}} system (UMTS) utilizes the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>reception</b> (DRX) mechanism {{to reduce the}} power consumption of mobile stations (MSs). DRX permits an idle MS to power off the radio receiver for a predefined sleep period and then wake up to receive the next paging message. The sleep/wake-up scheduling of each MS is determined by two DRX parameters: the inactivity timer threshold and the DRX cycle. In the literature, analytic and simulation models {{have been developed to}} study the DRX performance mainly for Poisson traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-Markov process to model the UMTS DRX with bursty packet data traffic. The analytic results are validated against simulation experiments. We investigate the effects of the two DRX parameters on output measures including the power saving factor and the mean packet waiting time.
