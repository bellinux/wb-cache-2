Drawing on conceptions of property, the principles and purposes of the Property (Relationships) Act and contrasted with trust law, a theory is adopted to explain why family property law has presumptive power over trust principles. Orthodox trust principles are discussed to explain why trust assets are protected from third party claims, the importance of the laws of powers and fiduciary obligations, the problems created by settlor or appointor control and the reason a “controller” is a beneficial owner of trust assets. The dispositions of relationship property to trusts and the limits on compensatory payments are discussed alongside the significance of the abolition of <b>gift</b> <b>duty,</b> other statutory remedies and judicial responses. Case authorities are explored, similarities with Australian alter ego trusts are drawn upon, and the application of the “bundle of rights” theory is discussed with reference to the valuation of debts and occupation orders.

40|$|Maatalouspolitiikan suhteen EU:n jäsenmaiden kansallinen liikkumavara on vähäinen. Verotus ja sosiaalipolitiikka kuuluvat kuitenkin melko pitkälle kansallisen päätäntävallan piiriin. Maa- ja metsätalousministeriön rahoittamassa tutkimushankkeessa on selvitetty Saksan maatalousverojärjestelmää saksalaisviljelijöiden mahdollisten kilpailuetujen ja -haittoja arvioimiseksi suomalaisiin viljelijöihin verrattuna. Tutkimuksesta käy ilmi, että saksalaisviljelijöiden maksettavaksi tulevan tuloveron määrä on noin 50 % alhaisempi kuin Suomessa. Saksassa maataloudenharjoittajien pakolliset sosiaalivakuutusmaksut ovat kuitenkin huomattavasti korkeammat kuin Suomessa. Vertailu osoittaa saksalaisten ja suomalaisten tilojen maksurasitteen olevan lähes yhtä suuren. Saksassa perintö- ja lahjaverosäännöstöstä on muodostettu selkeä kansallinen tukimuoto maataloudelle. Useat päällekkäiset vapaaosat, omaisuuden arvostamissäännökset ja siviilioikeudellisen lainsäädännön säännökset saavat aikaan sen, että vähennysten jälkeen maatiloille ei pääsääntöisesti jää maksettavaksi perintö- tai lahjaveroa, eikä tilanpidon jatkaja juuri koskaan maksa sukupolvenvaihdosluovutuksesta erillistä vastiketta. Saksassa tuloverotuksen edullisuus johtuu useista päällekkäisistä vähennyksistä. Ensin kunkin tulolajin sisällä vähennetään tulonhankkimismenot, jonka lisäksi kaikkien tulojen yhteissummasta tehdään vähennyksiä, joita ei voida kohdistaa yksittäisiin tulolajeihin. Saksassa suuret tilat ovat velvollisia pitämään kahdenkertaista kirjanpitoa. Hieman tätä pienemmät tilat ilmoittavat tulot kassaperusteisen meno-tulolaskelman mukaisesti. Kolmas menetelmä on kaavamainen pinta-alaperusteinen menetelmä, jossa todellisista tuloista tulee verotettavaksi 45 - 75 %. Tässä menetelmässä tuloverotus on edullisimmillaan, mutta sitä voivat käyttää vain pienet, tulokseltaan heikohkot ja sivutoimiset tilat. Mikäli maataloudenharjoittaja ei täytä ilmoitusvelvollisuuttaan, tulot arvioidaan. Arviointimenetelmä on ollut perinteisesti monille pientiloille edullinen, joten siihen ajaudutaan usein harkitusti. Saksan vuonna 1996 uudistettu perintö- ja lahjaverosäännöstö ulotti yritysten sukupolvenvaihdoksia koskevat veronhuojennukset myös maatalouteen. Perittäessä tai lahjoitettaessa maatalous- ja yritysomaisuutta omaisuuden arvosta voidaan vähentää 500 000 DM:n vapaaosa ja jäljelle jäävästä summasta vielä 40 %. Huojennus kohdistuu maatilan peltoihin, metsään ja maataloustyöntekijöiden asuntoihin. Käteisvarat ja maanviljelijän oma asunto lisätään huojennettuun omaisuuteen. Huojennuksen ja muiden vähennysten jälkeen lahjansaaja tai perillinen voi vähentää oman henkilökohtaisen vapaaosansa, joka on rintaperillisillä 400 000 DM. Saksan perintö- ja lahjaverotuksen edullisuus johtuu myös omaisuuden arvostusmenettelystä, jossa maatilan irtaimen omaisuuden, talousrakennusten, eläinten ja maitokiintiön arvo sisällytetään maapohjan arvoon. Käytännössä niiden osuus lopullisesta perintö- ja lahjaverotusarvosta on olematon. Uudistetun arvostusmenettelyn pohjalta määritettävät maapohjan arvot ovat lähellä tämän päivän reaalisia tuottoarvoja. Uudistuksessa arvot nousivat huomattavasti, mutta vastaavasti henkilökohtaisia vapaaosia nostettiin entisestä. Maatilojen sukupolvenvaihdosluovutusten edullisuuden takana vaikuttavat myös siviilioikeudelliset ja alueelliset sukupolvenvaihdosluovutuslait, joiden tarkoituksena on taata, että tila ei siirry suvun ulkopuolelle. Jatkajan kannalta siviilioikeudellisten sukupolvenvaihdoslakien suurimman hyödyn muodostavat lain sanelemat pienet väistyvien perillisten korvaukset ja se, että vanhemmille tuleva korvaus muodostuu yleensä vain syytingistä. The {{study is}} {{composed}} of two parts. He first part studies farmers income taxation in Germany. In Germany farmers may report their annual income for taxation according to three different taxation procedures. Large farms are obliged to double-entry bookkeeping and to report their incomes according to this. Smaller farms report their incomes according to cash basis expenditure and income calculation, and the information value of this is somewhat weaker than that of double-entry bookkeeping. The third procedure is a fully schematic method based on the area, and through this only about 45 - 75 % of the real income can be taxed. This method can be used only by small farms with weak results or part-time farms. The income taxation is the lowest when using the third method, {{which is based on}} averages. If a farmer fails to fulfill the reporting obligation, an estimation procedure of incomes is applied. The estimation procedure differs from the Finnish tax assessment by estimation in that it has traditionally been beneficial for many small farms, and thus it has been used deliberately. Farmers cannot choose the procedure to be used, but they are directed to the appropriate procedure {{on the basis of the}} size, result and economic value of the farm. If the farm size or the result changes, the farmer may change the procedure, but the change is binding for a certain period of time. When the amount of income taxes to be paid by German farms are examined, it can be noted that these are about 50 % lower than in Finland. Income taxation is the lowest when the taxpayer is married. The German legislation on income taxes is constructed so that the spouses may use tax tables of their own, and thus enjoy considerable tax concessions. The low income taxation is also partly caused by several overlapping deductions, which are first made within each type of income and, finally, deductions are made on the total of all types of income that could not be made in the case of the individual types of income. However, when the obligatory social security payments comparable to taxes in the countries in question were taken into account in addition to the amount of income taxes, the research result changed in a significant way. The social security expenses of German farmers are considerably higher than in Finland. Consequently, the burden caused by such payments on the Finnish and German farms is almost equal - on the German bookkeeping farms it is even a little higher than in Finland. This can be seen in the farm models presented in the latter part of the study. The second part of the study considers inheritance and gift duties of farms in Germany. The stipulations on inheritance and gift duties in Germany revised in 1996 extended the tax concessions concerning the change of generation in companies to agriculture as well. When agricultural or company property is inherited or given away, concession according to section 13 a of the act is directed to the property. Based on this concession, a free share of DM 500, 000 can be deducted from the value of the property, and a further deduction of 40 % can be made on the remaining amount. The concession concerns the arable land and forest of farms as well as residences of farm workers. Cash funds and the residence of the farmer are added to the property on which the concessions have been made. In addition to this concession, the recipient of the gift or heir may deduct a personal free share after all other deductions. In the case of direct heirs the personal free share is DM 400, 000. Due to the several overlapping free shares, in most cases there remain no inheritance or gift duties to be paid by farms. The low inheritance and gift duties in Germany are also partly based on the valuation of property in which the movable property, production buildings, animals or milk quotas are not valued separately. In practice the share of these of the final inheritance and <b>gift</b> <b>duty</b> value is DM 0. After the reform the old unit values defined in 1964 are no longer used as the basis for inheritance and gift duties. These were replaced by the first uniform valuation procedure applied in the whole country, and the values determined on the basis of this are close to the current realistic productive values of the ground. Thus the values rose considerably, but this was compensated by raising the personal free shares. One reason for the low payments in connection with changes of generation is also the regional act concerning the transfer of farms to descendants (Höfeordnung) based on the civil law, which makes sure that the farm is not transferred outside the family. The most significant benefits of acts concerning the change of generation that are based on the civil law consist of the small compensations to the heirs yielding the property and life-annuity to the parents. As a result of these factors the heir remaining on the farm hardly ever pays any separate compensations in connection with the transfer of the farm. Consequently, the low inheritance and gift duties in Germany are based on several overlapping free shares, valuation of the property, as well as stipulations based on the civil law that guarantee very low or no payments in connection with the transfer of a farm. vokMTT TaloustutkimusTaxation of agriculture in German...|$|E

The tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking/ payments system. The APT tax introduces progressivity through the tax base rather than via the rate structure. Since roughly 85 % of all transactions involve the exchange of financial instruments, it is the wealthy who carry out {{a disproportionate share of}} total transactions and therefore bear a disproportionate burden of the tax despite its flat rate structure. The automated recording of all APT tax payments by firms and individuals creates a degree of transparency and perceived fairness that induces greater tax compliance.

Its companion volume (Part 1, Technical) has also been revised this year, and is usually revised biennially. In an era of increasing sophistication in farm management analytical techniques, the budget remains the simplest and yet most versatile technique available to the farmer and his advisor. Essentially a farm budget is a written plan which formalizes an anticipated farm programme and translates it into expected financial results. The information in this manual is set out to assist the individual in assessing any farming orientated financial transaction or computation with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Section 1, "Assistance and Incentives for Farmers", contains direct extracts from the M. A. F. Information Services booklet of the same name. Section 2, "Farm Finance", gives a brief description on the forms of capital and provides information regarding possible sources, lending terms and lending rates. Section 3, "Farm Revenue", is an attempt at assessing representative levels for farm prices for the present financial year. Section 4, "Farm Expenditure", is likewise an attempt at formalizing a financial basis for assessment of farm costs. The information contained in both Sections 3 and 4 should be regarded in light of present highly inflationary times.

60|$|At the {{beginning}} of the year 1839 he received, through political interest, an appointment as weigher and gauger in the Boston Custom-house. Mr. Van Buren then occupied the Presidency, and it appears that the Democratic party, whose successful candidate he had been, rather took credit for the patronage it had bestowed upon literary men. Hawthorne was a Democrat, and apparently a zealous one; even in later years, after the Whigs had vivified their principles by the adoption of the Republican platform, and by taking up an honest attitude on the question of slavery, his political faith never wavered. His Democratic sympathies were eminently natural, and there would have been an incongruity in his belonging to the other party. He was not only by conviction, but personally and by association, a Democrat. When in later years he found himself in contact with European civilisation, he appears to have become conscious of a good deal of latent radicalism in his disposition; he was oppressed with the burden of antiquity in Europe, and he found himself sighing for lightness and freshness and facility of change. But these things are relative to the point of view, and in his own country Hawthorne cast his lot with the party of conservatism, the party opposed to change and freshness. The people who found something musty and mouldy in his literary productions would have regarded this quite as a matter of course; but we are not obliged to use invidious epithets in describing his political preferences. The sentiment that attached him to the Democracy was a subtle and honourable one, and the author of an attempt to sketch a portrait of him, should be the last to complain of this adjustment of his sympathies. It falls much more smoothly into his reader's conception of him than any other would do; and if he had had the perversity to be a Republican, I am afraid our ingenuity would have been considerably taxed in devising a proper explanation of the circumstance. At any rate, the Democrats gave him a small post in the Boston Custom-house, to which an annual salary of $1,200 was attached, and Hawthorne appears at first to have joyously welcomed the <b>gift.</b> The <b>duties</b> of the office were not very congruous to the genius of a man of fancy; but it had the advantage that it broke the spell of his cursed solitude, as he called it, drew him away from Salem, and threw him, comparatively speaking, into the world. The first volume of the American Note-Books contains some extracts from letters written during his tenure of this modest office, which indicate sufficiently that his occupations cannot have been intrinsically gratifying.|$|R
40|$|I {{propose the}} {{replacement}} of our current system of individual and corporate income, sales, excise, capital gains, import and export <b>duties,</b> <b>gift</b> and estate taxes with a single comprehensive “revenue neutral” Automated Payment Transaction (APT) tax. The APT tax consists of a flat rate tax levied on all voluntary transactions. The total volume of transactions represents the broadest conceivable tax base and therefore requires the lowest conceivable marginal tax rate. Since the efficiency (misallocation) costs of a tax system tend to rise geometrically with the marginal tax rate, a massive reduction in tax rates can save an estimated $ 300 billion of misallocation {{costs associated with the}} current tax system. The APT tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are routinely settled through the electronic technology of the bank/payments clearing system with no deductions, exemptions, or exclusions. The APT tax also imposes an automatically collected tax on cash as it enters and leaves the banking system. All income and information tax returns are eliminated as taxes are digitally assessed and collected by the financial equivalent of the E-Z pass that is now used to speed traffic through a toll booth system on highways. The annual savings in compliance and administrative costs are estimated to be $ 200 billion per year. Unlike the “Fair Tax” or “National Sales Tax” proposals which are highly regressive, the flat rate APT tax introduces progressivity through the tax base since the total volume of transactions includes all asset transactions involving exchanges of titles to property. The wealthy carry out a disproportionate share of these asset exchanges and therefore bear a disproportionate burden of the tax despite its flat rate structure. The perceived fairness, even handedness and simplicity of the APT tax will greatly reduce tax evasion, which the IRS estimates to total $ 325 billion per year. Like all taxes, the APT tax creates new distortions which must be weighed against the benefits obtained by scrapping the current tax system. Scrapping the present tax system tax promises potential benefits estimated at $ 825 billion annually. The proposed APT tax is simple, comprehensible, fair and efficient, with minimal administrative and compliance costs. The burden of proof therefore rests with APT tax opponents who must demonstrate that its costs exceed the $ 825 billion of potential annual benefits.

It had particular significance for Bach since it was on that day in 1723 that he assumed office as [...] in Leipzig. His duties included the education of the Thomanerchor and performances in the regular services of the main churches in Leipzig, the [...] and the [...] The most skilled church musicians—including SATB soloists and others doubling as choristers and instrumentalists—were based at the Thomaskirche where cantatas were performed each Sunday and on feast days. The other instrumentalists were either professional string players (Kunstgeiger), members of the Leipzig Stadtpfeifer, an ancient band of brass and wind players, or travelling musicians. Remaining gaps in the orchestra were filled by pupils from the Thomasschule and university students. Bach's orchestra would have had 12-20 players in addition to himself and an organist. The soloists, choir and orchestra performed from two galleries above and around the principal organ loft in the centre of the Thomaskirche. Sometimes two cantatas would be performed during a service; and when a cantata was written in two parts, a sermon would be preached between the two parts or the second part would accompany communion. As Thomascantor, Bach instituted several changes in performance practise in Leipzig: he introduced more frequent and regular rehearsals for choristers, including individual lessons; he installed former students as organists and directors of music in the churches for which he was responsible; and—going beyond his church duties—he helped select and train municipal musicians.On his appointment Bach embarked on the project of composing yearly cycles of cantatas with one for each Sunday and holiday of the liturgical year, a project which [...] describes as [...] "an artistic undertaking on the largest scale". The first cantata he wrote was Die Elenden sollen essen, BWV 75, beginning the first cycle on the first Sunday after Trinity in 1723; the cantata O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 20 from 1724 began the second cycle, again on the first Sunday after Trinity. With BWV 20, Bach entered on a new scheme for the second cycle: to compose chorale cantatas based exclusively on the main Lutheran hymns associated with the day in the liturgical calendar. After completing his second cycle, Bach's third cycle was composed sporadically between 1725 and 1727. Moreover, Bach does not seem to have marked the anniversary of his appointment in 1725. Somewhat exceptionally, from February to late September 1726, the cantatas performed in Leipzig were mainly those by Bach's distant cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, court composer at Meiningen, with gaps filled by Bach's own cantatas written in the previous year. During this period Bach not only had access to his cousin's compositions, but also to religious texts from the court at Meiningen. Of the relatively small number of nine cantatas newly composed by Bach during this period, seven were settings of Meiningen texts and all but one of these followed the formal compositional scheme of his cousin (BWV 39, BWV 88, BWV 187, BWV 45, BWV 102 and BWV 17). The first cantata based on a Meiningen text was Gott fähret auf mit Jauchzen, BWV 43 for the Feast of the Ascension on 30 May 1726. Following that, on 23 June 1726, the first Sunday after Trinity, Bach revived tradition by composing the cantata [...] for the beginning of his fourth year in office: it was the first [...] "Meiningen" [...] cantata written for an ordinary Sunday.The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle of John, (the [...] "God is Love" [...] verses, [...] ), and from the Gospel of Luke (the parable of the Rich man and Lazarus, [...] ).
