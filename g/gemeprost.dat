40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized {{trial was}} conducted in 140 women to compare the efficacy of vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> with vaginal misoprostol for termination of second trimester pregnancy. Women requesting termination of second trimester pregnancy were randomized into two groups. Group A women were given 1 mg vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> every 3 h for a maximum of five doses in the first 24 h, whereas group B women were given 400 μg vaginal misoprostol every 3 h for a maximum of five doses in 24 h. The median induction-abortion interval in the vaginal misoprostol group (14. 1 h) was significantly shorter than that in the <b>gemeprost</b> group (19. 5 h). The percentage of women who achieved successful abortion within 24 h in the misoprostol group (80. 0 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that in the <b>gemeprost</b> group (58. 6 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of side effects between the two groups except for diarrhea, which was more common in the <b>gemeprost</b> group. The incidence of fever was more common in the misoprostol group. It is concluded that vaginal misoprostol is more effective than <b>gemeprost</b> in termination of second trimester pregnancy. | The efficacies of vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> and vaginal misoprostol for the termination of second-trimester pregnancies were compared in a prospective, randomized trial conducted in Hong Kong, China. 140 women 16 - 40 years of age requesting pregnancy termination at gestational ages of 14 - 20 weeks were allocated to receive either 1 mg of <b>gemeprost</b> every 3 hours up to 5 doses (n = 70) or 400 mcg of misoprostol every 3 hours up to 5 doses (n = 70). 56 women (80. 0 %) in the misoprostol group and 41 (58. 6 %) in the <b>gemeprost</b> group aborted within 24 hours. In primigravidas, the rate of successful abortion was significantly higher in the misoprostol group (83. 3 %) than the <b>gemeprost</b> group (55. 3 %). There were no significant between-group differences in this rate for multigravid women. The median induction-abortion interval was significantly shorter in the misoprostol group (14. 1 hours) than the <b>gemeprost</b> group (19. 5 hours). Blood loss during the procedure was similar in both groups. Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects, diarrhea was less common in misoprostol acceptors (24. 3 %) than in women who received <b>gemeprost</b> (40. 0 %). In addition to being more effective at inducing abortion, misoprostol is substantially less expensive than <b>gemeprost</b> and does not require refrigerated transport and storage facilities. Thus, misoprostol, with or without mifepristone, should be the drug of choice for termination of mid-trimester pregnancies. Further studies are needed, however, to determine the optimal dose and frequency of administration. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} randomized double-blind placebo-controlled {{trial was}} conducted in 70 subjects to determine whether pre-treatment with misoprostol could facilitate termination of second trimester pregnancy by <b>gemeprost.</b> The women received either 400 μg oral misoprostol or placebo tablets 12 hours before the administration of vaginal pessary of <b>gemeprost</b> 1 mg every 3 hours. There {{were no significant differences}} in induction-abortion interval and the amount of <b>gemeprost</b> required between the misoprostol and the placebo group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects or analgesic requirement between the two groups. We conclude that oral misoprostol is not useful in facilitating termination of second trimester pregnancy by <b>gemeprost.</b> | In Hong Kong, 70 healthy women aged 16 - 40 years at the gestational age of 14 - 20 weeks who requested legal termination of pregnancy were randomly allocated to receive either 400 mg misoprostol or a placebo (vitamin B 6) 12 hours before initial administration of intravaginal <b>gemeprost</b> pessary (1 mg) every three hours. This double-blind study aimed to determine whether pretreatment with oral misoprostol can improve the efficacy of intravaginal <b>gemeprost</b> pessary to effect induced abortion. The two groups responded essentially the same in terms of the incidence of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, breast tenderness, or lower abdominal pain during the interval between misoprostol administration and <b>gemeprost</b> administration. Similarly, side effects and analgesic requirements did not differ significantly. The complete abortion rate was not significantly different between the two groups (62. 9 % for misoprostol and 68. 6 % for placebo). Even though the induction-abortion interval was shorter and the amount of <b>gemeprost</b> required was smaller in the misoprostol group than the placebo group (27. 3 vs. 28. 2 hours and 4. 9 vs. 5. 7 mg, respectively), the differences were not significant (p = 0. 0863 and 0. 0957, respectively). These findings suggest that oral misoprostol does not facilitate termination of second trimester pregnancy by intravaginal <b>gemeprost</b> pessary. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of oral misoprostol versus vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> for cervical dilatation prior to vacuum aspiration was compared in {{women in the}} 6 th to 12 th week of pregnancy. Sixty-four nulliparous women requesting termination of pregnancy between 6 th to 12 th weeks of gestation were randomized to receive either 400 μg misoprostol orally or 1 mg vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> at 12 hr or 3 hr prior to vacuum aspiration, respectively. The cervical dilatation at vacuum aspiration, the ease of the subsequent surgical procedure, and the incidence of complications and side effects were compared between these two methods of cervical priming. The median cervical dilatation at vacuum aspiration in the misoprostol group was significantly greater than that in the <b>gemeprost</b> group (8. 0 mm versus 7. 0 mm, p< 0. 02). Preoperative side effects were significantly less frequent in the misoprostol group (p< 0. 01). The ease of dilatation assessed subjectively by the operating surgeons was also improved significantly in the misoprostol group (p< 0. 01). However, the duration of operation and blood loss were similar in both groups. Since misoprostol is also much cheaper and more convenient to use, we conclude that oral misoprostol is better than vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> for cervical dilatation prior to vacuum aspiration in first trimester pregnancy. | Given the importance of adequate cervical dilatation to vacuum aspiration abortion, the {{effectiveness of}} oral misoprostol and vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> was compared. The 64 study subjects, all in the first 6 - 12 weeks of pregnancy, were randomly assigned either to take 400 mcg of misoprostol the night before pregnancy termination or were given 50 mg of vitamin B 6 (placebo for misoprostol) to be taken {{the night before the}} procedure followed by vaginal insertion of 1 mg of <b>gemeprost</b> three hours preoperatively. Preoperative side-effects [...] nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and vaginal spotting [...] were significantly greater (p 0. 01) in the <b>gemeprost</b> group; 28 out of 32 women in the misoprostol group compared to only 17 out of 32 in the <b>gemeprost</b> group experienced no side effects. The mean baseline cervical dilatation of 8. 1 mm in the misoprostol group was significantly greater (p 0. 01) than that in the <b>gemeprost</b> group (7. 0 mm) and the ease of further dilatation was rated by surgeons as easier than normal for 87. 5 % of women in the former group compared to 59. 4 % in the latter group (p 0. 01). The duration of the procedure and mean blood loss were similar in both groups. In addition to being more effective than <b>gemeprost,</b> misoprostol is less expensive and stable at room temperature.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} <b>gemeprost</b> on utero-placental and luteal circulation and on the embryo/fetus in normal first trimester pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-seven women with a normal first trimester pregnancy requesting termination of pregnancy for psychosocial reasons were randomly allocated to pre-operative treatment with vaginal suppositories containing placebo or <b>gemeprost.</b> The women underwent transvaginal color and spectral Doppler ultrasound examination before {{the application of the}} suppository, 4 h after the application of the suppository but before the abortion, and on the seventh post-operative day. Blood flow velocities in the uterine and subchorionic arteries, the intrachorionic area and arteries in the wall of the corpus luteum and the embryonic/fetal heart rate were measured. RESULTS: The median value for pulsatility index (PI) in the dominant uterine artery was 2. 4 before treatment with <b>gemeprost</b> and 8. 5 4 h after treatment (P = 0. 0006); the corresponding values for time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMXV) being 27 cm/s and 10 cm/s (P = 0. 0006). Four (14 %) of 28 embryos/fetuses in the <b>gemeprost</b> group were dead 4 h after treatment with <b>gemeprost</b> and the median heart rate of those still alive was significantly lower than before treatment (130 vs. 163 bpm; P = 0. 003). In the placebo group, the results for the uterine arteries and the embryonic/fetal heart rate did not differ significantly {{between the first and second}} ultrasound examinations. The median values for PI and TAMXV in the arteries of the corpus luteum wall at the first ultrasound examination were 0. 71 and 18 cm/s, respectively, in the placebo group and 0. 71 and 20 cm/s, respectively, in the <b>gemeprost</b> group. These values remained almost unchanged at the second and third ultrasound examinations in both groups. CONCLUSION: <b>Gemeprost</b> has profound effects on utero-placental circulation in the first trimester and can induce embryonic/fetal bradycardia and sometimes embryonic/fetal demise.

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} of lower doses of mifepristone and <b>gemeprost</b> for medical induction of early abortion. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Participants were blinded as to the therapy and physicians to the dose of mifepristone. Setting: Thirteen hospital gynaecological units in different continents. Participants: 1224 healthy pregnant women requesting medical abortion at < 57 days from last menses. Intervention: Random allocation to one of four regimens: mifepristone 50 mg by mouth followed by either 0. 5 mg or 1. 0 mg <b>gemeprost</b> vaginally on day 3; mifepristone 200 mg by mouth followed by either 0. 5 mg or 1. 0 mg <b>gemeprost</b> vaginally. We concealed the allocation sequence from clinicians enrolling participants, and maintained double blinding throughout. Main outcome measures: Incidence of complete abortion; subordinate outcome measures included side effects such as vomiting and fall in haemoglobin, {{as well as the}} need for emergency curettage and blood transfusion. Results: The success rate was significantly related to the dose of mifepristone. The relative risk of failure to have a complete abortion with the lower dose of mifepristone was 1. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 1 - 2. 3) times that with the higher dose. The relative risk of failure with the lower dose of <b>gemeprost</b> (1. 3; 95 % CI: 0. 9 - 1. 8) did not reach statistical significance.

Women in group 1 were given 400 mcg of oral misoprostol every 3 hours up to five doses, while patients in group 2 were given 1 mg of vaginal <b>gemeprost</b> every 6 hours up to four doses. There was no significant difference in the median induction-abortion intervals or the incidence of side effects between the two groups of patients. The authors therefore conclude that misoprostol is as effective as <b>gemeprost</b> in terminating second trimester pregnancy when combined with mifepristone. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study of 72 second trimester pregnancy terminations using <b>gemeprost</b> vaginal pessary is reported. The success rate with {{this method of}} induced abortion was 93 %. The mean induction to abortion interval was 12. 6 hours. Minor side-effects such as fever, vomiting and diarrhoea occurred in 46 %, 10 %, and 18 % of patients, respectively. Major complications were uncommon. One patient had blood loss of more than 500 ml and one patient had genital tract trauma. It is our experience that <b>gemeprost</b> is a safe and efficient method for effecting a second trimester termination. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of prostaglandin analogues and mifepristone {{has changed the}} management of second trimester abortion in the last 2 decades. <b>Gemeprost</b> and misoprostol {{are the two most}} extensively studied prostaglandin analogues that are used in this period. The combination of either <b>gemeprost</b> or misoprostol with mifepristone is most effective. With these regimens, over 90 % of women abort within 24 hours and the mean induction to abortion interval is about 6 hours. Hifepristone is expensive and is not available in many countries. Therefore, prostaglandin analogue-only regimens might be the only option. These regimens are still effective with an abortion rate of > 90 % in 48 hours. However, the induction to abortion interval (15 hours) is much longer. Intra-cervical tents can be used to shorten the induction to abortion intervals. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Although prostaglandins {{are largely}} used and {{considered}} safe drugs to induce midtrimester abortion, the literature reports several cases of uterine rupture consequent to their administration. We report the second ever-described case of uterine rupture after administration of <b>gemeprost</b> and sulprostone for midtrimester abortion in a 45 years-old women with scarred uterus. She {{was admitted to}} our Unit for termination at 20 weeks' gestation because of trisomy 21 diagnosed by chromosomal analysis of amniotic liquid at 16 weeks' gestation. Five pessaries of <b>gemeprost</b> (one pessary, every 3 hours) were administered into the posterior vaginal fornix. Since the cervix remained closed and uneffaced, another cycle of 5 <b>gemeprost</b> administration was conducted. When the cervix changed in consistency and dilatation, we decided to administrate sulprostone. At the obstetric examination any visible fetus was evidenced. The abdominal ultrasonography showed an empty uterine cavity and the gestational sac with the dead fetus in abdomen. Emergency laparotomy was therefore undertaken. Primary suture of the ruptured uterus was initially attempted but in vain. Therefore, total abdominal hysterectomy was performed to control bleeding and eventual hypovolemic shock. Given the lack of strong evidence in literature {{and the fact that}} case reports are not an optimal method for assessing frequency of an event nor the overall risks of a procedure since they frequently report rare single events, other larger studies are needed to assess whether women with multiple risk factors (e. g. advanced age and previous uterine surgery), and administered with prostaglandins' association have a higher risk of uterine rupture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Acute {{pancreatitis}} rarely complicates pregnancy. Although most {{pregnant women}} with acute pancreatitis have associated gallstones, less common causes such as drugs have been reported. Case presentation We report {{the case of}} a 34 -year-old woman who underwent medical abortion with mifepristone and <b>gemeprost</b> and received codeine as pain-relief during the induction of abortion. She developed a severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis which required 14 days of intensive care. Other possible etiological factors, i. e. gallstone, alcohol intake and hyperlipidemia, were excluded.

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the changes in}} maternal serum and coelomic fluid biochemical composition following two different methods of cervical ripening, i. e. mechanical and biochemical, Each study group included 20 women between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation who were requesting termination for psychosocial reasons, In the first group, a 3 mm hypan (synthetic hygroscopic dilator) was inserted into the cenix 12 h preoperatively, In the second group, two 1 mg pessaries of <b>gemeprost</b> (prostaglandin analogue) were inserted into the posterior fornix 6 and 2 h preoperatively, Coelomic fluid and maternal serum were obtained {{at the time of}} the surgical procedure and assayed for urea, total protein, potassium, sodium, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Significantly higher coelomic fluid sodium (t = 4. 72; P = 0. 029) and significantly higher maternal serum AFP (t = 13. 21; P < 0. 001) concentrations were observed after <b>gemeprost</b> than after hypan, There was no difference in the concentration of potassium, urea, total protein and HCG between the two groups, These findings indicate that prostaglandin analogues, when used for cervical ripening, provoke a breakdown of the placental barrier resulting in an increase in AFP molecules transferred from the fetal fluid compartments into the maternal circulation, The results also suggest that these drugs increase the placental permeability to sodium with a secondary accumulation of this ion in the coelomic fluid...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Modern {{methods of}} {{medically}} induced abortions {{are being used}} in many countries all over the world. These methods are safe and effective when used in an appropriate way. Drugs used for medical abortion. The most widely used regimens for drug induced abortions include antiprogestogen mifepriston followed by administration of a synthetic prostaglandin analogue - <b>gemeprost</b> vaginally or misoprostol orally or vaginally. When used for abortions up to 9 and 7 weeks of pregnancy, this method has efficacy up to 98 %. The regimen between 9 and 12 completed weeks is still under investigation. Methods for medical abortion after 12 completed weeks since last menstrual period include several regimens and medications - combination of mifepriston and repeated doses of misoprostol, misoprostol or <b>gemeprost</b> alone, methotrexate, synthetic prostaglandin analogues, oxytocin and some others. Medical abortions at our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Novi Sad, Clinical Center Vojvodine, Serbia. Medical abortions in the second trimester were introduced at our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Novi Sad, Serbia, in early 1980 s using prostaglandin analogues. This method was improved in year 2000 introducing two dinoprostone gels intracervically/extraamnially instead of just one, for cervical preparation before intramuscular application of carboprost thrometamine, which led to significantly shorter abortion interval. During the years 2003 / 2004 we took part successfully {{in one of the}} multicentric WHO projects for investigating new regimens on early medical abortions with mifepriston and misoprostol. Conclusions. Modern methods of medical abortions are safe and effective for termination of unwanted pregnancies in the first and second trimester...|$|E
40|$|Placenta previa is an obstetric {{complication}} {{in which}} the placenta is attached over the lower uterine segment. When associated with placenta accreta, the risk of massive obstetric hemorrhage is increased. 1 The established risk factors for placenta accreta are prior cesarean delivery and placenta previa. 1 Despite extensive research on the management of placenta previa (including placenta accreta, increta, and percreta), 2 – 6 the number and quality of studies are limited. Moreover, termination of pregnancy (TOP) due to placenta accreta in the second trimester is rare, and the management of this condition is both controversial and rarely reported. We present a case of placenta accreta requiring a complicated induced second-trimester abortion because of premature rupture of the membranes (PROMs). We terminated the pregnancy using intravaginal <b>gemeprost.</b> During the termi...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of synthetic prostaglandin has revolutionized the treatment protocol for induction of second-trimester abortion and intrauterine death. <b>Gemeprost</b> {{is the only}} licensed synthetic prostaglandin analogue for second-trimester abortion in the United Kingdom. However, it is expensive {{and needs to be}} stored in a refrigerator. Misoprostol is marketed for use in the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcer. It is inexpensive and can be stored at room temperature. It has been widely used for induction of second-trimester abortion and intrauterine death. Misoprostol, 400 μg given vaginally every 3 hours, is probably the optimal regimen for second-trimester abortion. The combination of misoprostol and mifepristone significantly reduced the induction-to-abortion interval when compared with the misoprostol-only regimen. In addition, misoprostol can also be used as a cervical priming agent prior to dilatation and evacuation in second-trimester abortion. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
