50|$|Historically, <b>kimberlites</b> {{have been}} {{classified}} into two distinct varieties termed 'basaltic' and 'micaceous' {{based primarily on}} petrographic observations (Wagner, 1914). This was later revised by Smith (1983) who renamed these divisions Group I and Group II based on the isotopic affinities of these rocks using the Nd, Sr and Pb systems. Mitchell (1995) later proposed that these group I and II <b>kimberlites</b> display such distinct differences, {{that they may not}} be as closely related as once thought. He showed that Group II <b>kimberlites</b> show closer affinities to lamproites than they do to Group I <b>kimberlites.</b> Hence, he reclassified Group II <b>kimberlites</b> as orangeites to prevent confusion.|$|R

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and <b>kimberlite.</b> Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either <b>kimberlite</b> or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. <b>Kimberlite</b> deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the <b>kimberlites</b> and {{diamonds}} of the Ekati Diamond Mine, NWT, Canada, which lies in {{the central part of}} the canadian slave craton and is operated by the BHP Billiton Diamond Inc [...] 150 <b>kimberlites</b> were discovered at Ekati and five of them are mined for diamonds. The most Ekati <b>kimberlites</b> are pipe-like bodies and their age range from 45 to 75 Ma. Only a few of the 150 <b>kimberlites</b> are economically useful. For that reason, they need to be drilled and sampled by particular methods. The Ekati property exhibits exceptional diamond grades. Diamonds are formed by carbon – and waterrich melts or by low density fluids. Especially, the diamonds of 13 <b>kimberlites</b> at Ekati were studied. Thereby, three developed regional associations were established...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, a magma may pick up {{crystals}} that crystallized {{from another}} magma; these crystals are called xenocrysts. Diamonds found in <b>kimberlites</b> are rare but well-known xenocrysts; the <b>kimberlites</b> do not create the diamonds, but {{pick them up}} and transport them {{to the surface of}} the Earth.|$|R
5000|$|Rock {{considered}} lamprophyres {{are part}} of a [...] "clan" [...] of rocks, with similar mineralogy, textures and genesis. Lamprophyres are similar to lamproites and <b>kimberlites.</b> While modern concepts see orangeites, lamproites and <b>kimberlites</b> as separate, a vast majority of lamprophyres have similar origins to these other rock types.|$|R
5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their <b>kimberlite</b> or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 49% of {{diamonds}} originate from Central and Southern Africa, although significant {{sources of the}} mineral have been discovered in Canada, India, Russia, Brazil, and Australia. They are mined from <b>kimberlite</b> and lamproite volcanic pipes, which can bring diamond crystals, originating from deep within the Earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form, to the surface. The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as concerns over the sale of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds by African paramilitary groups. The diamond supply chain is controlled by {{a limited number of}} powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world.|$|E
25|$|The Cretaceous period 145-66 {{million years}} ago was a period for active <b>kimberlite</b> {{volcanism}} in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The Fort à la Corne <b>kimberlite</b> field in central Saskatchewan formed 104to 95{{million years ago}} during the Early Cretaceous. Unlike most <b>kimberlite</b> fields on Earth, the Fort à la Corne <b>kimberlite</b> field formed during more than one eruptive event. Its kimberlites {{are among the most}} complete examples on Earth, preserving <b>kimberlite</b> pipes and maar volcanoes. The Northern Alberta <b>kimberlite</b> province consists of three <b>kimberlite</b> fields known as the Birch Mountains, Buffalo Head Hills and the Mountain Lake cluster. The Birch Mountains <b>kimberlite</b> field consists of eight <b>kimberlite</b> pipes known as Phoenix, Dragon, Xena, Legend and Valkyrie, dating approximately 75million years old. The Buffalo Head Hills <b>kimberlite</b> field was dominated by explosive <b>kimberlite</b> volcanism from 88million years ago to 81million years ago, forming maars. Kimberlites of the Buffalo Head Hills field are similar to those associated with the Fort à la Corne <b>kimberlite</b> field in central Saskatchewan. The <b>kimberlite</b> pipes of the Mountain Lake cluster were formed during a similar timespan with the Birch Mountains field 77million years ago.|$|E

25|$|Kelsey Lake Diamond Mine is a defunct diamond mine in Colorado, USA. It {{is located}} in the State Line <b>Kimberlite</b> District, near the Wyoming border, and {{consists}} of nine <b>kimberlite</b> volcanic pipes, of which two were open pit mined.|$|E
25|$|Periods of {{volcanic}} activity occurred throughout central Canada during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The source for this volcanism was a long-lived and stationary area of molten rock called the New England or Great Meteor hotspot. The first event erupted <b>kimberlite</b> magma in the James Bay lowlands region of northern Ontario 180million years ago, creating the Attawapiskat <b>kimberlite</b> field. Another <b>kimberlite</b> event spanned {{a period of}} 13million years 165to 152million years ago, creating the Kirkland Lake <b>kimberlite</b> field in northeastern Ontario. Another period of <b>kimberlite</b> volcanism occurred in northeastern Ontario 154to 134million years ago, creating the Lake Timiskaming <b>kimberlite</b> field. As the North American Plate moved westward over the New England hotspot, the New England hotspot created the magma intrusions of the Monteregian Hills in Montreal in southern Quebec. These intrusive stocks have been variously interpreted as the feeder intrusions of long extinct volcanoes {{that would have been}} active 125million years ago, or as intrusions that never breached the surface in volcanic activity. The lack of a noticeable hotspot track west of the Monteregian Hills might be due either to failure of the New England mantle plume to pass through massive strong rock of the Canadian Shield, the lack of noticeable intrusions, or to strengthening of the New England mantle plume when it approached the Monteregian Hills region.|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of major, trace, and platinum-group element (PGE) {{compositions}} {{were determined}} for {{a suite of}} the Early Palaeozoic (ca. 465 Ma) Mengyin and Fuxian diamondiferous <b>kimberlites</b> from the eastern North China Craton to constrain the petrogenesis of these rocks and thus the mantle processes involved in their origin. Although the Chinese <b>kimberlites</b> are broadly similar to the <b>kimberlites</b> of South Africa (McDonald et al., 1995), there are significant compositional differences between the Mengyin and the Fuxian fields. The Mengyin <b>kimberlites</b> are more refractory (Mg# > 87, Ni = 1207 - 1786, Cr = 1991 - 4224) and more strongly enriched in LREE ((La/Yb) N = 265 - 517), but have lower Pd/Ir ratios (1. 26 - 2. 08) {{than those of the}} Fuxian field. The Mengyin <b>kimberlites</b> possess primitive, mantle-like Sr-Nd isotopic ratios. These features suggest that the Mengyin <b>kimberlites</b> formed from a mixture of carbonated asthenosphere and lithospheric keel with a minor contribution from a previously subduction-dehydrated oceanic slab. In contrast, the Fuxian <b>kimberlites</b> are less refractory (Mg# = 80 - 87, Ni = 971 - 1411, Cr = 1483 - 2285), less enriched in LREE ((La/Yb) N = 45 - 173) and have higher Pd/Ir ratios (1. 59 - 4. 24). Their lower εNd values (εNd ∼ - 2. 3) and large variations in Sr isotopic compositions suggest significant involvement of hydrothermally-altered and previously subduction-dehydrated oceanic lithosphere. Thus, we consider that the formation of the two <b>kimberlites</b> was related to the previously dehydrated subduction of an oceanic slab beneath the North China Craton in the Palaeozoic. The subduction of Palaeo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere in the south and/or subduction of the Mongolian Ocean lithosphere in the north could have initiated the destabilization of the eastern North China Craton. Melts released from the previously dehydrated subducted slab migrated and concentrated in regions of thermally perturbed asthenosphere and at the base of lithosphere keel, which in turn triggered the generation of kimberlitic magmas by a small degree of melting of the carbonated asthenosphere and the lithosphere keel. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|<b>Kimberlites</b> are {{peculiar}} {{igneous rocks}} because they contain {{a variety of}} mineral species with chemical compositions that indicate they formed under {{high pressure and temperature}} within the mantle. These minerals such as chromium diopside (a pyroxene), chromium spinels, magnesian ilmenite, and pyrope garnets rich in chromium, are generally absent from most other igneous rocks, making them particularly useful as indicators for <b>kimberlites.</b>|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} geological {{feature of the}} Williamson diamond mine is the <b>kimberlite</b> pipe on which it is located. At 146 square kilometers in area at surface level, it ranks as the largest economically exploitable diamond-bearing volcanic pipe in the world. Recent exploratory drill cores conducted by De Beers have indicated that the pipe is a pyroclastic <b>kimberlite,</b> not a hypabyssal <b>kimberlite</b> as earlier suspected. This indicates {{that it may be}} possible to extend the current 90-meter deep open pit to as much as 350 meters deep, and continue down even further with underground mining operations. However, a review of mine operations and long term plans continues.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the cause}} of the initial warming has been {{attributed}} to a massive injection of carbon (CO2 and/or CH4) into the atmosphere, the source of the carbon has yet to be found. The emplacement of a large cluster of <b>kimberlite</b> pipes at ~56 Ma in the Lac de Gras region of northern Canada may have provided the carbon that triggered early warming in the form of exsolved magmatic CO2. Calculations indicate that the estimated 900-1,100 Pg of carbon required for the initial ~3°C of ocean water warming associated with the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum could have been released during the emplacement of a large <b>kimberlite</b> cluster. The transfer of warm surface ocean water to intermediate depths led to thermal dissociation of seafloor methane hydrates, providing the isotopically depleted carbon that produced the carbon isotopic excursion. The coeval ages of two other <b>kimberlite</b> clusters in the Lac de Gras field and two other early Cenozoic hyperthermals indicate that CO2 degassing during <b>kimberlite</b> emplacement is a plausible source of the CO2 responsible for these sudden global warming events.|$|E
25|$|During the Early Jurassic period 196million years ago, the New England or Great Meteor hotspot {{existed in}} the Rankin Inlet area of {{southern}} Nunavut along the northwestern coast of Hudson Bay, producing <b>kimberlite</b> magmas.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a modification {{to the current}} IUGS classification system for igneous rocks to include ultramafic lamprophyres, which are currently entirely omitted. This is done by including a new step in the sequential system, after the assignment of pyroclastic rocks and carbonatites, that considers ultramafic inequigranular textured rocks with olivine and phlogopite macrocrysts and/or phenocrysts. At this step ultramafic lamprophyres are considered together with <b>kimberlites,</b> orangeites (former Group 2 <b>kimberlites)</b> and olivine lamproites. This proposal allows the correct identification and classification of ultramafic lamprophyres within the IUGS scheme. Only three end-members are required for describing the petrographic and com-positional continuum of ultramafic lamprophyres: alnöite (essential groundmass melilite), aillikite (essential primary carbonate) and damtjernite (essential groundmass nepheline and/or alkali feldspar). It is argued that all ultramafic lamprophyre rock types {{can be related to}} a common magma type which differs in important petrogenetic aspects from <b>kimberlites,</b> orangeites, olivine lamproites and the remainder of lamprophyres such as alkaline and calc-alkaline vari-eties. Ultramafic lamprophyres can be readily distinguished from olivine lamproites by the occurrence of primary carbonates, and from <b>kimberlites</b> by the presence of groundmass clinopyroxene. In other cases distinction between aillikites, <b>kimberlites</b> and orangeites must rely on mineral compositions in order to recognize their petrogenetic affinities.
