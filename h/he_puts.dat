5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's comedy Love's Last Shift (1696) is {{an early}} herald of a massive shift in {{audience}} taste, away from the intellectualism and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. According to Paul Parnell, Love's Last Shift illustrates Cibber's opportunism at {{a moment in time}} before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing.

5|$|Henry {{crossed the}} border in mid-August. Given-Wilson has noted the care Henry took not to ravage or pillage the {{countryside}} on their march through Berwickshire and Lothian. This was {{in marked contrast to}} previous expeditions, and Given-Wilson compares it specifically to the 'devastation wreacked' in last such campaign, by Richard II in 1385. This <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> this down to the presence in the English army of the earl of Dunbar, whose lands they were. Brown has suggested the king 'envisaged... a punitive expedition' with either a confrontation or such a chevauchée that the Scots would be eager to negotiate. In the event, they offered no resistance as the English army marched through Haddington.|$|E

5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
