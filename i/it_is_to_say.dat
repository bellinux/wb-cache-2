500|$|Hendrick Vroom explains, [...] "the term Maya [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} as 'illusion,' {{but then it}} does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' {{does not mean that}} the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned." [...] According to Wendy Doniger, [...] "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge." ...|$|E
500|$|Humor and irony are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} book. Mark Lawson of The Guardian considered the narrator's tone to be [...] "sardonic empath", and other critics have characterized {{the beginning of the}} novel as comical. When Cal is baptized as an infant by Father Mike, a Greek Orthodox clergyman, the priest receives a surprise: [...] "From between my cherubic legs a stream of crystalline liquid shot into the air ... Propelled by a full bladder, it cleared the lip of the font ... struck Father Mike {{right in the middle of}} the face." [...] Derek Weiler of the Toronto Star noted that Eugenides has witty commentary about German compound words and the [...] "horrific qualities of public men's rooms". The author employed another writing deviceabrupt incongruityin describing Desdemona's physical appearances to suggest that her incestuous acts should be taken lightly when judging her. In describing her hair, he wrote that her [...] "braids were not delicate like a little girl's but heavy and womanly, possessing a natural power, like a beaver's tail". According to Penelope Music of Book Magazine, the mismatch in tone of the final two words compared with the rest of the sentence was such that the reading experience was changed from [...] "run-of-the-mill magical realism to true, subversive comedy". An instance of irony is illustrated by Cal's grandparents and parents: His grandparents assimilate into American culture through hard work and struggles while retaining certain old customs. His parents, however, abandon their roots for a more comfortable lifestyle. In another incident, the diner owned by the Stephanides is engulfed in flames during the 1967 Detroit riot. Cal notes that [...] "hameful as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the riots were the best thing that ever happened to us." [...] The diner was insured and the Stephanides gain a windfall payout.|$|E

And I would have a small but very aggressive anti-terrorism agency. And I would frankly give them extraordinary ability to eavesdrop. And my first advice to civil libertarians is simple.

2500|$|When Henry Jackman was in {{the running}} to score Captain America: The First Avenger, he had written [...] "a full-on {{traditional}} symphonic, Americana score" [...] as proof-of-concept for Marvel, which he looked to return to when Marvel asked him to score the sequel, [...] He felt that Silvestri had used that same style to great effect in the first film, but found that the second film [...] "could {{not have been more}} different, and the score was not suitable, so I had to rewrite it". Jackman said of his work on the film, [...] "it’s 50% production and all the tricks I’ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it’s also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece". He described the film as aesthetically [...] "way closer to something like Dark Knight Rises than <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the Richard Donner's Superman, or the traditional, nostalgic superhero film." [...] Some of Silvestri's work from the first film is tracked into the opening of the sequel, which Jackman said [...] "reminds everyone where we left off. This character is about to get hurled into a completely different environment, so it’s a nice way to tie the two films together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Arab–Israeli conflict, in a January 2012 Republican debate, Romney said, [...] "Well, {{the reason}} that there’s not peace between the Palestinians and Israel is because there is — in the {{leadership}} of the Palestinian people are Hamas and others who think like Hamas, who have as their intent the elimination of Israel. And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state." [...] Romney added, [...] "There are some people who say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and appease, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel." [...] Despite his pessimism about a two-state solution being achieved in the short term, Romney has defended the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict as an ideal that ought {{to be included in the}} Republican Party platform.|$|E

2500|$|Gordon Dahlquist of The Kubrick FAQ {{argues that}} the name change [...] "deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July Fourth photo. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous {{situation}} {{and the man who}} has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may {{have had a chance to}} escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to." [...] Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; [...] "I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [...] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'." ...|$|E
