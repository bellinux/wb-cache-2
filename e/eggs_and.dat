5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays <b>eggs,</b> <b>and</b> also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying <b>eggs,</b> <b>and</b> lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E
5|$|The <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> nymphs {{are under}} attack by parasitoids {{including}} blow flies, flesh flies, and tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites. Female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> thus have fewer offspring than unaffected individuals.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E

5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> chicks. The <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|E

5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain salamander (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding the <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> guarding them from predation as the embryos {{feed on the}} yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break {{their way out of}} the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E

The leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), Subantarctic fur seal (A. tropicalis), and killer whale (Orcinus orca) sometimes hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water. Colonies suffer low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally only take <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> young that have been left unattended or deserted.

5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles.

Rice rats also eat <b>eggs</b> <b>and</b> young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E

40|$|Proteins of {{the signal}} {{crayfish}} Pacifastacus leniusculus <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> spermatophore were identified using in-gel digestion, mass spectrometry, and Mascot search. Forty-one and one-hundred-fifty proteins were identified in <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> spermatophore, respectively. The proteins were classified into nine categories including cell defence, cell signaling, cytoskeleton, DNA related activity, metabolism and energy production, protease and protease inhibitor, respiration, transportation, and others and unknown. Twenty-two proteins were found in both <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> spermatophore. The respiration and cytoskeleton groups are the most diverse categories in the protein profiles of the <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> spermatophore, respectively. No protein was assigned to DNA related activity and cell defence categories in the protein profile of the crayfish egg. Differences between protein profiles of the crayfish <b>egg</b> <b>and</b> spermatophore show different functional priorities for each of gametes. Several proteins having possible roles in gametogenesis, capacitation, acrosome reaction, and fertilization were identified. This proteomic profile of signal crayfish gametes provides a basis for further investigation of functional roles of the identified proteins in aspects of reproduction such as capacitation and fertilization...|$|R
