In turn, Hayekian {{criticism}} of this theory affirms that this knowledge {{is the result}} of the competitive process, and therefore cannot be considered as a given. The "Hayek Problem" investigates the conditions under which agents knowledge approaches the true <b>fundamentals</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>economy.</b> In order to solve this problem, our paper uses ideas taken from the methodology of science known as the "growth of knowledge" theory (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos and others). These ideas are used to understand how agents knowledge evolves, especially the knowledge of entrepreneurs. These are seen as active formulators of conjectural entrepreneurial theories that are criticized in the competitive process, and not as passive agents that maximize already known functions as in conventional theory. We use philosophy of science not to methodologically analyze microeconomics, but as an analytical tool that is part of economic theory. microeconomics, entrepreneurship, methodology, Hayek, Popper...|$|E

In this paper, we favor another vision of innovation, as a discovery process that cannot allow ex ante a definition of best practices. Dealing with information issues in two different and alternative perspectives, we argue that antitrust authorities confront a market imperfection– market failure dilemma (MI–MF dilemma) which leads them to favor the existence of appreciative and discretionary policy rather than encouraging the existence of any market structure thought of as optimal as regards the current state of information.

A formal model is sketched around a utility function that includes money as an asset held in both local currency and foreign exchange. Given a steady stream of money supply, asset-price considerations in a free currency market make a fixed exchange rate untenable for the local currency and lead to devaluation and to crisis. Impressionistic evidence from the recent experience of financial crises corroborates the hypothesis of currency substitution.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the conditions under}} which multiple equilibria due to coordination failure can be ruled out when individual agents have noisy signals about the <b>fundamentals</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>economy.</b> Morris and Shin (1998) study a model of currency crisis where, with common knowledge of fundamentals, self-fulfilling currency attacks lead to multiple equilibria. They show that even a small amount of noise about fundamentals yields a unique equilibrium. The insights generated by their paper extends to other market situations where multiple equilibria may exist due to coordination failures. Our purpose here is to address this challenge to models with self-fulfilling multiple equilibria by studying the robustness of the uniqueness result with noisy signals about fundamentals. We show that even with noisy signals on the quality of a bank’s assets multiple equilibria exist in models of banking. We argue that {{the conditions under which}} this happens arise naturally in models of banking. In particular, when the proportion of early withdrawal is high, a bank may decide to defend itself by liquidating some of its long-term assets or borrowing from the outside third party to pay for withdrawal demand. Under these circumstances, we show that banks will decide to collapse regardless of fundamentals when (a) the credit rationing in the market for bank loans is severe, (b) the cost of bank loans is high, or (c) there is a high cost of early liquidation. In all these cases, multiple equilibria persist. Further, we show that our model of banking can be derived as a reduced form version of Diamond and Dybvig (1983) ’s model of banking...|$|E

Private equity capital is <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> feature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> capitalist <b>economy.</b> However the aggregation of large amounts of private funds to participate in PPPs/PFIs represents a new trend that should be monitored by public managers as they negotiate PPPs at the contract formation and contract management stages of such arrangements.

40|$|The paper {{sets out}} to {{evaluate}} the performance in terms of poverty alleviation of conventional labour market and social policies and arrangements {{in the era of}} globalised labour markets. To this end, it develops a framework based on five policy evaluation principles, centred on the normative notion of social justice, whereby the expansion of full freedom requires basic economic security for all. It concludes that most of the labour market interventions reviewed have suffered from common failures such as lack of transparency and accountability, high costs, chronic inefficiency in terms of misused resources and ineffective targeting, thus failing most of the time to reach the poorest and to reduce inequalities in labour markets. They rarely meet any of the policy evaluation principles proposed in the paper. Yet, countries are still encouraged to use these conventional policies, which were developed in the context of industrialised countries. The message is, thus, that not too much can be expected from labour market policies. These policies may help in making labour markets function better but their contribution towards overcoming poverty and economic insecurity can only be limited. Labour markets are part of the broader economic system: policymakers should look to social policies {{in order to deal with}} poverty and the misdistribution of income rather than expect labour markets to deal with these <b>fundamental</b> features <b>of</b> <b>a</b> market <b>economy.</b> ...|$|R

Since the Crimean War (1854-56), the demand for grain had pushed up the price of Algerian wheat to European levels. Storage silos were emptied when the world market's impact was felt in Algeria, and Muslim farmers sold their grain reserves — including seed grain — to speculators. But the community-owned silos were the <b>fundamental</b> adaptation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subsistence <b>economy</b> to <b>an</b> unpredictable climate, and a good year's surplus was stored away against a bad year's dearth. When serious drought struck Algeria and grain crops failed in 1866 and for several years following, Muslim areas faced starvation, and with famine came pestilence. It was estimated that 20% of the Muslim population of Constantine died over a three-year period. In 1871 the civil authorities repudiated guarantees made to tribal chieftains by the previous military government for loans to replenish their seed supply. This act alienated even pro-French Muslim leaders, while it undercut their ability to control their people. It was against this background that the stricken Kabyles rose in revolt, following immediately on the mutiny in January 1871 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> squadron <b>of</b> Muslim spahis in the French Army who had been ordered to embark for France.

As the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research Senator Kim Carr is painfully aware, the situation is serious and the ramifications for the Australian standard of living will be felt, perhaps not immediately, but in the years and decades to come as countries which have invested more successfully in the <b>fundamentals</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> innovative <b>economy</b> surpass us and relegate us to middle income status in the world. The bad news is that the lacklustre state of our innovation system {{does not appear to have}} turned the corner. According to the recently released IBM Melbourne Institute Innovation Index, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s innovative performance grew by only 0. 7 per cent in 2006, a figure which is around one-third of our long-term average growth rate. This index covers <b>a</b> wide range <b>of</b> innovation activities from R&D expenditure, to patents and organization innovation. Although we don 2 ̆ 7 t know what the optimal innovation growth rate is, the fact that Australia?s innovative activity has fallen as the economy has softened should have alarm bells ringing. This slowing down of the intensity of innovation (that is, innovation as <b>a</b> proportion <b>of</b> overall economic activity) is consistent with the academic literature which finds that innovation is pro-cyclical. That is, innovation moves in concert with the business cycle. The simple reason for this is that innovation is risky ? that is, many innovation investments ?fail? in the sense that they do not result in any tangible output. When aggregate demand softens, firms tend to contract their investment in risky innovative activities. The good news is that some industries performed well in the Innovation Index. In particular, the mining, communication, and finance and insurance industries all performed well above the average. However, this is tempered by the fact that innovation in key industries such as manufacturing, construction, and business services slumped. This is a concern for the government, especially Minister Carr, who has explicitly (and with good reason) identified manufacturing as a key industry in Australia since there are substantial opportunities for Australia to exploit value-adding opportunities in the manufacturing sector. Recognizing that there is a need to improve our game is a necessary but not sufficient condition for succeeding. We must know which policies are successful: Should we increase the level of public sector research spending? Should we put more resources into public-private sector collaborations? What are the most cost effective policies to aid the commercialisation pathway? And so on? Unfortunately, we do not at the moment have the scientific evidence with which to answer this raft of questions. There is <b>an</b> abundance <b>of</b> anecdotal evidence on what worked for one company or one project, but we do not have results that we can generalize to the whole of Australia. If the government is serious about evidence-based policy formulation on innovation, then it needs to stimulate research on these issues. Moreover, we have limited (and now dated) information on the success of the R&D tax concession. The key question to answer here is whether the concession just subsidises R&D activity that would have occurred any way? We also don 2 ̆ 7 t know whether the use of public money to subsidise public-private collaborations has been necessary for successful commercialisation. We do not know whether we should be spreading public money broadly on <b>a</b> multitude <b>of</b> technologies and industries or whether we should behave more strategically, as countries such as Singapore and Israel have done. Although the final recommendations of the Review are still unknown, the early indications are that the government will look to ways to stimulate further private R&D expenditure and to enhance the synergies between public R&D and industry. And although the devil may be in the detail, it 2 ̆ 7 s encouraging to see that the federal government after only nine months in office is clearly on the front foot with regard to putting innovation policy on the agenda.
