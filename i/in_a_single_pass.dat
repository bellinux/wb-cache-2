The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member.

2500|$|Operated a {{powerful}} Canadian made RIG-421 oil drilling rig operated by Calgary-based Precision Drilling Corporation.

The rig, normally used for oil and gas well drilling, could theoretically drill a wide enough escape shaft <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>pass</b> without a pilot hole. RIG-421 is a [...] tall Diesel-Electric Triple, which needed 40 truckloads to bring its components from Iquique, Chile, to Copiapó. Chosen for the rescue operation because it can drill large holes deep into the ground and is faster than mining drills, this plan suffered major setbacks due to the difficulty of aiming a large drill at such a small target. Furthermore, the hardness of the rock caused the drill bit to wander from its intended course and it then needed to be removed, resized and repositioned, slowing drilling progress. Many family members of the miners initially had high hopes for this rig, but it was forced to reduce its drill size and so lagged behind the other attempts.|$|E
