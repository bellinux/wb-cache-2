40|$|ABSTRACT Certain of the {{metabolic}} events associated with anaerobic sodium transport by the isolated bladder of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>turtle</b> have been investigated. The {{data suggest that}} energy for this transport arises from glycolysis and that endogenous glycogen was the major and perhaps the sole source of substrate. The rate of anaerobic glycolysis, as determined by lactate formation, correlates well with the rate as determined by glycogen utilization. Using lactate formation as the index of anaerobic glycolysis, a linear relationship was observed between glycolysis and net anaerobic sodium transport. In the absence of sodium transport, glycolysis decreased by approximately 45 per cent. Tissue ATP concentrations were maintained {{at about the same}} level under anaerobic as under aerobic conditions. Finally if it is assumed that in the conversion of glycogen to lactate anaerobically, 3 moles of ATP are generated per mole of glucose residue, an average of over 15 equivalents of sodium were transported for every mole of ATP generated. The urinary bladder of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>turtle</b> is among the specialized biologic membranes that actively transport sodium transcellularly in vitro. However, in contrast to similar structures such as the proximal renal tubule, the frog skin, and the toad bladder, the turtle bladder transports sodium (transepithelially) almost as well in the absence of oxygen as in its presence (1). Presumably, therefore, glycolysis {{plays a major role in}} the synthesis of free energy for anaerobic electrolyte transport. In the present studies, an effort has been made to define the quantitative relationships between anaerobic glycolysis and anaerobic sodium transport in the isolated turtle bladder. Because glycolysis is a more primitive, and certainly less complex, pathway for energy production than mitochondriallinked oxidative pathways, investigation of the turtle bladder could contribute importantly to the understanding of the coupling between metabolic energy and active transport...|$|E

40|$|Protecting {{the natural}} {{environment}} while fostering local development {{is one of the}} main challenges that engineers face today. New species are added to the federally threatened and endangered species lists as their habitats are altered or destroyed by development. The bog turtle (clemmys muhlenbergii) is threatened by new development that damages not only its wetland habitat, but the upland areas that store and discharge water into the wetlands. The bog turtle is one of the smallest North American turtles with the adults reaching only 10 to 11 centimeters in length. They are a <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>turtle</b> that inhabits open wet meadows, shallow water marshes, spring seeps, flood plain wetlands, bogs, and fens. Destruction of habitat and illegal capture have caused significant declines in turtle populations. The bog turtle was listed as federally threatened in 1997. Protection of bog turtle habitat is a concern to many state and local governments because the bog turtle’s habitat is often located in prime land slated for commercial, residential, and transportation related development. Until recently, there was little information available about the source water that feeds these wetland habitats. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA), in conjunction with other Maryland and federal agencies, has formed a biological assessment team in order to develop a protection plan for one such bog turtle habitat by investigating the hydrology associated with bog turtle habitats...|$|E
40|$|Dinitrophenol (1 x 10 - 5 M) {{has been}} found to inhibit {{anaerobic}} sodium transport by the isolated urinary bladder of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>turtle.</b> Concurrently, anaerobic glycolysis was stimulated markedly. However, tissue ATP levels diminished only modestly, remaining at approximately 75 % of values observed under anaerobic conditions without DNP. The utilization of glucose (from endogenous glycogen) corresponded closely to that predicted from the molar quantities of lactate formed. Thus the glycolytic pathway was completed in the presence of DNP and if ATP were synthesized normally during glycolysis, synthesis should have been increased. On the other hand, the decrease in Na transport should have decreased ATP utilization. Oligomycin did not block sodium transport either aerobically or anaerobically, but ATP concentrations did decrease. When anaerobic glycolysis was blocked by iodoacetate, pyruvate did not sustain sodium transport thus suggesting that no electron acceptors were available in the system. Two explanations are entertained for the anaerobic effect of DNP: (a) Stimulation by DNP of plasma membrane as well as mitochondrial ATPase activity; (b) inhibition of a high energy intermediate derived from glycolytic ATP or from glycolysis per se. The arguments relevant to each possibility are presented in the text. Although definitive resolution is not possible, we believe that the data favor the hypothesis that there was a high energy intermediate in the anaerobic system and that this intermediate, rather than ATP, served as the immediate source of energy for the sodium pump...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA mammalian-like {{melanopsin}} (Opn 4 m) {{has been}} found in all major vertebrate classes except reptile. Since the pupillary light reflex (PLR) of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>turtle</b> takes between 5 and 10 min to achieve maximum constriction, and since photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in mammals use Opn 4 m to control their slow sustained pupil responses, we hypothesized that a Opn 4 m homolog exists in the retina of the turtle. To identify its presence, retinal tissue was dissected from seven turtles, and total RNA extracted. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) were carried out to amplify gene sequences using primers targeting the highly conserved core region of Opn 4 m, and PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and sequenced. Sequences derived from a 1004 -bp PCR product were compared to those stored in GenBank by the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) algorithm and returned significant matches to several Opn 4 ms from other vertebrates including chicken. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was also carried out to compare expression levels of Opn 4 m in different tissues. The normalized expression level of Opn 4 m in the retina was higher in comparison to other tissue types: iris, liver, lung, and skeletal muscle. The results suggest that Opn 4 m exists in the retina of the turtle and provides a possible explanation for the presence of a slow PLR. The turtle {{is likely to be a}} useful model for further understanding the photoreceptive mechanisms in the retina which control the dynamics of the PLR...|$|E
