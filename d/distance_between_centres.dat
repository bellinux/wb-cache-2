40|$|The {{influence}} that distance from markets has upon remote economies, particularly {{as it relates}} to developed economies, remains under researched and lacks a theoretical base. The influence of distance and small size often has a compounding effect which places small, remote countries at a disadvantage in relation to many types of products and services. This paper contributes to the literature on this topic by proposing that {{there are two types of}} distance that influence business location and operational decisions. The first of these is physical distance, which is closely related to the geographic <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centres.</b> This is the way that distance has traditionally been viewed. The second is social distance, which relates to the advantages obtained from being close to sources of socially embedded communication. These types of distance form two dimensions which may be used to construct a two by two matrix. The resulting four quadrants assist in clarifying the effects of the different types of distance have upon on a diverse range of products, industries and businesses. The paper highlights that distance is not a simple one-dimensional relationship. By identifying the different types of distance greater understanding of it effects may be obtained...|$|E

40|$|Background Cellulose from {{grasses and}} cereals makes {{up much of}} the {{potential}} raw material for biofuel production. It is not clear if cellulose microfibrils from grasses and cereals differ in structure from those of other plants. The structures of the highly oriented cellulose microfibrils in the cell walls of the internodes of the bamboo Pseudosasa amabilis are reported. Strong orientation facilitated {{the use of a}} range of scattering techniques. Results Small-angle neutron scattering provided evidence of extensive aggregation by hydrogen bonding through the hydrophilic edges of the sheets of chains. The microfibrils had a mean centre-to-centre distance of 3. 0 nm in the dry state, expanding on hydration. The expansion on hydration suggests that this <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> was through the hydrophilic faces of adjacent microfibrils. However in the other direction, perpendicular to the sheets of chains, the mean, disorder-corrected Scherrer dimension from wide-angle X-ray scattering was 3. 8 nm. It is possible that this dimension is increased by twinning (crystallographic coalescence) of thinner microfibrils over part of their length, through the hydrophobic faces. The wide-angle scattering data also showed that the microfibrils had a relatively large intersheet d-spacing and small monoclinic angle, features normally considered characteristic of primary-wall cellulose. Conclusions Bamboo microfibrils have features found in both primary-wall and secondary-wall cellulose, but are crystallographically coalescent {{to a greater extent than}} is common in celluloses from other plants. The extensive aggregation and local coalescence of the microfibrils are likely to have parallels in other grass and cereal species and to influence the accessibility of cellulose to degradative enzymes during conversion to liquid biofuels...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{numerical}} modeling of conjugate heat transfer in an IGU with account for its deformation caused by excessive negative {{pressure in the}} glazing cavity are presented in the article. The influence of the IGU glass pane deformation on thermal characteristics and gas flow regime within the cavity are studied. A method of assessment of reduced thermal resistance of IGU is provided. The effects of different climatic impacts lead to the deformation of glasses within an IGU (and its vertical cavity, respectively). Deformation of glasses and vertical cavities reduces the thermal resistance of an IGU. A numerical simulation of conjugate heat transfer within an IGU was implemented {{as part of the}} research into this phenomenon. Calculations were performed in ANSYS FLUENT CFD package. Basic equations describing the conservation of mass, conservation of momentum (in the Boussinesq approximation), conservation of energy were solved. Also, the radiation of the cavity wall was taken into account. Vertical walls were considered as non-isothermal, while horizontal walls were adiabatic. Calculations were made for several patterns of glass deformations. Calculation results demonstrate that the heat flow over vertical walls intensifies as the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> of IGU glasses is reduced. The temperature in the central area of the hot glass drops.

40|$|To {{determine}} delivered dose to {{the spinal}} cord, a technique {{has been developed}} to propagate manual contours from kilovoltage computed-tomography (kVCT) scans for treatment planning to megavoltage computed-tomography (MVCT) guidance scans. The technique uses the Elastix software to perform intensity-based deformable image registration of each kVCT scan to the associated MVCT scans. The registration transform is then applied to contours of the spinal cord drawn manually on the kVCT scan, to obtain contour positions on the MVCT scans. Diﬀerent registration strategies have been investigated, with performance evaluated by comparing the resulting auto-contours with manual contours, drawn by oncologists. The comparison metrics include the conformity index (CI), and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> (DBC). With optimised registration, auto-contours generally agree well with manual contours. Considering all 30 MVCT scans for each of 3 patients, the median CI is 0. 759 ± 0. 003, and the median DBC is (0. 87 ± 0. 01) mm. An intra-observer comparison for the same scans gives a median CI of 0. 820 ± 0. 002 and a DBC of (0. 64 ± 0. 01) mm. Good levels of conformity are also obtained when auto-contours are compared with manual contours from one observer for a single MVCT scan for each of 30 patients, {{and when they are}} compared with manual contours from six observers for two MVCT scans for each of 3 patients. Using the auto-contours to estimate organ position at treatment time, a preliminary study of 33 patients who underwent radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancers indicates good agreement between planned and delivered dose to the spinal cord.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamical}} {{properties of the}} homogeneous shear flow of inelastic dumbbells in two dimensions {{as a first step}} towards examining the effect of shape on the properties of flowing granular materials. The dumbbells are modelled as smooth fused disks characterized by the ratio of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> (L) and the disk diameter (D), with an aspect ratio (L/D) varying between 0 and 1 in our simulations. Area fractions studied are in the range 0. 1 - 0. 7, while coefficients of normal restitution (e(n)) from 0. 99 to 0. 7 are considered. The simulations use a modified form of the event-driven methodology for circular disks. The average orientation is characterized by an order parameter S, which varies between 0 (for a perfectly disordered fluid) and 1 (for a fluid with the axes of all dumbbells in the same direction). We investigate power-law fits of S as a function of (L D) and (1 - e(n) (2)) There is a gradual increase in ordering as the area fraction is increased, as the aspect ratio is increased or as the coefficient of restitution is decreased. The order parameter has a maximum value of about 0. 5 for the highest area fraction and lowest coefficient of restitution considered here. The mean energy of the velocity fluctuations in the flow direction is higher than that in the gradient direction and the rotational energy, though the difference decreases as the area fraction increases, due to the efficient collisional transfer of energy between the three directions. The distributions of the translational and rotational velocities are Gaussian to a very good approximation. The pressure is found to be remarkably independent of the coefficient of restitution. The pressure and dissipation rate show relatively little variation when scaled by the collision frequency for all the area fractions studied here, indicating that the collision frequency determines the momentum transport and energy dissipation, even at the lowest area fractions studied here. The mean angular velocity of the particles is equal to half the vorticity at low area fractions, but the magnitude systematically decreases to less than half the vorticity as the area fraction is increased, even though the stress tensor is symmetric...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The primary {{somatosensory}} cortex (SI) contains Brodmann areas (BA) 1, 2, 3 a, and 3 b. Research in non-human primates showed that BAs 3 b, 1, and 2 each contain one full {{representation of the}} hand with separate representations for each finger. This research also showed that the finger representation in BA 3 b has larger and clearer finger somatotopy than BA 1 and 2. Although several efforts to map finger somatotopy in SI by fMRI have been made at 1. 5 and 3 T these studies have yielded variable results and {{were not able to}} detect single subject finger somatotopy, probably due to the limited spatial extent of the cortical areas representing a digit (close to the resolution in most fMRI experiments), complications due to acquisition of consistent maps for individual subjects (Schweizer et al 2008), or inter-individual variability in sulcal anatomy impeding group studies. Here, we used 7 T fMRI to investigate finger somatotopy in SI, some of its functional characteristics, and its reproducibility. Methods: Eight right-handed male subjects were scanned on a 7 T scanner (Siemens Medical, Germany) with an 8 -channel Tx/Rx rf-coil (Rapid Biomedical, Germany). 1. 3 x 1. 3 x 1. 3 mm 3 resolution fMRI data were acquired using a sinusoidal readout EPI sequence (Speck et al, 2008) and FOV= 210 mm, TE/TR= 27 ms/ 2. 5 s, GRAPPA= 2. Each volume contained 28 transverse slices covering SI. A single EPI volume with 64 slices was acquired to aid coregistration. 1 x 1 x 1 mm 3 anatomical data were acquire using the MP 2 RAGE sequence (Marques et al, 2009; TE/TR/TI 1, 2 /TRmprage= 2. 63 ms/ 7. 2 ms/ 0. 9, 3. 2 s/ 5 s). Subjects were positioned supine in the scanner with their right arm comfortably against the magnet bore. An experimenter was positioned at the entrance of the bore where he could easily reach and stroke successively the two distal phalanxes of each digit. The order of stroked digit was D 1 (thumb) -D 3 -D 5 -D 2 -D 4, with 20 s ON, 10 s OFF alternated. This sequence was repeated four times per run and two functional runs were acquired per subject. Realignment, smoothing (FWHM 2 mm), coregistration of the anatomical to the fMRI data and calculation of t-statistics were done using SPM 8. An SI mask was obtained via an F-contrast (p< 0. 001) over all digits. Within the mask, voxels were labeled with the number of the digit demonstrating the highest t-value for that particular voxel. Results: For all subjects, areas corresponding to the five digits were identified in contralateral SI. BA 3 b showed the most consistent somatotopic finger representation (see an example in Fig. 1). The five digits were localized in a consecutive order in the cortex, with D 1 most anterior, inferior and distal and D 5, most posterior, superior and medial (mean <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>centres</b> of mass of digit representations ±stderr: 4. 2 ± 0. 7 mm; see Fig. 2). The analysis of average beta values within each finger representation region revealed the specificity of the somatotopic region to the tactile input for each tested finger (except digit 4 and 5). Five of these subjects also presented an orderly and consecutive representation of the five digits in BA 1 and 2. Conclusions: Our data reveal that the increased BOLD sensitivity at 7 T and the high spatial resolution used in this study allow consistent somatotopic mapping using human touch as a stimulus and that human SI contains at least three separate regions that contain five separate representations of all single contralateral fingers. Moreover, adjacent fingers were represented at adjacent cortical regions across the three SI regions. The spatial organization of SI as reflected in individual subject topography corresponds well with previous electrophysiological data in non-human primates. The small distance between digit representations highlights the need for the high spatial resolution available at 7 T...|$|E
