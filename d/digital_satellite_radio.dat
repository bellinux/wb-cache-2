50|$|During this period, {{efforts to}} convert over-the-air AM and FM radio to digital {{technology}} failed. A technique known as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) (see Countries using DAB/DMB), {{was introduced to}} Canada in November 1999.

When the technology was introduced, there were few listeners equipped with DAB receivers, and this in turn provided little incentive for broadcasters to convert their very successful AM and FM operations to DAB. DAB came to an end in Canada in 2010. However <b>digital</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>radio</b> has been successful.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{complex-valued}} {{neural network}} based on adaptive activation functions is proposed. By varying the control points {{of a pair}} of Catmull–Rom cubic splines, which are used as an adaptable activation function, this new kind of neural network can be implemented as a very simple structure that is able to improve the generalization capabilities using few training samples. Due to its low architectural complexity (low overhead with respect to a simple FIR filter), this network can be used to cope with several nonlinear DSP problems at a high symbol rate. In particular, this work addresses the problem of nonlinear channel equalization. In fact, although several authors have already recognized the usefulness of a neural network as a channel equalizer, one problem has not yet been addressed: the high complexity and the very long data sequence needed to train the network. Several experimental results using a realistic channel model are reported that prove the effectiveness of the proposed network on equalizing a <b>digital</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>radio</b> link in the presence of noise, nonlinearities, and intersymbol interference (ISI).

40|$|Lagging {{behind the}} audio and {{telecommunication}} industries since the digital {{revolution in the}} early 80 s, digital radio now looks set to succeed the role of analogue radio and has hit across the entire spectrums. The Eureka- 147 DAB standard, first introduced in Europe in the early 1990 s, was developed to replace FM. On the other hand, the IBOC-based HD Radio developed for the US market provides radio broadcasters an opportunity to offer additional services in digital along with their AM or FM service. In Japan, the ISDB-T was designed to deliver both radio and television programmes. DRM, which was launched {{since the beginning of}} the new millennium, is another digital technology for radio broadcasting bands below 120 MHz. Besides terrestrial digital radio, several <b>digital</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>radio</b> services were launched over the past few years that include WorldSpace, XM and Sirius Radio.

40|$|A {{herdsman}} in the semi-desert {{region of}} northern Niger winds up his radio and tunes {{in to the}} daily weather report, {{in the hope that}} it will help him find suitable grazing pasture for his cattle. The programme, broadcast by a community-owned FM radio station in a village some 15 km away, is based on information downloaded via a <b>digital</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>radio</b> receiver. The same broadcast also features a request for assistance from another herdsman who has lost some of his animals. Later that day the station broadcasts discussions on health issues in four local languages. The sun is setting, but for a few more hours the solar-powered transmitter will still be able to broadcast local music, national news, and messages from migrants to loved ones at home. This scenario is the goal of RANET (Rural Communications using Radio and the Internet), an international collaboration that is helping to make weather, climate and related information accessible to communities in remotest areas of Africa, Asia and the Pacific. RANET works with national meteorological services to improve their outreach to rural communities, which will ultimately strengthen the agencies themselves. In addition, the programme forms partnerships with local NGOs and other development organizations to ensure that the information in the community radio broadcasts is relevant {{to the needs of the}} local population, and that it will help them to cope with adverse weather, and improve their livelihoods. RANET is often associated with the WorldSpace digital satellite system, which enables audio broadcasts and one-way data transfers to anywhere in Africa, Asia and the western Pacific. Working through First Voice International (formerly the WorldSpace Foundation) RANET uses reserve capacity on the satellite system to transmit current weather information including maps and charts to weather stations, rural radio stations and community centres in remote areas. The information is received by special digital radio receivers provided to partner groups at low cost. The networks RANET develops, however, are not limited solely to the WorldSpace system. The programme works with a variety of partners to standardize appropriate FM community radio station equipment, HF systems, and even energy solutions. By bringing together various appropriate and sustainable technologies, RANET is supporting ´human networks´ of dialogue and partnership that serve as the basis for sharing knowledge that will improve the lives of communities in remote areas. The most important element of RANET´s strategy is to encourage broad local ownership. Each radio station or satellite receiver system is locally owned. RANET rarely funds an activity in full, but requires the participants - regional, national or local - to demonstrate the need for and value of the system and then to mobilize in-kind and local resources to operate it. In Zambia, for example, in July 2004 a team of RANET members and the national programme coordinator visited the Mumbwa community radio station, which is now under development. The community has organized an association, is raising funds to refurbish a building for the station, and has constructed a radio mast with the help of another local partner. During the visit, RANET members were able to offer technical advice on the most affordable and durable equipment, and on how to obtain a broadcast licence, as well as to discuss the association´s plans for covering operating costs, programme development, and energy supply options. While it may take another six months or more for the Mumbwa radio station to become operational, the extended process of planning and dialogue will help to ensure that the station is firmly rooted and will have broad community support when it begins broadcasting, thus helping to ensure the sustainability of the service. RANET believes that as well as providing assistance to the station operators, it is just as important to hold dialogues with potential listeners to determine their needs. Thus, in Zambia, RANET members recently visited the Mazabuka community radio station, where they met with local weather service staff, station operators and local farmers. During the dialogue they discussed technical aspects such as coverage and reception, as well as programming issues such as the timing of broadcasts so that they reach the largest audience. The farmers were able to talk about the past growing season and their needs in terms of weather forecasts, observations and even hazard warnings. Although some requests may have been beyond RANET´s scientific capacities, the farmers suggested a number of changes in format or content that could easily be accommodated, such as using more familiar local place names in the forecasts. Such fine-tuning can often mean the difference between a forecast being used to good effect, or ignored completely. The partnerships with various national agencies, international organizations and local communities help to ensure the sustainability of RANET´s communication networks. Most important, however, the process of dialogue leads to the effective dissemination and application of weather and climate information, thereby reducing the vulnerability of rural farming and other communities to seasonal weather fluctuations and other natural hazards. mailto:rmumbi@meteo-zambia. net Reidner Mumbi is Director of RANET Zambia, and mailto:kelly. sponberg@noaa. gov Kelly Sponberg is RANET Program Coordinator at US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
