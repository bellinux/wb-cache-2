It is shown that the alkylate produced from feedstock with less mass fraction of isobutane has lower octane value. Wherein the difference in composition of the feedstock contributes to <b>antiknock</b> <b>index</b> by the amount of 1. 0 - 2. 0 points...|$|R

40|$|Reactive {{separation}} (RS) is {{the combination}} of a chemical (catalytic) reaction and a separation technique. For reactive distillation (RD), the reaction is combined with distillation. Rapid development of RS is the result of growing environmental demands and increasing energy costs. Several processes are performed using RD, such as esterifi-cation, etherification (<b>fuel</b> <b>antiknocks),</b> and hydrodesulphurisation. Other RS techniques also develop rapidly. However, the success has not come without some serious prob-lems. The heterogeneous proton catalysts still do not meet the requirements of many processes. The column internals with a built-in catalyst are rather sparse and expensive and their characteristics are not studied well enough. Therefore intensive studies are still being performed. This study presents a brief summary of the processes realisable with the usage of reactive distillation, catalysts, and column internals. Some interesting re-search results and application examples are also quoted...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the authors}} {{reviewed}} engine, vehicle, and fuel data since 1925 {{to examine the}} historical and recent coupling of compression ratio and <b>fuel</b> <b>antiknock</b> properties (i. e., octane number) in the U. S. light-duty vehicle market. The analysis identified historical time frames and trends and illustrated how three factors—consumer preferences, technical capabilities, and regulatory legislation—affect personal mobility. Data showed that over many decades these three factors have a complex and time-sensitive interplay. Long-term trends in the data were identified where interaction and evolution between all three factors were observed. Specifically, transportation efficiency per unit power (gal/ton-mi/hp) {{was found to be}} a good metric to integrate technical, societal, and regulatory effects into the evolutional pathway of personal mobility. From this framework, discussions of future evolutionary changes to personal mobility are also presented, with a focus centered on how increasing fuel octane number can help to enable sustained improvement in transportation efficiency per unit power...|$|R
30|$|Facing {{increasingly}} strict {{environmental regulations}} on transportation fuels, China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), {{the second largest}} supplier of petroleum products in China, needs to upgrade its transportation fuels. Using the scenario-based analysis method, this paper analyzes how the emission related properties, including <b>antiknock</b> <b>index,</b> and sulfur, olefin, benzene and aromatics contents of gasoline produced by CNPC, vary with {{the change in the}} configuration of gasoline production units in the future 5 – 15 years. The results showed that for CNPC to upgrade its gasoline, the share of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) naphtha must be reduced, but just increasing reformate or alkylate and isomerate will result in excessive increase in benzene and aromatics contents or a great loss of gasoline octane number. Therefore, CNPC should suitably control the capacity of its FCC units and increase the capacity of reformer, alkylation and isomerization units. Most importantly, CNPC should dramatically expand the capacity of its hydrotreating or non-hydrotreating gasoline upgrading units to decrease the olefin and sulfur contents in FCC gasoline that takes a dominant share of about 80 % in the gasoline pool of China.|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of naphtha obtained by direct distillation of medium and heavy crude oils is often {{limited by the}} low yield of these fractions. Gas chromatography is a technique that allows a complete determination of the chemical composition of these fraction. However, the prediction of properties such as octane rating and RVP from chromatographic data is a difficult task because there are not adequate models to predict {{the interaction of the}} different components, and particularly in the case of heavier fractions, there are some problems for the complete separation of components under the gas chromatographic condi-tions. The IR technology constitutes a rapid and effective tool to predict several properties of naphtha from the correlation of the spectrum in the infrared area and the properties. In this study, prediction models were developed in a Petrospec Cetane 2000 analyzer, in order to predict in a fast and simple way, the density, the <b>antiknock</b> <b>index</b> and the aromatic content of straight run naphtha obtained in a standard crude oil distillation unit. The equipment used was designed in the factory for the exclusive {{characterization of}} medium distillation and not for lighter fractions therefore this work constitutes an innovation given the extensive applications of this type of analyzers...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} combustion characteristics of higher alcohols/gasoline (UTG 96) blends is presented. Lower alcohols (methanol and ethanol) {{have been used}} in the past as fuel extenders by mixing them with gasoline, but relatively little work has been reported on higher alcohols (propanol, butanol, and pentanol). All of these alcohols can be produced from coal derived syngas. Given the abundant coal reserves in the United States, use of such higher alcohols offers an attractive alternative to alleviate the country's growing needs for transportation fuels. Comparisons of knock limits, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), emissions, and fuel characteristics between higher alcohol/gasoline blends and neat gasoline were made to determine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} blending alcohol with gasoline. All tests were conducted on a single-cylinder Waukesha Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine operating at steady state conditions and stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio. The data show that higher alcohol/gasoline blends have a greater resistance to knock than neat gasoline, as indicated by the knock resistance indicator (KRI) and the (RON+MON) / 2 <b>antiknock</b> <b>index.</b> Ignition delay and combustion interval data show that higher alcohol/gasoline blends tend to have faster flame speeds. Other fuel parameters, including reid vapor pressure (RVP) and distillation curve, are affected by the addition of alcohol to gasoline. The lower alcohols (methanol and ethanol) cause the most dramatic increase in RVP and the largest depression of the distillation curve. Addition of higher alcohols (propanol, butanol, and pentanol) tend to curb the effects of methanol and ethanol on RVP and the distillation curves of the blends...|$|R
40|$|Butanol has {{received}} significant research attention as a second-generation biofuel {{in the past}} few years. In the present study, skeletal mechanisms for four butanol isomers were generated from two widely accepted, well-validated detailed chemical kinetic models for the butanol isomers. The detailed models were reduced using a two-stage approach consisting of the directed relation graph with error propagation and sensitivity analysis. During the reduction process, issues were encountered with pressure-dependent reactions formulated using the logarithmic pressure interpolation approach; these issues are discussed and recommendations made to avoid ambiguity in its future implementation in mechanism development. The performance of the skeletal mechanisms generated here was compared with that of detailed mechanisms in simulations of autoignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and perfectly stirred reactor temperature response curves and extinction residence times, over a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios. The detailed and skeletal mechanisms agreed well, demonstrating the adequacy of the resulting reduced chemistry for all the butanol isomers in predicting global combustion phenomena. In addition, the skeletal mechanisms closely predicted the time-histories of fuel mass fractions in homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulations. The performance of each butanol isomer was additionally compared with that of a gasoline surrogate with an <b>antiknock</b> <b>index</b> of 87 in a homogeneous compression-ignition engine simulation. The gasoline surrogate was consumed faster than any of the butanol isomers, with tert-butanol exhibiting the slowest fuel consumption rate. While n-butanol and isobutanol displayed the most similar consumption profiles relative to the gasoline surrogate, the two literature chemical kinetic models predicted different orderings.

40|$|As {{regulatory}} measures for improved fuel economy and decreased emissions are pushing gasoline engine combustion technologies towards extreme conditions (i. e., boosted and intercooled intake with exhaust gas recirculation), fuel ignition characteristics {{become increasingly important}} for enabling stable operation. This study explores the effects of chemical composition on the fundamental ignition behavior of gasoline fuels. Two well-characterized, high-octane, non-oxygenated FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasolines, FACE F and FACE G, having similar <b>antiknock</b> <b>indices</b> but different octane sensitivities and chemical compositions are studied. Ignition experiments were conducted in shock tubes and a rapid compression machine (RCM) at nominal pressures of 20 and 40. atm, equivalence ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 0, and temperatures ranging from 650 to 1270. K. Results at temperatures above 900. K indicate that ignition delay time is similar for these fuels. However, RCM measurements below 900. K demonstrate a stronger negative temperature coefficient behavior for FACE F gasoline having lower octane sensitivity. In addition, RCM pressure profiles under two-stage ignition conditions illustrate that the magnitude of low-temperature heat release (LTHR) increases with decreasing fuel octane sensitivity. However, intermediate-temperature heat release is shown to increase as fuel octane sensitivity increases. Various surrogate fuel mixtures were formulated to conduct chemical kinetic modeling, and complex multicomponent surrogate mixtures were shown to reproduce experimentally observed trends better than simpler two- and three-component mixtures composed of n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene. Measurements in a Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) engine demonstrated that the multicomponent surrogates accurately captured the antiknock quality of the FACE gasolines. Simulations were performed using multicomponent surrogates for FACE F and G to reveal the underlying chemical kinetics linking fuel composition with ignition characteristics. A key discovery of this work is the kinetic coupling between aromatics and naphthenes, which affects the radical pool population and thereby controls ignition. © 2016 The Combustion Institute...|$|R
3000|$|Alcohols and ethers {{are used}} as oxygenated {{additives}} to motor <b>fuels</b> and as <b>antiknock</b> components in gasoline. They increase the octane number and reduce the emissions of gases to greenhouse effect (CO x [...] and NO x [...]). These oxygenated compounds have partially replaced the lead-based salts that are toxic and pollutant. Among the tertiary ethers, such as ethyl tertiary butyl ether, tertiary amyl ethyl ether and tertiary amyl methyl ether, MTBE is the oxygenated additive currently, {{the most widely used}} in the reformulated gasoline and also one of organic chemicals the most produced industrially [1]. However, the major drawback of this ether is its easy diffusion in the ground water, its slow biological breakdown and its unpleasant odour. The diisopropyl ether (DIPE) can be a potential candidate to substitute the MTBE. It has the advantage to increase the octane number and to have a lower vapour pressure. Various works proposed the synthesis of the DIPE from propene and water in a two-stage process [2], from a feed of acetone and hydrogen in a two-stage process [3] or one-step process [4] and from acetone feedstock [5]. The DIPE can be also synthesised either from a feed of propylene and water [6] or from a feed of propene and isopropanol over an acidic ion exchange resin like Amberlyst 15 [7]. The synthesis of the DIPE from the isopropanol decomposition was examined over aluminosilicates supported sulfopolyphenylketone (or polyphenylketone) [8] and over sulphated titania [9].|$|R
