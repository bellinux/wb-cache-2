5000|$|In C and C++, {{a leading}} zero {{indicates}} an octal value, e.g. 0755. This was primarily {{intended to be}} used with Unix modes; however, it has been criticized because normal integers may also lead with zero. As such, Python, Ruby, Haskell, and OCaml prefix octal values with 0O or 0o, following the layout used by <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R

(This is to support double-byte character set Unicode-based module names.) Some IBM products, however, only allow characters for external names and other identifiers to a restricted range, typically (EBCDIC) <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>values</b> of X'41' through X'FE' plus the shift-in and shift out characters, X'0F' and X'0E', respectively.|$|R

50|$|In most hex editor applications, {{the data}} of the {{computer}} file is represented as <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>values</b> grouped in 4 groups of 4 bytes (or two groups of 8 bytes), followed by one group of 16 printable ASCII characters which correspond to each pair of hex values (each byte).

50|$|Machine control characters, in contrast, are {{the very}} {{commands}} which IBM line printers understand. This is why they are hardware dependent or hardware determined. IBM defined this set of commands for their line printers and made sure all their line printers understand them. Other (mainframe) line printer manufacturers also {{had to make sure}} their printers understood those commands. Since machine control characters are hardware commands, many of them are not displayable characters and therefore machine control characters are always specified as <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Unicode has no {{separate}} characters for hexadecimal values. A consequence is, {{that when}} using regular characters {{it is not}} possible to determine whether <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>value</b> is intended, or even whether a value is intended at all. That should be determined at a higher level, e.g. by prepending [...] "0x" [...] to a hexadecimal number or by context. The only feature is that Unicode can note that a sequence can or can not be a <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
