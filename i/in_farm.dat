5|$|Brezhnev's {{agricultural}} policy reinforced the conventional methods for organising the collective farms. Output quotas {{continued to be}} imposed centrally. Khrushchev's policy of amalgamating farms was continued by Brezhnev, because he shared Khrushchev's belief that bigger kolkhozes would increase productivity. Brezhnev pushed {{for an increase in}} state investments in farming, which mounted to an all-time high in the 1970s of 27% of all state investment– this figure did not include investments <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> equipment. In 1981 alone, 33 billion U.S. dollars (by contemporary exchange rate) was invested into agriculture.|$|E

Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|India ranks first {{worldwide}} <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> output. Agriculture {{and allied}} sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 18.6% of the GDP in 2005, employed 60% {{of the total}} workforce and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and {{plays a significant role}} in the overall socio-economic development of India. Yields per unit area of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the green revolution.|$|E

5|$|The senior {{officers}} of the 1st Airborne Division had estimated {{that there would be}} around 450 casualties during the capture of the bridge, of which 25 per cent would be killed or missing, and the other 75 per cent wounded. It was appreciated that by themselves the three battalions' medical officers and staff would be unable to cope with the expected numbers of casualties, so one section from the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, consisting of one doctor and 16 other ranks, would be attached to each of the parachute battalions. The remainder of the field ambulance, comprising the headquarters with two surgical teams, would be co-located with the brigade and establish their main dressing station <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> buildings to the south of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions {{on issues such as}} gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E

5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase <b>in</b> <b>farm</b> produce.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to analyse the {{production}} efficiency of conventional and organic <b>farms</b> <b>in</b> the Western Bohemia. Based on the data of questionnaire investigation in 2009 I selected four farms from the Pilsen Region. Evaluative criteria were as follows: the total area under cultivation, farming system (conventional or organic), type of arable crops (especially wheat, oat, potatoes). The data were extracted from terrain investigation, telephone conversations, interview with farmers, yearbook of organic farming, situational review and forecast balance of Czech Statistical Office and Ministry of Agriculture. Supporting data were extracted from ÚZEI database. Crop yields, the costs of crops and selling price in recent 10 years were investigated. From the results it can be concluded, that crop yields <b>in</b> organic <b>farming</b> are lower than crop yields <b>in</b> conventional <b>farming.</b> The yields of wheat growing <b>in</b> organic <b>farming</b> are 40 % lower than <b>in</b> conventional <b>farming.</b> The yields of potatoes growing <b>in</b> organic <b>farming</b> are 40 % lower than <b>in</b> conventional <b>farming</b> and the yields of oat growing <b>in</b> organic <b>farming</b> are 30 % lower than <b>in</b> conventional <b>farming.</b> Production efficiency of chosen crops <b>in</b> organic <b>farming</b> is comparable to conventional farming due to higher redemption price and lower costs. <b>In</b> some organic <b>farms</b> the growing of chosen crops is even more profitable than <b>in</b> conventional <b>farms.</b> Structure of costs <b>in</b> organic <b>farming</b> is the most differential component comparable to conventional farming. It is because of different spending of fertilization and crop management practice...|$|R
