5|$|Dmowski was {{a deputy}} to the 1919 Legislative Sejm, but he {{attended}} {{only a single}} session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in Paris or recuperating from a lung infection, in Algeria. He reorganized endecja into a new party, Popular National Union (Związek Ludowo-Narodowy). During the Polish-Soviet War {{he was a member}} of the Council of National Defense and a vocal critic of Piłsudski's policies. In the aftermath of the war, Polish eastern borders were similar, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> smaller, from what became known as the Dmowski's Line.|$|E
5|$|Tassadar {{is a high}} templar {{who holds}} the rank of {{executor}} in the Khalai military. He appears in StarCraft and in several novels, most notably Queen of Blades. Tassadar is voiced by Michael Gough in StarCraft, with Michael Dorn playing the part in later appearances. Described as being fascinated with, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> wary of, the dark templar, Tassadar is {{the commander of the}} fleet that made first contact with the Terrans by destroying their colony of Chau Sara to contain Zerg infestation. However, Tassadar eventually disregards his orders to continue destroying worlds with no concern for the Terrans, and instead engages the Zerg by conventional means. After tracking the Zerg to their homeworld of Char, he encounters the dark templar Zeratul and Jim Raynor, forging a friendship with the two and learning how to use his psionic powers in conjunction with the powers of the dark templar.|$|E

25|$|Seymour MacDonald Nurse (born 10 November 1933) is a Barbadian former cricketer. Nurse played 29 Test matches for the West Indies between 1960 and 1969. A powerfully built {{right-hand}} batsman and an aggressive, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> impetuous, shotmaker, Nurse {{preferred to}} bat {{in the middle}} order but was often asked to open the batting. A relative latecomer to high-level cricket, Nurse's Test cricket career came to what many consider a premature end in 1969.|$|E
25|$|In his {{personal}} life, Alma-Tadema was an extrovert {{and had a}} remarkably warm personality.

A perfectionist, he remained in all respects a diligent, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> obsessive and pedantic worker. He was an excellent businessman, and one of the wealthiest artists of the nineteenth century. Alma-Tadema was as firm in money matters as he was with the quality of his work.|$|E

Despite this, he is very power hungry, a failure as a military strategist and uses the accomplishments of his relatives {{as a means to}} further his political career.

25|$|A keen {{student of}} the {{architecture}} of Michelangelo and the ruins of Antiquity, Borromini developed an inventive and distinctive, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> idiosyncratic, architecture employing manipulations of Classical architectural forms, geometrical rationales in his plans and symbolic meanings in his buildings. He {{seems to have had}} a sound understanding of structures, which perhaps Bernini and Cortona, who were principally trained {{in other areas of the}} visual arts, lacked. His soft lead drawings are particularly distinctive. He appears to have been a self-taught scholar, amassing a large library by the end of his life.|$|E
25|$|Tabari {{was some}} {{fifty years old}} when al-Mu'tadid became caliph. He was well past seventy in the year his History was published. During the {{intervening}} years, he was famous, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> controversial, personality. Among the figures of his age, he had access to sources of information equal to anyone, except, perhaps, those who were directly connected with decision making within the government. Most, if not all, the materials for the histories of al-Mu'tadid, al-Muktafi, and {{the early years of}} al-Muqtadir were collected by him about the time the reported events took place. His accounts are as authentic as one can expect from that period.|$|E

25|$|La Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto (English: The Complete Illustrated Dictionary of Esperanto, {{abbreviated}} PIV) is {{the largest}} monolingual dictionary of the language and is generally regarded as the standard. However, it is subject to criticism, for example for failure to distinguish rare, idiosyncratic, redundant, or even erroneous words attested in a few written texts from their conversational equivalents, and for giving French approximations of some difficult words rather than their Zamehofian meanings. The older Plena Vortaro de Esperanto, originally published in 1930 and appended in 1953, is still widely used, as more portable and less expensive than the PIV, and perhaps more accurate, even <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> dated. The Etimologia vortaro de Esperanto (five volumes, 1989–2001) gives source-language etymologies of all fundamental and official root words (tentative and uncertain in a few cases), along with comparisons of equivalent words in four other constructed international auxiliary languages.|$|E
25|$|Knott {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Surrey against New South Wales during the state's 1995 visit to England. Knott appeared in first-class cricket for Surrey from 1995 to 1998, making 12 appearances, {{the last of}} which came against Nottinghamshire in the 1998 County Championship. An able, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> inconsistent batsman, Knott scored 273 runs {{at an average of}} 21.00, with a high score of 49*. Behind the stumps he took 12 catches and made 2 stumpings. It was for Surrey that he made his List A debut for in the 1997 Benson & Hedges Cup against British Universities. He played List A cricket for Surrey until 1998, making 10 appearances, the last of which came against Derbyshire in the 1998 AXA League. In those 10 matches, he scored a total of 142 runs at an average of 17.75, with a high score of 98. Behind the stumps he took 15 catches. His score of 98, which came against Gloucestershire in 1998, was to remain his highest List A score. During his time at Surrey, Knott largely stood in for Alec Stewart when he was unavailable due to England duties, {{toward the end of his}} time with the county, he was below Jonathan Batty in the selection pecking order. He was released by Surrey at the end of the 1998 season.|$|E
25|$|Vocalist Hat {{decided to}} leave Gorgoroth in September 1995, but agreed to finish {{recording}} the vocal tracks for Antichrist. After Hat left, Infernus recruited vocalist Pest from Obtained Enslavement as Gorgoroth's new vocalist. In December 1995, the band supported Cradle of Filth at the London Astoria, a show which also included the band Primordial. This marked the first Gorgoroth live appearance of both vocalist Pest and bassist Ares. In 1995 the band had been offered a record deal with Moonfog Productions, but this offer was rejected in favour of an offer made by German label Malicious Records. Malicious Records released the band's second album, Antichrist, in 1996, and also re-released the debut album Pentagram. The band went on a European tour with Satyricon and Dissection in April 1996, followed by a one-off gig in Bergen with Hades Almighty and Gehenna, at which the live EP The Last Tormentor was recorded. The band also played a one-off gig in the fall in Bischofswerda, Germany, with Behemoth. Soon the name Gorgoroth was commonplace in the black metal underground, both in Norway and {{in the rest of}} Europe, <b>if</b> <b>somewhat</b> overshadowed by some of the more famous black metal bands such as Mayhem or Emperor. The band's third full-length album, Under the Sign of Hell, was recorded in spring 1996, and guitarist Tormentor joined the band later in the year. Under the Sign of Hell was released in 1997, and Gorgoroth went on their first headlining European tour in fall 1997, with support by Mystic Circle. It was on this tour that Infernus and Tormentor were approached by the major German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast, who wanted to sign the band. The band accepted the offer in late 1997.|$|E
