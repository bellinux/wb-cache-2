5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E

5000|$|When EQ-5D {{was first}} developed, the scale {{used in the}} health state {{description}} part was three-level; <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>having</b> some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in walking about", [...] "I have some problems in walking about", and [...] "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> for 1, <b>having</b> some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (<b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). 12321 indicates <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in mobility and anxiety/depression, having slight problems in self-care and pain/discomfort, and having extreme problems in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states.|$|R
5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom. Most of the students <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, {{his father had been}} suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> {{crossing}} the generally shallow {{streams and rivers}} typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied {{that he would not}} take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very slowly, toward the entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E

If he changed his mind on something, or if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> declaring that specific point non-canon.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the events}} that {{facilitated}} cooperating with Congress was the Bangladesh Liberation War. In 1971 Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) declared its independence from Pakistan. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising; but Indian military intervention thwarted such moves.

This delegation provides provinces {{with a lot}} of leeway to do as they please. As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of , saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada.

An exciting second match saw Denmark overcome Kenya by one wicket: some tight bowling from Mortensen (3-23) had restricted the Kenyans to 121, and although Denmark fell to 96/9, an unbroken last-wicket stand of 26 saw them through. For East Africa, GR Shariff made 72 and BR Bouri 31, but no-one else passed 7 as Brandes (5-37) wreaked havoc to dismiss them for 140. In reply, Zimbabwe reached 143/0 with 33 overs to spare, with David Houghton scoring 87 not out and Paterson 55 not out.|$|E

Later Pommer became a dissident herself, hiding a family member of one {{those involved in the}} 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler and eventually being jailed herself {{near the end of the}} war.

Law himself <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with Balfour's leadership, and along with Edward Carson attempted to regain support for him. By November 1911 it was accepted that Balfour was likely to resign, with the main competitors for the leadership being Law, Carson, Walter Long and Austen Chamberlain. When the elections began, Long and Chamberlain were the frontrunners; Chamberlain commanded the support of many tariff reformers, and Long that of the Irish Unionists.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{demographic}} and social network variables, independently of each other, are associated with quality of life (QoL), self-rated health or physical function. The sample consisted of 307 women aged 75 years. Social networks were assessed by Fillenbaum’s five questions and a question on ability to participate in organizations. Variables of demographic composition, QoL, health and physical function were registered. We found significant associations between social networks, QoL, health and physical functioning. Seeing friends and relatives as often as wanted, getting help when sick or disabled and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations were associated with higher QoL. Higher educational level, the ability to see friends and relatives as often as wanted and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations were associated with better health. Living alone, getting help when sick or disabled and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations indicated better mobility. Being younger, having higher education and <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in participating in organizations were associated with better balance. Higher scores on muscle strength were associated with being younger, not living alone and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in participating in organizations. Our results highlight the importance of social networks for maintaining good QoL, health and physical functioning...|$|R
