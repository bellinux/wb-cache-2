[...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> talk then that I'd never get 110 points like I did in the WHA," [...] said Gretzky. He proved his critics wrong, scoring 137 points in 1979–80 and winning the first of nine Hart Trophies (including 8 consecutive awards from 1980–1988) as the NHL's most valuable player. [...] Over the next several seasons, Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season, with 92 in the 1981–82 season; in assists, with 163 in the 1985–86; and in total points, with 215 in 1985–86. [...] He also scored 50 goals in 39 games, the fastest any player had reached the total in a single season. [...] Gretzky scored his 1,000th NHL point in his 424th game, breaking Guy Lafleur's old record of 720 games.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, music student Michael [...] "Miguel" [...] Happoldt {{offered to}} let the band record in the studio at the school where he was studying, {{although}} without the school's knowledge. The band agreed, and sneaked into the school at night, where they recorded from midnight to seven in the morning. That recording session resulted in the popular cassette tape, Jah Won't Pay the Bills, released in 1991. The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout Southern California. It was during this time that Nowell became involved with drugs. For years, Nowell refused to try heroin; however, as he entered his twenties and witnessed his band's success, he decided to try the drug. Nowell's father explained, [...] "His excuse for taking the heroin was that {{he felt like he}} had to be larger than life. He was leading the band, leading his fans, and he had to put on this persona. He <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> musicians say they were taking heroin to be more creative".|$|E

Le Guin has stated that, in retrospect, she is grateful for the ease and happiness of her upbringing. The encouraging environment fostered Le Guin's interest in literature; her first fantasy story was written at age 9, her first science fiction story submitted for publication in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction at age 11. The family spent the academic year in Berkeley, retreating in the summers to an old ranch named [...] "Kishamish" [...] in Napa Valley, which she once described as [...] "an old, tumble-down ranch in the Napa Valley … [...] a gathering place for scientists, writers, students, and California Indians. Even though I didn't pay much attention, I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> interesting, grown-up conversation." [...] She was interested in biology and poetry, but found math difficult. Le Guin attended Berkeley High School. She received her B.A. (Phi Beta Kappa) in Renaissance French and Italian literature from Radcliffe College in 1951, and M.A. in French and Italian literature from Columbia University in 1952. Soon after, Le Guin began her Ph.D. work and won a Fulbright grant to continue her studies in France from 1953 to 1954.|$|E

He said that if {{you get a lot of}} people all together and get them laughing you can do anything you like with them. Once they start to laugh they are lost. So they got Mr. Dreery, the English Literature teacher at the high school, to give an evening of readings from the Great Humorists from Chaucer to Adam Smith. They came mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that. If the people had once started laughing it would have been all over with them.

60|$|Mrs Brown {{had been}} very much vexed at her dismissal. The Browns were a childless couple and the {{arrangement}} had suited them perfectly. Their resentment was very bitter. Mrs Brown had to remain ashore alone with her rage, but the steward was nursing his on board. Poor Flora had no greater enemy, the aggrieved mate had no greater sympathiser. And Mrs Brown, with a woman's quick power of observation and inference (the putting of two and two together) {{had come to a}} certain conclusion which she had imparted to her husband before leaving the ship. The morose steward permitted himself once to make an allusion to it in Powell's hearing. It was in the officers' mess-room {{at the end of a}} meal while he lingered after putting a fruit pie on the table. He and the chief mate started a dialogue about the alarming change in the captain, the sallow steward looking down with a sinister frown, Franklin rolling upwards his eyes, sentimental in a red face. Young Powell had <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> that sort of thing by that time. It was growing monotonous; it had always sounded to him a little absurd.

6000|$|Jan. 24, 1868.—Now I {{am going}} to take a great liberty with you. [...] I can hardly help myself. I have <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> grumbling lately [...] about you, and have several times asked myself whether it would be [...] tanti to tease you by repeating it. Well, what is pressed on me [...] is, that at the present time when every one is full of anxiety as [...] to the future, and when your warmest {{supporters}} are longing for [...] cohesion, there is an impression that you are absorbed in [...] questions about Homer and Greek words, about Ecce Homo, that you [...] are not reading the newspapers, or feeling the pulse of followers. [...] One man personally complained that when you sought his opinion, [...] you spent the whole interview in impressing your own view on him, [...] and hardly heard anything he might have to say. It is with a [...] painful feeling and (were it not for your generous and truly [...] modest nature it would be) with some anxiety as to how you would [...] take it that I consented to be the funnel of all this grumbling. [...] As far as I can make out, the feeling resolves itself into two [...] main points: 1. Whatever your own tastes may be for literature, [...] and however strengthening and refreshing to your own mind and [...] heart it may be to dig into the old springs, still the people [...] don’t understand it; they consider you their own, as a husband [...] claims a wife’s devotion; and it gives a bad impression if you are [...] supposed to be interested, except for an occasional slight [...] recreation, about aught but the nation’s welfare at this critical [...] time, and that it riles them to see the walls placarded with your [...] name and Ecce Homo.... 2. (a) The other point is (pray forgive [...] me if I go too far, I am simply a funnel) a feeling that your [...] entourage is too confined, and too much of second-rate men; that [...] the strong men and the rising men are not gathered round you and [...] known to be so; (b) and besides that there is so little easy [...] contact with the small fry, as when Palmerston sat in the [...] tea-room, and men were gratified by getting private speech with [...] their leader.

5000|$|Born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1931, Knibb, {{grew up on}} Bond Street, {{close to}} where a local band rehearsed, and he made his own drum kit from a wooden box and paint cans to {{practice}} the sounds that he had <b>heard.</b> Like <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> musicians in the 1940s, he honed his craft in jazz bands. His first professional engagement was with the Val Bennett band, with whom he played for six years. [...] He also played with Count Ossie's group, adding burru and nyabinghi to his repertoire, and he regularly accompanied Rastafarian leader Sam Brown at meetings. It was with Eric Dean's band where he gained the technical skills to play many styles. Dean's set list included the big band music of Glenn Miller {{as well as the}} popular dances of the day: rhumba, cha-cha-cha and bolero, and his tenure in the band coincided with future major figures in ska such as Tommy McCook, Baba Brooks, and Lloyd Brevett. Knibb's technical proficiency and wide knowledge of styles soon led to him being featured on the recordings of Coxsone Dodd, Prince Buster, Sonia Pottinger and Duke Reid, playing an instrumental part in the development of ska.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of effects}} with {{multiple}} guitar amps {{is a common}} way to achieve a [...] "bigger-sounding" [...] tone. One {{of the most common}} and easiest ways to achieve this is {{through the use of a}} stereo delay unit. The guitar's signal enters the delay unit and gets split into two signals. One signal will usually be kept dry and go to one amplifier while the other signal will be delayed be a specific amount of time depending on the tempo of the song and go to the other amplifier. This creates a much bigger sounding guitar tone than just one mono delay feeding one amplifier. Oftentimes in the studio, dry and wet signals will be panned left and right in the mix to create a better stereo image. This can be <b>heard</b> on <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Coldplay recordings. Other common effects that are used with multi-amp rigs are stereo reverbs. Stereo reverbs are often used with two of the same amp. The advantage of using effects with multiple guitar amplifiers is that one can amplify a dry signal while another amplifies a wet signal with effects and the two signals can be blended in parallel. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> guitar effects don't feature any kind of mix function so using two amplifiers allows the user to dial in the amount of effects being heard.|$|R
