Some sources {{have a new}} total of 373 Centuries, but Cicero still writes of 193 centuries in his era, and most scholars still use that number It known that the first property class was reduced form 80 to 70 centuries, and the order of voting was changed so that the first class would <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> and be followed by the equites.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII's {{underestimation}} of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, {{the army}} stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital {{with a small}} escort at midnight. Louis decided to <b>go</b> <b>first</b> to Lille, and then crossed the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent. Other leaders, most prominently Alexander I of Russia, debated whether {{in the case of}} a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orléans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} went to penalties, Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United, and opted for his side to <b>go</b> <b>first</b> in the shoot-out, {{which would be}} taken at the end housing the Manchester United fans. Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way. Ballack was next up, {{shooting}} powerfully past Van der Sar. Carrick buried his spot-kick, as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game, having come on for Makélélé {{at the end of}} extra time. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E

5|$|At dawn, {{after his}} {{attacked}} failed to overtake any major positions, Zur decided to withdraw, {{for the first}} time in his life. He ordered Harpaz's company, which had the most casualties, to <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> and at 06:00 told Dromi's company to follow. Harpaz's company had five men missing in action, four of whom were picked up by Dromi's people. One of Dromi's platoons remained on top of a sand dune to provide cover fire for the retreat. Meanwhile, the rest of the company made its way under the road and the railway through culverts. On the eastern side, Dromi met Harpaz. They sent the cover platoon home with the injured, and remained in their place to wait for Zur. Their lookout also spotted Kotzer's retreating company and Harpaz requested artillery cover using the only working communication device they had. The Napoleonchiks missed their targets, but deterred the Egyptians, who stopped following Kotzer.|$|E
5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to <b>go</b> <b>first</b> on their respective teams will fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E
5|$|Smith headed west, {{across the}} Ligurian Alps, towards {{southern}} France, which he knew {{had just been}} invaded by Allied troops, principally Americans, Free French and British. He and Bill were assisted along the way by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that because it would be too risky to try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> with the Frenchman, Austrian and Pole following the next day.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to <b>go</b> <b>first</b> and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} round, the winning team took the Pendants of Life the contestants earned into the temple, and {{attempted}} to retrieve the episode's artifact {{and bring it back}} out of the temple within a three-minute time limit. The team designated one member to enter the temple first; that team member carried one of the team's full pendants. The other team member held the remaining pendant, half pendant, or no pendant at all and stood by to enter if the first team member was taken out of the temple by a temple guard. Before starting, Olmec would explain the rooms in the temple and the necessary tasks in each room. During season 1, Fogg asked who would <b>go</b> <b>first</b> and explained about the temple guards and, if necessary, the extra half pendant. Beginning in season 2, Olmec himself explained these things.|$|E
25|$|Every December 31, {{a special}} New Year's Eve {{countdown}} show occurs normally beginning at 9:30 PM. The show {{begins with the}} original show production and is then immediately followed by a special countdown show. Highlights of New Years celebrated in individual countries begins the show; the Asian pavilions (Japan and China) <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> followed by those in Europe (Italy, Norway, France, Germany), after that, the countries {{of those in the}} GMT time zone (Morocco and the United Kingdom). During the presentation, fireworks shoot from the back of each pavilion accompanied with custom celebration music from each country. The countdown begins at 10 seconds prior to midnight with the North American nations: United States, Canada, Mexico. The count down starts with a dong (which originates from the American pavilion) and leads to the massive celebratory firework display at 12:00 midnight including a 360 degree launch of fireworks around the World Showcase lagoon. The song Auld Lang Syne plays as spectators cheer and watch the massive firework display. This tag uses double the amount of fireworks that are launched in IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth. A male announcer concludes the show wishing guests a happy New Year and reminds guests of extended park hours for the New Year's Eve celebration.|$|E
500|$|In March 1966, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon remarked, [...] "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink... We're more popular than Jesus now—I don't know which will <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> rock and roll or Christianity." [...] The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later. The furore that followed—burning of Beatles records, Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against Lennon—contributed to the band's decision to stop touring.|$|E

Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me." [...] The comment drew no controversy when originally published in the United Kingdom, but angry reactions flared up in Christian communities when it was republished in the United States five months later.|$|E
500|$|As the Arab {{garrison}} of Kamarja approached Dabusiyya, the latter's garrison {{at first}} believed that Kamarja had fallen {{and that the}} soldiers coming towards them were Turgesh, but as they arrayed themselves for battle, a rider sent by the Kamarja troops alerted them as to the real situation, and [...] "the men of al-Dabusiyya galloped forward to carry whoever {{was too weak to}} walk or was wounded". At this the hostages began being released, with the Arabs sending a hostage back and the Turgesh in turn releasing one of the hostages they held. In the end, when the last two hostages were left, neither side was willing to let its own hostage <b>go</b> <b>first,</b> until the Arab hostage volunteered to go last. For this act of chivalry, he was richly rewarded by Kursul with a suit of armour and a horse.|$|E
