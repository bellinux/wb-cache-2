To minimize negative effects of ownership concentration on firm value, Latin-American firms resort to a number of different corporate governance mechanisms that are complements rather than substitutes.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} and empirically {{address the}} endogeneity of corporate ownership {{structure and the}} cost of debt, with a novel emphasis on the role of control concentration in post-default firm restructuring. Control concentration raises agency costs of debt, and <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholders</b> trade off private benefits of control against higher borrowing costs in choosing their ownership stakes. Based on our theoretical predictions, and using an international sample of syndicated loans and unique dynamic ownership structure data, we present new evidence on the firm- and macro-level determinants of corporate control concentration {{and the cost of}} debt. (JEL G 21, G 32) It is a stylized fact that corporate ownership is concentrated (Holderness 2009). Moreover, in much of the world, <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholders,</b> whose control (or voting) ownership exceeds significantly their cash-flow stakes, typically control public companies. 1 The determinants and consequences of such ownership structures have received extensive attention.

Public firms throughout the world tend {{to be controlled by}} large shareholders who possess significant control rights in excess of their cash-flow rights (excess control). The most salient agency problem in such concentrated ownership structures is the risk of minority shareholders expropriation by the <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholders.</b> In this paper, we focus on agency costs of concentrated ownership structures while proposing a different and novel angle to study. We investigate whether the presence of the <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholders</b> and excess control increases audit fees. Using a panel of 242 S&P/TSX Canadian firms over the period 2002 - 2008, we document a positive association between excess control and audit fees.

Wong currently holds a 32.81% stake in Bright Packaging. In October 2013, Wong emerged as a <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholder</b> in Bright Packaging Industry Berhad, a main board listed company on Bursa Malaysia. This is the second public-listed company in which the 31-year-old Wong has a controlling stake after Asia Media. Wong acquired a 22.73% equity stake in the packaging company which also owns two freehold sites with a combined area of 136,998 square feet in Prime Klang valley's Subang Hi-Tech Industrial Park where its headquarters and factories are located. As of 31 August 2013, debt-free Bright Packaging had cash of $19.94 million while net assets per share stood at 62 cents. The market reacted positively after news of Wong's investment was made public and the stock increased another 17% on news of its expansion plan through rights issue. News of Wong's interest in taking the company private were denied by the Board in its annual general meeting held on 24 February 2014. Wong has quietly built up his stake in the company and currently holds 32.81% which is just short of the 33% threshold required to trigger a mandatory general offer.|$|E
5000|$|A keen {{contest to}} control the company began, in which M. P. Veerendra Kumar, a wealthy planter and {{political}} aspirant, who held about 3% of the shares, emerged as the <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholder</b> and became the Managing Director. In {{the course of this}} struggle, M. D. Nalapat, another shareholder and editor from 1984-87, whose mother, the writer Kamala Das (Madhavikutty), also held shares, was forced off the board of directors. Nalapat then broke the rules as they had existed until that time: he sold his shares (at Rs. l2,500 each) not merely outside of Kerala but to Indias wealthiest newspaper chain, Bennett, Coleman & Co., owners of The Times of India in Bombay. Nalapat and his supporters sold close to 20% of the shares in Mathrubhumi. Though this was scarcely a controlling interest, others saw the sale as the beginning of a Times of India takeover of a Kerala institution, and, according to Nalapat, an [...] "innate sense of paranoia surfaced". The dominant shareholders appealed against the sale to the Kerala High Court which ruled that because The Times of India was a competitor of Mathrubhumi, the sale was invalid. Some saw the courts decision more as a response to Kerala sentiment than to the requirements of the law. The Times of India appealed to the Supreme Court of India where the case was still pending in the mid-1990s.|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} leading role of ownership structures in corporate governance for publicly traded firms in emerging markets. I analyze the relationships between ownership structures, corporate governance mechanisms, firm value and market liquidity for a sample of Latin American firms. The predominant highly concentrated ownership within a context of weak shareholder protection provides a rich environment to explore corporate governance practices in a regional setting. The period of analysis, 2000 - 2006, is characterized by economic growth sustained by the expansion of foreign direct investment in a post-privatization era. The region as a whole, rather than just individual markets, became an attractive investment destination. In addition {{the development of a}} private pension system initiated in Chile and subsequently expanded to more than 25 countries (the AFP system) reinvigorated the capital markets which have become more attractive as a means of diversification for global portfolios. Moreover, understanding the implications of concentrated ownership structures is fundamental for participants in a yet incipient mergers and acquisitions market. My dissertation consists of three related essays which collectively cohere to represent my research approach and understanding of the topic and they all benefit from the exploitation of a unique ownership database. This work serves to advance the finance literature in several dimensions: a) the manuscript examines at markets which have hitherto been ignored or at best simply characterized as having very weak governance structures; b) it addresses endogeneity problems from the initial design of this research project through the data collection process; c) furthermore, I extend the literature on the interactions between governance mechanisms and firm value; and d) it develops new corporate governance measures, including novel "effective" firm ownership variables for these markets. <b>Dominant</b> <b>shareholders</b> may have both the capability and the incentive to expropriate minority shareholders. Specifically, I examine performance effects that may be attributable to discrepancies between voting rights and cash-flow rights. I examine the extent to which <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholders</b> can divert resources for their own consumption, in turn reducing overall shareholder value. Given the large potential for private consumption, by the <b>dominant</b> <b>shareholders,</b> I also explore the motivations for outside investors to participate in the financing of the firms' activities...|$|R
