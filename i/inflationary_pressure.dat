5|$|Nurkse {{emphasised}} that Keynesian theory shouldn't {{be applied}} to underdeveloped countries because they don't face a lack of effective demand {{in the way that}} developed countries do. Their problem is to do with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause <b>inflationary</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate <b>inflationary</b> <b>pressure.</b> Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This <b>inflationary</b> <b>pressure</b> was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{elections}} should affect inflation, but evidence thus far has not incontrovertibly shown such an effect. We argue that monetary institutions offset <b>inflationary</b> <b>pressures</b> originated by the electoral cycle. Delegation of monetary policy to independent central banks curbs politically induced <b>inflationary</b> <b>pressures.</b> The anti-inflationary effects of central bank independence depend on the governments’ incentives to boost the economy, a root of <b>inflationary</b> <b>pressures.</b> Those incentives are stronger in election years, especially when there is uncertainty about the electoral results. Independent central banks are better suited to counter inflation under those circumstances. Statistical analyses on a sample of 143 developing countries between 1980 and 2012 show that the anti-inflationary effects of central bank independence are larger during election years, and when elections are more contested.

Although Nixon suspended Davis-Bacon, Usery and others soon convinced Nixon to reinstate Davis-Bacon enforcement and establish a separate body to review contract union contracts.

Devaluation can lead to a reduction in citizens' standard of living as their purchasing power is reduced both when they buy imports and when they travel abroad.

2500|$|From the post-Great Depression era to the present, {{the yield}} curve has usually been [...] "normal" [...] meaning that yields rise as {{maturity}} lengthens (i.e., {{the slope of}} the yield curve is positive). [...] This positive slope reflects investor expectations for the economy to grow in the future and, importantly, for this growth to be associated with a greater expectation that inflation will rise in the future rather than fall. [...] This expectation of higher inflation leads to expectations that the central bank will tighten monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates in the future to slow economic growth and dampen <b>inflationary</b> <b>pressure.</b> [...] It also creates a need for a risk premium associated with the uncertainty about the future rate of inflation and the risk this poses to the future value of cash flows. Investors price these risks into the yield curve by demanding higher yields for maturities further into the future. In a positively sloped yield curve, lenders profit from the passage of time since yields decrease as bonds get closer to maturity (as yield decreases, price increases); this is known as rolldown and is a significant component of profit in fixed-income investing (i.e., buying and selling, not necessarily holding to maturity), particularly if the investing is leveraged.|$|E
