25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>time</b> the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, IBM representatives {{communicated with}} Jeopardy! {{executive}} producer Harry Friedman {{about the possibility}} of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two of the most successful contestants on the show, and the program's producers agreed. Watson's differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and Jeopardy! staff during the planning of the competition. IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the show's writers would exploit Watson's cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues, thereby turning the game into a Turing test. To alleviate that claim, a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast. Jeopardy! staff also showed concerns over Watson's reaction time on the buzzer. Originally Watson signalled electronically, but show staff requested that it press a button physically, as the human contestants would. Even with a robotic [...] "finger" [...] pressing the buzzer, Watson remained faster than its human competitors. Ken Jennings noted, [...] "If you're trying to win on the show, the buzzer is all", and that Watson [...] "can knock out a microsecond-precise buzz <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>time</b> with little or no variation. Human reflexes can't compete with computer circuits in this regard." [...] Stephen Baker, a journalist who recorded Watson's development in his book Final Jeopardy, reported that the conflict between IBM and Jeopardy! became so serious in May 2010 that the competition was almost canceled. As part of the preparation, IBM constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model the one used on Jeopardy!. Human players, including former Jeopardy! contestants, also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of The Onion playing host. About 100 test matches were conducted with Watson winning 65% of the games.|$|E

He would often attempt to sell a character a [...] "prized" [...] item, succeeding almost <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>time.</b> He often had items in his shop that contained real properties of magic, yet did not know until it was revealed in the story. One {{of the most memorable}} recurring jokes in the series occurred when someone would address him as [...] "Mr. Sardo." [...] He would then get irritated and exclaim: [...] "That's SarDO! No mister; accent on the doh!" [...] Another recurring line was: [...] "Have you seen our vomit?" [...] Additionally, when selling someone an item, he would often ask a rather high price.

40|$|Abstract. Discrete {{stochastic}} models (DSM) {{are widely}} used in various application fields today. Proxel-based simulation can outperform discrete event-based approaches {{in the analysis of}} small stiff DSM, which can occur for example in reliability modeling. However, when parallel processes with largely differing speed are involved, the faster process determines the small discretization time step, investing far too much effort into the approximation of the slower process. This paper relieves that problem by using individual time steps for each transition and situation. The key problem is to keep semantic consistency when using different time steps for parallel transitions. However, the preservation of the probability mass in <b>every</b> <b>single</b> simulation <b>time</b> step could be achieved. Experiments show that binary step division in conjunction with appropriate subdivision criteria can outperform the original Proxel method significantly. This increases the applicability of Proxels, by enabling the analysis of larger and therefore more realistic models. Keywords: Proxel-based simulation, discrete-time Markov chains, state space-based simulation, discrete stochastic models. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstrat: The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{reconstruct}} the everyday life of employees of Elektropřístroj Písek, by using the methods of oral history and other archival sources. <b>Every</b> <b>single</b> period of <b>time</b> was affected by building a socialist society and its consolidation. Helping the farmers by patronage of JZD was later replaced by a companionship with a soviet enterprise. Also work and social conditions were changing during particular periods of the comunist regime. A democratisation process and a more free society that culminated {{in the year of}} Prague Spring, which was reflected both in employees' initiative and in the company organization and its economy, was characteristic of the sixties of the last century. The August invasion ment a sudden change and the following period of condition consolidation completely suppressed liberal tendencies of previous development.

So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense.

40|$|With {{the process}} of {{regionalisation}} in formerly unitary democracies, there is a renewed interest for conceptual and empirical studies on political careers. Not only in new federal political systems, but also in established federations. Yet, critical questions remain unsolved on both methodological and empirical aspects. This proposal seeks to provide original answers based on a comparative analysis of four regions from established and new federal systems: Catalonia in Spain, Quebec in Canada, Scotland in the UK and Wallonia in Belgium. The paper proceeds in two stages. From a methodological view, even though current research analyse individual trajectories, they do not take individual careers but predominantly inter-territorial movements as the unit of analysis. This paper demonstrates that an individual approach – following <b>every</b> <b>single</b> trajectory over <b>time</b> and across territories – is a better unit of analysis to uncover all career patterns. Based on a “survival analysis” of 2. 443 careers, a quantitative analysis tests several hypotheses to explain the variations in career patterns across regions. Two covariates of interest are more particularly tested: the effect of former regional/national experience on political career; the differences of survival rates at the regional and national levels between regionalist and national parties...|$|R

40|$|Useful type {{inference}} must {{be faster}} than normalization. Otherwise, you could check safety conditions by running the program. We analyze {{the relationship between}} bounds on normalization and type inference. We show how the success of type inference is fundamentally related to the amnesia of the type system: the nonlinearity by which all instances of a variable are constrained {{to have the same}} type. Recent work on intersection types has advocated their usefulness for static analysis and modular compilation. We analyze System-I (and some instances of its descendant, System E), an intersection type system with a type inference algorithm. Because System-I lacks idempotency, each occurrence of a variable requires a distinct type. Consequently, type inference is equivalent to normalization in <b>every</b> <b>single</b> case, and <b>time</b> bounds on type inference and normalization are identical. Similar relationships hold for other intersection type systems without idempotency. The analysis is founded on an investigation of the relationship between linear logic and intersection types. We show a lockstep correspondence between normalization and type inference. The latter shows the promise of intersection types to facilitate static analyses of varied granularity, but also belies an immense challenge: to add amnesia to such analysis without losing all of its benefits...|$|R
