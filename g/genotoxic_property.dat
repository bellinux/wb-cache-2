40|$|Hair dye {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{cosmetic}} products which are used more widely and frequently to improve an individual’s appearance. Although the genotoxic effects of dye ingredients are widely reported, hair dye in its usable form is not reported extensively. In this contribution, we report the possible mode of interaction of hair dye with DNA which leads to genotoxicity. The effect of dye DNA interaction was studied on the most popular and globally used hair dye with Calf Thymus DNA and plasmid DNA. This interaction of dye DNA was studied by spectroscopic analyses and gel electrophoresis. The result had shown positive interaction of dye with DNA. Gel electrophoresis study confirms the binding of dye with DNA which results in linearization and fragmentation of the plasmid DNA. Dye–DNA interaction causes fragmentation and oxidation of DNA in absence of any catalyst, implies high toxicity of commercial hair dyes. Thus, it can be deduced from the present studies that hair dye in its usable form may lead to its penetration through skin affecting genomic DNA possesses <b>genotoxic</b> <b>property</b> and can be treated as one of the most common mutagen...|$|E
40|$|Methylselenol {{has been}} implicated {{as an active}} anticancer {{selenium}} (Se) metabolite. However, its in vivo efficacy against prostate cancer (PCa) {{has yet to be}} established. Here, we evaluated the growth inhibitory effects of two presumed methylselenol precursors methylseleninic acid (MSeA) and Se-methylselenocysteine (MSeC) in comparison with selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenite in DU 145 and PC- 3 human PCa xenografts in athymic nude mice. Each Se was given by a daily single oral dose regimen starting the day after the subcutaneous inoculation of cancer cells. We analyzed serum, liver and tumor Se content to confirm supplementation status and apoptosis indices and tumor microvessel density for association with antitumor efficacy. Furthermore, we analyzed lymphocyte DNA integrity to detect genotoxic effect of Se treatments. The data show that MSeA and MSeC exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of DU 145 xenograft growth and both were more potent than SeMet and selenite, in spite of less tumor Se retention than in the SeMet-treated mice. Selenite treatment increased DNA single-strand breaks in peripheral lymphocytes, whereas the other Se forms did not. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cleaved caspase- 3 indices (apoptosis) from MSeC-treated tumors were higher than tumors from control mice or MSeA-treated mice, whereas the microvessel density index was lower in tumors from MSeA-treated mice. In the PC- 3 xenograft model, only MSeA was growth inhibitory at a dose of 3 mg/kg body wt. In summary, our data demonstrated superior in vivo growth inhibitory efficacy of MSeA over SeMet and selenite, against two human PCa xenograft models without the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>property</b> of selenite...|$|E
40|$|The SOS/umu {{genotoxicity}} assay {{evaluates the}} primary DNA {{damage caused by}} chemicals from the &# 946;-galactosidase activity of S. typhimurium. One of the weaknesses of the common umu test system based on spectrophotometric detection {{is that it is}} unable to measure samples containing a high concentration of colored dissolved organic matters, sediment, and suspended solids. However, umu tests with electrochemical detection techniques prove to be a better strategy because it causes less interference, enables the analysis of turbid samples and allows detection even in small volumes without loss of sensitivity. Based on this understanding, we aim to develop a new umu test system with hydrodynamic chronoamperometry using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) in a microliter droplet. PAPG when used as a substrate is not electroactive at the potential at which PAP is oxidized to p-quinone imine (PQI), so the current response of chronoamperometry resulting from the oxidation of PAP to PQI is directly proportional to the enzymatic activity of S. typhimurium. This was achieved by performing genotoxicity tests for 2 -(2 -furyl) - 3 -(5 -nitro- 2 -furyl) -acrylamide (AF- 2) and 2 -aminoanthracene (2 -AA) as model genotoxic compounds. The results obtained in this study indicated that the signal detection in the genotoxicity assay based on hydrodynamic voltammetry was less influenced by the presence of colored components and sediment particles in the samples when compared to the usual colorimetric signal detection. The influence caused by the presence of humic acids (HAs) and artificial sediment on the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>property</b> of selected model compounds such as 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4 -NQO), 3 -chloro- 4 -(dichloromethyl) - 5 -hydroxy- 2 (5 H) -furanone (MX), 1, 8 -dinitropyrene (1, 8 -DNP) and 1 -nitropyrene (1 -NP) were also investigated. The results showed that the genotoxicity of 1 -NP and MX changed in the presence of 10 mg&# 8729;L&# 8211; 1 HAs. The genotoxicity of tested chemicals with a high hydrophobicity such as 1, 8 -DNP and 1 -NP were decreased substantially with the presence of 1 g&# 8729;L&# 8211; 1 sediment. This was not observed in the case of genotoxins with a low log Kow value...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{gallic acid}} and its {{complexes}} with aluminum and iron were investigated for their antibacterial, pro-oxidative, and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> at alkaline pH. At 4. 0 μmol/mL, gallic acid displayed bacteriostatic property while aluminum-gallic acid and iron-gallic acid complexes showed bactericidal property against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. A higher antibacterial activity {{was observed in}} the turbidimetric assay compared to the well-diffusion assay. The metal complexes of gallic acid also generated a higher concentration of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide compared to gallic acid alone at > 0. 50 µmol/mL. Using the SOS response of the DNA repair-deficient Escherichia coli PQ 37, the metal complexes of gallic acid resulted to a significantly higher SOS Induction Factors (ρ< 0. 01) at ≥ 0. 25 μmol/mL. In addition, gallic acid and its metal complexes decrease the cell surface hydrophobicity of E. coli ATCC 25922 in a dose-dependent manner. The present study suggests that the antibacterial property of gallic acid and its metal complexes against Escherichia coli was caused by its pro-oxidative and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties.</b> Since metals {{are involved in the}} synthesis of the metal complexes of gallic acid, further tests should be conducted to determine their stability and effects to human health...|$|R

VKM also concluded that the data presented to evaluate the possible <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of the metabolite was insufficient to reach a conclusion. Based on this, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority rejected the approval of Aviator Xpro EC 225. The applicant has now submitted results from an in vivo study to strengthen the basis for assessment of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties,</b> and also submitted new historical controls in relation to the experimental studies on foetal developmental effects in rabbits. The VKM Panel on Plant Protection Products has discussed the questions raised by The Norwegian Food Safety Authority {{on the basis of the}} new data, and has the following opinion: On the assessment of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of the M 44 metabolite of bixafen, one of the active ingredients of Aviator Xpro EC 225 It is the view of VKM Panel on Plant Protection Products that the new in vivo mouse micronucleus study, supplemented together with a separate study demonstrating bioavailability, overrides the results of the in vitro clastogenicity studies. Taken together, it is the opinion of VKM that under the conditions studied, M 44 should be considered as nongenotoxic. On the assessment of the relevance of the foetal malformations in M 44 exposed animals VKMs Panel on Plant Protection products has assessed the arguments and new historical control data presented by the applicant, intended to show that metabolite M 44 is not teratogenic.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{migration of}} genotoxic compounds into mineral water stored in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottleswasevaluated by an integrated chemical/biological approachusing short-term toxicity/genotoxicity tests and chemical analysis. Six commercial brands of still and carbonated mineral water bottled in PET and in glass were stored at 40 C for 10 {{days in a}} stove according to the standard EECtotal migration test (82 / 711 /EEC), or at roomtemperature in the dark. After treatment, the samples were analysed using gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to detect volatile and non-volatile compounds, the Microtox test to evaluate potential toxicity of the samples, and three mutagenicity tests – Tradescantia and Allium cepa micronucleus tests and the Comet assay on human leukocytes – to detect their genotoxic activity. GC/MS analysis did not detect phthalates or acetaldehyde in the water samples. The Microtox test found no toxic effects. Mutagenicity tests detected <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of some samples in both PET and glass bottles. Statistical analyses showed a positive association between mineral content and mutagenicity (micronuclei in A. cepa and DNA damage in human leukocytes). No clear effect of treatment and PET bottle was found. These results suggest the absence of toxic compounds migrating from PET regardless of time and conditions of storage. In conclusion, bottle material and stove treatment were not associated with the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of the water; the genotoxic effects detected in bottled water {{may be related to}} the characteristics of the water (minerals and CO 2 content) ...|$|R

Here, we show that the beneficial DNA repair response triggered by these two genome caretakers critically depends on a dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of their homeostasis. The prolonged retention of DDB 2 and XPC in chromatin, due to a failure to readily remove both recognition subunits by the ubiquitin-dependent p 97 /VCP/Cdc 48 segregase complex, leads to impaired DNA excision repair of UV lesions. Surprisingly, the ensuing chromosomal aberrations in p 97 -deficient cells are alleviated by a concomitant down regulation of DDB 2 or XPC. Also, genome instability resulting from an excess of DDB 2 persisting in UV-irradiated cells is prevented by concurrent p 97 over-expression.

40|$|SummaryThe human {{bacterial}} pathogen Helicobacter pylori exhibits <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> that promote gastric carcinogenesis. H.  pylori introduces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in epithelial cells that trigger host cell DNA repair efforts. Here, {{we show that}} H.  pylori-induced DSBs are repaired via error-prone, potentially mutagenic non-homologous end-joining. A genome-wide screen for factors contributing to DSB induction revealed a critical role for the H.  pylori type IV secretion system (T 4 SS). Inhibition of transcription, as well as NF-κB/RelA-specific RNAi, abrogates DSB formation. DSB induction further requires β 1 -integrin signaling. DSBs are introduced by the nucleotide excision repair endonucleases XPF and XPG, which, together with RelA, are recruited to chromatin in a highly coordinated, T 4 SS-dependent manner. Interestingly, XPF/XPG-mediated DNA DSBs promote NF-κB target gene transactivation and host cell survival. In summary, H.  pylori induces XPF/XPG-mediated DNA damage through activation of the T 4 SS/β 1 -integrin signaling axis, which promotes NF-κB target gene expression and host cell survival...|$|R

This type of cancer is usually associated with the inhalation of asbestos, but {{on the basis of}} the most prevalent fibre in the dust from these villages, the Turkish outbreak has been attributed to the inhalation of zeolite fibres. A counter hypothesis, based on the detection of very small quantities of chrysotile and tremolite in strata samples and human lung tissue, postulates a significant role of these minerals as one of several factors contributing to pleural disease. A respirable fraction of erionite, (from Oregon, USA, but with similar characteristics to the fibres found in Turkey), has some in vitro <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> associated with many conventional carcinogens.

Acute toxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in CE; results of acute toxicity did not show any mortality. Besides, the comet assay showed that CE at a dose of 100 [*]mg/kg did not show any genotoxic effect when evaluated at 24 [*]h, whereas it induced slight damage at 200 [*]mg/kg, with the formation of type 1 comets...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dorema aucheri is a plant of Apiaceae family {{which is}} used widely in some states of Iran. Different {{extracts}} and essential oil of Dorema species contain flavonoids and cumarin compounds which have anti-hypertensive, cholesterol- and triglycerides-lowering properties. This study was undertaken to evaluate the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts of D. aucheri on human hepatoma cells using the comet assay method for safety evaluation. Materials and Methods: In this method, after incubation of cells with different concentrations of extracts, cell suspensions were added to pre-coated normal agarose slides. After lysis, electrophoresis and neutralization process, staining was done by ethidium bromide and comets were observed using a fluorescence microscope. Tail length, percentage of DNA in tail and tail moment parameters were measured. Results: Statistical analysis of the results demonstrated that concentrations more than 500 μg/ml of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extract of D. aucheri were genotoxic. Conclusion: It can be concluded from the results that taking the concentrations less than these dosages of extracts are safe but more studies are required to determine genotoxic mechanisms of this plant...|$|R
40|$|The potent {{carcinogen}} aflatoxin B 1 is a weak mutagen but {{a strong}} recombinagen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Aflatoxin B 1 exposure greatly increases frequencies of both heteroallelic recombination and chromosomal translocations. We analyzed the gene expression pattern of diploid cells exposed to aflatoxin B 1 using high-density oligonucleotide arrays comprising specific probes for all 6218 open reading frames. Among 183 responsive genes, 46 {{are involved in}} either DNA repair or in control of cell growth and division. Inducible growth control genes include those in the TOR signaling pathway and SPO 12, whereas PKC 1 is downregulated. Eleven of the 15 inducible DNA repair genes, including RAD 51, participate in recombination. Survival and translocation frequencies are reduced in the rad 51 diploid after aflatoxin B 1 exposure. In mec 1 checkpoint mutants, aflatoxin B 1 exposure does not induce RAD 51 expression or increase translocation frequencies; however, when RAD 51 is constitutively overexpressed in the mec 1 mutant, aflatoxin B 1 exposure increased translocation frequencies. Thus the transcriptional profile after aflatoxin B 1 exposure may elucidate the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>properties</b> of aflatoxin B 1...|$|R
