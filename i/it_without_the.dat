5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} from what was originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, land {{appears to}} have been held in common with an {{individual}} unable to sell <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> consent of the other owners, who in most cases were members of the same community. Prior to the arrival of the British, the concept of individual proprietorship of land had already emerged along India's west coast such that the new administration's land revenue system was not markedly different from that of its predecessor. Nevertheless, landlords never sold land without the consent of other members of the community. This communistic property rights system was known as kaniachi among the Vellalars, swastium among the Brahmins and mirasi among Muslims and Christians. In the Tanjore district, all mirasi in the village were vested in a single individual who was called the Ekabhogam. The mirasidars were required to donate {{a certain amount of money}} known as mirei to the village administration. They also paid a specified sum to the Government. In return, the mirasidars demanded non-interference by the government in the internal affairs of the villages.|$|E

Machines like the Amiga and the Commodore 64 had an international network, through which software not available on one continent would eventually make its way to every region via bulletin board systems.|$|E

Palacios was skeptical and said he would give her his answer in the morning. Agnes agreed, believing he would go through with it. Maximilian was executed 19 June 1867 in Santiago de Querétaro.|$|E

25|$|In 1966 the {{coalition}} of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) fell and a grand coalition between CDU/CSU and SPD was formed {{under the leadership of}} CDU Chancellor Kiesinger. The welfare state was considerably expanded, while social spending was almost doubled between 1969 and 1975. Changes were made to income maintenance schemes which met some of the SPD’s long-standing demands, and many other social reforms were introduced, including the equalising of wages and salaries between white-collar and blue-collar employees, the continuation of wage and salary payments, a law to promote employment, and a vocational training law. Although these measures were largely due to the efforts of the CDU minister Hans Katzer, it is arguable that he would never have been able to push his programme through the cabinet (let alone envisage <b>it)</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> SPD.|$|E
25|$|Melba made {{numerous}} gramophone (phonograph) {{records of}} her voice in England and America between 1904 (when she was already in her 40s) and 1926 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company and the Victor Talking Machine Company. Most of these recordings, consisting of operatic arias, duets and ensemble pieces and songs, have been re-released on CD. The poor audio fidelity of the Melba recordings reflects {{the limitations of the}} early days of commercial sound recording. Melba's acoustical recordings (especially those made after her initial 1904 session) fail to capture vital overtones to the voice, leaving <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> body and warmth it possessed– albeit to a limited degree– in life. Despite this, they still reveal Melba to have had an almost seamlessly pure lyric soprano voice with effortless coloratura, a smooth legato and accurate intonation. Melba had perfect pitch; the critic Michael Aspinall says of her complete London recordings issued on LP, that there are only two lapses from pitch in the entire set. Like Patti, and unlike the more vibrant-voiced Tetrazzini, Melba's exceptional purity of tone {{was probably one of the}} principal reasons why British audiences, with their strong choral and sacred music traditions, idolised her.|$|E
25|$|Elected consul for {{the second}} time in 294 BC, Megellus was given command of the forces on the {{southern}} front. He captured several towns in Samnium, but in Apulia he was routed and put to flight, and after being himself wounded he was driven into Luceria with a few of his men. Returning to Rome to recover from his wounds, he dedicated the temple of Victory in Rome, built with the fines exacted during his curule aedileship. When he had recovered, he again returned to campaign in Samnium, where he captured the towns of Milionia and Ferentinum. Contradictory accounts have Megellus also campaigning in Etruria in 294 BC, but these tend to be discounted by modern scholars. At the end of the campaigning season, he celebrated a triumph over the Samnites. This triumph was notorious, as his senatorial enemies claimed that he was not entitled to one, as he had technically left the province which the Senate had assigned to him, during his return to Rome. Disregarding the opposition, he celebrated <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> Senate’s permission, which was customary, earning him a good deal of enmity.|$|E

25|$|At last, Prospero and Roger are reunited at {{the actual}} site called Five Dials, a lone inn {{on the edge}} of the country. Here they discuss why Melichus is after Prospero: they once created a magical item together, a kind of crystal ball {{resembling}} a green glass paperweight. Since neither one can fully possess <b>it</b> <b>without</b> <b>the</b> other’s cooperation, Prospero will have some share in Melichus’ power until he is dead. They also determine that Melichus is using the mysterious book mentioned early in the story to create a permanent winter over the world. While staying the night at Five Dials they meet a small armed force that intends to attack a village across the border. Roger and Prospero thwart the army by destroying a necessary bridge and begin traveling to the village where the paperweight is kept, and where, they presume, Melichus is now. As they travel, unseasonably cold weather gradually sets in. Though the way to their destination is blocked, they find a monk herbalist who lets them in through a back entrance. Once in the village they do find Melichus studying the book. Prospero attempts to steal the paperweight, only to be transported to a different world. Melichus follows him there, but Prospero meets another wizard who takes the magical item and defeats Melichus. In the end, Prospero returns home to find that the early winter has subsided.|$|E
