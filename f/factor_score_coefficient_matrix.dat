40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{connotation}} of agricultural listed {{company and the}} related researches on capital structure theory of enterprises in China. Based on this, research hypothesis is put forward. Capital structure has positive correlation with the scale, growth and debt paying ability of agricultural listed company, and has negative correlation with the profitability, operating capability and cash capacity. Taking 37 agricultural listed companies as the research samples, a total of 15 financial indices reflecting the growth, profitability, enterprise scale, operating capacity, cash capability and debt paying ability are selected to conduct factor analysis. Based {{on the principle of}} eigenvalue greater than 1, five factors are ascertained, which can explain 84. 04 % variance of original independent variables. Factor loading matrix indicates that these five factors can be named as debt paying factor, profitability factor, scale and growth factor, operating capacity factor and cash capability factor. Multiple linear regression is carried out by taking <b>factor</b> <b>score</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> as the independent variable, and asset-liability ratio of agricultural listed company as the dependent variable. Remove method is applied under 5 % significant level. And only profitability factor can pass the test. Result shows that there is significant negative correlation between profitability and asset-liability ratio, which is inconsistent with the assumption and has supported the Pecking Order Theory. The other four factors have not passed the significant test, and have certain negative correlation with the capital structure of enterprises. Among them, correlation between the capital structure and the debt paying factor and scale and growth factor is inconsistent with the assumption. Combining with the analysis result, corresponding countermeasures for optimizing the capital structure of agricultural listed company are put forward.

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes twenty-four {{performance}} indices {{contained in}} the questionnaire that {{was used for the}} evaluation of the contributions of some factors to the current performance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Nigerian universities. The researchers surveyed forty five out of sixty three public universities that cut across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria by administering copies of the questionnaire at meetings with staff and students. The indices, through the responses, were subjected to factor analysis by principal components using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). From this analysis, four factors; namely communication and feedback, study aid, processing and administration and management and relationship were extracted and the percentage contribution of each factor to the current performance of ICT in the university system in Nigeria was estimated. It was discovered that the total sum of the percentage contributions was less than 100. This showed that the performance indices of some extraneous factors which contribute in no small measure to the current performance of ICT in Nigerian universities were not given consideration in the research instrument. Such extraneous factors include but not limited to staff training, security of lives and properties, discipline among staff and student, curriculum and government policy on ICT.

40|$|Abstract Background The SF- 36 and SF- 12 summary {{scores were}} derived using an {{uncorrelated}} (orthogonal) factor solution. We estimate SF- 36 and SF- 12 summary scores using a correlated (oblique) {{physical and mental}} health factor model. Methods We administered the SF- 36 to 7, 093 patients who received medical care from an independent association of 48 physician groups in the western United States. Correlated physical health (PCS c) and mental health (MCS c) scores were constructed by multiplying each SF- 36 scale z-score by its respective <b>scoring</b> <b>coefficient</b> from the obliquely rotated two factor solution. PCS c - 12 and MCS c - 12 scores were estimated using an approach similar to the one used to derive the original SF- 12 summary scores. Results The estimated correlation between SF- 36 PCS c and MCS c scores was 0. 62. There were far fewer negative <b>factor</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the oblique factor solution compared to the <b>factor</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>coefficients</b> produced by the standard orthogonal factor solution. Similar results were found for PCS c - 12, and MCS c - 12 summary scores. Conclusion Correlated {{physical and mental health}} summary scores for the SF- 36 and SF- 12 derived from an obliquely rotated factor solution should be used along with the uncorrelated summary scores. The new scoring algorithm can reduce inconsistent results between the SF- 36 scale scores and physical and mental health summary scores reported in some prior studies.

The published norms and scoring procedures are based on data from the US general population. The Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health (Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Australia) undertook a survey in 1996 of approximately 42, 000 Australian women in three age groups of 18 - 22, 45 - 49 and 70 - 74 years and provided age-and gender-specific norms for the SF- 36 health profile. From these data, factor weights and <b>factor</b> <b>score</b> <b>coefficients</b> were calculated for these age-and gender-specific populations of Australian women. Thus, component summary scores for physical and mental health can now be calculated using a formula standardized to the relevant Australian population. This will facilitate the interpretation of the physical and mental health component summary scores in the Australian context and will allow more meaningful comparisons within the young, middle-aged and older cohorts of Australian women in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health.

40|$|Well-prepared {{informal}} caregivers play {{an important}} role in heart failure (HF) care, so an instrument to evaluate their preparedness to care is important. To date, HF caregiver preparedness has been rarely investigated quantitatively. The Caregiver Preparedness Scale (CPS) has been used in other chronic condition populations, but its psychometric characteristics have never been tested in HF caregivers. The purpose of this study was to test the validity and reliability of the 8 -item CPS in HF caregivers. In a convenience sample of 317 HF caregivers (72. 4 % female, mean age 54), we tested the CPS' factorial structure with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and its concurrent validity with the Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care of HF Index (CC-SCHFI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We also tested CPS' reliability with composite reliability indicators, Cronbach's alpha, <b>factor</b> <b>score</b> determinacy <b>coefficient,</b> and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The CFA for a one-factor model resulted in supportive fit indices (e. g., comparative fit index. 97). Significant correlations (p <. 05) of the CPS with both the CC-SCHFI and the HADS supported concurrent validity. The composite reliability index, Cronbach's alpha, <b>factor</b> <b>score</b> determinacy <b>coefficient,</b> and ICC were. 89,. 91,. 96,. 91, respectively, supporting reliability.

Therefore, an indirect method of predicting semen traits of cocks is required by poultry farmers. The objective {{of this study was}} to use <b>factor</b> <b>scores</b> derived from <b>factor</b> analysis of body measurements to predict some semen traits of cocks. Correlation matrix was obtained by calculating the correlations between body measurements and semen traits of cocks. Kais-er-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartletts test of sphericity were used to test the appropriateness of factor analysis on the data. The extraction of the factors was done by calculating the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. Variance maximizing rotation of the transformation matrix was done to facilitate the interpretation of the factor loadings. Two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 were extracted which accounted for 76. 96 % of the variations present in the original variables. The two factors were used to obtain the <b>factor</b> <b>score</b> <b>coefficients.</b> When utilized as independent variables in multiple regression analysis, the two factors explained 53. 20 % and 40. 80 % of the variations in sperm motility and sperm concentration respectively. Factor 1 had more impact on sperm motility than factor 2 as it was significantly related to it. Factor 2 was significantly more related to sperm concentration than factor 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that Rodbard's method of noninvasively determining the anacrotic slope of the brachial artery pressure pulse wave is useful in cardiovascular epidemiology. [...] The materials were the raw records obtained for two groups of subjects aged 55 years living an Göteborg in 1969 / 70, and the cardiovascular disease information registered for these subjects in the following ten years. The method of checking on the hypothesis was to determine if there was a significant relationship between any of the eleven variables used to quantify the anacrotic slope obtained for each subject and his cardiovascular history in the follow-up period. Because an understanding of the physiological mechanisms was essential for the correct interpretation of any significant results, these mechanisms were evaluated by first submitting the variables to factor analysis and covariance analysis. [...] The means and the <b>factor</b> <b>score</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the variables were not found to be related to the development of cardiovascular disease in the follow-up period. However, a significant relationship was found between one pair of vari-ables in combination (systolic pressure and the gradient of the initial, linear portion of the anacrotic slope) and the subject's risk of experiencing a stroke in the follow-up period. [...] It was concluded that Rodbard's method has the potential to be useful in cardiovascular epidemiology because one member of the pair of variables determined to be of value (the gradient of the initial, linear portion of the anacrotic slope) can be easily obtained only by Rodbard's method. [...] Two important additional conclusions arose from the use of factor analysis and covariance analysis: it is possible to estimate peripheral resistance noninvasively where systolic pressure and the gradient of the initial, linear portion of the anacrotic slope are known, and it is not necessary to correct the variables for differences in heart rate...|$|R

A cross-sectional study on 2, 143 community-living subjects aged 60 – 92 years (33 % men and 67 % women) conducted in Santiago, Chile. Scores in 8 scales of SF- 36 -physical function (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE) and mental health (MH) -, were calculated. Factor analysis was used to extract two principal factors and logistic regression model was applied to estimate its association with socio-demographic and health variables. The internal consistency of scales was high (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 86 – 0. 87). Factor analysis retained two factors: mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) components accounting for 65. 3 % of total variance (55. 3 and 10. 0 % respectively). High correlations (0. 61 – 0. 94) between MCS and MH, V, RE and SF were obtained. PCS correlated highest (0. 72 – 0. 86) with RP, PF and BP. Self-perceived symptoms of depression (GDS- 15 C 5) was the main variable explaining low scores in both MCS and PCS (adjusted OR = 26. 9; 95 % CI: 15. 3 – 47. 2; OR = 3. 4; 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 5. 5, respectively).

40|$|We {{propose a}} new class of estimators of the multivariate {{response}} linear regression <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> that exploits the assumption that the response and predictors have a joint multivariate Normal distribution. This allows us to indirectly estimate the regression <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> through shrinkage estimation of the parameters of the inverse regression, or the conditional distribution of the predictors given the responses. We establish a convergence rate bound for estimators in our class and we study two examples. The first example estimator exploits an assumption that the inverse regression's <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> is sparse. The second example estimator exploits an assumption that the inverse regression's <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> is rank deficient. These estimators do not require the popular assumption that the forward regression <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> is sparse or has small Frobenius norm. Using simulation studies, we show that our example estimators outperform relevant competitors for some data generating models...|$|R

30|$|The {{elementary}} row transformations on the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> of self-adjoint vertex conditions {{allow us}} to bring them into their corresponding normalized forms, and the self-adjoint column transformations on these matrices give us simple one-to-one correspondences between the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrices</b> in different normalized forms.|$|R
40|$|The <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> (Green matrix) is {{composed}} of surface point offset caused by unit slip of sub-fault patches. The elements of the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> {{are related to the}} location, geometry of rupture surface, assumption of model and other factors. In this paper, we attempted to consider the Green'function <b>matrix</b> (<b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix)</b> errors in order to compensate for the effects of above-mentioned factors to some extent. The total least squares (TLS) method, which both errors of <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> and observation vector are considered, is proposed for fault slip inversion. So we dealt with the errors in both of <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> and observation at same time. And by analysis of the relations between observation vector and <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> elements, we obtained the covariance <b>matrix</b> of <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> elements and observation vector. Considering the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> was ill-posed, we used the second-order Laplace smoothing to constrain the slip parameters each other, then we used the regularized total least squares method to estimate slip distribution. the total least squares (TLS) slip inversion method was applied to simulate oblique fault event and Mw 6. 3 earthquake occurred in L'Aquila (central Italy) on April 6, 2009, respectively. To L'Aquila earthquake, the results by total least squares method indicate that the inverted geodetic moment is 3. 63 &# 215; 10 18 N&# 183;m (Mw 6. 34). With a maximum slip of 0. 95 m, and a average rake of - 96. 4 &# 176;, the main slip occurred at depth of 4 km- 15 km. The difference of slip distribution solutions between total least squares and least squares method is less than 10 - 4 order...|$|R
40|$|The Vandermonde and {{confluent}} Vandermonde matrices are {{of fundamental}} significance in matrix theory. A further generalization of the Vandermonde matrix called the q-adic <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> {{was introduced in}} [V. Mani and R. E. Hartwig, Lin. Algebra Appl., to appear]. It was demonstrated there that the q-adic <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> reduces the Bezout matrix of two polynomials by congruence. This extended the work of Chen, Fuhrman, and Sansigre among others. In this paper, some important properties of the q-adic <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> are studied.

If the <b>coefficient</b> <b>matrix</b> is sparse these iterative methods are attractive in contrast to direct methods, provided that they converge sufficiently fast.
