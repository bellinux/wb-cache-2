30|$|Many {{background}} subtraction methods {{assume that}} the scene is stationary or changes slowly.

The features for modeling the background scene, which are also used in the background-foreground classification, are very important.

40|$|Abstract: Lubrication {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the wear and friction of metal-on-metal bear-ings for artificial hip joints. It is generally known that both load and speed can influence the lubrication mechanism. This is particularly important in hip implants, which experience many intermittent start-ups and stops, which may adversely affect the lubrication and increase wear inmetal-on-metal hip implants. The effect of start-up and gait initiation upon elastohydro-dynamic lubrication (EHL) in a typical metal-on-metal hip implant has been investigated in the present study. A simple ball-on-plane model was used for a full transient EHL analysis under assumed start-up conditions represented by linear variations in both load and speed, but with different development time periods. It was shown that the duration of the start-up period had little effect on the predicted lubrication film thickness during either the start-up or the steady cyclic conditions. It was found that only two to three steps were required to estab-lish a continuous steady cyclic variation of the predicted lubricant film thickness. This suggests that <b>intermittent</b> <b>motions</b> associated with start-up and stop may have only a small effect on the wear of metal-on-metal hip implants...|$|R

5000|$|A {{married print}} {{is a film}} print which has had an optical soundtrack added onto the print. As the process usually is fairly {{expensive}} and resource-intensive, it usually {{is one of the}} last stages of post-production. Due to the <b>intermittent</b> <b>motion</b> of movie projectors and movie cameras, the sound cannot be located adjacent to the actual frames it is synced to, but instead must be offset by 21 frames (35mm). Because of this, a married print can not be edited, and thus should only be done when the picture edit has been [...] "locked" [...] (as well as the sound, of course). Marrying a print is often done at the stage of the answer print, although this is not strictly a requirement.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} straightline intermittent reciprocator {{has only}} one motion curve. By applying the TRIZ contradiction table to select proper innovative principles, we design a straightline intermittent reciprocator with a polytropic motion curve that possesses the function of variable velocity power source, under the condition of fixed velocity power source. With the Scotch-Yoke as the original mechanism, by modifying its slider and adopting the method of applying the rocker axis of rotation {{in a set of}} crank rocker four-link mechanism, we design a straightline reciprocator that possesses such variable motion curves as the variable straightline reciprocating motion, the straightline one-way variable <b>intermittent</b> reciprocating <b>motion,</b> and the straightline two-way variable <b>intermittent</b> reciprocating <b>motion.</b> In addition, by applying the BASIC program language to develop the mechanism design software, we quickly obtain the optimal design plan of the straightline intermittent reciprocator, and by means of the instance design and prototype manufacturing, proves that the achievements of our research may not only provide reference for the design of such mechanisms as the bias cutter, the surface glue cutter, and the punch fast feeder and discharger for the rubber industry, but also be used as the teaching materials and aid for the mechanism creative design...|$|R

5000|$|One {{application}} of the Geneva drive is in movie projectors: the film does not run continuously through the projector. Instead, the film is advanced frame by frame, each frame standing still {{in front of the}} lens for 1/24 of a second (and being exposed twice in that time, resulting in a frequency of 48 Hz). This <b>intermittent</b> <b>motion</b> is achieved using a Geneva drive. (Modern film projectors may also use an electronically controlled indexing mechanism or stepper motor, which allows for fast-forwarding the film.) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors go back to 1896 to the projectors of Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the Teatrograph of Robert William Paul. Previous projectors, including Thomas Armat's projector, marketed by Edison as the Vitascope, had used a [...] "beater mechanism", invented by Georges DemenÃ¿ in 1893, to achieve intermittent film transport.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the optical}} and {{mechanical}} {{elements of a}} movie camera are also present in the movie projector. The requirements for film tensioning, take-up, <b>intermittent</b> <b>motion,</b> loops, and rack positioning are almost identical. The camera will not have an illumination source and will maintain its film stock in a light-tight enclosure. A camera will also have exposure control via an iris aperture located on the lens. The righthand side of the camera {{is often referred to}} by camera assistants as [...] "the dumb side" [...] because it usually lacks indicators or readouts and access to the film threading, as well as lens markings on many lens models. Later equipment often had done much to minimize these shortcomings, although access to the film movement block by both sides is precluded by basic motor and electronic design necessities. Advent of digital cameras in reduced the above mechanism to a minimum removing much of the shortcomings.|$|E
50|$|Just {{as with a}} {{standard}} motion picture camera, the intermittent register pin camera actually stops the film in the film gate while the photograph is being taken. In high-speed photography, this requires some modifications to the mechanism for achieving this <b>intermittent</b> <b>motion</b> at such high speeds. In all cases, a loop is formed {{before and after the}} gate to create and then take up the slack. Pulldown claws, which enter the film through perforations, pulling it into place and then retracting out of the perforations and out of the film gate, are multiplied to grab the film through multiple perforations in the film, thereby reducing the stress that any individual perforation is subjected to. Register pins, which secure the film through perforations in final position while it is being exposed, after the pulldown claws are retracted are also multiplied, and often made from exotic materials. In some cases, vacuum suction is used to keep the film, especially 35 mm and 70 mm film, flat so that the images are in focus across the entire frame.|$|E

40|$|Frictional {{stick-slip}} dynamics is studied theoretically and numerically in a {{model of}} one oscillator interacting with a nonsinosoidal subtracted potential. We focus our attention on a class of parameterised one-site Remoisenet-Peyrard potential U RP (X,r), whose shape can be varied {{as a function of}} parameterÂ r and which has the sine-Gordon shape as the particular case. The dynamics of the model is carefully studied, both numerically and analytically. Our numerical investigation, which involves bifurcation diagrams, shows a rich spectrum of dynamical behavior including periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic states. On the other hand, and for a good selection of the parameter systems, the motion of the particle involves periodic stick-slip, erratic and <b>intermittent</b> <b>motions,</b> characterized by force fluctuations, and sliding. This study suggests that the transition between each of motion strongly depends on the shape parameterÂ r. However, the stick-slip phenomena can be observed for all values of the shape parameterÂ r in the range |r|> 1. The analytical analysis of the dry friction reveals that the dynamic depends non trivially on the shape parameterÂ r, which shows the importance of deformable substrate potential in the description of real physical systems.

40|$|Machines, mechanisms, vehicles, robots, {{manipulators}} are multibody configurations {{with many}} dependent contacts including impulsive and stick-slip processes, dynamic sliding, chattering; etc. Some of these phenomena are {{generated by the}} imperfect coupling between the elements. Applications of impact mechanics can require linear and onlinear combination of friction, thermal effects, dynamic plasticity, wave propagation, etc [...] Even low speed collisions can be complicated although finite element analysis now provide expanded solution capabilities. In some problems, the main interest lies not in the stresses and displacements in the contact region but rather the dynamics (velocity changes and energy loss) of the colliding objects. For problems that involve <b>intermittent</b> <b>motions</b> due to an impact prediction of the response is more difficult. In an impact, nonlinear contact forces of unknown nature are created, which act and disappear over {{a short period of}} time. Practically, in several situations simple models are advantageous. Thus, if a designer is interested in the effect upon a control strategy of a collision of a robot's end effector or an automotive engineer wishes to simulate highway speed collisions for arbitrary vehicle orientations they need fast and accuracy models. A simple model is usually sufficient to model chaotic dynamics of vibration impact. (orig.)
