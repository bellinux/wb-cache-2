40|$|The macromorphological and {{physicochemical}} characteristics of fersialitic soils from the Corbas plain {{and from the}} Saint Symphorien d'Ozon, Villete de Vienne and Pont Eveque depressions (Lyon-Vienne area), are explained, indicating their relict nature. Profiles, one from the «fersialitic with calcic reserve. group located on a fluvioglacial terrace probably dating from the fini-Wurmian period, and two from the «fersialitic» without calcic reserve,, group on moraines which show signs of cryoturbation, and of an older pedogenesis, Riss-Wurm or perhaps Mindel-Riss, are presented. The first one shows a pH of between 7 and 7, 2, a saturation level greater than 65 % and a clay illuviation index of more than 1 / 1, 4. But from the iron illuviation index and the lower level of saturation -V- in the horizon B 3 (50, 3), it would perhaps be necessary to consider this soil as being a stage between the fersialitics with calcic reserve and those without it. From its colour it should perhaps be placed between the brown and the red fersialitics. The second profile corresponds to a reddish brown acid <b>fersialitic</b> <b>soil</b> (pH less than 5), only slighthly illuviated and devoid of calcic reserve. Judging by the pH {{it belongs to the}} IX/ 22 group (CPCS, 1967) but from the clay illuviation index which is greater than 1 / 1, 4 it resembles the IX/ 21 group. Thus, it seems like a IX/ 22 -IX/ 21 slightly illuviated fersialitic intergrade. The third profile described, a red acid <b>fersialitic</b> <b>soil</b> without calcic reserve, would also be taxonomically better classified as being between IX/ 21 and IX/ 22, due partly to the pH value and the dose of iron liberation in the horizon B, and partly to the exceedingly high values of the saturation complex as well as the clay illuviation index which is greater than 1 / 1, 4...|$|E
40|$|In Camaguey, Cuba {{there is}} an surface chrome mine in need of restoration; the search for viable {{alternatives}} is an urgent need. One alternative used is initial micro organic stimulation of the soil with mineral fertilizers. However, due to {{the high costs of}} the procedure, organic sources were tried, as replacement for inorganic fertilizers. An experiment was set up at the Soil Laboratories, in Camaguey, Cuba, under semi-controlled conditions. A completely randomized design and six treatments were applied (mining sterile, ferromagnesial brownish-red <b>fersialitic</b> <b>soil,</b> originally found in the mine, from an unaltered area, mining sterile mixed with soils, manure (cattle or chicken), and a treatment using a mixture of mineral fertilizers: ammonium sulfate plus triple superphosphate, to determine the best microbiological variant. The results showed that the mining sterile was highly degraded, in comparison to the soils previously found in the site. The mixtures that contained organic fertilizers had higher microbial development, especially a treatment that included chicken manure...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{developed}} in the UBPC “The Coast”, belonging to the Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise of Campechuela municipality, Granma province, during the period from November to March of the year 2010 – 2011. It was carried out in a reddish brown <b>fersialitic</b> <b>soil,</b> according with the new genetic classification of the soils of Cuba MINAGRI, (2000), with the objective of studying and evaluating the influence of different organic fertilizers in the growth, development and yield in the cultivation of onion, variety Texas Early Grain. For this reason it was necessary to work on blocks with 4 treatments and 4 replies. The treatments applied were: treatment 1 (vermicompost), treatment 2 (cow dung), treatment 3 (cachaça) and treatment 4 (control), those were applied in a solid way. The growth variables that were evaluated were number of leaves, height of the plant, equatorial diameter, polar diameter and fresh weight of the bulb. The yield was also evaluated in t. ha - 1 per treatment. High yields are achieved with the application of organic fertilizer, among 27 and 30 t. ha - 1, this is an alternative for the sustainable production of this product which is highly demanded by the population...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{morphological}} and physico-chemical characteristics of <b>fersialitic</b> <b>soils,</b> developed on volcanic-phonolitic ash of Canary Islands. There are {{two groups of}} profiles. The first formed by young soils, rich in primary minerals. They show brown or red-brown hues, clayed textures and slightly developed structures. The other profiles are old soils, with red-brown or red hues, clayed textures with argillic horizon and very developed prismatics structures. The physico-chemical characteristics are relatively homogenous in all profiles. In each profile, these properties can show great differences between the horizons due tothe frequency of volcanic and colluvial materials with different chemical and mineralogical composition received by the soil at different stages. Barranco Hondo Alto and Las Mejoranas profiles show some characteristics that differ from the other soils, as pH, base saturation, total SiO 2, etc. We can explain these differencias by the ecological conditions {{in the first case}} and the high degree of geochemical evolution in the second.

40|$|Pb-, Zn- and Cd-bearing {{particles}} from the flotation tailing heaps of Jebel Ressas mine are carried by {{wind and water}} toward the surrounding agricultural areas. These crop-producing areas are made of <b>fersialitic</b> <b>soils</b> and developed on carbonated bedrock. The risk of ecotoxicity depends on the bioavailability fraction of metals which {{is closely related to}} their physicochemical and biological environment. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the contamination of the soils surrounding the waste dumps and to estimate the bioavailable fraction of metals present in these soils. The flotation tailings display big amounts of Zn, Pb and Cd, averaging 7. 11 %, 2. 30 % and 290 mg kg(- 1), respectively. The concentrations found in soils reach 6. 3 % Zn, 2. 3 % Pb and 290 mg kg(- 1) Cd. Analyses of the samples taken between surface and bedrock show that Pb and Zn may reach concentrations as high as 900 mg kg(- 1) 2 m below surface. Simple extraction tests show that with deionized water only Zn is mobile, with 0. 02 - 0. 03 mmol l(- 1) released from soil. The mobilization of contaminants by organic acids, secreted by plants in the rhizosphere, is potentially higher than that achieved in the presence of percolating waters...|$|R
40|$|Many soil maps {{were drawn}} up after World War II with {{different}} soil classifications that have significantly evolved since. Updating such old maps {{with a new}} version or a new classification system is always complex: (i) we do not always possess all the original information; (ii) the criteria for determining references are often different, and (iii) on the most accurate scales, correlations come up against the complexity and specificities of each classification system. On Reunion, a volcanic tropical island in the Indian Ocean, we undertook a comprehensive overview of the old existing soil studies. This article describes (i) the procedure used to update the soil maps and the toposequence acquired with the old French Commission de Pédologie et de Cartographie des Sols (CPCS) classification system, without any new information, using the World Reference Base for soil resources (WRB); (ii) {{the construction of a}} new soil map drawn up with completely new information, and (iii) a comparison of these two approaches. At elevations below 350 m asl (above sea level), without any new pedological information, we updated Brown ferruginous soils, Reddish-brown ferrallitic <b>soils,</b> and <b>Fersialitic</b> <b>soils</b> into Haplic Nitisols (Humic, Eutric). The acquisition of new data showed that this update was incorrect because not all the diagnostic criteria of the Nitic horizons were met. The correct diagnostic horizons were a Mollic horizon when the thickness was 25 cm or more, or a Cambic horizon. Leptic Phaeozems and Leptic Cambisols were then the correct Reference Soil Group (RSG). At elevations from 350 to 900 m asl, without any new information, Brown and Reddish-brown ferrallitic soils, Andic ferrallitic soils, and Brown and Andic brown soils were updated into Haplic Nitisols (Humic, Dystric) and Andic Umbrisols (Humic). The acquisition of new data showed that this update was incorrect because Andic properties and the diagnostic criteria of the Nitic horizons were not met. Over 900 m asl, Pozols were correctly updated, as were the Andosols except from 900 to 1050 m asl where not all the Andic properties were met. Without any new information, incorrect updates were observed for both the determination of RSG and the qualifiers. Despite the field descriptions, the lack of any analytical determinations on the old soil studies was a source of updating errors for the more developed soils formerly qualified as ferrallitic. In order to update limits for Andic properties and Andosols, the systematic use of analytical determinations has to be considered for updating old soil maps, as the diagnostic criteria are more restrictive than in the past.

40|$|THE CAMBONGO-NEGUNZA RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: AN EXAMPLE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DRAINAGE PATTERNS IN ANGOLA. The hydrographical {{basin of}} River Cambongo-Negunza, {{situated}} in the coastal area of central Angola, was selected {{as an example of}} the complexity of drainage patterns in Angola. From its sources in the massifs of the Marginal Mountain (more than 2 000 m) the river flows through the stepped planed erosion surfaces to the Ocean. In its lower course the river valley presents a narrow and V-shaped cross profile cut in sedimentary rocks (Cretaceous-Quaternary). The coastal erosion surface, including the raised beaches (mean altitudes from 40 to 100 m), levelling the rocks of the Sedimentary Belt and those of the ancient crystalline massif, gradually rises towards the east until a well marked topographical limit, the base (altitude approx. 280 - 300 m) of the steep western slopes of a NNE-SSW quartzitic ridge with a dissymmetrical cross-sectional profile: the serra do Engelo (altitudes between 1 400 - 1 700 m), whose faults are peppered with thermal springs. Above the coastal surface, in the crystalline rock strip, some quartzitic hills with Inselberge characteristics rise out of the plains, leading to problems in relation to, for example, the western extension of the quartzite formations and their dismantling, and the behaviour of the same material in the complex genesis and evolution processes of the extensive regional line of N-S escarpments, against which the erosion surfaces of the coastal belt end. In the limestones near the coast, the river Cambongo-Negunza has a subterranean network of large caves and galleries surfacing near the small plain from which it flows into the ocean. Not far from the valley sinks and dolines of various sizes and lapies can be seen. The climatic conditions are semi-arid, with annual precipitation less than 700 mm and high evaporation rates. Vegetation is a mix of that which can be found in savanna, steppe and xerophytic habitats, with few to no trees. A vast area of outcrops of granitic and related rocks, sometimes covered by regoliths of various thicknesses, can be found between the Serra do Engelo and the massifs of the Marginal Mountain chain. The altitudes of the general levelling range between 1 100 and 1 200 m. The area is covered by forest and savannas with low trees, shrubs and tall grasses growing in rather thin and variable <b>soils,</b> <b>fersialitic</b> being among the most frequent. The average temperature is around 22 ºC and annual rainfall is about 1 400 mm. Lateritisation or bauxitisation lines and subaerean duricrust can be seen in many places. Above this surface, there are many Inselberge-type hills, isolated or in groups, mostly with square-shaped forms, linked or not to the geometrical patterns of the hydrographic networks, revealing the structural control of fractures and faults over these watercourses, whether small or large, permanent or temporary. Note that the majority of the Inselberge is not found near the escarpments of the marginal mountain chain, the eastern limit of the 1 100 - 1 200 metre-high plain, but rather quite a distance away to the west, near the Serra do Engelo quartzitic ridge. The same can be seen in the neighbouring basins of the River Cuvo-Queve to the north and to the south of the Cambongo-Negunza river basin. Fracture valleys and residual hills call for more detailed explanations, with suggestions of criteria for their study. Moreover, there has been the concern regarding how to correlate several factors relative to external dynamics (meteorisation and erosion in a broad sense) with those relative to internal dynamics (geology and tectonics) to explain the genesis and evolution of the landforms. Therefore, the study wraps up with some brief thoughts regarding a dynamic geo-chronological approach...|$|R
