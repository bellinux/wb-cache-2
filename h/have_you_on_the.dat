Are you onta the fact that yours truly has learnt a new trade. Well he has. He could take a job stage-drivin' anywheres. They drive six {{on some of the}} stages up in Lake County.

6000|$|He leaned forward, laying {{his hand}} on Newman's arm {{compressing}} his lips and shaking his head. [...] "The fact is my dear fellow, you see, that you ought never to have gone into it. It was not your doing, I know--it was all my wife. If {{you want to come}} down on her, I'll stand off; I give you leave to hit her as hard as you like. You know she has never had a word of reproach from me in her life, and I think she is in need of something of the kind. Why didn't you listen to ME? You know I didn't believe in the thing. I thought it at the best an amiable delusion. I don't profess to be a Don Juan or a gay Lothario,--that class of man, you know; but I do pretend to know something about the harder sex. I have never disliked a woman in my life that she has not turned out badly. I was not at all deceived in Lizzie, for instance; I always had my doubts about her. Whatever you may think of my present situation, I must at least admit that I got into it with my eyes open. Now suppose you had got into something like this box with Madame de Cintre. You may depend upon it she would have turned out a stiff one. And upon my word I don't see where you could have found your comfort. Not from the marquis, my dear Newman; he wasn't a man you could go and talk things over with in a sociable, common-sense way. Did he ever seem to want to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> premises--did he ever try to see you alone? Did he ever ask you to come and smoke a cigar with him of an evening, or step in, when you had been calling on the ladies, and take something? I don't think you would have got much encouragement out of HIM. And as for the old lady, she struck one as an uncommonly strong dose. They have a great expression here, you know; they call it 'sympathetic.' Everything is sympathetic--or ought to be. Now Madame de Bellegarde is about as sympathetic as that mustard-pot. They're a d--d cold-blooded lot, any way; I felt it awfully at that ball of theirs. I felt as if I were walking {{up and down in the}} Armory, in the Tower of London! My dear boy, don't think me a vulgar brute for hinting at it, but you may depend upon it, all they wanted was your money. I know something about that; I can tell when people want one's money! Why they stopped wanting yours I don't know; I suppose because they could get some one else's without working so hard for it. It isn't worth finding out. It may be that it was not Madame de Cintre that backed out first, very likely the old woman put her up to it. I suspect she and her mother are really as thick as thieves, eh? You are well out of it, my boy; make up your mind to that. If I express myself strongly it is all because I love you so much; and from that point of view I may say I should as soon have thought of making up to that piece of pale high-mightiness as I should have thought of making up to the Obelisk in the Place des la Concorde." ...|$|E

5000|$|Little {{is known}} about Spirito's early life. As a front for his illegal {{activities}} he gave people {{the impression that he}} was a plumber or a hardware store owner. He came from the Italian community of Chambersburg, New Jersey which is now part of Trenton, New Jersey. At one time, Spirito, who was involved in loansharking and bookmaking, was considered a close associate of both Harry Riccobene and of Riccobene's half-brother, Mario. He worked in the Scarfo crime family during the 1980s, during Nicodemo Scarfo's reign. Pasquale (Pat the Cat) Spirito was an associate of made man Joseph (Joey Chang) Ciangalini who introduced Spirito into the life of organized crime. Pat earned the nickname amongst his fellow associates as 'The Cat' because of con artist charm and demeanour. He was an associate until he was the getaway driver in the murder of John Calabrese, a long-time drug dealer who served under Angelo Bruno and then became a 'made man' under Phil Testa with Francis (Faffy) Iannarella and Andrew Thomas DelGiorno at a secret induction ceremony at the home of mob associate Robert (Toro) Locicero in Vineland, New Jersey. He was married but was a constant womanizer. John Calabrese was murdered on October 6, 1981 in Southwest Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pat recruited Nicholas Caramandi, Charles Iannece, and Ralph Staino Jr. as his associates, eventually elevating them all to 'proposed members' to Nicholas Scarfo. Nicholas Caramandi said, [...] "He was greedy and ambitious, attributes that (Nicholas) Scarfo could appreciate, but he lacked the killer instinct… Spirito was a moneymaker but he was also a whiner and complainer." [...] He used to hang out at a bar, Paco's in Pennsport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Nick Caramandi would later say, [...] "If he had problems with his wife (he would send Charles Iannece or Nick Caramandi) to talk to his wife. Then we had to stay with him from eleven o'clock in the morning til one or two the next morning. Then he used to call you on the phone and <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone for two or three hours." ...|$|E
40|$|You died in Auschwitz, {{but we do}} not <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> conscience. The I. G. Farben AG. {{was founded}} from the {{association}} BASF AG, BAYER AG, Höchst AG. Then gave the main war criminal - process in Nürenberg several proceedings against various possible perpetrator groups, also enterprises, after 1945. The I. G. Farben {{was one of the most}} important companies in Europe. Which question was central? Why was a factory in Auschwitz built by the I. G. ? Why this location? Questions to persons must provide criminal law, like perpetrator research, after responsibility, after fault. All 24 accused members of the executive board and directors of the I. G. colors can not be included, this would blow up every frame of a publication. Which limitation makes sense? The I. G. plant at Ludwigshafen/Oppau was a so-called mother work for Auschwitz. The look follows inevitably Ludwigshafen on the Rhine here. Who had the responsibility for this work? In the area of the inorganic chemistry Carl Wurster, the so-called business leader, for the organic one Otto Ambros. Auschwitz should produce primarily synthetic india rubber, Ambros that is in a central position. Wurster was in the Degesch the administrative board, though, definitely the cyclone production of this Degesch also brings Wurster very near to the holocaust. Both persons have to be represented. Wurster was acquitted, sentences Ambros. Synthetic fuel should just be produced in Auschwitz. Heinrich Bütefisch was responsible here. The activity has consequently to be examined by Bütefisch. Who worked as a works manager in Auschwitz? Walter Dürrfeld. So four persons give up in central responsibility for the I. G. plant at Auschwitz in which the I. G. plant at Ludwigshafen/Oppau put a variety of employees for Auschwitz also at a middle and lower level. An interest network of the silence arose in early BASF since innumerable employees the I. G. Auschwitz came back to Ludwigshafen and replace. Bütefisch was a member of the circle of friends SS Himmler. So he was authoritatively the I. G. responsibly for donations directly on the special account empire leader SS. Million amounts were too and just donated the holocaust at the time. Many employees the I. G. who were tied into the planning of the plant in Auschwitz are conspicuous that a member was for the SS or connected Himmler directly. As a works manager of the plant at Auschwitz scrawny country had direct contact for the prisoners, the holocaust and SS people involved for among others Höß. More than 200 companies (AEG etc.) were involved in the construction of the I. G. Auschwitz. The holocaust was familiar to all workers from immediate experiences. The process in Nürenberg has failed particularly since the defendants dominated the method. The central statement is: The story of Auschwitz cannot be written without intimate knowledge of the I. G. plant at Auschwitz since an essential constituent would otherwise be at least missing. This means that considerably more fellow travelers, perpetrators and spectators were involved in the holocaust when you assume generally. Approx. 10. 000 workers have experienced the mass murder in addition to the staff of the I. G in the environment of the I. G. Farben. Auschwitz. The murders in Auschwitz are consequently in no way the SS only on to buy. founde...|$|E
