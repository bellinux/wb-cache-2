40|$|Piezoelectric monomorph, {{which has}} only one element, is a {{potential}} structure for piezoelectric applications in some extreme conditions. But as the restriction of the strain neutral layer, the traditional parallel <b>electrode</b> <b>connection</b> is not effective for sensing and energy harvesting. In this paper, perpendicular <b>electrode</b> <b>connections</b> were designed to utilize the nonuniform shear piezoelectric effect in the {{cross section of the}} monomorph, which made the monomorph avoid the restriction of the strain neutral layer. The PZT 5 ceramic monomorph was preliminarily studied in this experiment. By comparing seven forms of perpendicular <b>electrode</b> <b>connections</b> with the traditional parallel <b>electrode</b> <b>connection,</b> the whole superposed perpendicular <b>electrode</b> <b>connection</b> is considered as the optimal output way for the monomorph.

40|$|In this study, two power {{supplies}} having positive/ground and negative/ground electrode output ends were used separately for electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile nanofibers.

40|$|Currently, {{superconductor}} digital {{integrated circuits}} fabricated at HYPRES, Inc. can operate at clock frequencies of ~ 40 GHz. The circuits present multilayered structures containing {{tens of thousands}} of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions (JJs) of various sizes interconnected by four Nb wiring layers, resistors, and other circuit elements. In order to be operational, the integrated circuits should be fabricated such that the critical currents of Josephson junctions remain within the tight design margins and the proper relationships between the critical currents of JJs of different sizes are preserved. We present experimental data and discuss mechanisms of process-induced variations of the critical current and energy gap of Nb/Al/AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions in integrated circuits. We demonstrate that the Josephson critical current may depend on the type and area of circuit elements connected to the junction, on the circuit pattern, and on the step in the fabrication process at which the connection is made. In particular, we discuss the influence of a) junction base <b>electrode</b> <b>connection</b> to ground plane, b) junction counter <b>electrode</b> <b>connection</b> to ground plane, and c) counter <b>electrode</b> <b>connection</b> to Ti/Au or Ti/Pd/Au contact pads by Nb wiring.
