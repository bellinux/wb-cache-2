5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main reason it is prepared before the day it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> and stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
5|$|For his services, Ferdinand awarded Monte Sant'Angelo to Skanderbeg {{where many}} of his men soon settled. They settled fifteen villages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> landscapes {{to the east of}} Taranto. His return to Albania was greeted as a triumph by his followers. Despite the jubilation, however, Skanderbeg began to prepare for war. On 7 July 1462, the Turkish army resumed its campaigns in Albania. The first major {{engagement}} was at Mokra on 7 July 1462. In the following Macedonian campaign in August of the same year, Skanderbeg defeated three Ottoman armies in one month. On 27 April 1463, Skanderbeg and Mehmed signed a new peace treaty, but later, on 9 September 1463, Skanderbeg signed an alliance with Venice which had been preparing for war against the Ottomans. On 12 October 1463, Pius grew confident enough to declare his crusade against the Ottoman Turks which Skanderbeg joined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to some {{specific}} features (high corrosion resistance and long-life durability in particular) {{as well as}} interesting aesthetic appeal, zinc-titanium strips are widely used as roof coverings, facade panels and rain gutters.

25|$|In the USSR, {{the power}} supply system of an {{electric}} railroad is {{closely tied to the}} overall power system. Electricity arrives from substations in high-voltage power transmission lines, is converted, and then transmitted over feed and negative booster lines to the contact system and then to the rolling stock. Depending on the equipment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> stock, the power may be supplied over DC systems using single-phase systems at the commercial frequency (50 hertz) or lower (16 2/3 or 25Hz). The DC systems in the USSR had a nominal voltage of 3 kilovolts. In 1956, the Central Committee of the Soviet Union adopted the General Plan for the Electrification of Railroads - after which major rail routes were upgraded.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Reveilles protracted, painstaking, and digital production process, 2003's Apple O' was played almost entirely live to tape in one nine-hour session with Jay Pellicci engineering.

Karen O chose Apple O’ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone 2003 Music Awards, Artists’ Top Albums, and the album received some critical praise, notably in the New York Times. But in {{what was to become}} a pattern for Deerhoof, the album's critical appraisal improved with time, and Apple O' was later listed by Pitchfork {{as one of the top}} albums of the 2000s. The anti-war themes of the record were underscored by Deerhoof's outspoken opposition to that year's invasion of Iraq.|$|E

25|$|Twomey’s Calistoga Estate Vineyard, {{surrounding}} the Calistoga Winery, and Healdsburg Estate Vineyard, on the Healdsburg winery property, are planted with Sauvignon Blanc. Their sources of fruit for their Merlot, Pinot noir and Sauvignon blanc wines come from estate-owned vineyards in the Napa, Russian River and Anderson Valleys, and from independent partner growers {{who have a}} contract with Twomey to grow grapes for them. The Duncan family’s purchase of the Soda Canyon Ranch vineyard in 1999 in southeastern Napa Valley was the impetus for Twomey’s creation. They originally purchased Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard to produce Cabernet Sauvignon for Silver Oak. However, when winemaker Daniel Baron discovered it was also planted with quality French clones of Merlot, he approached the Duncans about making a Merlot using techniques he learned while working in France and Twomey began. Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> hills of southeastern Napa Valley and its volcanic soils are tightly planted with French Merlot clones.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, as many rock artists moved towards {{expansive}} {{and experimental}} psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival {{when he went}} to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde, using notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians. Other acts that followed the back to basics trend in different ways were the Canadian/American group The Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George. The back to basics tendency would also be evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones' Beggars Banquet (1968) and Exile on Main Street (1972), the Beatles' The White Album (1968) and Let It Be (1970)., The Doors' Morrison Hotel (1970) and L.A.
