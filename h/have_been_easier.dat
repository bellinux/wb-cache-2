5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the original assets, and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} original assets posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting that it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to recreate the data from the ground up.|$|E
25|$|However, no rise in population, youth bulge, or {{decline in}} {{agricultural}} production {{during this period}} has been definitively demonstrated. Nor is it clear why such pressures would have prompted expansion overseas rather than into the vast, uncultivated forest areas {{in the interior of}} the Scandinavian Peninsula, although perhaps emigration or sea raids may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> or more profitable than clearing large areas of forest for farm and pasture in a region with a limited growing season.|$|E

25|$|Under {{this job}} contract, which aimed to {{encourage}} {{the creation of new}} jobs, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier,</b> during a contract's first two years, for workers under twenty-six years old to be fired. It would have allowed employers the opportunity to terminate employment of workers under twenty-six without any reason, within their first two years of employment. Those opposed to the First Employment Contract were worried that it could compromise job security, encourage social pressure with a view to lowering wages, and impede employees in having legal recourse in cases of sexual harassment or other abuse, since this could lead to their subsequently being fired.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is famous}} for a New Year celebration where lighted tar barrels are carried on the heads of revellers called guisers. This {{tradition}} dates back to 1858. It appears to have originated from the lighting of a silver band that were carolling at New Year. They were unable to use candles to light their music due to the strong winds, so someone suggested a tar barrel be used. Having to move from place to place, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to carry the barrels upon the guisers' heads, rather than rolling them. There have been claims {{that it is a}} pagan festival, however, these claims are unfounded.|$|E
25|$|One of nine {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven, Redmond produced an outstanding performance as Birmingham outclassed Maribor in the last group stage fixture. Apart from Jovan Vidović's early header that went wide, the attacking play was all Birmingham's. After 24 minutes, Rooney scored his first European goal, a close-range header from a Redmond cross, then Žigić failed {{to take a couple}} of chances, Davies failed to make contact with a Redmond corner when it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to score, and Redmond himself hit a half-volley against the post from distance. His marker, Arghus, was perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for a high tackle born of frustration. But ten-man Braga could only draw with Brugge, so Birmingham's ten points were not enough.|$|E

25|$|According to Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organisation, all Post-Soviet {{states that}} buy gas from Gazprom should pay market prices {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of their economies. Lamy stated that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to resolve the conflict if both Russia and Ukraine had been WTO members. Moreover, {{he added that the}} problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient energy uses amongst the states. He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect {{that there is no such}} thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E
25|$|An {{early and}} {{influential}} {{book about the}} subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English, was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.|$|E
25|$|Escrivá's canonization {{was one of}} {{the first}} to be {{processed}} after the 1983 Code of Canon Law streamlined the procedures for canonization, and so it was processed more quickly than was typical before. Mother Teresa was canonized even more quickly, having been beatified just 6 years after her death (Escrivá was beatified in 17 years). According to journalist Kenneth L. Woodward, the 6,000-page long positio (the official document about the life and work of the candidate for sainthood prepared by the postulators) was declared confidential, but leaked to the press in 1992, after Escrivá's beatification. Woodward declared that, of 2,000 pages of testimonies, about 40% are by either Álvaro del Portillo or Javier Echevarría Rodríguez who, as successors of Escrivá at the head of Opus Dei, would have the most to gain from the Church recognizing that organization's founder as a saint. The only critical testimony quoted in the positio was by Alberto Moncada, a Spanish sociologist who had been a member of Opus Dei and whose testimony might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> for the Church authorities to dismiss because he had had little personal contact with Escrivá and had left the Catholic Church altogether. This critical testimony covered a mere two pages.|$|E

25|$|On {{this subject}} the king's prejudices were insurmountable, and his ministers had the {{weakness}} {{to give way}} to them. It was impossible to defend a system which confined the suffrage to 200,000 citizens and returned a chamber of whom half were placemen. Nothing would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> than to strengthen the conservative party by attaching the suffrage to the possession of land in France, but blank resistance was the sole answer of the government to the moderate demands of the opposition. Warning after warning was addressed to them in vain by friends and by foes alike, and they remained profoundly unconscious of their danger till the moment when it overwhelmed them. Strange to say, Guizot never acknowledged either at the time or to his dying day the nature of this error, and he speaks of himself in his memoirs as the much-enduring champion of liberal government and constitutional law. He utterly failed to perceive that a more enlarged view of the liberal destinies of France and a less intense confidence in his own specific theory might have preserved the constitutional monarchy and averted a vast series of calamities, which were in the end fatal to every principle he most cherished. But with the stubborn conviction of absolute truth he dauntlessly adhered to his own doctrines to the end.|$|E
500|$|The {{land around}} Waterfall Gully {{provided}} the original inhabitants {{with a number}} of resources. The bark from the local stringybark trees (Eucalyptus obliqua) was used in the construction of winter huts, and stones and native timbers were used to form tools. Food was also present, and cossid moth larvae along with other species of plants and animals were collected. Nevertheless, {{there were only a few}} resources that could only be found on the slopes, and [...] "both hunting and food gathering would in general <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> on the rich plains".|$|E
500|$|The film's title {{came from}} the song [...] "Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam", from Ratnam's Idaya Kovil (1985). Although he began work on the script while making Pallavi Anu Pallavi, Mouna Ragam did not begin {{production}} until after Idaya Kovil release. Ratnam said that due to budgetary constraints it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi, {{but he did not}} want her to be able to easily return to her parents because she could not adjust to her husband. The line [...] "Neenga thottaa kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku", spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed how she would feel on her wedding night.|$|E

500|$|Edge {{wrote that}} Titanfall major issue was the Xbox One, which {{performed}} less admirably {{compared to the}} PC version. GameSpot Chris Watters acknowledged that the PC's higher resolution was expected and that the Xbox 360 version had an even lower resolution, frame rate issues, and texture pop-in, though it still handled the game well. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that the game's visuals were [...] "lacking", with flat lighting and static environments. OXM Mikel Reparaz thought that the title {{should have been a}} launch release, where it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to overlook its sparse content. Minding the processing power behind the battles, the reviewers were not particularly impressed by the graphics. Eurogamer Dan Whitehead compared the game's aesthetics to Pacific Rim and District 9.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren {{performed}} at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands in April 2001. The festival was curated by the band Tortoise, with whom Herren toured as the opening act in May 2001. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was released on June 11, 2001 through Warp on vinyl, compact disc and download. It was Warp's second release by an American musician, following Richard Devine's Lipswitch which had been released in the previous January. The album did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. Herren was not happy on how the album was promoted, saying: [...] "I couldn't understand why they were treating me like I was 10. They were ignoring all the cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record." [...] He felt the album [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to package if I'd been from the Bronx. Instead I was from Miami, and lived in Decatur." ...|$|E

Abramowitz said that [...] "...it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to kill her off in the episode," [...] but the writers [...] "...wanted it to be a surprise and show how shocking [...] was to [...]" [...] Horvath said that [...] "...losing a loved one to a random act of violence isn't something that only happens to television action heroes or Immortals or people in another type of life, it happens in the real world too- totally unexpectedly, at a moment that makes no sense dramatically."

500|$|The {{workforce}} {{consisted of}} a mixture of German specialists and forcibly conscripted Frenchmen from the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO). They were supplemented by Belgian, Dutch, French, Polish, Czech and Soviet prisoners of war and civilian conscripts, who were used as slave labour. The labour force also included many French political prisoners and Spanish Republicans who had fled to France after General Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War but had then been interned by the invading Germans. The non-German workers lived in two camps officially known as Organisation Todt Watten Zwangsarbeitslager 62 (Forced Labour Camp 62) about [...] distant from the site, {{near the village of}} Éperlecques. The camps were guarded by the French civil police with the assistance of Belgian and Dutch Nazis and Russian POWs who had volunteered for guard duty. Although escape attempts were punished by immediate execution, there were up to three escapes daily with external assistance. The commandant of the camp is said to have complained that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to [...] "guard a sack of fleas". Over 35,000 foreign workers passed through the camps during the period in which they were operational.|$|E
500|$|Like {{most other}} {{starling}}s, the hoopoe starling was omnivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongue—long, slender, sharp, and frayed—may {{have been able}} to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak. De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of [...] "Pseudobuxus" [...] (possibly Eugenia buxifolia, a bush with sweet, orange berries). He noted that the bird weighed , and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on Réunion, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities. Its song was described as a [...] "bright and cheerful whistle" [...] and [...] "clear notes", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings.|$|E
