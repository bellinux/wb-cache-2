For this purpose, a fraction of the laser output is diverted to a small neon <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp</b> which is monitored for resonant opto-galvanic responses associated with atomic neon. As the laser is tuned, the responses are correlated with the precisely known opto-galvanic spectrum which is catalogued in memory.

The most attracting feature of rf coupling is its capability to sputter atomize conductive as well as non-conducive solid materials. The <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp</b> described here works under obstructed abnormal discharge condition in which the sample acts as a cathode. The fundamental processes occurring in rf powered glow discharges have been described for its characterization for direct solids elemental analysis. The discharge from the cathode surface, which is in contact with a water-cooled jacket, is observed side-on. The anode orifice diameter has been kept at 6 mm. In order to optimize the lamp performance the effect of discharge power, pressure, and dc self-bias potential, etc. on the emission intensity of copper spectral line (324. 7 nm) have been studied...|$|E

In the presence of oxygen, {{the change in the}} measured intensity of the lamp, obtained using standard demodulation techniques, is proportional to the oxygen column density. Measurements using an industry-standard insulated glass window indicate that the sensor can measure the amount of oxygen in a nominally argon-filled IG window (with a window gap of 10 mm) with a precision of 0. 50 % oxygen using a 16 second integration time. This level of precision is well within the limits required by the IG window manufacturing industry for proper monitoring of newly manufactured window units...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 An {{atmospheric}} pressure argon <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> {{is shown to}} detect trace levels of carbohydrates in aqueous flowing systems, using either of two <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> solution interface configurations. The first configuration consists of an oscillating <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> sustained between a flowing aqueous cathode and platinum anode. Picomole and micromolar mass and concentration detection limits, respectively, are obtained for sucrose in an aqueous flow injection system when monitoring discharge oscillation frequency or discharge current. The second configuration consists of a non-oscillating <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> sustained between metallic electrodes near the flowing output of a high performance liquid chromatography system.
