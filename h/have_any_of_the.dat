5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; {{there is a direct}} quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem does not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original context but the two works are connected in imagery {{with the idea of a}} dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E

25|$|JSL is a romanization {{system based}} on Japanese phonology, {{designed}} using the linguistic principles used by linguists in designing writing systems for languages {{that do not have}} any. It is a purely phonemic system, using exactly one symbol for each phoneme, and marking pitch accent using diacritics. It was created for Eleanor Harz Jorden's system of Japanese language teaching. Its principle is that such a system enables students to better internalize the phonology of Japanese. Since it does not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advantages for non-native speakers that the other systems have, and the Japanese already have a writing system for their language, JSL is not widely used outside the educational environment.|$|E

500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bad things, he's not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, and maybe {{he would be the}} closest thing to a superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to be more involved in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E

500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character the real casino has".|$|E
