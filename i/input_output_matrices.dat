First, we confirm the usual rejection of factor price equalization and identical technologies. Second, we develop a new technique to compute the factor content of trade when countries' technologies are different. Measuring factor content conventionally, we find a putative paucity of trade in these data. When factor content is measured correctly, theory predicts the direction and volume of trade more accurately. Thus measuring the factor content of trade according to the country of origin may vindicate the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek paradigm...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} three aproaehes to rural {{planning}} are analysed: as planning of non-urban areas, as planning {{of the villages}} and its environment, and finally rural planning integrated into the national economic structure. The first approach {{is based on the}} high degree of planibilitv of land because of its unlimited duration, its irreproducibility and divisibility. This is the approach mainly used in physical planning of rural areas, in planning of land use, in planning land reforms, in dealing with the use of water, and in forestry. In the second approach there is consideration of the village as a rural nucleus, of the rural area gravitating to it, and of inter-rural vaccuums with no settlements. Planning of this kind is found in the following cases: traditional three-field cultivation, the closed village community system, based an irrigation schemes or animal husbandry relying on open fields, common pastures and forests. It is also found in the transformation of villages from agricultural production units into service centers; in farm consolidation schemes; in the cooperative organization of villages following the principle »one village — one cooperative«; in the organization of kolkhozes; in community development planning etc. The third approach to rural planning is based on integrative planning of the socio-economic structure. Rural activities are a component part of social life, and this has to be remembered in rural planning. Rural activities need to be built into the general frame of society, {{in the form of the}} interdependent action of many centers of activity and social decision making. The basic underlying fact is that economic development leads to an ever greater specialization of production and diversification of consumption in such a way that the former is increasingly locally bound whereas the latter is more and more freed from locality. This disequilibrium is the main obstacle which rural planning has to overcome. The magnitude of the task arises from the immobility and indivisibility of the factors of production, the magnitude of the spatial units under consideration and of the level of their economic development. Increase in agricultural production changes the relation between auto-consumption and the local, regional, national and international markets. The absolute figures present a somewhat different picture. Auto-consumption does not change considerably in value, and increase of production is mainly due to access to ever greater markets. Nevertheless this tendency is neither radial nor symmetrical. The interdependence is measured with the aid of <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>matrices.</b> In spite of the integrative progress the author believes that rural planning ought to preserve its identity as a special kind of planning for the following reasons: the specific character of land; the fact that the location of activities in rural areas follows different rules from that in urban settlements; there is a difference in the degree of local determination of socio-economic activities which is greater in rural than in urban areas; disequilibrium is greater in the country than in town because of greater specialization of production and less diversification of consumption; there is a greater density of population, of traffic of goods and of capital outlay per area unit in urban than in rural areal. The aims, the actors and instrument of rural planning are analysed. Emphasis is laid on the problem of price parity, income parity and the equal opportunity of mobility, in both the horizontal and vertical sense. The idea that rural planning is an instrument of the urbanization of rural areas is rejected as both areas are subject to changes under the influence of the same forces. Rural planning has to deal with natural and economic risk. It acts as a socialized reductor of uncertainties, as a form of generalized market research, and a universal social insurance scheme. It is optimal when organized in a polycentric way. Finally the size of different social groups carrying out various social activities is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} a new generalization of the von Neumann model and to show how this model can be applied in practical economic planning. The von Neumann theory of growth is one of the best known models in mathematical economics. Since 1937, when von Neumann first published his famous article, many authors have tried to generalize his results and, therefore, have investigated in great depth the properties of the original model and those of its various generalized forms. Kemeny, Morgenstern, and Thompson (1956) changed von Neumann's original assumptions and made the model more plausible for economic applications. In 1960 Morishima introduced a nonlinear generalization of the model, in which the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>matrices</b> are nonlinear functions of variables. In 1974 J.
