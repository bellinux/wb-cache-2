40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of an unmodified hammerhead RNA {{in the absence}} of divalent metal ions has been solved, and it was shown that this ribozyme can cleave itself in the crystal when divalent metal ions are added. This biologically active RNA fold is the same as that found previously for two modified hammerhead ribozymes. Addition of divalent cations at low pH makes it possible to capture the uncleaved RNA in metal-bound form. A conformational intermediate, having an additional Mg(II) bound to the cleavage-site phosphate, was captured by <b>freeze-trapping</b> the RNA at an active pH prior to cleavage. The most significant conformational changes were limited to the active site of the ribozyme, and the changed conformation requires only small additional movements to reach a proposed transition-stat...|$|E
40|$|The phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are metal ion-dependent {{enzymes that}} {{regulate}} cellular signaling by metabolic inactivation of the ubiquitous second messengers cAMP and cGMP. In this role, the PDEs {{are involved in}} many biological and metabolic processes and are proven targets of successful drugs for the treatments {{of a wide range}} of diseases. However, because of the rapidity of the hydrolysis reaction, an experimental knowledge of the enzymatic mechanisms of the PDEs at the atomic level is still lacking. Here, we report the structures of reaction intermediates accumulated at the reaction steady state in PDE 9 /crystal and preserved by <b>freeze-trapping.</b> These structures reveal the catalytic process of a PDE and explain the substrate specificity of PDE 9 in an actual reaction and the cation requirements of PDEs in general...|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} a reductive elimination/oxidative addition (re/oa) mechanism for reduction of N 2 to 2 NH 3 by nitrogenase, based on {{identification of a}} <b>freeze-trapped</b> intermediate of the α- 70 Val→IleMoFe protein as the Janus intermediate that stores four reducing equivalents on FeMo-co as two [Fe–H–Fe] bridging hydrides (denoted E 4 (4 H)). The mechanism postulates that obligatory re of the hydrides as H 2 drives reduction of N 2 to a state (denoted E 4 (2 N 2 H)) with a moiety at the diazene (HN═NH) reduction level bound to the catalytic FeMo-co. EPR/ENDOR/photophysical measurements on wild type (WT) MoFe protein now establish this mechanism. They show that a state <b>freeze-trapped</b> during N 2 reduction by WT MoFe is the same Janus intermediate, thereby establishing the α- 70 Val→Ile intermediate as a reliable guide to mechanism. Monitoring the Janus state in WT MoFe during N 2 reduction under mixed-isotope condition, H 2 O buffer/D 2, and the converse, establishes that the bridging hydrides/deuterides do not exchange with solvent during enzymatic turnover, thereby solving longstanding puzzles. Relaxation of E 4 (2 N 2 H) to the WT resting-state is shown to occur via oa of H 2 and release of N 2 to form Janus, followed by sequential release of two H 2, demonstrating the kinetic reversibility of the re/oa equilibrium. Relative populations of E 4 (2 N 2 H) /E 4 (4 H) <b>freeze-trapped</b> during WT turnover furthermore show that the reversible re/oa equilibrium between [E 4 (4 H) + N 2] and [E 4 (2 N 2 H) + H 2] is ∼ thermoneutral (ΔreG 0 ∼ − 2 kcal/mol), whereas, by itself, hydrogenation of N 2 (g) is highly endergonic. These findings demonstrate that (i) re/oa accounts for the historical Key Constraintson mechanism, (ii) that Janus is central to N 2 reduction by WT enzyme, which (iii) indeed occurs via the re/oa mechanism. Thus, emerges {{a picture of the}} central mechanistic steps by which nitrogenase carries out one of the most challenging chemical transformations in biology...|$|R

40|$|A {{performance}} evaluation {{was made of}} a prototype liquid cooled freeze trap with sodium at 350 and 1000 deg F. The sodium freeze-off function was adequate for all test conditions encountered. The freeze-off occurred satisfactorily with the larger clearance provided by a test modification to provide 0. 030 eccentricity to the rotating shaft. Turning the <b>freeze-trap</b> handle was successful in opening the unit for gas venting when 350 deg F sodium was used. For a seal formed with 1000 deg F sodium, 16 turns of the trap handle gave no measurable gas venting at pressures up to 30 psi. Melting out the seal opened the vent satisfactorily. All the major problems encountered during the test were mechanical and associated with the rotating feature of the unit. (M. C. G. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSuperoxide reductase {{is a novel}} {{class of}} non-heme iron {{proteins}} that catalyzes the one-electron reduction of O(2) (.) to H(2) O(2), providing an antioxidant defense in some bacteria. Its active site consists of an unusual non-heme Fe(2 +) center in a [His(4) Cys(1) ] square pyramidal pentacoordination. In this class of enzyme, the cysteine axial ligand has been hypothesized to be an essential feature in the reactivity of the enzyme. Previous Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies on the enzyme from Desulfoarculus baarsii revealed that a protonated carboxylate group, proposed to be the side chain of Glu(114), is in interaction with the cysteine ligand. In this work, using pulse radiolysis, Fourier transform infrared, and resonance Raman spectroscopies, we have investigated {{to what extent the}} presence of this Glu(114) carboxylic lateral chain affects the strength of the S-Fe bond and the reaction of the iron active site with superoxide. The E 114 A mutant shows significantly modified pulse radiolysis kinetics for the protonation process of the first reaction intermediate. Resonance Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the E 114 A mutation results in both a strengthening of the S-Fe bond and an increase in the extent of <b>freeze-trapping</b> of a Fe-peroxo species after treatment with H(2) O(2) by a specific strengthening of the Fe-O bond. A fine tuning of the strength of the S-Fe bond by the presence of Glu(114) appears to be an essential factor for both the strength of the Fe-O bond and the pK(a) value of the Fe(3 +) -peroxo intermediate species to form the reaction product H(2) O(2) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Investigations of {{reduction}} of nitrite (NO 2 −) to ammonia (NH 3) by nitrogenase indicate a limiting stoichiometry, NO 2 − + 6 e − + 12 ATP + 7 H+ → NH 3 + 2 H 2 O + 12 ADP + 12 Pi. Two intermediates <b>freeze-trapped</b> during NO 2 − turnover by nitrogenase variants and investigated by Q-band ENDOR/ESEEM are identical to states, denoted H and I, formed on the pathway of N 2 reduction. The proposed NO 2 − reduction intermediate hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) is a nitrogenase substrate {{for which the}} H and I reduction intermediates also can be trapped. Viewing N 2 and NO 2 − reductions {{in light of their}} common reduction intermediates and of NO 2 − reduction by multiheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase (ccNIR) leads us to propose that NO...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) receptor converts transiently to an open-channel {{form when}} activated by ACh {{released into the}} synaptic cleft. We describe here the conformational change underlying this event, determined by electron microscopy of ACh-sprayed and <b>freeze-trapped</b> postsynaptic membranes. ACh binding to the α subunits triggers a concerted rearrangement in the ligand-binding domain, involving an ~ 1 ‐Å outward displacement of the extracellular portion of the β subunit where it interacts with the juxtaposed ends of α-helices shaping the narrow membrane-spanning pore. The β-subunit helices tilt outward to accommodate this displacement, destabilising the arrangement of pore-lining helices, which in the closed channel bend inward symmetrically to form a central hydrophobic gate. Straightening and tangential motion of the pore-lining helices effect channel opening by widening the pore asymmetrically and increasing its polarity {{in the region of}} the gate. The pore-lining helices of the αγ and δ subunits, by flexing between alternative bent and straight conformations, undergo the greatest movements. This coupled allosteric transition shifts the structure from a tense (closed) state toward a more relaxed (open) state...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} tryptophan radicals (W(a) and W(b)) with lifetimes {{of several}} minutes {{at room temperature}} are formed during the reconstitution of the diiron center in the Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase mutant protein R 2 Y 122 F. Detailed hyperfine parameters are {{for the first time}} determined for protein-linked oxidized neutral tryptophan radicals. W(a) is <b>freeze-trapped</b> and investigated by EPR and ENDOR in protonated and selectively deuterated proteins at 20 K. Two hyperfine couplings from the β-methylene protons, hyperfine tensors of two α-protons, and the complete nitrogen hyperfine tensor are determined. Based on the absence of a large hyperfine coupling from the N-H proton, which would be expected for a cation radical, and on comparison of the experimental data with theoretical spin densities from density functional calculations, W(a) is assigned to an oxidized neutral tryptophan radical. A small anisotropic hyperfine coupling detected in selectively deuterated W(a) is tentatively assigned to a proton which is hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen of W(a). A similar spin density distribution as for W(a) is obtained also for the second tryptophan radical, W(b), observed by EPR at room temperature, which is also assigned to an oxidized neutral radical...|$|R
40|$|The 31 P NMR {{spectrum}} of energy-related metabolites under strictly aerobic conditions in rapidly respiring tissues under physiological conditions has {{been approached by}} {{the study of the}} 31 P NMR signals in vivo and in <b>freeze-trapped</b> organs. Freezing the head of the anesthetized animal by liquid N 2, excision of the brain tissue (white and gray matter) at - 196 °, and transfer to the NMR tube occurs without alteration of the metabolite concentrations. The sample is warmed to the region - 15 ° to - 10 °, at which temperatures there is sufficient mobility for recording 31 P NMR at concentrations characteristic of brain tissues (∼ 5 mM) with an adequate signal to noise ratio in 10 min but insufficient mobility for significant enzymatic activity. A ∼ 0. 4 -sec acquisition time is adequate for nuclear relaxation and a 10 -min scan gives an adequate signal to noise ratio. Metabolism of creatine phosphate, Pi, and sugar phosphates occurs by 1 hr at - 10 ° and 2 hr at - 12 °. Extrapolation of the approximately zero order kinetics of disappearance of creatine phosphate and appearance of Pi suggests that < 10 % of these two metabolites has been altered in {{the time of the first}} measurement...|$|R
40|$|The {{positions}} of the ordered hydrogen isotopes of a protein and its bound solvent can be determined by using neutron crystallography. Furthermore, by collecting neutron data at cryo temperatures, the dynamic disorder within a protein crystal is reduced, which may lead to improved definition of the nuclear density. It has proved possible to cryo-cool very large Con A protein crystals (> 1. 5 mm 3) suitable for high-resolution neutron and x-ray structure analysis. We can thereby report the neutron crystal structure of the saccharide-free form of Con A and its bound water, including 167 intact D 2 O molecules and 60 oxygen atoms at 15 K to 2. 5 -Å resolution, along with the 1. 65 -Å x-ray structure of an identical crystal at 100 K. Comparison with the 293 -K neutron structure shows that the bound water molecules are better ordered and have lower average B factors than those at room temperature. Overall, twice as many bound waters (as D 2 O) are identified at 15 K than at 293 K. We note that alteration of bound water orientations occurs between 293 and 15 K; such changes, as illustrated here with this example, could be important more generally in protein crystal structure analysis and ligand design. Methodologically, this successful neutron cryo protein structure refinement opens up categories of neutron protein crystallography, including <b>freeze-trapped</b> structures and cryo to room temperature comparisons...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{show that}} the active portion of a graphitic {{nanoparticle}} can be mimicked by a perylene diimide (PDI) to explain the otherwise elusive biological and electrocatalytic activity of the nanoparticle construct. Development of molecular analogues that mimic the antioxidant properties of oxidized graphenes, {{in this case the}} poly(ethylene glycolated) hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG–HCCs), will afford important insights into the highly efficient activity of PEG–HCCs and their graphitic analogues. PEGylated perylene diimides (PEGn–PDI) serve as well-defined molecular analogues of PEG–HCCs and oxidized graphenes in general, and their antioxidant and superoxide dismutase-like (SOD-like) properties were studied. PEGn–PDIs have two reversible reduction peaks, which are more positive than the oxidation peak of superoxide (O 2 •–). This is similar to the reduction peak of the HCCs. Thus, as with PEG–HCCs, PEGn–PDIs are also strong single-electron oxidants of O 2 •–. Furthermore, reduced PEGn–PDI, PEGn–PDI•–, in the presence of protons, was shown to reduce O 2 •– to H 2 O 2 to complete the catalytic cycle in this SOD analogue. The kinetics of the conversion of O 2 •– to O 2 and H 2 O 2 by PEG 8 –PDI was measured using <b>freeze-trap</b> EPR experiments to provide a turnover number of 133 s– 1; the similarity in kinetics further supports that PEG 8 –PDI is a true SOD mimetic. Finally, PDIs can be used as catalysts in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in water, which proceeds by a two-electron process with the production of H 2 O 2, mimicking graphene oxide nanoparticles that are otherwise difficult to study spectroscopically...|$|R

Two different tryptophan radicals (Wa° and W 0 °) with life-times of several minutes are formed at room temperature. Wa° is <b>freeze-trapped</b> and investigated by EPR and ENDOR in normal and selectively deuterated proteins at 20 K Two hyperfine couplings from the βmethylene protons, hyperfine tensors of two a-protons and the complete nitrogen hyperfine tensor are determined. Based on {{the absence of a}} large hyperfine coupling from the N-H proton, which could be expected for a cation radical, and on comparison of the experimental data with theoretical spin densities from density functional calculations, WV is assigned to an oxidized neutral tryptophan radical. A small anisotropic hyperfine coupling detected in selectively deuterated W. " is tentatively assigned to a proton which is hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen of VW. A similar spin density distribution was obtained also for the second tryptophan radical. WV observed at room temperature by stopped-flow EPR is also assigned to an oxidized neutral radical. The site of Wa° and WtT in protein R 2 has been determined from the comparison of the conformation of the βprotons (from EPR data) with X-ray structure data to W 111 and W 107, respectively, in close neighborhood to the iron center.

40|$|NAD+/NADH redox {{state has}} been implicated in many {{diseases}} such as cancer and diabetes {{as well as in}} the regulation of embryonic development and aging. To fluorimetrically assess the mitochondrial redox state, Dr. Chance and co-workers measured the fluorescence of NADH and oxidized flavoproteins (Fp) including flavin–adenine–dinucleotide (FAD) and demonstrated their ratio (i. e. the redox ratio) is a sensitive indicator of the mitochondrial redox states. The Chance redox scanner was built to simultaneously measure NADH and Fp in tissue at submillimeter scale in 3 D using the <b>freeze-trap</b> protocol. This paper summarizes our recent research experience, development and new applications of the redox scanning technique in collaboration with Dr. Chance beginning in 2005. Dr. Chance initiated or actively involved in many of the projects during the last several years of his life. We advanced the redox scanning technique by measuring the nominal concentrations (in reference to the frozen solution standards) of the endogenous fluorescent analytes, i. e., [NADH] and [Fp] to quantify the redox ratios in various biological tissues. The advancement has enabled us to identify an array of the redox indices as quantitative imaging biomarkers (including [NADH], [Fp], [Fp]/([NADH]+[Fp]), [NADH]/[Fp], and their standard deviations) for studying some important biological questions on cancer and normal tissue metabolism. We found that the redox indices were associated or changed with (1) tumorigenesis (cancer versus non-cancer of human breast tissue biopsies); (2) tumor metastatic potential; (3) tumor glucose uptake; (4) tumor p 53 status; (5) PI 3 K pathway activation in pre-malignant tissue; (6) therapeutic effects on tumors; (7) embryonic stem cell differentiation; (8) the heart under fasting. Together, our work demonstrated that the tissue redox indices obtained from the redox scanning technique may provide useful information about tissue metabolism and physiology status in normal and diseased tissues. The Chance redox scanner and other redox imaging techniques may have wide-ranging potential applications in many fields, such as cancer, diabetes, developmental process, mitochondrial diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging...|$|R
