50|$|Most {{packaging}} {{is printed}} using flexography, {{because it is}} more versatile over the range of materials used in packaging. However, the image quality of flexographic prints is often inferior to offset presses, and it is important to simulate the characteristics of the press in the proofs so that customers have realistic expectations for the <b>final</b> <b>packaging.</b> Similarly certain materials, such as corrugated cardboard, add their own characteristics to the image, and these too need to be simulated.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} related to textile {{industry}} especially to Yarn manufacturing process. Textile {{is one of the}} biggest manufacturing industries in India. Defects rate of product plays a very important role for the improvement of yield and financial conditions of any company. Actually defects rate causes a direct effect on the profit margin of the product and decrease the quality cost during the manufacturing of product. Companies strive to decrease the defects rate of the product during the manufacturing process as much as possible. By checking and inspection of defects of product at different point in a production cycle and management implement some changes specifically at those points in production where more defects are likely to happen. The paper of defects rate of textile product in the yarn manufacturing process is so important in industry point of view. This process has large departments where the cotton passes in different process and may be effects the quality of yarn when it reaches the package form. A thousand defects opportunities create in the <b>final</b> <b>package</b> of yarn.

50|$|The {{use of an}} inert {{blanketing}} gas {{for food}} products helps to keep oxygen levels low {{in and around the}} product. Low levels of oxygen surrounding the product help {{to reduce the amount of}} oxidation that may occur, and increases shelf life. In the case of cooking oils, lipid oxidation can cause the oil to change its color, flavor, or aroma. It also decreases the nutrient levels in the food and can even generate toxic substances. Tank blanketing strategies are also implemented to prepare the product for transit (railcar or truck) and for <b>final</b> <b>packaging</b> before sealing the product.|$|E

40|$|Results of wafer level {{packaging}} for micro-electro-mechanical systems {{based on}} {{low temperature melting}} metallurgy {{are going to be}} presented. The MEMS are packaged under vacuum with internal pressure in the range of 1 mbar after sealing. Through Silicon Vias in a silicon interposer allow the feeding of the electrical contacts to the package outside. The thin silicon interposer acts as MEMS carrier or lid and therefore is part of the <b>final</b> <b>packaged</b> component after dicing. AuSn rings have been chosen for process compatibility with the MEMS and ensure the hermeticity of the components after vacuum sealing. Evaluation of the bond process is carried out using XRay imaging microscopy, analysis of cross sections and the <b>final</b> <b>package</b> resistance is evaluated using shear testing. The thickness of the chip-scale packaged MEMS is smaller than 500 mu m and a yield of vacuum sealing of around 80 % was obtained in first evaluation on 200 mm wafer scale...|$|R

50|$|Since early 2007, {{the company}} has {{received}} three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy. The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices. The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and <b>final</b> <b>packaging</b> areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence {{of these and other}} problems. The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.|$|E

40|$|The liberalized {{market economy}} {{introduced}} by the Sri Lankan government in 1977, increased competition in the local market, resulting in a high demand for the quality packs on for most consumer product. The quantum leap in packaging development owes itself to the high demand created by the above reason. The growth of packaging industry also is direct reactive response to the same. High cost of packaging and its frequent changes {{has become one of}} the main barriers for Sri Lankan manufactures to be competitive. The parameters in the macro environment are continuously subject to change and have to a greater extended, have an effect on the cost & quality of the Sri Lankan product. Identifying the factors which influence cost with their degree of influence & and effectively managing them will help to control the cost of the <b>final</b> <b>packaging</b> material. Rigid plastic, flexible plastic and paper & paper board packaging material prices have been governed by their direct raw material component & they are all imported materials. Local value addition costs including labour, energy & other overheads together contribute around 30 to 40 %. During the last three years price changes of <b>final</b> <b>packaging</b> material is mainly coursed by the fluctuation of cost of raw material, labour & electricity. Economic factors such as parity, crude oil prices & inflation too have influence the cost of packaging marital but indirectly through the plastic raw material component...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{study the}} {{packaging}} of DNA into a bacteriophage capsid using computer simulation, specifically {{focusing on the}} potential impact of twist on the <b>final</b> <b>packaged</b> conformation. We perform two dynamic simulations of packaging a polymer chain into a spherical confinement: one where the chain end is rotated as it is fed, and one where the chain is fed without end rotation. The <b>final</b> <b>packaged</b> conformation exhibits distinct differences in these two cases: the packaged conformation from feeding with rotation exhibits a spool-like character that is consistent with experimental and previous theoretical work, whereas feeding without rotation results in a folded conformation inconsistent with a spool conformation. The chain segment density shows a layered structure, which is more pronounced for packaging with rotation. However, in both cases, the conformation is marked by frequent jumps of the polymer chain from layer to layer, potentially influencing the ability to disentangle during sub-sequent ejection. Ejection simulations with and without Brownian forces show that Brownian forces are necessary to achieve complete ejection of the polymer chain in the absence of external forces...|$|R
