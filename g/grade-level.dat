5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of the Ben Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction.

25|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. In underground stations, this typically consists of the first level below the street or the areas between the street and platform level. For open-cut, <b>grade-level</b> and elevated stations, prevalent in uptown Manhattan and the outer boroughs, the mezzanine area often consists of a station house at street level or above the street. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. At busy intersections, they also act as a pedestrian underpass or overpass. They also allow for crossover between uptown and downtown trains on side platforms or a pair of island platforms, which is very useful when local tracks are closed for construction. Within the mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In underground subway stations built close to ground level or under narrow streets, a characteristic of early IRT and BMT construction, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers.

Using statewide data from the 2004 - 2005 school year, we examined the relationships between school-level indicators of student achievement on nationally-normed tests and proportions of alternatively certified teachers, while controlling for building type and other relevant covariates.

The results of the survey and interview indicate that the most important influence on young female students is their parents. Although peers play some role when AP females share their workload with other AP females, peer influence is negligible when compared to parental influence. The importance of teachers, be they male or female, is second only to parents. Female students seek the advice and recommendations of teachers when they select which courses to enroll. In addition, young female students are more apt to choose advanced courses in the biological sciences rather than the physical sciences.

40|$|The {{degree to}} which gifted {{students}} are able to contrib-ute significantly to the good of society and to lead self-fulfilled lives depends, in no small measure on their ability to communicate with honesty and precision and without bias. The rationale on which this statement is based and the implications it has for teachers of the gifted are the subject of this article. The intent is not to suggest a list of activities for use at particular <b>grade-levels</b> but to consider a basis for developing curriculums in communication skills at all levels. Prompted by demonstrated need, many industries are systematically teaching employees how to communi-cate with each other. Problems in employment most generally arise not because of not knowing how to do the job but because there has been a so-called &dquo;breakdown&dquo; in communications. The success which industries are having in teaching communication skills, thereby lessen-ing tension and increasing productivity, suggests that communication skills can be taught and learned. The schools would appear to be a natural place for such learn-ing to occur, and opportunity should be given to all students to learn these skills. However, {{the purpose of this article}} is to suggest that gifted students be given the opportunity to learn communication skills at levels appro-priate to their special needs and abilities. The progression of educational objectives in the Affective domain as out-lined by Krathwohl, Bloom and Masia (1956) suggests a framework of sequential learnings which, like the Bloom taxonomy of educational objectives in the cognitive do-main, allows gifted students to explore upper level learn-ings not usually dealt with in the regular classroom...|$|R

40|$|We are {{currently}} witnessing {{an increase of}} international interest in mathematics education, fueled partly by the growing concerns of students’ declining results, but also by changed perceptions of what mathematics students should master. In response, many initiatives have appeared {{in order to move}} away from traditional to more inquiry based approaches to teaching. Though several small-scale studies have contributed much to our understanding on how to support teachers in this work, there is still a lack of research conducted on a larger scale. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to add to our knowledge of how to support instructional improvement at scale. This is done by focusing on two common approaches to support mathematics teachers’ development of reform based practices: teacher professional development [PD] programs and curriculum materials. The thesis builds on four papers which are all connected to a project aiming at improving the mathematics instruction in a large Swedish municipality. The project includes a PD-program for almost 400 elementary teachers and the mathematics curriculum materials that teachers are using {{play a central role in}} the program. The first two papers focus on curriculum materials either by using surveys to compare teachers’ views of the support offered in the materials and their reported mathematics instruction, or by conducting textbook analyses to characterize how some commonly used materials communicate about, for example, goals of lessons. The results demonstrate that teachers using different materials experience different levels of support from them and also show variations in their reported instruction. These differences are further reflected in the textbook analyses which show that the materials offer teachers various support, for example regarding how they communicate about goals. The last two papers focus on teacher PD-programs either by comparing the effects of two programs on student achievement, or by using surveys to examine teachers’ views of one of the programs and its impact on their reported instruction. The results indicate that the two PD-programs have affected students’ achievement in different ways, demonstrating both decline and improvement. Even within the programs differences are revealed between students at the primary and secondary levels. These variations are further present in the teacher surveys, where the results show differences between teachers from different <b>grade-levels.</b> By drawing on the literature review and the results of the papers, the thesis ends with a discussion of possible elaborations of a widely used core conceptual framework for studying teacher PD...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research {{study was to explore}} the relationship between students' perceptions of their physical education (PE) classes and their level of leisure-time physical activity (PA). Three psychosocial constructs (enjoyment, self-efficacy, and social support) were examined in the context of physical education. Past research indicates that these constructs influence participation in leisure-time PA. This study attempted to characterize the influence that PE has on leisure-time PA. This study had two objectives. The first was to understand the relationship between PE and leisure-time PA. Secondly, the relationships among enjoyment, self-efficacy, and social support were examined in order to explore enjoyment as a mediator between both self-efficacy and enjoyment and social support and enjoyment, in the context of PE and leisure-time physical activity. Males and females between 13 and 18 years of age (n = 663) were surveyed in their PE classes by trained volunteers. Enjoyment, self-efficacy and social support were examined using a questionnaire that was developed for this study. Physical activity was assessed using a summer-time PA inventory, from which median minutes per day of PA were calculated for each participant. The results of independent samples t-tests indicate that males reported significantly higher scores on the enjoyment assessment than females, and a significantly higher number of median minutes per day of PA compared to females. Among white students, self-efficacy scores were significantly higher than within the minority sub-group. Results also indicate that 12 th graders reported higher scores on the social support assessment than did all remaining <b>grade-levels.</b> Weak to moderate correlations were found among the psychosocial constructs. Results of the regression analyses show that none of the possible covariates were significant predictors of participation in leisure-time PA. Enjoyment was not a mediator between self-efficacy and total PA, and social support and total PA. The sub-group that reported the highest enjoyment scores also reported the most minutes of total PA (males). However, the exact relationship between PE and participation in leisure-time PA is still unclear. Complex factors contribute to peoples' adoption and long term maintenance of PA. Enjoyment, social support, and self-efficacy do not exist independent from one another. Rather, they seem to influence each other. The exact nature of this influence is not fully understood. Future research is still necessary to better understand the complex relationships that were examined...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{educators}} have become ever {{more aware of}} the critical role that vocabulary knowledge plays in the academic lives of their students. Vocabulary knowledge is fundamental to the comprehension of text and is most effective when it relates new words to students’ existing vocabulary and background knowledge. Effective vocabulary instruction provides multiple exposures through rich and varied activities that are meaningful and relevant to English learning (EL) students (Marzano 2004). This helps them gain ownership and understanding of the words, instead of just learning them well enough to pass a test. Nagy and Scott (2000) noted that “knowing a vocabulary word means being able to do things with it” (p. 273). The principles of effective vocabulary instruction recommended for language arts {{can be applied to the}} content area of science. However, science instruction can be especially challenging for EL students who are faced with learning both the language of science and the English language at the same time. Even though EL students bring a wealth of cultural and linguistic knowledge with them to school, research has shown that these students tend to lag behind their native- English speaking peers in their levels of academic achievement (Echevarria, Short, and Powers 2006). EL students are less likely to have the vocabulary needed to comprehend informational text, so instruction that helps build both general academic and content-specific vocabulary knowledge is particularly critical while promoting language development. Even EL students who appear fluent in English frequently need assistance in learning the academic language of science. The vocabulary of science can be particularly problematic. Words such as work, table, and wave take on meanings specific from those of everyday usage. Additionally, vocabulary words such as hypothesis and analysis have precise meanings in science that differ from the manner in which the words are used in everyday life (Powers and Stanfield 2009). The goal of this article is to briefly discuss vocabulary instructional strategies and describe how they actively engage EL students in the science vocabulary learning process. Each vocabulary strategy offers students the opportunity to build and extend upon their understanding of a word’s meaning and to make personal connections with the science content. Marzano (2004) suggests that vocabulary instruction is most effective when it targets academic terms that students will encounter throughout their reading materials. All of the vocabulary words and concepts introduced throughout this article were taken from the district’s science program for fourth graders. Even though the vocabulary words were selected from the textbook, these strategies can easily be used with informational books. Examples from the classroom experiences are used to illustrate each instructional strategy; however, all of these strategies can be used at all <b>grade-levels...</b>|$|R
