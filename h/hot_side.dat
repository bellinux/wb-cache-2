25|$|As the {{pressure}} increases, a point is reached where {{the pressure}} differential across the displacer rod becomes {{large enough to}} begin to push the displacer rod (and therefore also the displacer) towards the piston and thereby collapsing the cold space and transferring the cold, compressed gas towards the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> in an almost constant volume process. As the gas arrives in the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> the pressure increases and begins to move the piston outwards to initiate the expansion step as explained in (1).|$|E
25|$|A {{thermocouple}} {{can produce}} current to drive some processes directly, {{without the need}} for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The electrical energy generated by a thermocouple is converted from the heat which must be supplied to the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the thermocouple tends to cause the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the Peltier effect).|$|E
25|$|Designing Stirling engine heat {{exchangers}} is {{a balance between}} high heat transfer with low viscous pumping losses, and low dead space (unswept internal volume). Engines that operate at high powers and pressures require that {{heat exchangers}} on the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> be made of alloys that retain considerable strength at high temperatures and that don't corrode or creep.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{thermoelectric}} effect, now, {{consider the}} case of uniform voltage (uniform chemical potential) with a temperature gradient. In this case, at the <b>hotter</b> <b>side</b> of the material there is more variation in the energies of the charge carriers, compared to the colder side. This means that high energy levels have a higher carrier occupation per state on the <b>hotter</b> <b>side,</b> but also the <b>hotter</b> <b>side</b> has a lower occupation per state at lower energy levels. As before, the high-energy carriers diffuse away from the hot end, and produce entropy by drifting towards the cold end of the device. However, there is a competing process: at the same time low-energy carriers are drawn back towards the hot end of the device. Though these processes both generate entropy, they work against each other in terms of charge current, and so a net current only occurs if one of these drifts is stronger than the other. The net current is given by , where (as shown below) the thermoelectric coefficient [...] depends literally on how conductive high-energy carriers are, compared to low-energy carriers. The distinction may be due to a difference in rate of scattering, a difference in speeds, a difference in density of states, or a combination of these effects.|$|R

25|$|Direct contact {{membrane}} distillation (DCMD). Applicable to desalination. Heated seawater is passed along {{the surface of}} a hydrophobic polymer membrane. Evaporated water passes from the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> through pores in the membrane into a stream of cold pure water on the other side. The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through.|$|E
25|$|When {{one side}} of the piston is open to the atmosphere, the {{operation}} is slightly different. As the sealed volume of working gas comes in contact with the <b>hot</b> <b>side,</b> it expands, doing work on both the piston and on the atmosphere. When the working gas contacts the cold side, its pressure drops below atmospheric pressure and the atmosphere pushes on the piston and does work on the gas.|$|E
25|$|A {{dehumidification}} chamber {{can be an}} unvented system (closed loop) or {{a partially}} vented system which uses a heat pump to condense moisture from the air using cold side of the refrigeration process (evaporator.) The heat thus gathered {{is sent to the}} <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> of the refrigeration process (condenser) to re-heat the air and returns this drier and warmer air inside the kiln. Fans blow the air through the piles as in a normal kiln. These kilns traditionally operate from 100°F to 160°F and use about half the energy of a conventional kiln.|$|E

40|$|New HCEs were {{installed}} on the <b>hot</b> <b>sides</b> of the thermal loops at SEGS VIII and IX from mid- 2007 to mid- 2008. Due to significant increases in plant performance, an interest in a further increase performance by installing new HCEs on the cold portions of the loop developed. Although {{it was assumed that}} the plant performance would increase, the exact amount was unknown. The objective of this project was to estimate the performance improvements with new HCEs {{installed on the}} cold sides of the loop, with performance being evaluated as potential increases in electrical power production (megawatt-hours). A comparison of performance prior to and post installation of new HCEs on the <b>hot</b> <b>sides</b> of the loops was done. For completeness, an estimate of performance losses - such as the optical efficiency, mirror reflectivity, and optical accuracy - was also included in this analysis.

2500|$|The Franchot {{engine is}} a double acting engine invented by [...] in the nineteenth century. A double acting engine {{is one in which}} both sides of the piston are acted upon by the {{pressure}} of the working fluid. One of the simplest forms of a double acting machine, the Franchot engine consists of two pistons and two cylinders and acts like two separate alpha machines. In the Franchot engine, each piston acts in two gas phases, which makes more efficient use of the mechanical components than a single acting alpha machine. However, a disadvantage of this machine is that one connecting rod must have a sliding seal at the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> of the engine, which is difficult when dealing with high pressures and temperatures.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{essential}} that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the [...] "hot" [...] heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the <b>hot</b> <b>side</b> and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the coefficient of performance (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.|$|E

40|$|The Hawaiian Kea and Loa volcano trends have {{commonly}} {{been interpreted}} as directly reflecting a compositional zonation within the Hawaiian plume stem, {{inherited from the}} lowermost mantle. As this zonation {{is often associated with}} variations in mafic material, and as such materials, especially eclogites, impact mantle flow, this study aims to characterize the ascent and melting of bilaterally-zoned thermochemical plumes. Our geodynamic models predict that plumes bearing ≿ 12 % eclogite tend to stagnate as a deep eclogitic pool (DEP) in the mid upper mantle where phase changes lead to a maximum in eclogite excess density. This behavior can explain recent seismic-tomography results, and predicts thermal asymmetry of material rising out of the DEP to feed the hotspot. Thermal asymmetry is caused by the effects of ambient-mantle flow or plume-stem zonation on DEP dynamics, and ultimately boosts peridotite melting on the melting zone’s <b>hotter</b> <b>side.</b> This <b>hotter</b> <b>side</b> is hence less dominated by melting of mafic materials, despite being fed by equally or more such materials than the cooler side. These results suggest that the Kea side of the Hawaiian Plume is equally or more eclogitic than the Loa side, opposite to previous interpretations. Care should thus be taken in mapping geographical variations in lava chemistry into the deep mantle...|$|R
