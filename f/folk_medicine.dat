5|$|Recently, some {{compression}} clothing with inter-woven copper {{has been}} marketed with health claims {{similar to the}} <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> claims. Because compression clothing is a valid treatment for some ailments, the clothing may have that benefit, but the added copper may have no benefit beyond a placebo effect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Natural sources used as <b>folk</b> <b>medicines</b> in Merzifon were {{investigated}} in this study. It {{was determined that}} 35 plant and 4 animal species together with 3 animal and 1 inorganic sources are being used as various preparations of <b>folk</b> <b>medicines</b> in Merzifon area. All the collected medicinal plants were identified and voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of Hacettepe University, Faculty of Pharmacy (HUEF). Local names, part(s) used, methods of preparation and traditional usages of <b>folk</b> <b>medicines</b> are given in this paper. Traditional herbal medicines were mostly used for gastrointestinal system diseases, heart and circulatory system disorders. When our findings were compared with previously published literatures on <b>folk</b> <b>medicines</b> in Turkey, new local names for 4 species and different usages for 6 plants were found. Moreover, Scorzonera eriphora DC. and Beta trigyna Waldst & Kit. {{were found to be}} used as <b>folk</b> <b>medicines</b> in Turkey {{for the first time in}} this study...|$|R

5|$|The {{biguanide}} {{class of}} antidiabetic drugs, {{which also includes}} the withdrawn agents phenformin and buformin, originates from the French lilac or goat's rue (Galega officinalis), a plant used in <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> for several centuries.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{has yielded}} at least 64 {{isoquinoline}} alkaloids, which include anti-parasitic (e.g. candimine) and psychopharmacological activity {{due to their}} high alkaloid content. One alkaloid isolated from Hippeastrum vittatum (montanine) has demonstrated antidepressant, anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties. Hippeastrum puniceum may also have therapeutic properties {{as it has been}} used in <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> to treat swellings and wounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} {{guinea pig}} {{plays an important}} role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> and in community religious ceremonies.

5|$|Bluebells {{synthesise}} a {{wide range}} of chemicals with potential medicinal properties. They contain at least 15 biologically active compounds that may provide them with protection against insects and animals. Certain extracts – water-soluble alkaloids – are similar to compounds tested for use in combating HIV and cancer. The bulbs of bluebells are used in <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> as a remedy for leucorrhoea, and as a diuretic or styptic, while the sap can be used as an adhesive.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in <b>folk</b> <b>medicine,</b> P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; {{they can also be}} crushed to yield a blue colorant that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid. <b>Folk</b> <b>medicine</b> has also claimed it {{as a treatment for}} pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found. The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of human {{presence in the}} area is dated between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago. The area of the park has been sparsely populated throughout historical times, however from the 17th to the 19th century the local communities of Zagori acquired an autonomous status, flourished economically due to increased trade, and became a major center of <b>folk</b> <b>medicine.</b> In recent decades, ecotourism {{is seen as a}} remedy to the economic decline of heavily depopulated local settlements, while preserving the natural environment and local architecture.|$|E
5|$|In the West, A.auricula-judae {{was used}} in <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> as {{recently}} as the 19th century for complaints including sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent. Although it is not widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century. Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as hot and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana, as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that A.auricula-judae has antitumour, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant and cholesterol-lowering properties.|$|E
5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese <b>folk</b> <b>medicine,</b> was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end, but the Chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E
50|$|Although 130 {{countries}} have regulations on <b>folk</b> <b>medicines,</b> {{there are risks}} {{associated with the use}} of them.

5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{has been with}} humans {{since at least the}} Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper Mexican {{cochineal}} {{led to an}} abrupt slump in the Polish cochineal trade, and the 1540s saw a steep decline in quantities of the red dye exported from Poland. In 1547, Polish cochineal disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish cochineal, which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants who collected it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric {{but also as a}} vodka colorant, an ingredient in <b>folk</b> <b>medicine,</b> or even for decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was a practicing Catholic and that she cared a lot for her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{mountain}} tapirs {{have been}} hunted for their meat and hides, while the toes, proboscises, and intestines {{are used in}} local <b>folk</b> <b>medicines</b> and as aphrodisiacs. Since they will eat crops when available, they are also sometimes killed by farmers protecting their produce. Today, deforestation for agriculture and mining, and poaching are the main threats to the species.|$|R
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European <b>folk</b> <b>medicine</b> include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{medicine}} {{may include}} formalized aspects of <b>folk</b> <b>medicine,</b> {{that is to}} say longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. <b>Folk</b> <b>medicine</b> consists of the healing practices and ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience. <b>Folk</b> <b>medicine</b> may also be referred to as traditional medicine, alternative medicine, indigenous medicine, or natural medicine. These terms are often considered interchangeable, even though some authors may prefer one or the other because of certain overtones they may be willing to highlight. In fact, out of these terms perhaps only indigenous medicine and traditional medicine have the same meaning as <b>folk</b> <b>medicine,</b> while the others should be understood rather in a modern or modernized context.|$|E
