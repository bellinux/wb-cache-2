500|$|Felipe Massa {{discounted}} rumours {{he might}} try to help Alonso win the title by forcing Vettel into retirement, stating [...] "I've always been an honest person and an honest driver. And {{that will continue to}} be the case. My limit is the limit of the regulations, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> true to this limit".|$|E
500|$|When Henriette von Schirach {{suggested}} that Braun {{should go into}} hiding after the war, Braun replied, [...] "Do you think I would let him die alone? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> with him up until the last moment..." [...] Hitler named Braun in his will, to receive 12,000 Reichsmarks yearly after his death. He was very fond of her, and worried when she participated in sports or was late returning for tea.|$|E
500|$|Delft, {{captured}} {{in the early stages}} of the battle, was under the command of the Dutch Lieutenant Heilberg and the British Lieutenant Charles Bullen, with a small prize crew of 69 men. Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God bless you, my brave fellow! Here is my hand; I give you my word <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E

2500|$|The book {{tells of}} Ruth's {{accepting}} the God of the Israelites as her God and the Israelite people as her own. In Ruth 1:16-17, Ruth tells Naomi, her Israelite mother-in-law, [...] "Where you go I will go, {{and where you}} stay <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay.</b> Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me." [...] The book is held in esteem by Jews who {{fall under the category}} of Jews-by-choice, as is evidenced by the considerable presence of Boaz in rabbinic literature. The Book of Ruth also functions liturgically, as it is read during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot ("Weeks").|$|E
2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked [...] "If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive." [...] The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: [...] "As long as I have one plane and one pilot, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> on the offensive." ...|$|E
