Describing her 1950 exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries, one critic considered it [...] "one of the most stimulating and refreshing that has been seen <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time" [...] and that [...] "She paints with a strong, sombre palette and her forms are sculptured with great decision. She uses paint sensuously and passionately, as paint, not as so many contemporary Australians do, as mere colour".|$|E
500|$|An indignant Mulder sneaks {{onto the}} base {{with help from}} Emil and Zoe. He sees a {{triangular}} craft fly overhead and then is captured by soldiers who tamper with his memory. Meanwhile, Scully reencounters Mossinger, whom she discovers is actually a security operative for the base. At gunpoint, she forces him to guide her to the base and exchanges him for Mulder. Having been denied {{the truth about the}} base, Mulder and Scully return to Washington. Days later, Mulder encounters Deep Throat while jogging at a local track. Mulder asks if [...] "they" [...] really are present on Earth; Deep Throat responds that [...] "they have been <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> long time".|$|E
500|$|Several commentators, such as Kim Thompson of The Comics Journal, {{film critic}} Jean-Philippe Guerand and the {{newspaper}} Libération, have noted certain similarities between the Valérian albums and the Star Wars film series. Both series are noted for the [...] "lived-in" [...] look given to their various settings and for the diverse alien creatures they feature. Mézières' response upon seeing Star Wars {{was that he was}} [...] "dazzled, jealous... and furious!". As a riposte, Mézières produced an illustration for Pilote magazine in 1983 depicting the Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa meeting Valérian and Laureline in a bar surrounded by a bestiary of alien creatures typical of that seen in both series. [...] "Fancy meeting you here!" [...] says Leia. [...] "Oh, we've been hanging around <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time!" [...] retorts Laureline. Mézières has since been informed that Doug Chiang, design director on The Phantom Menace, kept a set of Valérian albums in his library.|$|E

500|$|Outside of comics, Mézières' art {{has been}} {{particularly}} influential on science fiction and fantasy film.

500|$|Betty was the longest-serving barmaid of the soap's public house, The Rovers Return. She first served {{behind the}} bar in 1969 and had been shown to work there for 42 years, as of 2011. There have been brief breaks however, as storylines {{have led to the}} {{character}} being fired or quitting her post. She was fired by Annie Walker (Doris Speed), who accused her of theft, and she quit her post in 1995 when Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) took over as landlords. In the summer of 2009, Betty was sacked again temporarily by manager Poppy Morales. A Coronation Street insider reassured The Sun that Betty was not being written out of the show, however, stating: [...] "She’ll be <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to come – she’ll just be {{on the other side of}} the bar for a change". In a storyline that aired in February 2010, Betty – at 90 years old – was named Manchester's Oldest Barmaid. In a plot twist, a 91-year-old rival came forward, resulting in Betty fearing she killed her, when the rival consumes a two-month-old hotpot.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1995, Boehner {{distributed}} {{campaign contributions}} from tobacco industry lobbyists on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies. In a 1996 documentary by PBS called The People and the Power Game, Boehner said [...] "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before {{we got to the}} end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."

500|$|Senior Resident Magistrate Glenn Brown {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the public prosecutors for taking too long to prepare cases, often because of difficulty in finding and bringing witnesses.

2500|$|... a tiny minority, {{from within}} the non-Iraqi British Muslim communities, reacted with {{violence}} on 7 July 2005. To interpret this simply as a [...] "nationalist struggle" [...] to remove occupation ignores the blatantly obvious fact that, first, the terrorists were not Iraqis, they were British-Pakistanis (though British Iraqis have lived <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time); second, {{the vast majority of}} the Stop the War protesters were non-Muslims, yet only a handful from among a minority of Muslims reacted to the war with terrorism. Even though occupation may have caused agitation among the 7 July bombers, these northern-born lads with thick Yorkshire accents confessed in their suicide tapes to considering themselves soldiers with a mission to kill our people (Britons) on behalf of their people (Iraqis). The prerequisite to such a disavowal of one's country of birth is a recalibration of identity; this is the undeniable role of ideological narratives.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was also}} in 1890 that trouble was brewing in Winton, and indeed {{in other parts of}} Australia. One report {{mentioned}} a robbery in which one man was relieved of £30 while the police seemed unable to catch the thief, and the correspondent commented [...] "This game has been going on <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> time," [...] perhaps meaning to suggest police complicity in this and other crimes.

2500|$|Carl Anton Larsen, {{the founder}} of Grytviken was a naturalised Briton born in Sandefjord, Norway.

6000|$|... "They are of {{the same}} race, but they came not with them, and formed no part of their conquering armies.

5000|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{managers}} and senior {{officers of the}} South Georgia whaling stations, Larsen lived in Grytviken together with his family including his wife, three daughters and two sons.

[...] Joyce Millman of Salon.com stated that she disliked Seinfelds pilot episode, but after seeing a scene from [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] in which Jerry and Kramer discuss returning fruit, she was [...] "awed by Seinfeld and co-creator/writer Larry David's brilliant grasp of, A) working-class Jewish craziness, and, B) the absurd humor of the deeply mundane." ...|$|R
