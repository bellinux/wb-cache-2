As of 2006, the Route30 overlap had an annual average daily traffic of 1,781 vehicles. Traffic volumes are reduced to 1,231 vehicles per <b>day</b> <b>from</b> the end of the Route30 overlap to the intersection with Blue Ridge Road (CR84). South of this intersection, traffic is reduced further to 350 until the hamlet of Minerva, rising to 751 south of Minerva until near the Warren county line. Traffic increases back up to 1,248 vehicles per <b>day</b> <b>from</b> there to Route28 in North Creek.|$|E

40|$|Background: Length of stay (LOS) in {{hospital}} {{is an important}} component of describing how costs change in relation to healthcare-associated infection and this variable underpins models used to evaluate cost. It this therefore imperative that estimations of LOS associated with infections are performed accurately. Aim: To test the relationships between the size of hospital, age, and patient comorbidity on <b>days</b> <b>from</b> admission to infection and <b>days</b> <b>from</b> infection to discharge in patients with a healthcare-associated urinary tract infection (HAUTI), using structural equation modelling (SEM). Methods: A non-current cohort study in eight hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. All patients admitted to the hospital for > 48 h and who acquired a HAUTI were included. Findings: From the 162, 503 eligible patient admissions, 2821 (1. 73 %) acquired a HAUTI. SEM showed that the proposed model had acceptable fit indices for the combined sample (GFI = 1. 00; AGFI = 1. 00; NFI = 1. 00; CFI = 1. 00; RMSEA = 0. 000). The main findings showed that age of patient had a direct association with <b>days</b> <b>from</b> admission to infection and with <b>days</b> <b>from</b> infection to discharge. Patient comorbidity had direct links to the variables <b>days</b> <b>from</b> admission to infection and <b>days</b> <b>from</b> infection to discharge. Multi-group analysis indicated that the age of male patients was more influential on the factor <b>days</b> <b>from</b> admission to infection when compared to female patients. Furthermore, the number of comorbidities was significantly more influential on <b>days</b> <b>from</b> admission to infection in male patients than in female patients. Conclusion: As the first published study to use SEM to explore a healthcare-associated infection and the predictors of <b>days</b> <b>from</b> infection to discharge {{in hospital}}, we can confirm that accounting for the timing of infection during hospitalization is important and that patient comorbidity influences the timing of infection...|$|R

40|$|The field {{experiments}} were conducted during 2004 and 2005 seasons {{to study the}} effect of three first post planting irrigation times and ten fertilization treatments on growth, yield, yield components and fiber traits in cotton. The times of first post planting irrigation in a separate experiment were 20, 30 and 40 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting irrigation time in both seasons 2004 and 2005. A completely randomized block design with four replicate was used for each time of first irrigation. Each experiment of the first irrigation included ten of fertilizers treatments. Application the first irrigation after 40 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting resulted in the highest values of all growth characters. However, application of the first irrigation after 30 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting gave the highest values of all yield and yield components, except boll weight which recorded highest values with application the first irrigation after 20 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting. On the other hand, the lowest values of all growth, yield and yield components were recorded by application of the first irrigation after 20 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting in the two seasons, except boll weight which recorded the lowest values with application the first irrigation after 30 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting in the two seasons. Application the first irrigation after 40 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting gave the highest values of fiber strength and fiber length uniformity ratio (%). On the other hand, the lowest values of fiber strength and fiber uniformity ratio (%) were recorded by application the first irrigation after 20 <b>days</b> <b>from</b> planting over the two seasons.
