5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing {{that they would}} need to relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Mírzá Yahyá's {{leadership}} was controversial. He generally absented {{himself from the}} Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he {{went so far as}} to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Bahá'u'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs. In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Bahá'u'lláh was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] paleolake, also spelt palaeolake, is a {{lake that}} existed in the past when {{hydrological}} conditions were different. Quaternary paleolakes can often be identified on the basis of relict lacustrine landforms such as relict lake plains and coastal landforms that form recognizable relict shorelines, which are called paleoshorelines. Paleolakes can also be recognized by characteristic sedimentary deposits that accumulated in them and any fossils that these sediments might contain. The paleoshorelines and sedimentary deposits of paleolakes provide evidence for prehistoric hydrological changes <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> they existed.|$|R
50|$|A {{common goal}} of the {{engineering}} field of signal processing is to reconstruct a signal {{from a series of}} sampling measurements. In general, this task is impossible because {{there is no way to}} reconstruct a signal <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> signal is not measured. Nevertheless, with prior knowledge or assumptions about the signal, it turns out to be possible to perfectly reconstruct a signal from a series of measurements. Over time, engineers have improved their understanding of which assumptions are practical and how they can be generalized.|$|R
30|$|The {{samples of}} signal ν(t) {{can be at}} hand, for example, by using an {{out-of-band}} measurement of the noise. In this way, the data transmission is not interrupted and the samples of ν(t) can be measured as accurately as needed. In other words, in (23), <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> out-of-band measurements are performed, {{the presence of the}} signal is contemplated as s(t)= 0; therefore, this allows us to estimate the parameters of ν(t). Alternatively, the samples can also be obtained by sending a ‘zero’ signal and sampling the output of the receiver.|$|R
5|$|As a {{successful}} artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies {{with the doctor}} Marcantonio della Torre. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy. These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing. The project was left incomplete {{at the time of}} Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's Treatise on painting, published in France in 1632. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Benchley was filming various short films, he {{also began}} working at The New Yorker, which had started in February 1925 {{under the control}} of Benchley's friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of getting {{involved}} with another publication for various reasons, he completed some freelance work for The New Yorker over the first few years, and was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the lead conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic for The New Yorker in 1929, leaving Life, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine. The New Yorker published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather forecast office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather forecast office for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E

5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E
5|$|Æthelberht was {{succeeded in}} Kent {{by his son}} Eadbald. Bede states that after Æthelberht's death Eadbald refused to be baptised and married his stepmother, an act {{forbidden}} by {{the teachings of the}} Roman Church. Although Bede's account makes Laurence's miraculous flogging the trigger for Eadbald's baptism, this completely ignores the political and diplomatic problems facing Eadbald. There are also chronological problems with Bede's narrative, as surviving papal letters contradict Bede's account. Historians differ on the exact date of Eadbald's conversion. D. P. Kirby argues that papal letters imply that Eadbald was converted <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Justus was Archbishop of Canterbury, which was after Laurence's death, and long after the death of Æthelberht. Henry Mayr-Harting accepts the Bedan chronology as correct, and feels that Eadbald was baptised soon after his father's death. Higham agrees with Kirby that Eadbald did not convert immediately, contending that the king supported Christianity but did not convert for at least eight years after his father's death.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that an active continental margin existed {{along the coast of}} Southeast China <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Mesozoic <b>time</b> <b>that</b> produced extensive magmatism in the region.

Here we present new SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages and geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic data for syntectonic granites on Hainan Island. Our data demonstrate that these rocks, dated at 267 - 262 Ma, are typical of calc-alkaline I-type granites formed in continental arc environments. The age of this magmatic arc coincides with a sudden change in sedimentary environments in South China <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Permian <b>time,</b> suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> South China Indosinian Orogeny was likely contemporaneous with the onset of continental arc magmatism...|$|R

At the lander sites and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> observations were carried out {{on the surface of}} Mars, no evidence, direct or indirect, has been obtained for macroscopic biology on Mars. No obvious examples of geometric distortion that might have been motion induced have been observed.
