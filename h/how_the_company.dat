5|$|Jensen {{was able}} to take on {{production}} of the Tiger because its assembly contract for the Volvo P1800 had recently been cancelled. An additional factor in the decision was that Jensen's chief engineer Kevin Beattie and his assistant Mike Jones had previously worked for Rootes, and understood <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> operated. The first of 14 Jensen-built prototypes were based on the Series IV body shell, which became available at the end of 1963.|$|E

Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.|$|E

5|$|In late 2013, graphic {{designer}} Darren Wall released an art {{book about the}} history of British developer Sensible Software. Funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and written by games journalist Gary Penn of Zzap!64, Sensible Software 1986–1999 is a 340-page anthology of the company's full catalogue, from its popular 16-bit games (e.g. Sensible Soccer, Cannon Fodder, Wizball) to its lesser-known products and features. It also explains the personalities behind the company, mainly its founders Jon Hare and Chris Yates, through long-form interviews. Hare was elated when Wall originally contacted him about the project, but Yates, who has been estranged from Hare since 2003, did not participate. Hare explained the company's issues with scaling and hiring, and <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was slow to transition to 3D graphics. Other commentators featured in the book include developer and entrepreneur David Darling, television personality Dominik Diamond, musician Martin Galway, and games journalist Gary Whitta.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{there were}} no opening features, but Jo-Han plastic models were {{intricately}} detailed, with accurate body scripts, trim, and emblems, as well as seat and dashboard highlights. Intricate details would change {{from year to year}} according to annual design changes and specifications of the real cars produced. One model expert, and former employee of Jo-Han, Dennis Doty, reported <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> would mix paints to be applied to the models in as near to the same colors as used by the actual manufacturers. One particularly difficult paint to match for the 1977 Cadillacs was Saffron metallic. Thus, normally automobile companies did not supply the actual paints to the promo manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|About 1978, Cursor went in a {{different}} direction. First, models of contemporary trucks, mostly Mercedes-Benzes, started to appear. Secondly, these were now often diecast in zamac. Then, similar to NZG Models and Conrad Models three or four Mercedes-Benz sedans (the 230, 200, and 190) and the Gelandewagen SUV were introduced in 1:35 scale (Force 1990, 124-127; Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 76). This marked Cursor's main focus on the production of miniatures mainly for promotional purposes. Apparently all three companies were taking similar marching orders from Mercedes-Benz on <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> wanted its promotional models standardized. A BMW 3 series coupe also was made by Cursor in the 1:35 scale. As was typical models usually had opening doors with tilting seats and realistic rubber tires (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 76).|$|E

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] out {{of dissatisfaction}} with {{his status as}} a junior {{songwriter}} with the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. The lyrics and music convey his disenchantment at <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> retained the copyright for the songs it published, and at how, following its public listing in 1965, the major shareholders profited more from his compositions than he did. The recording features Hammond organ, played by Harrison, and an overdubbed montage of assorted sounds including trumpet blasts and spoken voices, anticipating John Lennon's 1968 sound collage [...] "Revolution 9". Due to the difficulty in assembling the completed track from two tape sources, [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] remained a rare song from the Beatles' post-1963 catalogue that was unavailable in true stereo until 1999. That year, it was remixed for inclusion on the album Yellow Submarine Songtrack.|$|E
500|$|AllGame editor Brett Alan Weiss's {{retrospective}} {{review was}} critical {{as he called}} Slalom [...] "a rush job" [...] that did not capture the spirit of skiing. He felt that the game was repetitive, too simple, and not fun for adults. Weiss described the graphics as blocky and insipid, the sound as repetitive and derivative. He said that {{even though it was}} an early release in the console's lifespan, Slalom was on par with the 1979 Intellivision's capabilities. He recommended Konami's Antarctic Adventure for the ColecoVision in its stead. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer wrote that the game received little fanfare. The magazine's Stuart Hunt wrote in December2010, on Rare's 25th anniversary, that the game was [...] "fun but quite simplistic" [...] in its lack of race variety. He said, though, that the game showcased <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> could maximize the system resources of the NES. Slalom was included in Rare Replay, a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the Xbox One on August 4, 2015.|$|E
500|$|High-profile {{advertising}} {{was central}} to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long-standing policy of using large-scale advertisements that stood out {{in stark contrast to}} the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye-catching drawings and photographs on double-page spreads, varying from month to month, were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double-page spread. The value for money of Sinclair's products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81's benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan [...] "Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer – the heart of a system that grows with you". The advertisement highlighted ZX81 BASIC Programming, the manual written by Steve Vickers, as [...] "a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs." [...] The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed ("it's still very simple to teach yourself computing") and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non-technical terms. For instance, the ZX81's idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke – the result of the memory-saving method of using one-byte tokens to represent keywords – was presented as [...] "eliminat a great deal of tiresome typing". The ZX81's British character was emphasised; it was [...] "designed by Sinclair and custom-built in Britain." [...] Sinclair's advertising in the United States provides an illustration of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> perceived the ZX81's purpose: ...|$|E
