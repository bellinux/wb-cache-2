5|$|In {{his final}} period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and {{completed}} three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, {{as well as}} the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are <b>graver</b> in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation led to {{clashes between}} the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the Peace of Augsburg but {{continued}} tensions produced a far <b>graver</b> conflict—the Thirty Years' War—which {{broke out in}} 1618. In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots (French Calvinists) and {{the forces of the}} French Catholic League. A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League. This ended under Pope Clement VIII, who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes, which granted civil and religious toleration to French Protestants.|$|E

5|$|When Harith {{arrived at}} Marw in early July 745, however, the {{situation}} had changed: Yazid was dead, a full-blown civil war had erupted in Syria, and Nasr ibn Sayyar, although still occupying the position of governor, lacked authority. Although he recognized Marwan II (r. 744–750), most of his own followers did not accept Marwan as Caliph. Harith was quick {{to distance himself from}} Nasr: he refused the offer of a district governorship, and distributed the gifts he received among his supporters. Harith vocally denounced Marwan II, and was soon joined by 3,000 of his fellow Tamimis, while his secretary, Jahm ibn Safwan, drummed up further support. Within a short time, he had become a <b>graver</b> threat to Nasr than al-Kirmani. After attempts to negotiate an agreement proved fruitless, Nasr attacked Harith's forces in March 746, and scored a first victory over them, in which Jahm ibn Safwan fell. At this point, al-Kirmani joined forces with Harith, and together they forced Nasr to abandon Marw and withdraw to Naysabur. The two allies entered the capital of Khurasan, but within days fell out and began fighting each other. In these clashes, Harith was killed, leaving al-Kirmani the master of the city. The conflict between Nasr and al-Kirmani continued, but was soon overtaken by events: exploiting the conditions of civil war, the Abbasids under Abu Muslim launched their own anti-Umayyad revolt in Khurasan. Nasr ibn Sayyar tried to conclude an alliance with al-Kirmani, but failed when the latter was murdered by one of Harith's sons in revenge. Abu Muslim managed to exploit the situation to his advantage, and in early 748, his men entered Marw, {{the first step in a}} war that would lead to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement with the Abbasids two years later.|$|E

25|$|Each <b>graver</b> is {{different}} and has its own use. Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or <b>graver,</b> to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate. However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. Dies used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to discuss the double <b>graves</b> existence, content and meaning during the Swedish Iron Age. Being buried in pairs {{seems to have been}} {{relatively}} rare. Is the double <b>grave</b> a family <b>grave</b> or was one of the individuals a human sacrifice? The focus of this essay will be to discuss the possible relationship the people in the double <b>graves</b> may have had, but also to see how rare the <b>grave</b> type is with the help and inspiration of theories by Sarah M. Nelson. Are the <b>graves</b> family style <b>graves</b> such as husband and wife or parent and child? Are there any other possibilities for the existence of double <b>graves?</b> The most common interpretation of the double <b>graves</b> is that they are family <b>graves.</b> I will try to answer these questions by examining four Iron Age burial grounds in Sweden. I do not rule out that double <b>graves</b> may be family <b>graves,</b> however, if they were family <b>graves,</b> why are they so uncommon and where is the rest of the family? Why is it only two people in the <b>grave?</b> This makes me question if the double <b>graves</b> are something else but pure family <b>graves.</b> It is more likely that the double <b>graves</b> have been the results of accidents or disease where two people lost their lives at the same time. ...|$|R

Besides his lectures and his superintendence of the resident students, he had to enter all new students, to advise them how to work, and to manage the finances and the general affairs of the school.
