5|$|In November, Herring flew {{across the}} {{mountains}} {{to take control of}} the fighting around Buna, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea. Herring planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda. He struggled to amass <b>enough</b> <b>troops,</b> equipment, guns, and supplies to allow Australian troops under Vasey and Americans under Eichelberger to overcome the Japanese and capture the area.|$|E
5|$|By 1700, the European {{states had}} <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> and ships at their disposal, {{following}} {{the end of}} a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of privateers. Pirates based in the Caribbean were chased from the seas by a new British squadron based at Port Royal, Jamaica, and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the Spanish Main, known as the Guarda de Costa, or simply the Guarda.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E

Before the troop arrived, non Taiwanese {{residents}} get killed by local Taiwanese for 10 days. However, alike Taiwanese independence spirits, it mainly focused on local Taiwanese pain and depression. There are collective sadness to show not willing {{to go back to}} China KMT government. The director/scriptwriter might not know the part of large amount of death of the non-residents from China. The standpoint remained not objective.|$|R

5000|$|During the Siege of Genoa (6 April [...] - [...] 4 June 1800) the Austrians besieged and {{captured}} Genoa. However, {{this was a}} pyrrhic victory as the smaller French force at Genoa under André Masséna had diverted <b>enough</b> Austrian <b>troops</b> to enable Napoleon to win the Battle of Marengo and defeat the Austrians.|$|R
5|$|At first, Botaneiates lacked <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> {{to oppose}} Bryennios, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had consolidated his control over his native Thrace, effectively isolating the capital from the remaining imperial territory in the Balkans. Botaneiates sent an embassy under the proedros Constantine Choirosphaktes, a veteran diplomat, to conduct negotiations with Bryennios. At {{the same time he}} appointed the young Alexios Komnenos as his Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief), and sought aid from the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman, who sent 2,000 warriors and promised even more. In his message to Bryennios, the aged Botaneiates (76 years old at his accession) offered him the rank of Caesar and his nomination as heir to the throne. Bryennios agreed in principle, but added a few conditions of his own, and sent the ambassadors back to Constantinople for confirmation. Botaneiates, who likely had initiated negotiations only to gain time, rejected Bryennios's conditions, and ordered Alexios Komnenos to campaign against the rebel.|$|E
5|$|Bradstreet set {{out from}} Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 {{soldiers}} and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt {{that he did not}} have <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 1861, Frémont ordered Grant {{to embark}} south with his troops from Cairo to attack Confederate {{soldiers}} encamped in Belmont, Missouri. Grant, along with Brigadier General John A. McClernand, landed 2,500 men at Hunter's Point, two {{miles north of}} the Confederate base outside Belmont. They took the camp, but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier Generals Frank Cheatham and Gideon J. Pillow forced a chaotic Union retreat. At first, Grant had wanted to destroy Confederate strongholds at both Belmont, Missouri and Columbus, Kentucky, but Frémont had not given Grant <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> to do the job. All Grant's men could do was disrupt the Confederates and fight their way back to their Union boats. They escaped back to Cairo under fire from the heavily fortified stronghold at Columbus. A tactical defeat, the battle gave Grant's volunteers confidence and experience.|$|E
50|$|The British 21st Army Group {{commanded}} by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery would cross the Rhine in Operation Plunder. Varsity {{would support the}} crossings by landing two airborne divisions of the Airborne Army's US XVIII Airborne Corps by parachute and glider behind the Rhine, near Wesel and Hamminkeln. A second U.S. airborne division {{was added to the}} original plan, but when it became apparent that the Airborne Army barely had <b>enough</b> <b>troop</b> carriers for two divisions, the third division was placed in reserve and then released altogether from the operation on March 6. The consequences of the poor weather during Operation Market led Brereton to plan for the delivery of both divisions in a single lift. On February 18, to establish a command post for the operation, Brereton moved the headquarters of First Allied Airborne Army to Maisons-Laffitte, near Paris.|$|R

On 13 December, Conner {{departed}} Tampico in Princeton and left Commander Tattnall in charge there until <b>enough</b> Army <b>troops</b> arrived {{to hold the}} town. Thus, Spitfire {{did not return to}} Vera Cruz until 3 January 1847.|$|R

5|$|Throughout 1915 Mexican insurgents {{raided the}} Texas border region {{as part of}} the Plan of San Diego. Supported by the Mexican Carranza government, a group of raiders known as the Seditionistas {{attacked}} American military and commercial interests along the United States–Mexican border in an effort to provoke a race war in the Southwestern United States with aims of returning the area to Mexican control. Charged with guarding the border, American General Frederick Funston had 20,000 troops to pit against the few hundred Seditionista insurgents. Nonetheless, the Mexicans never raided in force and the long border was difficult for Funston to fully protect. The Seditionista raids became such a threat to the Americans in the Big Bend area that local vigilante groups were formed in order to repel the Mexican raiders as Funston did not have <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> {{to ensure the safety of}} the American citizens living in the area.|$|E
5|$|Augustus ordered Tiberius {{to break}} off {{operations}} in Germany and move his main army to Illyricum. When {{it became clear that}} even Tiberius' forces were insufficient, Augustus was obliged to raise a second task force under Tiberius' nephew Germanicus, resorting to the compulsory purchase and emancipation of thousands of slaves to find <b>enough</b> <b>troops,</b> {{for the first time since}} the aftermath of the Battle of Cannae over two centuries earlier. The Romans had now deployed no less than 15 legions and an equivalent number of auxilia. This amounts to a total of c. 150,000 men, including at least 50 auxiliary cohorts composed, exceptionally, of Roman citizens. These were men whose status or background was regarded by Augustus as unsuitable for recruitment into the legions: either natural-born citizens of the lowest category including vagrants and convicted criminals, or the freed slaves (Roman law accorded citizenship to the freed slaves of Roman citizens). These special units were accorded the title civium Romanorum ("of Roman citizens"), or c.R. for short. After the Illyrian revolt, these cohorts remained in being and recruited non-citizens like other auxiliary units, but retained their prestigious c.R. title. In addition, the regular forces were assisted by a large number of allied troops from neighbouring Thrace deployed by their king Rhoemetalces I, a Roman amicus (puppet king).|$|E
5|$|In {{summing up}} the counterattack, US Army {{official}} historian John Miller {{argues that the}} Japanese offensive failed due to poor planning and intelligence. The Japanese commanders underestimated {{the strength of the}} US defenders, but even if XIV Corps had been as weak as the Japanese believed, the force committed to the attack did not include <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> or artillery to penetrate the well-prepared defenses. In the event, the defenders greatly outnumbered the Japanese force and had far superior artillery support. Miller argues further that the attack might have achieved a degree of success, {{at least in terms of}} inflicting heavy casualties on the US forces, had Hyakutake concentrated his forces early in the attack, rather than cumulatively, in order to achieve a break in the US line, which he might have been able to exploit to penetrate into the rear areas and cause considerable destruction before the US forces regrouped. Nevertheless, this did not happen and ultimately the veteran US troops held their positions despite the onslaught. Miller opines that had the offensive been successful, it would have had a serious affect on the campaign in the Solomons, resulting in a large drain on Allied resources, but would most likely not have altered the wider course of the war.|$|E
2500|$|Massive looting {{took place}} in the days {{following}} the 2003 invasion. According to U.S. officials, the [...] "reality of the situation on the ground" [...] was that hospitals, water plants, and ministries with vital intelligence needed security more than other sites. There were only <b>enough</b> U.S. <b>troops</b> on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some [...] "hard choices" [...] were made.|$|R
50|$|The {{execution}} of the Mongol-appointed king and heir {{did not result in}} any immediate Mongol reprisals. The Yunnan government, which did not have <b>enough</b> spare <b>troops,</b> initially ignored the pleas of Kumara Kassapa, who had somehow escaped the arrest, to intervene. It was only after the brothers seized lightly-manned Mongol garrisons at Singu and Male in January 1300 that the Mongols took notice. They organized a small expedition to central Burma in the following dry season, but it failed.|$|R
50|$|The Marinids {{were quick}} to return the favor. Abu al-Rabi {{dispatched}} a Marinid fleet to force the Castilians to lift the siege of Algeciras in January 1310, and dispatched <b>enough</b> North African <b>troops</b> to assist the Granadines {{to fend off the}} Aragonese landing near Almeria.|$|R
5|$|The Allies' {{failure to}} secure a bridge over the Lower Rhine spelled the end of Market Garden. While all other {{objectives}} had been achieved, the failure to secure the Arnhem road bridge over the Rhine meant that the operation failed in its ultimate objective. Field Marshal Montgomery claimed that the operation was 90% successful and the Allies did possess a deep salient into German occupied territory that was quickly reinforced. Milton Shulman observed that the operation had driven a wedge into the German positions, isolating the 15th Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army {{on the eastern side}} of the bulge. This complicated the supply problem of the 15th Army and removed the chance of the Germans being able to assemble <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> for a serious counterattack to retake Antwerp. Chester Wilmot agreed with this, claiming that the salient was of immense tactical value for the purpose of driving the Germans from the area south of the Maas and removing the threat of an immediate counterattack against Antwerp. Kershaw views the situation differently, observing that the north flank of the west wall was not turned and the 15th Army was able to escape. Dr. John Warren of the American Historical Division of the United States Air Force believed that the Allies now controlled a salient leading nowhere. John Waddy is of the belief that the strategic and tactical debate of Market Garden will never be resolved.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications {{had only}} {{relatively}} thin crenelated walls, which were insufficiently strong to counter artillery bombardments. They {{were lined with}} many tall towers for archers, but {{could not be used}} to mount cannon. Don Luis Bravo de Acuña, the governor of Gibraltar, produced a report for the king recommending a series of changes to the territory's fortifications. A series of new batteries was built along the Line Wall, each named after saints, and a New Mole (later renamed the South Mole) was built to provide additional protection to ships in the harbour. On the north side of Gibraltar, the Muralla de San Bernando (now the Grand Battery) was fully adapted to mount cannon facing the isthmus with the old archery towers being pulled down and replaced by bastions. The Old Mole, stretching into the Bay of Gibraltar, provided further mountings for cannon to sweep the isthmus. A series of defensive works constructed on a glacis above the entrance to the town provided further enfilading fire. A formidable bastion was constructed to protect the south of the town; known as the Baluarte de Nuestra Señora del Rosario ("Bastion of Our Lady of the Rosary"), and now as the South Bastion, it enfiladed the ditch across the Gate of Africa, now the Southport Gates. However, the effectiveness of the new fortifications was undermined by the continued failure of the Spanish crown to provide <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> to man them.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, the Scouts of the West Side {{district}} {{finally had}} <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> coming to camp {{to support their}} own camp, and so Camp Blackhawk was opened on Big Blue. The dining hall was located about 1000 yards east of the current location.|$|E
60|$|The band {{of eight}} men were well armed and well mounted, and if imperative, could have held off the Sioux for a time. But General Lodge and the scout headed across a little valley and up a higher ridge, {{from which they}} {{expected}} to sight the troops. They rode hard and climbed fast, {{but it took a}} quarter of an hour to gain the ridge-top. Sure <b>enough</b> the <b>troops</b> were in sight, but far away, and the Sioux were cutting across to get in front.|$|R

25|$|The {{size and}} sophistication of an ambush varied from hasty meeting engagements, to full scale, {{carefully}} planned, regimental sized ambushes that included forces sufficient to encircle {{the enemy in}} the kill zone.

25|$|On 3 October 1910 {{the republican}} {{uprising}} foreshadowed {{by the political}} unrest finally took place. Although many {{of those involved in}} the republican cause avoided participation in the uprising, making it seem like the revolt had failed, it eventually succeeded thanks to the government's inability to gather <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> to control the nearly two hundred armed revolutionaries that resisted in the Rotunda.|$|E
2500|$|By March 1918 Germany's Western Front armies {{had been}} {{reinforced}} to a strength of almost 200 divisions by {{the release of}} troops from the Eastern Front.

25|$|Before the battle, Kress von Kressenstein {{recommended}} that the wells at Beersheba be destroyed and the garrison withdrawn to the hills north of the town, because he considered there were not <b>enough</b> <b>troops</b> to successfully defend Beersheba.

The battles entailed long fierce fighting; some of the Japanese continued to fight until the official surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945. The Second Republic was dissolved earlier, on August 14. After their landing, Filipino and American forces also undertook measures to suppress the Huk movement, which was founded to fight the Japanese Occupation.|$|R
