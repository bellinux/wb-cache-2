5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>pollution,</b> the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by <b>genetic</b> <b>pollution</b> from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E
5|$|The mallard is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Unlike many waterfowl, mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The non-migratory mallard interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through <b>genetic</b> <b>pollution</b> by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted by the domesticated and feral mallard populations.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many waterfowl, mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much {{so that they are}} now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through <b>genetic</b> <b>pollution</b> by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E

25|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution—i.e., uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the introduced (or hybrid) species. Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact. Extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones; interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool (for example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by <b>genetic</b> <b>pollution</b> from the abundant domestic water buffalo). Such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionarily process, nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species' existence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aquatic {{ecosystems}} are major sinks for pollu-tants which can have {{adverse effects on}} biodiversity. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand the nature of pollution-induced change in aquatic ecosystems. We show that brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus) may have evolved in response to chronic pollution exposure. We collected adults from the Detroit River (polluted site) and Belle River (control site). Both adults and common-garden raised juveniles were tested for aggression, locomotion, and escape response using consecutive unchallenged (clean) and challenged (polluted) trials. Detroit River fish were more aggressive than Belle River fish when challenged. Furthermore, Belle River fish showed increased locomo-tion when exposed to pollutants, whereas Detroit River fish were unaffected. The consistent difference in adult and juvenile behaviour across trials suggests a <b>genetic</b> response to <b>pollution.</b> Escape response on the other hand, showed inter-population differences, but no consistency between adults and juveniles, indicating that this behaviour is influenced by non-genetic factors. We discuss our data with respect to the potential adaptation of populations to pol-lution and the implications for prioritizing remediation efforts...|$|R

Due to their life history strategies, marine invertebrates are unable to avoid stress and must adapt to variable environments. We examined the <b>genetic</b> basis of <b>pollution</b> resistance across multiple environments using the marine invertebrate, Styela plicata. Gametes were crossed in a quantitative genetic breeding design to enable partitioning of additive genetic variance across a concentration gradient of a common marine pollutant, copper.

There was a significant genotype 3 environment interaction in hatching success across copper concentrations. Further analysis using factor analytic modeling confirmed a significant dimension of across-environment genetic variation where the genetic basis of resistance to stress in the first three environments differed from that in the environment of highest copper concentration. A second genetic dimension further differentiated between the genetic basis of resistance to low and high stress environments. These results suggest that marine organisms use different genetic mechanisms to adapt to different levels of pollution and that the level of genetic variation to adapt to intense pollution stresses may be limited...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{pollutants}} on the genome is of crucial importance to preserve the evolutionary potential of endangered natural populations. The highly vagile European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) has suffered a dramatic decline in recruitment since two decades, urging for {{a better understanding of}} the <b>genetic</b> impact of <b>pollution.</b> Its catadromous life history constitutes a model to assess local selection of pollutants on condition and genetic variability, as juveniles recruit in European rivers without appreciable pollution load or interfering genetic background. Because of its high fat content and local benthic feeding behaviour, the feeding stage is considered extremely prone to the bioaccumulation of pollutants. We studied the relationship between heavy metal bioaccumulation, fitness (condition) and genetic variability in the European eel. The muscle tissues of 78 sub-adult eels, originating from three Belgian river basins (Scheldt, Meuse and Yser), were examined for nine heavy metal pollutants (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, As and Se), while in total 123 individuals were genotyped at 12 allozyme and 8 microsatellite loci. A significant negative correlation between heavy metal pollution load and condition was observed, suggesting an impact of pollution on the health of sub-adult eels. In general, we observed a reduced genetic variability in strongly polluted eels, as well as a negative correlation between level of bioaccumulation and allozymatic multi-locus heterozygosity (MLH). Microsatellite genetic variability did not show any pollution related differences, suggesting a differential response at metabolic enzymes and possibly direct overdominance of heterozygous individuals...|$|R
40|$|Energy saving {{in general}} and less polluting {{vehicles}} in specific, {{become more and more}} urgent topics. One reason is that, in a world where the demand for fast transportation is increasing, the risk of global warming is a fact. Hybrid Vehicles (HV:s) are proposed as a more environmentally friendly candidate than conventional vehicles. Nowadays, there are numerous different types of HV:s and the components can, in theory, be sized in infinite ways. There is no simple answer to how to choose driveline configuration and size components in a HV. This paper describes one method, Driveline Synthesis (DS), that systematically presents a suitable driveline, on the basis of demands and conditions. Examples of demands are driving cycle and emission free zones. Some conditions are fuel price, tax on pollution and discount rate. The most suitable driveline is defined as the most cost effective. Total cost is defined as the sum of: cost of components, fuel cost, cost of external energy and cost of <b>pollution.</b> <b>Genetic</b> algorithms are used as an optimization method. Two major types of drivelines are compared in a case study, a conventional bus with a diesel engine and automatic transmission versus a series hybrid bus with different types of primary power units (diesel engine or fuel cell) and storage devices (super capacitor or NiMH battery). DS gives reasonable answers but needs further validation and development. One conclusion from the work is that the most suitable driveline configuration depends very much on demands, conditions and present technology, i. e. HV:s are only preferable to conventional vehicles under special circumstances...|$|R

40|$|This year we {{are celebrating}} the 40 th {{anniversary of the}} launch of the Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) {{instrument}} on NASA's Nimbus- 4 satellite. The purpose of this instrument was to demonstrate the capability to measure total column ozone and its vertical distribution from space. The success of this instrument led to about a dozen instruments of this type on various NASA and NOAA satellites. These instruments used a single photomultiplier tube (PMT) that restricted the measurements to 6 - 12 discrete wavelengths in the 250 - 380 nm range. With the availability of solid-state detector arrays in the past decade it has been possible to make similar measurements but with hyperspectral (contiguous in wavelength) sampling and enhanced spectral resolution. This has allowed global mapping of several weakly-absorbing trace gases including S 0 2, NO 2, BrO, HCHO, and CIIOCHO. Since these measurements are affected by clouds and aerosols, a great deal of effort has gone into understanding their effect on ultraviolet radiation- both upwelling and downwelling. The downwelling UV radiation is chemically and biologically active and has both negative (<b>genetic</b> damage, air <b>pollution)</b> and positive (production of vitamin D and OH radical) environmental effects. I will discuss how the interaction of Rayleigh-scattered UV radiation with clouds and aerosols produce a variety of interesting effects that are leading to new methods of remote sensing of their properties.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Increased ambient {{particulate}} matter (PM) levels {{are associated with}} cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as shown by numerous epidemiology studies. Few studies have investigated the role of copollutants, such as ozone, in this association. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which PM affects cardiac function remain uncertain. We hypothesized that PM and O 3 induce adverse cardiovascular effects in mice and that these effects are strain dependent. STUDY DESIGN: After implanting radiotelemeters to measure heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) parameters, we exposed C 57 Bl/ 6 J (B 6), C 3 H/HeJ (HeJ), and C 3 H/HeOuJ (OuJ) inbred mouse strains to three different daily exposures of filtered air (FA), carbon black particles (CB), or O 3 and CB sequentially [O 3 CB; for CB, 536 ± 24 µg/m 3; for O 3, 584 ± 35 ppb (mean ± SE) ]. RESULTS: We observed significant changes in HR and HRV in all strains due to O 3 CB exposure, but not due to sequential FA and CB exposure (FACB). The data suggest that primarily acute HR and HRV effects occur during O 3 CB exposure, especially in HeJ and OuJ mice. For example, HeJ and OuJ mice demonstrated dramatic increases in HRV parameters associated with marked bradycardia during O 3 CB exposure. In contrast, depressed HR responses occurred in B 6 mice without detectable changes in HRV parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that important interstrain differences exist with respect to PM- and O 3 -induced cardiac effects. This interstrain variation suggests that genetic factors may modulate HR regulation in response to and recuperation from acute copollutant exposures.

Deste modo, não é um fogo constante que o alimenta, mas sim, os desastres do mundo moderno. Desordem genética, poluição, sujeira e escuridão, fazem parte das alegorias do inferno de hoje. Para demonstrar como o inferno tem sido reconstruído por novos atores e autores, foi usado Blade Runner, um filme de Ridley Scott, de 1982. Nesta tese, procurou-se demonstrar que os intérpretes da atualidade não abandonaram a noção de inferno, mas a atualizaram e a trouxeram para os nossos dias, nos inserindo num inferno realístico, em contraposição àquele existente como possibilidade temida no pós-morte.
