40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis and experimental results for a feedforward control circuit suitable for applications in pulse-width modulated (PWM) buck derived converters. Line regulation {{can be improved}} using feedforward control techniques. The analysis is given for the buck converter operated in continuous conduction mode (CCM). The experimental results are performed at Vi = 17 to 42 V, V 0 = 14 V, and the switching frequency of 100 kHz. The measured line regulation of the buck converter without negative feedback loop was less than 0. 2 % per 1 V of <b>imput</b> <b>voltage...</b>|$|E
