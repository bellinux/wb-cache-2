25|$|A {{burglar alarm}} {{contains}} sensors which {{are connected to}} a control unit via a low-voltage <b>hardwire</b> or narrowband RF signal {{which is used to}} interact with a response device. The alarm was patented (U.S. patent #9,802) on June 21, 1853, by the Reverend Augustus Russell Pope of Somerville, Massachusetts. As the first person to commercialize Pope's invention, Edwin Holmes acquired Pope's patent rights in 1857 for US$1,500.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hardwired</b> {{control units}} are {{implemented}} {{through use of}} combinational logic units, featuring {{a finite number of}} gates that can generate specific results based on the instructions that were used to invoke those responses. <b>Hardwired</b> control units are generally faster than microprogrammed designs.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} {{networks}} on chip (NOC) are <b>hardwired</b> in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Although some {{area of the}} FPGA then has a fixed function, this loss of flexibility is outweighed by the following benefits. First, implementation cost is much reduced. Second, a <b>hardwired</b> NOC solves physical problems such as timing closure and high cost of global wiring. Third, dynamic partial reconfiguration can be better exploited. Compared to current soft or firm interconnects, a <b>hardwired</b> NOC poses fewer restrictions on the (re) placement of IP blocks in the FPGA. Finally, we also propose that the <b>hardwired</b> NOC is used for both the functional interconnect between the IP blocks and the configuration interconnect that transports the bitstreams. We give a detailed overview of our NOC architecture, and its configuration and programming. The proposed scheme enhances the on-line generation of bitstreams and the on-line verification of loaded bitstreams to detect tampering with the device. In our experiment, a <b>hardwired</b> NOC has acceptable (≤ 10 %) overhead for IP sizes with approximately 1400 lookup tables (LUT), enabling a fine-grained combined functional and configuration interconnect. A <b>hardwired</b> NOC offers significantly better functional performance than a soft NOC. Moreover, the configuration and programming of the hard NoC is much faster than when using a soft NOC. 1...|$|R
50|$|The unnamed {{man that}} would become <b>Hardwire</b> {{received}} his powers from Rex Mundi and became a hitman for the crime lord, The Operator. Asked by Mundi to kill Hardcase, the Operator offered <b>Hardwire</b> the job. He seriously wounds Hardcase with a surprise attack, but is unable to kill him due to the ultraheroine Choice's intervention. Later that night, a recovered Hardcase defeats <b>Hardwire</b> by dislocating his shoulders. <b>Hardwire</b> is {{turned over to the}} police.|$|E
50|$|Unhappy {{about his}} {{unfinished}} business with Hardcase, <b>Hardwire</b> seeks him out. Hardcase once again defeats him.

50|$|Unlike human brains {{that rely}} on experience-dependent {{neuronal}} plasticity, the brain of the fly is <b>hardwired</b> for particular tasks in the visual sensory system. The H1 neuron and related tangential neurons are suggested to be genetically determined, meaning that these neurons are unaffected by visual stimuli during early development. Parts of the fly brain have neuroplasticity but the H1 and other tangential neurons are <b>hardwired</b> neuronal machinery. Genetic <b>hardwiring</b> is likely an adaptation strategy that allow the flies to navigate in flight soon after hatching, actions largely mediated by the H1 and related tangential neurons.|$|R
