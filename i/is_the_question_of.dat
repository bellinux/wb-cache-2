5|$|Less clearcut <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{whether the}} regular auxilia {{recruited}} barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although {{there is little}} evidence of it before the 3rd century, the consensus is that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Landis's commissionership <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis's commissionership; Rickey (then running the Brooklyn Dodgers) broke the color line by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis's death; Robinson became the first black in the major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some elements {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling. One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} problem {{about the}} layer pyramid <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> who had it built. Most scholars today {{believe that it}} was likely king Khaba of the late 3rd Dynasty. This conclusion is based on stone bowls and vases bearing the serekh of Khaba discovered in Mastaba Z500, located just north of the pyramid. Rainer Stadelmann goes further and identifies Khaba with king Huni, the last ruler of the 3rd Dynasty. His hypothesis is based on his reading of the Turin canon, a kinglist compiled in the early Ramesside period c. 1300 BC, some 1400 years after Huni's lifetime. The Turin canon credits Huni with a relatively long reign of 24 years. According to Stadelmann, this time would be sufficient to cover the time span needed to complete the building of the layer pyramid. He also argues that royal monuments of the first three Egyptian dynasties only present a king's horus name in a serekh and only later do they record the throne or birth name. Thus, the serekh of Khaba could correspond to the throne name Huni. In this case, the layer pyramid would be Huni's tomb. This conclusion is contested by most Egyptologists who think that Huni instead built the Meidum Pyramid, point to the apparent unfinished state of the layer pyramid and identify Khaba with king Hudjefa II mentioned on the Turin canon.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E

25|$|The rationalist {{notion that}} all {{law should be}} {{condensed}} and comprehensively written in a code was challenged by social, economic and political mutations which imposed a need for the text to be constantly updated.

50|$|Thio's strong {{position}} towards retaining the code drew much protest from some Singaporeans.

25|$|Then, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{the last}} three poems that were found among her papers.

25|$|Traditionally, the Lepospondyli {{has been}} favored as lissamphibian ancestors. Like the modern amphibians, {{they were mostly}} small with simple vertebrae, {{resembling}} lissamphibians in many aspects of external anatomy and presumably ecological niches. At a subclass level, {{it was thought that}} labyrinthodonts gave rise to lepospondyls, and lepospondyls to lissamphibians. Several cladistic studies also favour the lepospondyl link, though placing Lepospondyli as close relatives or even derived from reptile-like amphibians. One problem with this position <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether Lepospondyli actually is monophyletic in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue as}} regards mutual wills <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> revocability. In Re Hobley Charles Aldous QC held {{that there could}} be either {{unilateral}} or mutual revocation provided it occurred during the lifetime of both testators. However, the problem with this approach is that unilateral revocation is against the general principle of contract. Several explanations for this could be proffered. Firstly, there could be an implicit term that the agreement is revocable. Secondly, it could be conceptually viewed that the agreement takes on the revocable nature of the will to which it relates. Thirdly, as the doctrine is based on detrimental reliance, the agreement only concretized on the death of the other party. Fourthly, one could apply the unconscionability rationale that unjust enrichment could only be complete when one party takes a benefit under the will of the other party.|$|E

25|$|Phylogeny {{as applied}} to {{historical}} linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages. The phylogeny problem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> what specific tree, in the tree model of language evolution, best explains the paths of descent of {{all the members of}} a language family from a common language, or proto-language (at the root of the tree) to the attested languages (at the leaves of the tree). The Germanic languages form a tree with Proto-Germanic at its root that is a branch of the Indo-European tree, which in turn has Proto-Indo-European at its root. Borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the Germanic branch within Indo-European less clear than the positions of the other branches of Indo-European. In the course of the development of historical linguistics, various solutions have been proposed, none certain and all debatable.|$|E
25|$|Long {{discussed}} {{but so far}} unresolved <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{how many}} artists participated in producing the Gigantomachy. Just as disputed {{is the extent to}} which the character of individual artists can be identified in this work of art. There is agreement that at least the basic design of the frieze was the work of a single artist. In view of its consistency down to the level of details, the plan must have been worked out to its smallest elements; nothing had been left to chance. Already in the arrangement of the fighting groups it can be noted that each group is unique and, for example, that the hairstyle and the footwear of the goddesses always differ. Each of the pairs of fighters is individually arranged. Thus, the figures in themselves reveal their distinctive character rather than this being the result of the artists’ personal styles.|$|E
25|$|According to Graziano Gasparini and Luise Margolies, Inca stonemasonry was {{inspired}} by the architecture of Tiwanaku, an archaeological site in modern Bolivia built several centuries before the Inca Empire. They argue that according to ethnohistorical accounts the Incas were impressed by these monuments and employed large numbers of stoneworkers from nearby regions in the construction of their own buildings. In addition to these references, they also identified some formal similarities between Tiwanaku and Inca architecture including the use of cut and polished stone blocks, as well as of double jambs. A problem with this hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how was expertise preserved in the three hundred years between the collapse of Tiwanaku and the appearance of the Inca Empire and its architecture. As a solution, John Hyslop has argued that the Tiahuanaco stonemasonry tradition was preserved in the Lake Titicaca region in sites such as Tanka Tanka, which features walls resembling Inca polygonal masonry.|$|E
50|$|The {{discussion}} {{this case}} sparked involved two key issues. <b>The</b> first <b>was</b> one of power, and if <b>the</b> curfew law <b>was</b> unconstitutional. <b>The</b> second issue <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> racial discrimination, a constant theme within {{all of these}} cases.|$|R

25|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{not always}} known whether a {{specific}} form is actually the official name of an institution, or what is its official name (e.g. whether the city of its location is part of the name). In addition, {{it is not}} always clear if a group is actually an institution in the sense of having been registered at the court, with a statute, a stamp, letter header etc. on its own. A third problem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> whether the spelling of an organization can be corrected if it is not written according to the above rule. In addition, adjectival forms derived from institution names are also often mistaken because people feel the need to distinguish them from genuine common names (especially if the name contains a fancy name that becomes identical with a common name if written in lowercase). Furthermore, it is unclear why cinemas are treated differently (see above) from theatres, cf. Művész mozi, but Magyar Színház.|$|E
25|$|A graph {{property}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{whether a}} graph {{belongs to a}} given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined is how many pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the property of interest can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic number of pairs of vertices. The full Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a monotonic graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every possible pair of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true—for instance, it {{is known to be}} true for graphs with a prime number of vertices—but the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{overriding}} message {{may seem to}} be [...] "careful what you wish for", there are other themes throughout the episode as well.
