5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>haul,</b> and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was formed}} as [...] "Keewatin Air Limited" [...] to provide charter {{services}} to the region. It was the first airline to have a permanent base in Nunavut (then known as the Keewatin Region of the Northwest Territories). In 1987 it expanded to include medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) services, to {{what would become the}} Kivalliq Region, using a fleet of aircraft that began with a Tradewind aircraft - a multi-modified Beech 18 with a turbine engine and tricycle gear. This aircraft was followed by a Westwind, another modified Beech 18 with turbine engines and eventually these were replaced by Merlin IIA aircraft that had the added benefit of being pressurized and had turboprops. The MEDEVAC service is now known as [...] "Nunavut Lifeline". Currently three Kingair 200 aircraft are based in Rankin Inlet, one in Churchill, Manitoba. and two in Iqaluit, where the airline also bases a Lear 35 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>hauls</b> to Ottawa and a Pilatus PC-12 to access the short strips.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} selecting capacity additions from a finite set of possible facility sizes to meet demand at a single location over an infinite horizon. The problem is motivated and illustrated by an application to <b>the</b> planning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deployment of <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> transmission facilities in the nationwide intercity telephone network. Under the assumption that demand grows at an increasing rate, taken to be exponential for purposes of exposition, we prove a "turnpike theorem" which characterizes the optimal policy as {{one in which the}} least average cost facility is eventually the only optimal facility type installed over the infinite horizon. This structural result, together with an efficient algorithm <b>for</b> solving <b>the</b> finite horizon problem, which has been implemented in a facilities network planning tool known as OFNPS, leads to a constructive algorithm <b>for</b> finding <b>the</b> optimal first facility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> infinite horizon problem. The approach avoids the end of study effects inherent in a finite horizon approach to the problem. facilities/equipment planning: capacity expansion, dynamic programming: applications, industries: communications...|$|R

40|$|In September 2012, the Swedish Government {{presented}} a 1. 3 billion SEK investment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> years 2013 - 2016 targeted on improving <b>the</b> infrastructure <b>for</b> transportation of iron ore powder between the mine in Kaunisvaara and Svappavaara, {{where it is}} transferred to train. This decision was preceded by an official report from the Swedish Transport Administration investigating necessary road reconstruction along with alternatives <b>for</b> electrification of <b>the</b> vehicles used. As a result, a new road of 140 kilometers will be constructed {{and at the same}} time serve as test project for electric road technologies in Sweden, with the initial focus set on heavy duty trucks. Scania CV AB is the supplier of <b>the</b> 90 ton <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> trucks which will transport the iron ore powder, and also an active part in the rapidly evolving area of electric roads in Sweden. In August 2012, the company’s Hybrid Systems Development Department initiated a life cycle assessment (LCA) on this case, set up in the form of a master’s thesis. The LCA study compares three different drivetrain alternatives <b>for</b> <b>the</b> heavy <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> trucks. In essence, the cradle to grave cycle impact of a set of additional components is compared with the effect of the reduced total energy use of fuel and electricity in <b>the</b> well-to-wheel phase, <b>for</b> a conventional truck, a hybrid (made more efficient by integrating electric propulsion) and a hybrid with external power supply from the road. The aim of the study is to evaluate the environmental impact of the three alternatives and to demonstrate how it changes over the different life cycle phases. The motive of Scania has been to increase their knowledge of the environmental impacts of drivetrain electrification, and also to provide support for internal decisions and future strategies on how to meet energy efficiency targets. The idea is also to present the results within the test project working group and thereby contribute to the overall project evaluation. The aim of this presentation is to point out that the increased governmental focus on electric roads in Sweden and Scania’s need to understand the effect of this technology in an environmental systems perspective, has given LCA a role in the evaulation. Hence, the results and conclusions of the LCA will be presented. Finally, the opportunities and limitations of LCA as a learning tool when applied on this type of emerging technology at a department with no prior LCA experience will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|During Berlin’s ITB travel {{trade fair}} in March 2015, Lufthansa Group has named the first ‘low cost long haul’ {{destinations}} for revitalized Eurowings, which {{are going to}} be operated by SunExpress Germany. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> first time since the early 90 ’s, LH Group is going to fly <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> out of Cologne/Bonn, one of Europe’s pioneer low cost airports, whose management has consistently been predicting the inauguration of ‘low cost <b>long</b> haul’ flights. <b>The</b> objective {{of this paper is to}} have a critical look at this new product to assess to what extent it meets the fundamental low cost criteria and if it may be seen as breakthrough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ‘long haul low cost’ business model in Germany. First, we review the vast literature on low cost carriers to sum up the essential cost- and rev-enue related characteristics of their business model, and to discuss its transferability to <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> operations. Second, we have a closer look at the new ‘low cost long haul’ product as announced by Eurowings and then assess its compatibility with the low cost carrier (LCC) principles. We also discuss the general reasoning behind Lufthansa’s move. We find that major parts of the business model have more in common with traditional <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> leisure operations of holiday carriers such as airberlin and Condor than with the low cost philosophy of Ryanair and the likes. However, some LCC principles like ‘no free catering’ or ‘baggage charges’ apply for passengers travelling at the lowest fares. It is still too early to predict if the Eurowings product can be regarded as breakthrough for ‘low cost <b>long</b> haul’ flights. <b>The</b> actual choice of holiday destinations by Eurowings, though, indicates a quite conservative approach with only limited potential for supply-driven market stimulationon routes to Dubai and Bangkok. In any case, irrespectively of the question if the new product itself is ‘low cost’ or not, Lufthansa seems to have sound internal reasons <b>for</b> inaugurating <b>the</b> Eurowings <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> flights, as it could help significantly reducing staff costs also on longer distances...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} how aircraft noise {{can be translated}} into a form of landing charge. The objectives of the thesis were to develop noise landi'ng charges <b>for</b> six of <b>the</b> major airports in England and to determine what the implication it has on passengers' choice of airports. An airport choice model is developed distinguished by three market types: long-haul international scheduled, short-haul international scheduled and charter international. Modelling of airport choice was also carried out <b>for</b> passengers from <b>the</b> Greater London and South East areas. The best results are obtained using difference in access time, logarithmic difference in frequencies and weighted differences in fare variables. There is consistency in the access time coefficients for all three markets. Airport choice for international scheduled and charter passengers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Greater London and other South East areas also show consistency in access time amongst different passenger groups in choosing airports. The implication of the noise charge particularly at Gatwick and Heathrow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> short and <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> markets reveal that the fare coefficients are sensitive and are subject to doubt. However Brooke et al (1994) acknowledge that exact fare details are difficult to obtain. Therefore {{it is a difficult}} task to produce accurate fare coefficients with published fare details that do not take into account discounts received by passengers. This is reflected in this study by observing the fact that high number of passengers change airports, when it may be argued that the noise charges are moderate. The sensitivity of the implications of the noise charge determined in this study have depended highly on the fare coefficients. This study has demonstrated the importance and perhaps the over reliance of depending on a single parameter <b>for</b> <b>the</b> evaluation of the implications of the noise charge...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first modern}} theory of mammal ageing was {{formulated}} by Peter Medawar in 1952. It formed from discussions {{in the previous}} decade with J. B. S.

[...] Nature is a highly competitive place, and almost all animals in nature die before they attain old age. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> – not much selection pressure for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would be dead anyway, killed by predators, disease, or accident.|$|E
2500|$|Alan Davidson {{almost had}} David Sheppard {{out for a}} pair in the first over, instead it was Geoff Pullar who {{was caught in a}} {{stunning}} dive by Barry Jarman off Garth McKenzie's first ball and Ted Dexter came in at 5/1 instead of sending in a nightwatchman. He survived that day and returned with Sheppard needing another 225 runs to win on the fifth day. It rained overnight, but the wicket was well covered and play began on time. Sheppard and Dexter settled down <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> and apart from McKenzie making the ball lift in the first few overs they were not troubled. Davidson lost his verve and bowled efficiently rather than dangerously. By lunch the Reverend was outscoring his captain, having made 44 of 90 balls to his 41 off 127. After lunch it was more difficult. Benaud dropped Dexter in the gully on 44 and he reached his fourth 50 of the series. It was Dexter's sixth successive 50 in Tests, equalling Patsy Hendren's England record; having made 85 and 172 against Pakistan and 70, 99, 93 and 52 against Australia, but he was dismissed by Sheppard, who pushed the pull to cover and set off for a run, leaving a hesitant Dexter to be run out by Benaud. Colin Cowdrey came in at 129/2 and took 30 minutes to score, then edging McKenzie (1/58) knee-high to [...] "the Claw" [...] at second slip, only to see it dropped. Sheppard edged a cut from Davidson between Jarman and Simpson at second slip, the keeper leapt at the chance and missed, so spoiling Simpson's line of sight. After this they moved slowly, but surely towards their goal in a stand of 104. Benaud (0/69) lacked control and Sheppard drove him to the boundary to bring up his first century in Australia. Davidson (0/53) was too exhausted to take the new ball, which was given to Ken Mackay (0/34) and {{in the end it was}} divine intervention that gave then their third wicket, Sheppard, who had dropped two catches, been dropped on a pair and run out his captain now took a risky single for the winning run and was run out by Bill Lawry for 113. Ken Barrington came in to stand at the bowler's end while Brian Booth gave Cowdrey (52 not out) the winning run.|$|E
