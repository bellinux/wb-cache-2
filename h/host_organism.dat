5|$|The {{bacterium}} can {{be grown}} and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy. E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species {{in the fields of}} biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> for the majority of work with recombinant DNA. Under favorable conditions, it takes only 20 minutes to reproduce.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of wasps {{resemble}} maggots, and are {{adapted for}} life in a protected environment; {{this may be the}} body of a <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> or a cell in a nest, where the larva either eats the provisions left for it or, in social species, is fed by the adults. Such larvae have soft bodies with no limbs, and have a blind gut (presumably so that they do not foul their cell).|$|E
5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} viruses {{in the oceans}} {{decreases}} further offshore {{and deeper into the}} water, where there are fewer <b>host</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used as examples of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b> Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase the fitness of plasmids in competition with other plasmids. Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|In {{standard}} {{molecular cloning}} experiments, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> and cloning vector, (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into <b>host</b> <b>organism,</b> (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties.|$|E
25|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is able to}} form a {{protective}} biofilm in order to escape a host organism’s defences, especially white blood cells and antibiotics. The biofilm is constructed using DNA and actin filaments from the <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
50|$|PLOS Pathogens is a peer-reviewed open-access {{medical journal}} {{containing}} original articles about pathogens {{and how they}} interact with their <b>host</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} in this subfamily {{is based}} on the morphology, nucleic acid type, mode of replication, <b>host</b> <b>organisms</b> and the type of disease caused.|$|R
50|$|The antennules are {{frequently}} reduced {{in size and}} the antennae modified to terminate in small hooks or claws {{that are used in}} attachment to <b>host</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
25|$|The DNA mixture, {{previously}} manipulated in vitro, {{is moved}} {{back into a}} living cell, {{referred to as the}} <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b> The methods used to get DNA into cells are varied, and the name applied to this step in the molecular cloning process will often depend upon the experimental method that is chosen (e.g. transformation, transduction, transfection, electroporation).|$|E
25|$|An {{interaction}} may {{not happen}} in yeast, the typical <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> for Y2H. For instance, if a bacterial protein is tested in yeast, it may lack a chaperone for proper folding that is only present in its bacterial host. Moreover, a mammalian protein is sometimes not correctly modified in yeast (e.g., missing phosphorylation), which {{can also lead to}} false results.|$|E
25|$|In {{molecular}} biology, trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs), are proteins {{found on}} the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria use TAAs in order to infect their host cells via a process called cell adhesion. TAAs also go by another name, oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins, which is shortened to OCAs. In essence, they are virulence factors, factors that make the bacteria harmful and infective to the <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Host</b> <b>organisms</b> {{must ensure}} that the {{activity}} of serine proteases is adequately regulated. This is achieved by a requirement for initial protease activation, and the secretion of inhibitors.|$|R
50|$|The uses of {{bioluminescence}} and its {{biological and}} ecological significance for animals, including <b>host</b> <b>organisms</b> for bacteria symbiosis, {{have been widely}} studied. Its benefits for bacteria, however, still remain unclear.|$|R
50|$|During {{the escape}} phase, tumor cell {{variants}} {{selected in the}} equilibrium phase have breached the <b>host</b> <b>organism's</b> immune defenses, with various genetic and epigenetic changes conferring further resistance to immune detection.|$|R
25|$|The {{creation}} of recombinant DNA {{is in many}} ways the simplest step of the molecular cloning process. DNA prepared from the vector and foreign source are simply mixed together at appropriate concentrations and exposed to an enzyme (DNA ligase) that covalently links the ends together. This joining reaction is often termed ligation. The resulting DNA mixture containing randomly joined ends is then ready for introduction into the <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
25|$|G. ruricola is the <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> for {{two species}} of flies in the genus Drosophila. They were first {{observed}} on Montserrat by Henry Guernsey Hubbard in 1894, and presented at a scientific meeting later that year (where the crab was misidentified as Cardisoma guanhumi), but no further research was conducted until 1955, when specimens were again collected, this time from Mona Island, and named as Drosophila carcinophila by M. R. Wheeler.|$|E
25|$|Unlike viral vectors, non-viral ones {{avoid the}} risk of {{acquiring}} replication competence. They {{have the capacity to}} deliver a large amount of therapeutic genes repeatedly, and it is convenient to produce them on a large scale. The most important of all, they do not elicit immune responses in the <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b> In spite of having advantages, non-viral vectors have not yet replaced viral vectors due to relatively low efficiency and short-term transgene expression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Host</b> <b>organisms</b> are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} different defense mechanisms used to protect the host from pathogenic infection. Humans in particular possess multiple lines of defense that affect pathogenesis from beginning to end. In order for a virus or bacterium to display tropism for a specific host, it must first have the means to break through the <b>host</b> <b>organism's</b> line of defense. The first line of defense, known as the innate immune system, is meant to prevent initial pathogenic entry and establishment. The innate immune system is only broadly specific to pathogens and includes: anatomical barriers, inflammation, phagocytosis, and nonspecific inhibitors.|$|R
50|$|Host tropism is the {{infection}} specificity of certain pathogens to particular hosts and host tissues. This type of tropism explains why most pathogens are only capable of infecting a {{limited range of}} <b>host</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are DNA sequences {{that can}} move within the genome. TEs have greatly shaped the genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of the <b>host</b> <b>organisms</b> {{through a variety}} of mechanisms. However, TEs generally disrupt genes and destabilize the host genomes, which substantially reduce fitness of the <b>host</b> <b>organisms.</b> Understanding the genomic distribution and evolutionary dynamics of TEs will greatly deepen our understanding of the TE-mediated biological processes. Most TE insertions are highly polymorphic in Drosophila melanogaster, providing us a good system to investigate the evolution of TEs at the population level. Decades of theoretical and experimental studies have well established “transposition-selection” population genetics model, which assumes that the equilibrium between TE replication and purifying selection determines the copy number of TEs in the genome. In the last decade, P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI) -interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were demonstrated to be master repressors of TE activities in Drosophila. The discovery of piRNAs revolutionized our understanding of TE repression, because it reveals that the <b>host</b> <b>organisms</b> have evolved an adaptive mechanism to defend against TE invasion. Tremendous progress has been made to understand the molecular mechanisms by which piRNAs repress active TEs, although many details in this process remain to be further explored. The interaction between piRNAs and TEs well explains the molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid dysgenesis for the I-R and P-M systems in Drosophila, which have puzzled evolutionary biologists for decades. The piRNA repression pathway provides us an unparalleled system to study the co-evolutionary process between parasites and <b>host</b> <b>organisms...</b>|$|R
25|$|Glycoprotein {{molecules}} on {{the surface}} of ejaculated sperm cells are recognized by all human female immune systems, and interpreted as a signal that the cell should not be rejected. The female immune system might otherwise attack sperm in the reproductive tract. The specific glycoproteins coating sperm cells are also utilized by some cancerous and bacterial cells, some parasitic worms, and HIV-infected white blood cells, thereby avoiding an immune response from the <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Virology is {{the study}} of viruses – submicroscopic, {{parasitic}} particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat – and virus-like agents. It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology {{is considered to be a}} subfield of microbiology or of medicine.|$|E
25|$|Whichever {{method is}} used, the {{introduction}} of recombinant DNA into the chosen <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> is usually a low efficiency process; that is, {{only a small fraction}} of the cells will actually take up DNA. Experimental scientists deal with this issue through a step of artificial genetic selection, in which cells that have not taken up DNA are selectively killed, and only those cells that can actively replicate DNA containing the selectable marker gene encoded by the vector are able to survive.|$|E
50|$|Aplanochytrium are {{exclusively}} {{marine and}} their isolates {{have been found}} in water samples, sediments, detritus, oyster mantle, gastropods and seagrasses. They can either be free-living in water or as symbiont in <b>host</b> <b>organisms,</b> where some species act as parasitic symbiont.|$|R
50|$|In plants, VirA is {{a protein}} {{histidine}} kinase which senses certain sugars and phenolic compounds. These compounds are typically found from wounded plants, {{and as a}} result VirA is used by Agrobacterium tumefaciens to locate potential <b>host</b> <b>organisms</b> for infection.|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{analysis}} of mechanisms of pathogen {{resistance in the}} nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed a role for evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that are required for innate immunity {{in a wide range}} of organisms, from worms to mammals. C. elegans represents one of the more simple <b>host</b> <b>organisms</b> in which mechanisms of host defense can be dissected, and the use of C. elegans presents the researcher with a wide array of genetic and genomic tools to probe the host-pathogen interface. The study of host defense mechanisms in C. elegans continues to provide an ancient evolutionary perspective on innate immunity, which may generate insights into the conserved processes in phylogenetically diverse <b>host</b> <b>organisms,</b> including humans...|$|R
25|$|The mode {{of action}} is not exactly known at present, but {{experimental}} evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the <b>host</b> <b>organism</b> and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.|$|E
25|$|Transgenic {{plants have}} genes {{inserted}} into them that {{are derived from}} another species. The inserted genes can come from species within the same kingdom (plant to plant) or between kingdoms (for example, bacteria to plant). In many cases the inserted DNA has to be modified slightly in order to correctly and efficiently express in the <b>host</b> <b>organism.</b> Transgenic plants are used to express proteins like the cry toxins from B. thuringiensis, herbicide resistant genes, antibodies and antigens for vaccinations A study led by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found also viral genes in transgenic plants.|$|E
25|$|Because {{teeth are}} very resistant, often {{preserved}} when bones are not, and reflect the diet of the <b>host</b> <b>organism,</b> {{they are very}} valuable to archaeologists and palaeontologists. Early fish such as the thelodonts had scales composed of dentine and an enamel-like compound, suggesting that the origin of teeth was from scales which were retained in the mouth. Fish {{as early as the}} late Cambrian had dentine in their exoskeleton, which may have functioned in defense or for sensing their environment. Dentine can be as hard as the rest of teeth and is composed of collagen fibres, reinforced with hydroxyapatite.|$|E
40|$|The {{advances}} {{that have been}} made in metabolic engineering of various <b>host</b> <b>organisms</b> today enables a growing number of chemical compounds to be produced from sugars, rather than petroleum.
