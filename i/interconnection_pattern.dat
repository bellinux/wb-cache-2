Localized interconnections between subdivided switches are combined with simpler global interconnections. The interconnections between subdivided switches can be implemented by use of metallic traces on smart-pixel arrays. The global interconnections would be provided by optical free-space techniques. Several advantages arise from this procedure: (1) The regular <b>interconnection</b> <b>pattern</b> is decomposed into several pipes (collection of light beams that form a complete pattern) without loss of functionality. (2) The <b>interconnection</b> <b>pattern</b> may be optimized by variation of {{the placement of the}} switches in a switching network (e. g., to obtain a minimum deflection angle).

40|$|Two radix-R regular <b>interconnection</b> <b>pattern</b> {{families}} of factorizations {{for both the}} FFT and the IFFT -also known as parallel or Pease factorizations- are reformulated and presented. Number R is any power of 2 and N, {{the size of the}} transform, any power of R. The first radix- 2 parallel FFT algorithm -one of the two known radix- 2 topologies- was proposed by Pease. Other authors extended the Pease parallel algorithm to different radix and other particular solutions were also reported. The presented {{families of}} factorizations for both the FFT and the IFFT are derived from the well-known Cooley-Tukey factorizations, first, for the radix- 2 case, and then, for the general radix-R case. Here we present the complete set of parallel algorithms, that is, algorithms with equal <b>interconnection</b> <b>pattern</b> stage-to-stage topology. In this paper the parallel factorizations are derived by using a unified notation based {{on the use of the}} Kronecker product and the even-odd permutation matrix to form the rest of permutation matrices. The radix-R generalization is done in a very simple way. It is shown that, both FFT and IFFT share <b>interconnection</b> <b>pattern</b> solutions.

40|$|The {{microscopic}} principles organizing dynamic {{units in}} complex networks—from proteins to power generators—can {{be understood in}} terms of network ‘motifs’: small <b>interconnection</b> <b>patterns</b> that appear much more frequently in real networks than expected in random networks. When considered as small subgraphs isolated from a large network, these motifs are more robust to parameter variations, easier to synchronize than other possible subgraphs, and can provide specific functionalities. But one can isolate these subgraphs only by assuming, for example, a significant separation of timescales, and the origin of network motifs and their functionalities when embedded in larger networks remain unclear. Here we show that most motifs emerge from <b>interconnection</b> <b>patterns</b> that best exploit the intrinsic stability characteristics at different scales of interconnection, from simple nodes to whole modules. This functionality suggests an efficient mechanism to stably build complex systems by recursively interconnecting nodes and modules as motifs.

40|$|The {{established}} methodologies {{for studying}} computational complexity {{can be applied}} to the new problems posed by very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. This thesis develops a “VLSI model of computation” and derives upper and lower bounds on the silicon area and time required to solve the problems of sorting and discrete Fourier transformation. In particular, the area A and time T taken by any VLSI chip using any algorithm to perform an N-point Fourier transform must satisfy AT^ 2 ≥ c N^ 2 ^ 2 N, for some fixed c > 0. A more general result for both sorting and Fourier transformation is that AT^ 2 x = Ω(N^ 1 +x^ 2 x N) for any x in the range 0 < x < 1. Also, the energy dissipated by a VLSI chip during the solution of either of these problems is at least Ω(N^ 3 / 2 N). The tightness of these bounds is demonstrated by the existence of nearly optimal circuits for both sorting and Fourier transformation. The circuits based on the shuffle-exchange <b>interconnection</b> <b>pattern</b> are fast but large: T = O(^ 2 N) for Fourier transformation, T = O(^ 3 N) for sorting; both have area A of at most O(N^ 2 / 1 / 2 N). The circuits based on the mesh <b>interconnection</b> <b>pattern</b> are slow but small: T = O(N^ 1 / 2 N), A = O(N ^ 2 N). ...|$|E
