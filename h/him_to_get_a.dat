5|$|Born in Florida, Cox {{struggled}} in school due to severe dyslexia. His teachers advised <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job {{in which he}} worked with his hands, so he studied sculpture at the University of South Florida, and majored in art. Cox {{took a job as}} an insurance agent after college, but his income disappointed him, and he sought out higher-paying work.|$|E
5|$|His {{frequent}} absences {{from school}} jeopardized {{his position as}} a diver on his school's swim team. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother's demands for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job or continue his education. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence {{of his father and}} residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house. He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley soon {{gave up his}} apprenticeship, {{and after}} a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here he picked up a working {{knowledge}} of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, Brearley's rift {{with the}} Lancashire committee became irreconcilable {{and at the}} beginning of 1912 it was clear he would play no county cricket. However, so well-thought of was he that, playing when business allowed for Cheshire in the Minor Counties competition, Brearley played one further Test but the wicket was too soft for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> foothold.|$|E
25|$|Charles William Key, PC (8 August 1883 – 6 December 1964) was a British {{schoolmaster}} and Labour Party politician. Coming {{from a very}} working-class background, {{the generosity}} of a family friend {{made it possible for}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> start in life and train as a teacher; he entered politics through Poplar Borough Council, and was elected to Parliament to replace George Lansbury. Serving in junior posts during the Attlee government, he remained in Parliament until the age of 81.|$|E
25|$|Hayes {{established}} the Pocasset Club to help <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{hold on the}} district. The club {{would become one of}} the strongest clubs in the Tammany Hall organization. For years the clubhouse was at 208 East 116th Street from which Hayes ruled as the Tammany chieftain. The 28th Assembly District (formerly the 33rd Assembly District) in lower East Harlem became his political stronghold for the next 20 years. At the time the district was bounded roughly by 106th Street, Park Avenue, 119th Street and the East River and included Ward's Island and Randall's Island and the Little Italy section. It had the smallest vote of any Assembly district in Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|Orwell married Eileen O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the {{political}} crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At {{the end of}} the year, concerned by Francisco Franco's military uprising, (supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and local groups such as Falange), Orwell decided to go to Spain {{to take part in the}} Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation in situ, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Wuornos hitchhiked to Florida, {{where she}} met 69-year-old yacht club {{president}} Lewis Gratz Fell. They married that same year, and the announcement of their nuptials was printed in the local newspaper's society pages. However, Wuornos continually involved herself in confrontations at their local bar and eventually {{went to jail for}} assault. She also hit Fell with his own cane, leading <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> restraining order against her. She returned to Michigan where, on July 14, 1976, she was arrested in Antrim County and charged with assault and disturbing the peace for throwing a cue ball at a bartender's head. On July 17, her brother Keith died of esophageal cancer and Wuornos received $10,000 from his life insurance. Wuornos and Fell annulled their marriage on July 21 after only nine weeks. In August 1976, Wuornos was given a $105 fine for drunk driving. She used Keith's inheritance money to pay the fine and spent the rest within two months by using it to buy luxuries including a new car, which she wrecked shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{seventh and}} {{deciding}} {{game of the}} series was scheduled for Sunday night, October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an extra day of rest due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 3 start earlier in the series, {{was supposed to take}} the mound for the Red Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> third day of rest and thus be ready to go for the decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night if he was needed.|$|E

25|$|Hobbs {{was educated}} at a primary school {{affiliated}} with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's. In 1891, {{he moved to}} York Street Boys' School, where in contrast to his previous school, his family had to pay fees for him to attend. He later wrote {{that he was a}} poor scholar but was more successful at sports. Both he and his mother later recounted that he was rarely in trouble at home or school, except when carrying out practical jokes. He was also heavily involved in St Matthew's Church, and {{was a member of the}} church choir. Although his first appearance in a cricket match was as a last minute substitute playing for Jesus College choir, he played regularly for the St Matthew's choir team, which he went on to captain, and the York Street school team. He was also a founder member of a team called the Ivy Club which played on Parker's Piece. During holidays, he helped his father at work on the Jesus College ground. In his final year at York Street, in order to supplement the family budget, he took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house where his duties mainly involved cleaning. When he left school in 1895, Hobbs initially worked as an errand boy before his father's connections at the university helped <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Then, aged 16, he began a potentially more permanent career working as an apprentice gas fitter.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Alex Seropian was {{pursuing}} a mathematics {{degree at the}} University of Chicago, as the university did not offer undergraduate degrees in computer science. Seropian's first video game was a Pong clone called Gnop! (Pong spelled backwards). Seropian released Gnop! free of charge, though a few players paid Seropian for the source code. Living at home shortly before graduation, his father's wishes for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job convinced Seropian {{to start his own}} game company instead. Seropian founded Bungie in 1991 to publish [...] Seropian culled funding from friends and family, assembling the game boxes and writing the disks himself. Operation: Desert Storm sold 2,500copies, and Seropian looked for another game to publish.|$|E
500|$|In {{naming the}} character, {{executive}} producer and head writer Russell T Davies {{drew inspiration from}} the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> grip of the character on the blank page. Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived {{with the intention of}} forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, [...] "Is he a force for good or ill?" ...|$|E

He auditioned unsuccessfully for 10 years before he landed the role.|$|R
500|$|When Gareth David-Lloyd {{was cast}} in the role, the {{character}} was renamed Ianto Jones. This {{was inspired by the}} character of Yanto Jones, also played by David-Lloyd, in Russell T Davies's 2004 comedy-drama Mine All Mine. Ianto shares the surname [...] "Jones" [...] with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones, Torchwood character Eugene Jones ("Random Shoes"), and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies's earlier Queer as Folk; Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> grip of the character on the blank page. In developing the character's attire, costume designer Ray Holman comments: [...] "Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot. He started off with some nice but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one, which were top-end fitted ones but always very sober. Towards the end of series one, I also got him into a waistcoat, and everyone thought that looked really good.|$|E
500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} entry of the series to be {{directed}} by Duchovny. While Duchovny was working on plot points with Carter, the two agreed that the episode would serve as Duchovny's directorial debut. As the episode did not heavily feature his character, since it is framed as a flashback, Duchovny was {{able to focus on}} pre-production. This narratological method also gave Anderson a minor respite from her work. While Duchovny later expressed gratitude that [...] "The Unnatural" [...] enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feel for directing, he also experienced severe anxiety during the production process because of the stress of both writing and directing. However, when the episode was finished, Duchovny was pleased, calling the results [...] "great." [...] He later noted that his stress was largely uncalled for because the episode would have been made even [...] "if [...] just showed up and drooled for 24 hours a day." ...|$|E
500|$|His work, {{including}} the New Orleans postcards, had attracted admirers, who, {{in addition to}} Smith, helped <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job with the San Francisco Chronicle in 1892. [...] While there, he attracted reader attention {{for his ability to}} draw animals. [...] He resigned in April 1893 because {{he wanted to go to}} Chicago and see the World's Columbian Exposition, and his contacts secured him a position with the Chicago Herald. [...] At the Herald, one of his jobs was to illustrate the horse races at Washington Park. [...] He was dismissed from the Herald, and in one account ascribed his dismissal to going every day to visit and sketch the Arabian horses on exhibit at the World's Fair. [...] However, more likely, the poor economy and the end of the fair caused the Herald to lay him off, and Davenport suggested as much in a 1905 interview. While at the Daily Herald, he married Daisy Moor, who traveled from her home in San Francisco's to Chicago in order to marry him.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Workman fled, Schultz {{staggered}} {{out of the}} bathroom, {{clutching his}} side, and sat at his table.

50|$|In {{his late}} teens, Count Bass D {{enrolled}} at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, {{to take advantage}} of the school's instruments to finish his demo tape. He then broadcast his first Hip-Hop video on campus. His demo led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> record deal with Chaos Recordings where he released his first studio album, Pre-Life Crisis in early 1995.The album was considered too progressive, and the label found it difficult to market the album. Count was then dropped from the label.|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the energy crisis of 1973, Alfred Benlloch began a long series of experiments and patents in the field of solar energy.Numerous patents that lead <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> independent system design, with low cost and capable of delivering both hot water heating and cooling as well as electricity.

500|$|Princess Caroline's {{unconventional}} behaviour led, in 1807, to {{accusations that}} she had had sexual relations with other men since the separation. [...] Caroline was caring for a young child, William Austin, who was alleged to be her child by another man. [...] The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed [...] "the Delicate Investigation" [...] would turn up evidence of adultery that would permit <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother. Charlotte was aware of the investigation. [...] The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter caught sight of each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince's command to have no contact with Charlotte, pretended not to see her. [...] To George's bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess's behaviour was very much open to misconstruction. [...] The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards. [...] After the conclusion of the Delicate Investigation, the Prince reluctantly allowed Charlotte to see her mother again, with the condition that William Austin not be a playmate.|$|E
500|$|Voorhis {{was born}} in Ottawa, Kansas, on April 6, 1901, to Charles Brown Voorhis, of Dutch descent, and Ella Ward (Smith) Voorhis. Jerry was the {{grandson}} (and future biographer) of Aurelius Lyman Voorhis, who had [...] "ventured out to the frontier in western Kansas" [...] as merchant, land agent, and self-taught lawyer, and had scraped to send his son to college until he was forced, halfway through, to give his son the only two dollars he could spare and advise <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job. [...] Charles Voorhis took work in an investment company and as a semi-professional baseball player and rose to become an executive of the Kingman Plow Company. When that company dissolved, Charles Voorhis became an executive of the Oakland Motor Car Company, which became the Pontiac division of General Motors, and finally of the Nash Motor Company before his 1925 retirement. Jerry Voorhis began school in Ottawa, but also attended school in Oklahoma City, Peoria, Illinois and Pontiac, Michigan. He attended The Hotchkiss School, an elite boys' boarding school in Connecticut {{with close ties to}} Yale University, and subsequently attended Yale, graduating in 1923. Voorhis was elected as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, was president of the Christian Association, and was greatly influenced by the Social Gospel movement.|$|E
500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I said that I was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E
