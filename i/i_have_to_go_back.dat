500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

Think of me as I was when you came into the room, three centuries ago, and you turned and looked, frowning at me in the candle-light; remember that and look at me now. What is the difference? Does it shock you? Does it make the whole world seem a trick, a sham? Does it simply sour your life to think such a thing possible? Oh, the hours I've spent gloating on Widderstone's miserable mask of skin and bone, as I was saying to your brother only last night, and never knew until they shuffled me that the old self too was nothing better than a stifling suffocating mask.' ...|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-2000s, Mase {{spent time}} touring and {{recording}} with G-Unit {{and became a}} mainstay in 50 Cent's public image, appearing together on magazine covers, on stage, and in music videos. He has since said that working with the group was not something he regrets, but that the message he was sending was a mistake. He joined G-Unit {{to appeal to a}} different audience so they could see that they could change just as he did, thinking that [...] "in order to get people where I'm at, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to where I once was". Under G-Unit, he released Crucified 4 The Hood: 10 Years of Hate, a mixtape from the DJ Whoo Kid series, but an official album was never released. According to 50 Cent, Diddy refused to let Mase out of his contract with Bad Boy Records for anything less than $2 million. Uncertain that Mase's album would sell well enough to make up for that type of investment, 50 Cent gave up on trying to bring Mase onto G-Unit.|$|E

Let’s say, because I do what I do; I’m an R&B artist. So let’s {{say that if you}} could put a soundtrack to my life, in the last 5 years, this would be the soundtrack. So it’s kind of like, I’m telling my business. You know what I mean and I didn’t really want to. But it’s going to help when it comes to relationships like love and all of that because it’s like the sh*t really happens. The same way Steve Harvey did the book Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man. So it’s like the album, like I messed up with my main chick, trying to get with the side-chick. Like she was out there, but I didn’t know. So now I’m learning and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and fix my relationship because the side-chick got me all tore up. So for instance, like on the title track Guilty Conscience, that’s me talking to my main girl. And now I’m like, where you going, what are you doing, why are you doing this, why are you putting on make-up? You know what I mean and that’s the guilty conscience and what it’s about." ...|$|E

5000|$|After working {{together}} for about seven months, Cudi was being evicted from his apartment. With {{plans to move}} back to Cleveland, Ohio, Dot da Genius' parents allowed Cudi to stay with them and their family, so the two could continue {{working together}} and pursue their music careers: [...] "I remember being like, 'Shit—what am I going to do? I’m {{going to have to go}} back to Cleveland, go back to my old job, stack some money and then come back.' I was talking to O-Dot about this, and they were saying that I had to be out by January 31st—the day after my fucking birthday. So I was like, 'I don’t know what I’m going to do, but if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home, you can still send me beats, and we can still work.” I brought it up, not for a guilt trip, but like, “Yo fam, how are we still going to work?' Because I knew if I wasn’t proactive, I wasn’t going to get anything accomplished. So I was like, 'If I go back to Cleveland, it’s temporary, literally until I can get my paper back up.' I was like, 'Man, I’m just about to pass out here. Is it cool if I stay here?' and he was like, 'Yeah, yeah.' So I slept on the couch. I woke up in the morning, and Dot came downstairs, like, “Yo, my parents want to talk to you.” I was like, “What the fuck? What happened? What’d I do?” I thought I was in trouble. So I went up to his parents room, and his dad was like, 'O-Dot told us about your situation, and we’ve seen that you come to the house, working with Dipo. You guys have been productive, staying out of trouble, and you guys are working towards something.' And he was like, 'I think about it like this, if it was my son, what would I want another family to do for my son?' Long story short, he said, 'You can stay here as long as you like, until you get on your feet. And you can still work with Dipo. You guys can still work on your music. So it’s a win-win.' I remember being like, 'Holy shit. Like, really?' Because I was really about to go back home, and I ended up staying there, and the rest is history. It was really, really an amazing thing. It was a blessing just to have them in my life and for them to want to do that for me. Like I said, me and Dot only knew each other for seven months." ...|$|E

I’m in the day room now. This is really a swell day room, better than our other one. There’s a pool table here. Also a piano! Yesterday we had a real tough {{physical}} exam. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> for a recheck on my depth perception, it’s not to hot. But don’t worry hon, I’ll pass it. I’ve been practicing and exercising my eyes. A fellow here loaned me a machine to help me. The test is to line up two sticks in a box about 25 ’ away, i. e. : [illustration] By pulling on the strings I’m supposed to line the sticks up side by side. It’s not easy, but I’ll do it. They give me several chances, and if I can’t they’ll send me to an eye doctor who will help me. I haven’t been to town yet because of my retest Monday, I’m trying to save my eyes. Will probably go today. We had our first real personal and barracks inspection Friday. The personal inspection we had to fall in at 1300 with our class A’s on and stand at attention while a first louie inspected us for shined shoes, clean shave, pressed uniforms, and haircuts. By the way I got a hair cut and it’s not so bad, just sort of a close trim around the sides. As I probably told you, I took a classification test Tuesday, I think it was Tuesday. You can’t keep track here. Well anyhow, it was a test to classify us in the air corps in case we wash out of the cadets. I was classified as a gunner mechanic, gunner radioman, or a gunner crew chief. But if I do wash out, or can’t pass that test Monday I’m going to try for Aerial Photography, but I won’t wash out, don’t worry. I just can’t hon, pray for me like hell. Got Bobby’s letter yesterday along with yours. I’m going to write her now. I love you, angel, with all my heart. Take good care of your sweet self and my sisters and nephews. All my love to all.
