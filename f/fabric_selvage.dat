30|$|Skewness is a known fabric defect {{which occurs}} in both woven and {{knitting}} fabrics. Skewness is created when {{the pattern is}} distorted across the fabric width. In other words, it is a condition resulting when weft yarns are angularly displaced from a line perpendicular to the <b>fabric</b> <b>selvage,</b> usually, due to uneven distribution of tension (ASTM-International 2006; Lee 1989).|$|E
30|$|The {{test methods}} {{used in the}} current study require the use of two or three {{specimens}} for each experimental group (AATCC Test Methods 124 - 2011, 135 - 2010, and 79 - 2010 require three specimens; Test Method 130 - 2010 requires two). To increase the precision of the results, five specimens (five repeats) were used for each experimental group. Five specimen cutting diagrams were prepared to ensure that the five test specimens for each experimental group did not contain the same warp or filling yarns. No specimen was taken nearer than 6.5  cm (2.5 in.) from the <b>fabric</b> <b>selvage</b> edge (Merkel 1991). All specimens were cut to the size of 38 [*]×[*] 38  cm (15 [*]×[*] 15 in.) according to AATCC Test Methods 124 - 2011, 130 - 2010, 135 - 2010, and 179 - 2010.|$|E
50|$|A selvage (US English) or {{selvedge}} (British English) is a self-finished edge of <b>fabric.</b> The <b>selvages</b> {{keep the}} <b>fabric</b> from unraveling or fraying. The selvages {{are a result}} of how the fabric is created. In woven <b>fabric,</b> <b>selvages</b> are the edges that run parallel to the warp (the longitudinal threads that run {{the entire length of the}} fabric), and are created by the weft thread looping back at the end of each row. In knitted <b>fabrics,</b> <b>selvages</b> are the unfinished yet structurally sound edges that were neither cast on nor bound off. Historically, the term selvage applied only to loom woven fabric, though now can be applied to flat-knitted fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Very often <b>fabric</b> {{near the}} <b>selvage</b> is unused and discarded, {{as it may}} have a {{different}} weave pattern, or may lack pile or prints that are present {{on the rest of}} the fabric, requiring that the <b>selvage</b> <b>fabric</b> be cut off or hidden in a hem. Since industrial loomed <b>fabric</b> often has <b>selvages</b> that are thicker than the rest of the <b>fabric,</b> the <b>selvage</b> reacts differently. It may shrink or [...] "pucker" [...] during laundering and cause the rest of the object made with it to pucker also.|$|R
5000|$|Poplin {{traditionally}} {{consisted of}} a silk warp with a weft of worsted yarn. In this case, as the weft {{is in the form}} of a stout cord the fabric has a ridged structure, like rep, which gave depth and softness to the lustre of the silky surface. The ribs run across the <b>fabric</b> from <b>selvage</b> to selvage.|$|R
50|$|Applying {{the term}} selvage to a hand-knitted object is still {{relatively}} new. Most books on <b>fabric</b> define a <b>selvage</b> as {{the edge of}} a woven cloth. However, the term is coming into usage for hand-knitted objects. The edges of machine-knitted fabric on the other hand are rarely if ever referred to as selvages.|$|R
40|$|The {{practical}} {{requirements for}} textile inkjet-printing systems and factors influencing printing quality are discussed. Ink-jet ink must meet very stringent {{physical and chemical}} criteria for compatibility with specific printers' needs and substrates. Such criteria include the viscosity, surface tension and conductivity of the ink, which may technically affect the efficiency and economy of ink-jet printing. The problems of printing quality due to textile substrates also discussed. The quality of the textile substrate associated with fabric pretreatment, <b>fabric</b> hairiness, <b>selvages,</b> warp and weft alignment, fabric alignment, fabric tension and shrinkage during printing should be carefully monitored and controlled during and before the ink-jet printing production. The author suggests further study be conducted to overcome the present limitations in ink-jet printing. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
50|$|In a flat or abutted seam, {{two pieces}} of fabric are joined edge-to edge with no overlap and sewn with hand or machine {{stitching}} that encloses the raw edges. Antique or old German seam is the 19th century name for a hand-sewn flat seam that joins {{two pieces of}} <b>fabric</b> at their <b>selvages.</b> This type of construction is found in traditional linen garments such as shirts and chemises, and in hand-made sheets pieced from narrow loom widths of linen.|$|R
5000|$|In textile terminology, threads {{that run}} {{the length of}} the fabric (longitudinally) are warp ends. Threads running {{laterally}} from edge to edge, that is from left side to right side of the fabric as it emerges from the loom, are weft picks. Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process. The weave used to construct the selvage may be the same or different from the weave of the body of the <b>fabric</b> cloth. Most <b>selvages</b> are narrow, but some may be as wide as [...]75 in. Descriptions woven into the selvage using special jacquards, colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes. For many end-uses the selvage is discarded. Selvages are 'finished' and will not fray because the weft threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the warp.|$|R
