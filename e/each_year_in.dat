5|$|The tribes traded freely, {{and soon}} many had {{acquired}} French guns, while others had traded for Spanish horses. Tribes {{without access to}} either resource were left at a disadvantage. The Lipan Apache, who had been seasonal farmers, were soon pressed by the Comanche, who had horses, and the Wichita, who had guns. The Apaches were bitter enemies of the Tejas of East Texas and had transferred their enmity to the Spanish as friends of the Tejas. After discovering San Antonio in 1720, the Apache began repeatedly raiding the area to steal livestock, especially horses. An average of 3Spaniards died <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> Texas {{as a result of}} Apache attacks, with approximately 100animals taken <b>each</b> <b>year.</b> <b>In</b> retaliation, the Spanish launched multiple attacks on the Apaches, capturing horses and mules, hides and other plunder, and taking Apache captives, whom the Spanish used as household servants. By 1731, however, the San Antonio garrison was begging the government for help in negotiating a peace with the tribes.|$|E
