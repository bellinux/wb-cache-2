5|$|He was demoted to {{the reserve}} side soon {{thereafter}} by manager Míchel, who had replaced Bielsa {{early in the}} season, and made only one more senior appearance for the campaign. Much of his absence {{in the second half}} of the season also came as a result of him suffering from glue ear, a condition which traps liquid behind the eardrum and affects hearing. Míchel confirmed that Sparagna had been suffering from the condition since the start of the season and had unsuccessfully undergone treatment in late 2015. In April he began a new cortisone treatment but was unable to return to the pitch for fear that he would fall short of doping regulations as a result of the medication. Míchel later revealed that his reluctance to play Sparagna, despite the risks involved had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, ultimately contributed towards him being sacked by Vincent Labrune and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who at the time were the president and owner of the club respectively. Sparagna ultimately made 15 appearances across all competitions as Marseille ended the season in 13th position in Ligue 1 and as runners-up in the Coupe de France.|$|E
25|$|One {{question}} arising {{early in}} the story is why God rejects Cain's sacrifice, since Cain never received instructions about how to sacrifice correctly, nor had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> anything wrong, and why God then admonishes Cain with a warning about sin. The Midrash suggest that although Abel brought the best meat from his flock, Cain did not set aside for God {{the best of his}} harvest.|$|E
25|$|Charles Cutler Torrey taught Semitic {{languages}} at Yale University. His lasting contribution {{has been}} to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He {{thought this was a}} point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, {{he would have had to}} use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.|$|E

Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste. After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.|$|E
25|$|Israeli emigrants {{working in}} low status {{immigrant}} occupations that the diaspora Jewish population tends {{not to engage}} in or has long-ago abandoned such as taxi driving, auto repair, security guards, mall cart sales and other tasks. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told of a waiter who once came over to her at a New York luncheon and whispered in Hebrew that there was ham in the dish she had been served. When she asked him how he knew Hebrew, he told her he was an Israeli. And what work had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E
25|$|Count Nostitz {{immediately}} {{sprang from}} his saddle, and holding {{with his left}} hand the bridle of his own horse, which had been slightly wounded, he drew his sword, firmly resolved to shed, if necessary, the last drop of his blood in defence of his commander. Scarcely had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, when he saw the Cuirassiers rushing forward at the charge. To attract as little as possible their attention, he remained motionless. Most fortunately, the rapidity with which the Cuirassiers advanced amidst the twilight, already obscured by the falling rain, precluded them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group, although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly brushed against the aide de camp's horse.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a matter}} of {{speculation}} why Hannibal did not march on Rome or what might have happened had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so immediately after Trasimene. The Carthaginian army instead marched south-east into Umbria, through Perugia, although Livy refers to a failed siege of Spoletum, a Latin colony, Polybius does not mention it, and it is likely that only some Carthaginian raiders troubled the Latin colony. Hannibal, all the while ravaging the countryside, marched through Picenum towards the Adriatic coast, reaching Herita 10 days after leaving Lake Trasimene. Here Hannibal rested his army, which was suffering from scurvy, refitted the Libyan/African troops with captured Roman equipment and retrained them, and by using low grade local wine (acetum) as an ointment, brought the cavalry horses back to health. With no Roman army situated near him, Hannibal was free to choose his next course of action unhindered.|$|E
500|$|Cartoonist Milt Gross's <b>He</b> <b>Done</b> Her Wrong (1930) was {{a parody}} of the genre; the book uses varying panel designs akin to those of comics: the action {{sometimes}} takes place outside the panel borders and [...] "dialogue balloons" [...] show in images what the characters are saying. [...] Cartoonist and illustrator William Gropper's Alay-oop (1930) tells of three entertainers' disappointed dreams. [...] In Abraham Lincoln: Biography in Woodcuts (1933) Charles Turzak documented the American president. [...] Animator Myron Waldman (1908–2006) wrote a wordless tale of a plump young woman looking for a glamorous husband.

500|$|The {{success of}} [...] {{led to the}} American {{publication}} of Nückel's Destiny in 1930.

[...] The protagonist is a lumberjack, a commentary on Ward as a woodcut artist.|$|E

500|$|One {{day after}} the race, both Matteo Tosatto (...) and Eros Capecchi (...) accused Démare of having used the tow of his teamcar to rejoin the pack after his crash before the Cipressa climb. Démare rebuffed these allegations, saying that the race commissioners were right behind him and would have disqualified him, had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> {{something}} illegal. On 8 May 2016, it became public that the Italian Cycling Federation was making inquiries into the accusations about Démare, with Tosatto {{saying that he had}} given written testimony to officials about the incident.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{took place}} in June 1965. Jeffrey Hunter was unwilling to reprise his role as Captain Christopher Pike. [...] Lloyd Bridges and Jack Lord were considered, but William Shatner was finally cast as Pike's replacement, Captain James Kirk. The {{character}} of Number One, the female second-in-command, was dropped on the insistence of the NBC network, and Science Officer Spock was given Number One's unemotional demeanor. NBC was worried about Leonard Nimoy's [...] "satanic" [...] appearance and pressured for his removal. As Roddenberry later explained at conventions, {{he felt he had}} a strong enough negotiating position to save one character, but not both. Gene went on to muse that, had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> it the other way around, he could not have then married the losing actor.|$|E
500|$|While graphic novels {{generally}} use captions and dialogue, cartoonists such as Eric Drooker, Peter Kuper, , Brian Ralph, Masashi Tanaka, Lewis Trondheim, and Billy Simms {{have made}} wordless graphic novels. [...] As Gross did in <b>He</b> <b>Done</b> Her Wrong, 's wordless oeuvre uses textless word balloons containing symbols, icons, and other images. [...] The {{influence of the}} wordless novel is prominent in Drooker's Flood (1992) and Kuper's The System (1997), both metaphorical stories that focus on social themes. [...] Since 2011, the Pennsylvania State University Libraries and the Pennsylvania Center for the Book have awarded the annual Lynd Ward Prize for Graphic Novel, a cash prize established by Ward's daughters to highlight their father's influence {{on the development of}} the graphic novel.|$|E

500|$|A Contract with God has frequently, though erroneously, {{been cited}} as the first graphic novel; [...] comic book {{reviewer}} Richard Kyle had used the term in 1964 in a fan newsletter, and it had appeared {{on the cover of}} The First Kingdom (1974) by Jack Katz, with whom Eisner had corresponded. [...] A number of book-length comics preceded Contract, at least as far back as Milt Gross's <b>He</b> <b>Done</b> Her Wrong (1930). [...] A Contract with God attracted greater attention than these previous efforts partly due to Eisner's greater status in the comics community. [...] It is considered a milestone in American comics history not only for its format, but also for its literary aspirations and for having dispensed with typical comic-book genre tropes.|$|E
500|$|Ward first {{encountered}} the wordless novel with Frans Masereel's The Sun (1919) while studying art in Germany in 1926. [...] He {{returned to the}} United States in 1927 and established a career for himself as an illustrator. [...] He found Otto Nückel's wordless novel Destiny (1926) in New York City in 1929, and it inspired him to create such a work of his own. [...] appeared {{a week before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929; it nevertheless enjoyed strong sales and remains the best-selling American wordless novel. [...] Its success inspired other Americans to experiment with the medium, including cartoonist Milt Gross, who parodied [...] in <b>He</b> <b>Done</b> Her Wrong (1930). [...] In the 1970s Ward's example inspired cartoonists Art Spiegelman and Will Eisner to create their first graphic novels.|$|E
500|$|The wordless novel has {{its origin}} in the German Expressionist {{movement}} of the early 20th century. [...] The typically socialist work drew inspiration from mediaeval woodcuts and used the awkward look of that medium to express angst and frustration at social injustice. [...] The first such book was the Belgian Frans Masereel's 25 Images of a Man's Passion, published in 1918. [...] The German Otto Nückel and other artists followed Masereel's example. [...] Lynd Ward brought the genre to the United States in 1929 when he produced , which inspired other American wordless novels and a parody in 1930 by cartoonist Milt Gross with <b>He</b> <b>Done</b> Her Wrong. [...] Following an early-1930s peak in production and popularity, the genre waned {{in the face of}} competition from sound films and anti-socialist censorship in Nazi Germany and the US.|$|E

500|$|... "Death in Bloom" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez, from {{a story by}} Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The episode was {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. Both Ward and fellow series storyboard artist Tom Herpich helped Moynihan and Sanchez clean up their story. One scene, in which Finn and Jake hide from the skeletons only to have Jake's flatulence alert them to their presence, {{was supposed to be}} storyboarded by Ward. However, he was extremely tired and offered Herpich $100—the amount Ward would have earned had <b>he</b> <b>done</b> it—to storyboard the scene instead. The episode features an extremely long pan showing much of the Land of the Dead. Moynihan noted that he [...] "wanted to really go over the top and make it like 15 pages but 7 pages felt right"; he later said that he wanted to [...] "blow kids' minds" [...] with the shot. Moynihan's original pan was redesigned by background designer Dan [...] "Ghostshrimp" [...] James, who also did some of the other backgrounds for the episode. Other background were done by Chris Tsirgiotis, who, according to Moynihan, was doing his [...] "best Ghostshrimp impression"; Tsirgiotis himself later noted that, [...] "Matching Ghostshrimp’s drawing style is pretty tricky. It looks simple at first glance, but it’s actually very sophisticated and nuanced." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again.
