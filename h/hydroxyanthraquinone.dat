40|$|Abstract <b>Hydroxyanthraquinones</b> {{represent}} {{a group of}} phar-macologically active compounds characteristic for plants of the Rumex and Rheum genera. These compounds in the hu-man intestine act as laxative compounds. As they cause the greatest side effects and are often abused by the public, their accurate analysis in plants and plant-derived laxatives is much needed. To isolate compounds from plants, pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) is frequently applied. The technique has been regarded, so far, as very effective, even in isolation of sensitive compounds for which exposure time in high temperature has a negative impact. This work demonstrates some interesting and surprising results accompanying PLE of <b>hydroxyanthraquinones</b> from the Rumex crispus L. root using methanol/water mixtures as extractant. The presented results demonstrate that glycoside forms of <b>hydroxyanthraquinones</b> (emodin- 8 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside, chrysophanol- 8 -O-β-D [...] glucopyranoside, and physcion- 8 -O-β-D-glucopyranoside) are hydrolytically unstable even in the short-lasting PLE. The increase of water concentration in the extractant leads to the increase of the transformation degree of the glycoside forms to the corresponding aglycones (emodin, chrysophanol, and physcion), increasing the concentration of the latter. The rise in the PLE temperature accelerates the hydrolytical deg-radation of the glycoside forms. The extension of the extrac-tion time also intensifies this process. The presented results show that extraction of glycosides using extractants contain-ing water can lead to false conclusions about the chemical composition of plants...|$|R

The in vivo treatment of primary rat hepatocytes with danthron, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, and rhein resulted in a 2 - 3 -fold increase of DNA synthesis, lucidin and purpurin were less active, and emodin, purpuroxanthin, and alizarin were essentially inactive. In addition, danthron, rhein, and chrysophanol (preliminary data), but not alizarin, enhanced transformation of C 3 H/M 2 mouse fibroblasts initiated by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 3 -methylcholanthrene. The results of these in vitro studies suggest that <b>hydroxyanthraquinones,</b> possessing 2 hydroxy groups in the 1, 8 -positions, e. g., danthron, rhein, and chrysophanol, may have tumor-promoting activities.

The HCV genome encodes nonstructural protein 3 (NS 3) helicase, which is a potential anti-HCV drug target because its enzymatic activity is essential for viral replication. Some anthracyclines {{are known to be}} NS 3 helicase inhibitors and have a <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> moiety in their structures; mitoxantrone, a <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> analogue, is also known to inhibit NS 3 helicase. Therefore, we hypothesized that the <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> moiety alone could also inhibit NS 3 helicase. Here, we performed a structure–activity relationship study on a series of hydroxyanthraquinones by using a fluorescence-based helicase assay. Hydroxyanthraquinones inhibited NS 3 helicase with IC 50 values in the micromolar range. The inhibitory activity varied depending on the number and position of the phenolic hydroxyl groups, and among different hydroxyanthraquinones examined, 1, 4, 5, 8 -tetrahydroxyanthraquinone strongly inhibited NS 3 helicase with an IC 50 value of 6 µM.

Part Two: The synthesis of functionalized <b>hydroxyanthraquinones</b> is reported. The method utilized was applied to a total synthesis of vineomycinone B 2 methyl ester, the aglycone of the C-glycosyl anthraquinone antibiotic vineomycin B 2. <b>Hydroxyanthraquinones</b> were protected as the corresponding methoxymethyl ethers and reduced to the anthracenes with sodium borohydride in refluxing isopropanol. These anthracenes could be cleanly lithiated and functionalized by reaction with reactive electrophiles. The lithio derivatives could also be captured by stannylation and the stannanes iodinated. These iodoanthracenes underwent Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions to generate the corresponding C-C bonds in a highly regiospecific manner. The use of a protected glucal derivative generated from the commercially available tri-O-acetyl-D-glucal afforded a C-glycosyl anthracene. Hydrogenation with sodium cyanoborohydride in methanolic HCl generated the corresponding β-C-glycosyl anthracene. Further stannylation of this C-glycoside afforded a stannane that was coupled with a chiral dioxinone to incorporate the alkyl side chain. Addition of lithium dimethylcuprate results in a functionalized anthracene that contains all of the carbon - carbon bonds present in vineomycinone 82 methyl ester, and all the asymmetric centers in the correct configuration. Elaboration into vineomycinone 82 methyl ester took place by oxidation to the corresponding 9, 10 -anthraquinone followed by removal of all protecting groups with methanolic HCl...|$|R

Anthraquinones, produced as secondary metabolites in plants, constitute a large structural variety of compounds among the quinone family. Derivatives that contain hydroxyl groups, namely hydroxy-anthraquinones, are colored. They have attracted the attention of many researchers due to their large spectrum of possible applications especially in the fields of dyeing. These dyes produce a wide range of nuances in shades (red, orange and yellow). Fifteen anthraquinones’ derivatives from madder color roots (Rubia tinctorium L.) {{play an important role in}} dyeing (CI Natural Red 8). Purpurin (CI Natural Red 16) is a minor component in the madder color, but is the main dye in addition with munjistin in Indian madder (Rubia cordifolia). Alizarin (Pigment Red 83, CI Mordant Red 11) is the main red dye in madder color. Several other species, although producing hydroxyanthraquinones dyes, are not considered viable contributors to the natural red dye market. This is the case of Anchusa tinctoria, Lithospermum spp., Carthamus tinctoria or Galium species. Some <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> dyes, either extracted from insects (carminic acid), microbes (Arpink red) or plants (alizarin from European madder roots), are already manufactured and marketed as natural colorants in textile, food, cosmetic or pharmaceutics industries.

After incubation of O-glycosides (sennoside A and B, frangulin A, ruberythric acid and lucidinprimveroside) with rat liver S 9 preparation, rat hepatocytes or rat coecal bacteria, the corresponding aglycones were liberated.

In vitro antimetastatic property of AE was evaluated by adhesion and Boyden chamber invasion assays.

40|$|Background: Alizarin and {{purpurin}} are di- and trihydroxyanthraquinones {{derived from}} Rubia tinctorum L. Previous pharmacological {{studies have demonstrated}} that they exhibit certain degree of selective inhibitory effects towards cancer cells suggesting their application as a targeted drug for cancer. Our present work was aimed to investigate the suitability of <b>hydroxyanthraquinones</b> of Rubia tinctorum L. for targeted tumor therapy. The effects of alizarin, purpurin and an aqueous extract from transformed hairy root culture of Rubia tinctorum L. were examined on (1) cell proliferation, (2) apoptosis, (3) cell adhesion/morphology and (4) migration (chemotaxis, chemokinesis) of human melanoma cell lines (A 2058, HT 168 -M 1) and human fibroblast cells (MRC- 5), as well as (5) the aqueous extract was analytically characterized. Methods: The aqueous extract was prepared from R. tinctorum hairy root culture and qualitatively analyzed by HPLC and ESI-MS methods. The cell growth inhibitory activity of anthraquinones was evaluated by MTT-assay and by flow cytometry. The effect of anthraquinones on cell adhesion was measured by an impedance based technique, the xCELLigence SP. For the chemotaxis assay NeuroProbe® chamber was used. Computer based holographic microscopy was applied to analyze chemokinetic responses as well as morphometry. Statistical significance was determined by the one-way ANOVA test. Results: In the aqueous extract, munjistin (Mr = 284, tR = 18. 4 min) as a principal component and three minor anthraquinones (pseudopurpurin, rubiadin and nordamnacanthal) were identified. The purpurin elicited a stronger but not apoptosis-mediated antitumor effect in melanoma cells (A 2058 : 10 - 6 - 10 - 5 M: 90. 6 - 64. 1 %) than in normal fibroblasts (10 - 6 - 10 - 5 M: 97. 6 - 84. 8 %). The aqueous extract in equimolar concentrations showed the most potent cytotoxicity after 72 h incubation (A 2058 : 10 - 6 - 10 - 5 M: 87. 4 - 55. 0 %). All tested substances elicited chemorepellent effect in melanoma cells, while in MRC- 5 fibroblasts, only the alizarin exhibited such a repellent character. Indices of chemokinesis measured by holographic microscopy (migration, migration directness, motility and motility speed) were significantly enhanced by alizarin and purpurin as well, while morphometric changes were weak in the two melanoma cell lines. Conclusions: Our results highlight the effective and selective inhibitory activity of purpurin towards melanoma cells and its possible use as a targeted anticancer agent.

These findings may point to the application of specific synthesis conditions favouring the 2, 6 -substitution and thus leading to an excessive amount of by-products {{with respect to the}} target species. Flavopurpurin was detected by other authors in late 19 th century textiles from the China National Silk Museum [15]. A mono-hydroxyanthraquinone was also identified in the samples from the Lefranc collection, but neither the UV–Vis nor the mass spectra located the position of the substituent unambiguously. One sample, namely P. 20 (“Laque de Garance V”), also contained the imine form of alizarin (alizarin- 9 -imine). This species is easily formed when alizarin is treated with ammonia and one of its keto groups undergoes condensation; the imine form is in equilibrium with alizarin. Note that if the sample is extracted in acidic solution, the peak corresponding to the imine form disappears from the chromatogram.|$|E
40|$|Experiential and sensory {{evaluation}} {{is an ancient}} method that remains important in the current quality control system of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs). The process is rapid and convenient when {{evaluating the quality of}} crude materials in TCM markets. However, {{sensory evaluation}} has been met with skepticism because it is mainly based on experience and lacks a scientific basis. In this study, rhubarb was selected to demonstrate how color-based sensory evaluation could differentiate the quality of herbal medicines objectively. The colors of the rhubarb samples, expressed as RGB values, were obtained from different parts and forms of the plant, including the plant’s surface, fracture surface color, and a powdered form with or without treatment with a color-developing reagent. We first divided the rhubarb samples into three grades based on the total content of five <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> derivatives, the major pharmacological components in rhubarb. Then, a three-layer back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), calibrated with selected training samples, was used to correlate the quality of the rhubarb with its color. The color of the rhubarb powder after coloration attained the highest accuracy (92. 3 %) in predicting the quality grade of the test samples with the established artificial neural networks. Finally, a standardized colorimetric grading scale was created based on the spatial distribution of the rhubarb samples in a two-dimensional chromaticity diagram according to the colors of the powdered rhubarb after color enhancement. By comparing the color between the scale and the tested samples, similar to performing a pH test with indicator paper, subjects withou...|$|E
40|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} microscopy (TPEM) is used {{to visualize}} and track the uptake and movement of anthracene and phenanthrene from a contaminated growth medium into living unmodified roots of maize and wheat over a 56 -day period. The degradation of anthracene was also directly observed within the cortex cells of both species. The power of this technique is that neither the plant nor the compound require altering (staining or sectioning) to visualize them, meaning {{they are in their}} natural form throughout the experiment. Initially both compounds bound to the epidermis along the zone of elongation, passing through the epidermal cells to reach the cortex within the root hair, and branching zones of the root. The PAHs entered the epidermis radially; however, once within the cortex cells this movement was dominated by slow lateral movement of both compounds toward the shoot. Highly focused “streams” of compound were observed to form over time; zones where phenanthrene concentrated extended up to 1500 μm in length over a 56 -day period, for example, passing through several adjoining cells, and were detectable in cell walls and cell vacuoles. Radial movement was not observed to extend beyond the cortex cells to reach the vascular tissues of the plant. The longitudinal movement of both compounds was not observed to extend beyond the root base into the stem or vegetative parts of the plant. The lateral movement of both compounds within the cortex cells was dominated by movement within the cell walls, suggesting apoplastic flow through multiple cell walls, but with a low level of symplastic movement to transport compound into the cellular vacuoles. Degradation of anthracene to the partial breakdown products anthrone, anthraquinone, and <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> was observed directly in the zones of root elongation and branching. The technique and observations have important applications to the fields of agrochemistry and phytoremediation...|$|E
40|$|Many fungal toxins {{exhibit in}} vitro and in vivo antineoplastic effects on various cancer cell types. Luteoskyrin, a <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> {{has been proved}} to be a potent {{inhibitor}} against Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The comparative antitumor activity and antioxidant status of MT 81 and its structural analogue [Acetic acid-MT 81 (Aa-MT 81) ] having polyhydroxyanthraquinone structure were assessed against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) tumor in mice. The in vitro cytotoxicity was measured by the viability of EAC cells after direct treatment of the said compounds. In in vivo study, MT 81 and its structural analogue were administered (i. p.) at the two different doses (5, 7 mg MT 81; 8. 93, 11. 48 mg Aa-MT 81 /kg body weight) for 7 days after 24 hrs. of tumor inoculation. The activities were assessed using mean survival time (MST), increased life span (ILS), tumor volume, viable tumor cell count, peritoneal cell count, protein percentage and hematological parameters. Antioxidant status was determined by malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content, and by the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CA T). MT 81 and its structural analogues increased the mean survival time, normal peritoneal cell count. They decreased the tumor volume, viable tumor cell count, hemoglobin percentage and packed cell volume. Differential counts of WBC, total counts of RBC & WBC that altered by EAC inoculation, were restored in a dose-dependent manner. Increased MDA and decreased GSH content and reduced activity of SOD, and catalase in EAC bearing mice were returned towards normal after the treatment of MT 81 and its structural analogue. Being less toxic than parent toxin MT 81, the structural analogue showed more prominent antineoplastic activities against EAC cells compared to MT 81. At the same time, both compounds exhibit to some extent antioxidant potential for the EAC-bearing mice...|$|E

The color is mainly caused by quinones and carotenoids. Various reports on the quinone pigments of crinoids have been pub-lished. 1) At present, the following four groups of polyketide-derived pigments, linear and angular naphthopyrones, 2 — 4) 4 -acylanthraquinones, 5 — 7) 3 -alkylanthraquinones, 6, 8) and dia-metric bianthrones (bianthraquinones and phenanthroperyl-enequinones) 9, 10) are known to occur in crinoids. Some of the quinone pigments in crinoid are present in sulfate form. 1, 7) This prompted us to search for water-soluble quinone pig-ments in crinoids. This paper reports the isolation and struc-tural elucidation of new quinone sulfates from Tropiometra afra macrodiscus and Oxycomanthus japonicus by chemical and spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, antifeedant activity of anthraquinone sulfate on fish is reported. Structure of a New Anthraquinone Sulfate from T. afra macrodiscus The acetone extract of T. afra macrodiscus was partitioned with Et 2 O–n-hexane (1 : 1) and water to remove fat and carotenoids from the aqueous acetone solution. The purple-red colored aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc to remove free anthraquinones. The aqueous layer was evap-orated, and the dark purple residue was subjected succes-sively to column chromatography on ODS and preparative HPLC on ODS to yield a water-soluble yellow pigment 1. Compound 1 showed UV–vis absorption maxima at 225, 262, and 435 nm, indicating a <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> chro-mophore and IR absorption maxima at 1620 and 1481 cm 21, which are characteristic absorption bands of anthraquinone. 8) Furthermore, 1 showed strong IR absorptions at 1249 and 1057 cm 21, suggesting {{the presence of a}} sulfate group. 7) Neg-ative ion FAB-MS gave a quasi-molecular ion at m/z 443, corresponding to the formula [C 18 H 14 O 10 SNa 2 H] 2.

40|$|Dothistromin is {{a bright}} orange-red pigment {{produced}} by the pine-needle pathogen Dothistroma pini Hulbary, the causal agent of a necrotic disease known as dothistromal blight. This compound, implicated as a fungal toxin, has been isolated both from laboratory cultures of D. pini and from infected Pinus radiata foliage. Detailed chemical investigation by Gallagher (1971) showed that dothistromin is a tri -α- <b>hydroxyanthraquinone</b> fused to a substituted tetrahydrobifuran ring system. The bifuran ring moiety is incorporated in other fungal metabolites including the extremely toxic and carcinogenic aflatoxin compounds. There is an increasing body of {{evidence to suggest that}} these fungal metabolites share a common biosynthetic origin. Bioassay has demonstrated the toxicity of dothistromin to the unicellular green alga, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and to tissue cultures of P. attexuata. The very low level of solubility of the compound in aqueous solutions has precluded bioassay using pine seedlings. This thesis reports an investigation of the biochemical changes induced by dothistromin in microbiological systems. In the course of this investigation dothistromin {{has been shown to be}} toxic to a range of microorganisms in addition to its known toxicity to Chlorella pyrenoidosa. These studies have suggested possible ways of increasing the sensitivity of bioassays for dothistromin. It was found that the addition of dothistromin to liquid cultures of Chlorella as an ethyl acetate solution caused reproducible levels of inhibition, provided that the ethyl acetate concentration was less than 0. 5 % Batch culture techniques were used to establish the levels of dothistromin required for inhibition of growth of Chlorella. The ratio of dothistromin concentration to cell number was found to be an important factor in the inhibition response. Utilization of synchronous culture techniques permitted the study of biochemical changes induced by dothistromin throughout the cell cycle of Chlorella. Results showed a marked inhibition of the rate of increase of total protein and RNA over the cell cycle with no significant alteration of the rate of DNA increase. A dose-response curve for dothistromin inhibition of growth of Chlorella was established and a more detailed investigation of the action of dothistromin in inhibiting growth was undertaken using radioactive isotopes. By this means it was shown that 3 H-uridine and 14 C-phenylalanine incorporation into cell material is inhibited within 30 mins of exposure to the toxin. Difficulties encountered in attempts to obtain satisfactory incorporation of label into Chlorella DNA-fractions prevented further investigation of the effect of dothistromin on DNA synthesis in this organism. This led to the investigation of other microorganisms as more suitable experimental systems for this study. Bacillus megaterium KM, proved to be very sensitive to dothistromin and showed rapid incorporation of radioactive isotopes into protein and nucleic acid fractions. Growth curves established that the inhibitory ratios of dothistromin concentration to cell numbers for this organism were in the order of 0. 25 μg/cell X 108 (as compared to 2. 0 μg/cell X 108 for Chlorella). At this concentration, over the 30 min time course studied, dothistromin had no effect on the incorporation of 3 H-thymidine into the DNA fraction. Inhibition of 3 H-uridine incorporation was evident at 6 min and very marked by 10 min while the inhibition of 14 C-phenylalanine incorporation into protein was not evident until considerably later. The effects of dothistromin in this system were compared with those of antibiotics with known sites of action. Dothistromin inhibition of 3 H-uridine incorporation has a similar time course to that shown by actinomycin D, although marked inhibition by actinomycin D is evident at 3 min, whereas dothistromin inhibition is not noticeable until 6 min. On the basis of these results it is suggested that dothistromin interferes with RNA synthesis and that the observed inhibition of protein synthesis is a secondary effect of this impairment. Confirmation of dothistromin action 'in situ'by administration of the compound to pine seedlings is necessary before any definitive statement can be made concerning its role in dothistromal blight. However these results indicate the possible importance of dothistromin in pathology of dothistromal needle blight of pines. Impairment of the RNA synthetic capacity in pine needle tissue by the toxin could rapidly lead to cell death and to the necrosis of needle tissue observed in diseased foliage...|$|E
