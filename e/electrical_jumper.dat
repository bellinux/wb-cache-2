50|$|Type H {{couplers}} are in {{widespread use}} on multiple unit passenger trains in the UK built from the mid 1970s onwards. The previous generation of slam door units fitted with Buckeye couplers had required a shunter {{to get down}} onto the track and stand between the two units to manually trip the coupler mechanism as well as connect or disconnect the air pipes and <b>electrical</b> <b>jumper</b> leads. In order to reduce staffing costs and cut down station dwell times, British Rail looked to incorporate an automatic coupler mechanism in its new power-door trains. Class 313 units were the first stock to incorporate this. Air-operated Tightlock couplers were chosen, together with underslung electrical connector boxes controlled by a Drum switch, and this allowed drivers to single-handedly attach or split a train without having to leave the cab.|$|E
50|$|On November 9, 2007, Malenchenko {{performed}} {{his fourth}} career spacewalk. He and Expedition 16 commander, Peggy Whitson, in US EMUs ventured into space from the station's Quest airlock at 09:54 UTC. Malenchenko's suit was all white, {{and the purpose}} of the spacewalk was to prepare for the relocation of Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) and the subsequent move of the Harmony node to its permanent location. As the first task, the two spacewalkers disconnected the Station to Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS) cables between the Destiny laboratory and PMA-2. Next they disconnected eight other cables between PMA-2 and the Destiny. Malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with Whitson removed the active Common Berthing Mechanism cover that was located at the outboard end of Harmony. Next, Malenchenko moved back behind the Z1 truss to reconfigure a power system, removing an <b>electrical</b> <b>jumper.</b> The spacewalk ended at 16.49 UTC when the two spacewalkers returned to the ISS. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 55 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial I/O {{breakout}} box. A {{piece of}} electronic test equipment used for diagnosing problems in computer communications, typically over a serial port. The breakout box sits between {{two pieces of}} equipment and usually has some LEDs to display {{the status of the}} different signals in the serial cable. It will also often have DIP switches to let the user connect or disconnect different signals in the cable, and it will usually have connector pins that let the user short pins together using <b>electrical</b> <b>jumpers,</b> or gain access to individual signal lines with an oscilloscope or other test equipment.|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} to transfer mass between spacecraft {{is necessary for}} many mission scenarios. Docking and berthing operations have enabled fluid, electrical, crew and equipment transfers to some degree on all manned space operations since the Gemini program. The Apollo program performed some sophisticated docking maneuvers to land men {{on the moon and}} return them safely to Earth. These programs primarily transferred crew, equipment, and pressurized atmosphere between docked spacecraft. The International Space Station (ISS) U. S. modules are connected by Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) portals. They provide many feed-through ports for electrical, and fluid transfer between modules, as well as a large diameter crew and equipment tunnel. Fluid and <b>electrical</b> <b>jumpers</b> are manually installed after the CBM sealing surfaces have been securely mated to maintain the pressurized cabin environment. CBM berthing and subsequent fluid transfer capability requires a lengthy manual process involving an active interface that mates with a passive half. The Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (MAS) a Russian technology that docked the Russian Zarya module to Unity, or Node 1, is a more complex system that also is capable of fuel transfer, enabling refueling of the Russian re-boost engines on ISS. For several years, a Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) has been under development at Johnson Space Center (JSC). This docking technology has a requirement to be androgynous in order to allow the fabrication of a single configuration that can dock with all other LIDS units. It is desired to make electrical and fluid coupling mating an automated process to enable routine docking and undocking operations to support future exploration missions. It is envisioned that modular design and vehicle assembly will require an efficient LIDS for fuel, electrical, crew, and equipment transfer. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has joined the LIDS development effort and plans to employ fluid transfer concepts and technology from previous development programs, such as the Automated Fluid Interface System (AFIS) and the Ohital Fluid Transfer System (OFTS) that were developed and tested by MSFC. Orbital Expressderived robotic satellite servicing technology is scheduled to fly soon to demonstrate fluid transfer technology developed for the Air Force. This paper will compare known technology against possible fluid transfer requirements for LIDS to develop design strategies for automated fluid transfer...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} summary of the measurement results, a recommended upgrade configuration, and recommendations. The recommended upgrade includes two new transmitters, use of 50 -ohm coaxial transmission lines, and adjustable matching. The recommended upgrade will result in complete redundancy for ease of maintenance and will allow for the possibility of dual-array operation for further increases in radiated power. The major aspects of the recommended upgrade are given in section 5. 6. The recommendations are listed below. 1. Replace the insulators in the toploads and feed cages as soon as possible. Also replace the guy fail-safe insulators with a new fail-safe insulator of a different type. 2. Inspect and repair all electrical aspects of both antennas as required. The topload panels and downlead cages must be inspected. All <b>electrical</b> connections and <b>jumpers</b> should be taken apart, cleaned, repaired or replaced if necessary, and coated with conducting grease prior to reassembly. 3. The towers and guy wires should be inspected by structural experts. 4. Start the process of obtaining two AN/FRT [...] 72 transmitters from the U. S. Navy as soon as possibl...|$|R
