5|$|As birds began nesting on the island, soil {{conditions}} improved, and more vascular plant species {{were able to}} survive. In 1998, the <b>first</b> <b>bush</b> {{was found on the}} island—a tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), which can grow to heights of up to 4metres (13ft). By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2–5new species per year.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the <b>first</b> <b>Bush</b> Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently {{under the impression that}} they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their <b>first</b> <b>bush</b> trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E

25|$|The Bush Doctrine {{has been}} defined as a {{collection}} of strategy principles, practical policy decisions, and a set of rationales and ideas for guiding United States foreign policy. Some of these had reemerged from the 1992 draft Wolfowitz Doctrine, which had been leaked and disavowed by the <b>first</b> <b>Bush</b> administration; Wolfowitz, as deputy secretary of defense, {{was at the center of}} the new Bush administration's strategic planning. Two main pillars are identified for the doctrine: preemptive strikes against potential enemies and promoting democratic regime change.|$|E
25|$|The NTEU {{has been}} famous for {{aggressive}} {{use of the}} courts to supplement their statutorily-limited powers to bargain and restraints on traditional labor tactics such as strikes and boycotts. In 1972, the union sued President Richard M. Nixon, challenging his decision to bypass Congress and postpone salary increases for all federal workers covered by the General Schedule. This lawsuit, NTEU v. Nixon, resulted in an unprecedented victory that required the government to pay over $533 million in back pay to federal employees. In another lawsuit, Boyce and Dixon v. United States, the removal of two IRS service center employees was reversed, establishing {{for the first time}} the principles that an agency did not have total discretion in penalizing employees and that mitigating circumstances could render an agency-ordered removal an abuse of discretion. Shortly thereafter, in NTEU v. Fasser, the union won the right for federal employees to engage in informational picketing, an action previously deemed banned by federal law. During the Reagan and <b>first</b> <b>Bush</b> administrations, NTEU participated aggressively in numerous court battles. It took the issue of the constitutionality of random drug testing of Customs inspectors all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in NTEU v. Von Raab and it successfully fought initiatives it viewed as anti-worker proposed by the head of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).|$|E
