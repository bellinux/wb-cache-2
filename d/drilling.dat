5|$|<b>Drilling</b> {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some <b>drilling</b> fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the <b>drilling</b> fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the <b>drilling</b> process.|$|E

5|$|An {{innovative}} <b>drilling</b> and blasting {{technique called}} Penetrating Cone Fracture (PCF) {{was used in}} the remedial works process. PCF was chosen over conventional <b>drilling</b> and/or blasting techniques due to the reduced risk of damage to the existing structure from vibration, as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels.|$|E

50|$|Jobber-length <b>drills</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} found type of <b>drill.</b> The length of the flutes is between 9 and 14 times {{the diameter of the}} <b>drill,</b> depending on the <b>drill</b> size.

5000|$|Pneumatic <b>drills</b> were {{developed}} {{in response to the}} needs of mining, quarrying, excavating, and tunneling. In 1806 Samuel Miller invented a steam driven percussion <b>drill.</b> In 1838 Isaac Singer invented another steam driven <b>drill.</b> A pneumatic <b>drill</b> was proposed by a C. Brunton in 1844. [...] The first [...] "percussion drill" [...] was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] In this <b>drill,</b> the <b>drill</b> bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the <b>drill</b> bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model. In 1849, Couch's assistant, Joseph W. Fowle, filed a patent caveat for a percussion <b>drill</b> of his own design. In Fowle’s <b>drill,</b> the <b>drill</b> bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder; specifically, the <b>drill</b> bit was connected to the piston’s crosshead. The <b>drill</b> also had a mechanism for turning the <b>drill</b> bit around its axis between strokes and for advancing the <b>drill</b> as the hole deepened. [...] By 1850 or 1851, Fowle was using compressed air to drive his <b>drill,</b> making it the first true pneumatic <b>drill.</b>|$|R

5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, <b>drilling</b> {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic <b>drilling</b> may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade <b>drilling</b> in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E

25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center <b>drill</b> bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally <b>drilled</b> hole (a hole <b>drilled</b> by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist <b>drill</b> bit) is a spotting <b>drill</b> bit (or a spot <b>drill</b> bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting <b>drill</b> bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional <b>drill</b> bit so that the <b>drill</b> bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|R

5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were <b>drilling</b> holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence <b>drilling</b> in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main.
