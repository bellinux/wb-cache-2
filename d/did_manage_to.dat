5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city was called off after the Iraqi {{occupants}} opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudis to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi units. The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> destroy one Saudi V-150 armored personnel carrier.|$|E
5|$|However, the Tang <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> restore {{at least}} {{indirect}} control over former Tang territories as far west as the Hexi Corridor and Dunhuang in Gansu. In 848 the ethnic Han Chinese general Zhang Yichao (799-872) managed to wrestle {{control of the}} region from the Tibetan Empire during its civil war. Shortly afterwards Emperor Xuānzong of Tang (r. 846-859) acknowledged Zhang as the protector (防禦使, Fangyushi) of Sha Prefecture and jiedushi military governor of the new Guiyi Circuit.|$|E

However, the team <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, and the revenue obtained from the cup run helped to keep the club afloat.|$|E

5|$|In Kesselring's memoirs, he {{said that}} in Wolfsberg he was {{approached}} by a former SS major who had an escape plan prepared.

5|$|The {{following}} season saw Juventus start strongly, {{winning the}} 2003 Supercoppa Italiana over Milan on penalties, although Juventus were knocked {{out in the}} round of 16 in the UEFA Champions League, and finished the Serie A season in a disappointing third place. The club <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> reach {{the final of the}} Coppa Italia, however, only to be defeated by Lazio.

5|$|At least 802 prisoners {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E
5|$|Brackman {{claims that}} despite the arrests, Lenin {{continued}} his attempts to exchange the 500-ruble notes and <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> trade some of them for 10,000 rubles from an unknown woman in Moscow. According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after the arrests, but Bogdanov tried (and failed) to exchange some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed to exchange several more notes. Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff were relegated for {{the first}} time in their history in 1929 and entered a period of decline, {{dropping}} into the third tier two years later. The club <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> return to the top tier in 1952, but their relegation in 1962 led to a decline in the club's fortunes that saw them outside the top division for 51 years, the longest absence in the club's history, not returning until 2013. Relegation from Division Two in the 1984–85 season saw the club enter a downward period that culminated with their joint lowest ever finish in the Football League, 22nd in the fourth tier in the 1995–96 season.|$|E

5|$|For the 1995–96 season, Del Piero {{was awarded}} Baggio's number 10 shirt (which had also {{previously}} belonged to Michel Platini), following his departure to A.C. Milan. Del Piero scored 6 goals and provided 10 assists in Serie A, although Juventus finished {{the season in}} second place behind Milan. Del Piero <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> capture the Supercoppa Italiana in 1995, over Parma, setting up Vialli's only goal of the match.

Greg Chappell became {{the coach of the}} Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all-rounder. He started to hone Pathan's batting skills, which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19.64.|$|E
5|$|In 1115 Henry sent Warelwast back to Rome to {{negotiate}} with Paschal, who was angry that the king was prohibiting papal legates in England, not allowing clerics {{to appeal to the}} papal court, and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or the translation of bishops. Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> prevent sanctions against the king. Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the Canterbury–York disputes over the primacy in the English Church, with visits in 1119, 1120, and possibly also in 1116.|$|E

5|$|In passing across Florida, Katrina did not attain {{any more}} {{strength}} but <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> maintain hurricane status.

Afterward, Katrina made landfall as a Category3 storm near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, and once more near the Mississippi/Louisiana border. Katrina progressed northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the Great Lakes on August 31, when it was absorbed by a cold front.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest.

Those who <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced {{to turn back the}} same way they had come with only four men surviving.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{then made}} {{sporadic}} {{appearances in the}} VB triangular ODI series, playing in four of India's ten matches, as he and Kumble were brought {{in and out of}} the team in an attempt to challenge the Australian superiority. He continued to be punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of 1/178 from 26 overs, an economy rate of 6.84. However, he <b>did</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> resist the Australians with the bat; in his only two innings he made 32 not out and 23 as the Indian batting was dismissed for only 203 and 151 respectively.|$|E
