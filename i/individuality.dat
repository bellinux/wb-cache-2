5|$|Utica's neighborhoods have {{historically}} been defined by their residents, allowing them {{to develop their own}} <b>individuality.</b> Racial and ethnic groups, social and economic separation and the development of infrastructure and new means of transportation have shaped neighborhoods, with groups shifting between them as a result.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the three}} psychoacoustic {{experiments}} described here was to clarify whether there are speaker <b>individualities</b> in the spectral envelopes, in which frequency bands such <b>individualities</b> exist, and how frequency bands having speaker <b>individualities</b> can be manipulated. The LMA analysis-synthesis system was used to prepare stimuli varied specific frequency bands, and the frequency bands having speaker <b>individualities</b> were estimated expermentally. The results indicate that (1) speaker <b>individualities</b> exist in spectral envelopes, (2) these <b>individualities</b> are mainly at frequencies higher than 22 ERB rate (2212 Hz) and vowel characteristics exist from 12 ERB rate (603 Hz) to 22 ERB rate, and (3) the voice quality can be controlled by replacing the higher frequency band of one talker with that of other talkers. The replace point is the adjacent spectral local minimum below the spectral local maximum around 23 ERB rate in the spectral envelopes...|$|R

5|$|Carpentier {{reduces the}} <b>individuality</b> of the characters, {{enhancing}} {{the notion of}} humanity, keeping {{in line with the}} theme of history as a repetition of patterns regardless of who is in power. The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and the cycle of reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E

5|$|More {{recordings}} {{as leader}} ensued following Hope's return to New York, {{but they did}} little to gain him more public or critical attention. Further drug and health problems reduced the frequency of his public performances, which ended a year before his death, {{at the age of}} 43. He remains little known, despite, or because of, the <b>individuality</b> of his playing and composing, which were complex and stressed subtlety and variation rather than the virtuosity predominant in bebop.|$|E
30|$|Figure  6 {{also shows}} the {{magnitude}} of the transfer function {{for each of the three}} participants. They were largely flat up to 80 – 120 Hz, and then moderately increased followed by a cave for which the bottom peak was between 120 – 150 Hz. We suggest that the major causes of the <b>individualities</b> originate from the anatomical <b>individualities</b> of the participants’ fingertips [32] as well as the <b>individualities</b> of the mechanical impedance of their fingertips. Especially, the nail profile and thickness of the fingertip fatty tissue may influence the transfer function between the skin deformation at the pad and radial side of the finger. Given the main goal of the present study, this was not pursued any further.|$|R

5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of <b>individuality.</b> Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand a guitar revival took place and raised a new {{generation}} of alternative guitar bands often described as post-punk revival or garage rock revival. Prominent US bands of this generation are White Stripes, The Strokes, and The Killers.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the various facets and values of irony as a figure of speech, used to express power relations.

Nevertheless, they have distinct <b>individualities</b> determined by the cultural and discourse community they belong to. Irony typology, social effects and dramatic values in context intermingle resulting in a pungent text meant to reflect those <b>individualities...</b>|$|R

The fertilising conflict of <b>individualities</b> is the ultimate meaning of the personal life, and all our Utopias no more than schemes for bettering that interplay. At least, that is how life shapes itself more and more to modern perceptions. Until you bring in <b>individualities,</b> nothing comes into being, and a Universe ceases when you shiver the mirror of the least of individual minds.|$|R

5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more <b>individuality,</b> while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
5|$|As Farmer's {{reputation}} grew, he {{expanded from}} bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He {{went on to}} join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing {{is known for its}} <b>individuality</b> – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity.|$|E

According to author Kate Deepwell, her works, and those of Vanessa Bell and other women, were evaluated differently at that time than those made by men: The best critique of woman's work at the time would be that they had <b>individuality,</b> but they would not have been considered innovative, modern works like those made by men.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{included}} the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his teacher training courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students {{and that the}} layout of a classroom should allow one teacher to oversee {{a large number of}} students. Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded <b>individuality.</b> Maeser argued that the teacher have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each student would be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E
5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary busts reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided {{the most convenient}} Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn of}} the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality <b>individuality,</b> the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.|$|E
