5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference <b>in</b> <b>colors</b> and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E

50|$|From the {{beginning}} The Wizard of Oz was telecast <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> although few people owned <b>color</b> television sets <b>in</b> 1956. In fact, all U.S. telecasts of the film, {{except for the}} 1961 telecast have been <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television, than it does now, when color TV is taken for granted. The reason in 1961 for not showing the movie <b>in</b> <b>color</b> was that color telecasts had {{to be paid for}} by their sponsors. Those sponsoring The Wizard of Oz declined to do so that year, and the film was shown in black-and-white. Between 1956 and 1965, the Wizard of Oz showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS, whose competitor NBC was owned by RCA, which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the <b>color</b> sets sold <b>in</b> the U.S. CBS, though had color equipment to show any movies and shows that were made <b>in</b> <b>color,</b> <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> But because RCA, rival Network NBC’s parent company had a monopoly on Color TV sets and equipment, CBS declined to use it as did ABC (which did not even have color equipment until 1962. But CBS would show a movie <b>in</b> <b>color</b> if the sponsor paid for it to be shown in such a way. The Lucy Show, in 1962 began to be made <b>in</b> <b>color</b> after one black and white season, but CBS still showed it in black and white until the fall of 1965, when they finally began showing color produced movies and TV shows <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> ABC, by the way was strictly black and white until the fall of 1962 when they began showing color movies and shows <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> Still, as far back as 1958, most movies and cartoons were made <b>in</b> <b>color.</b> But almost every TV program was still made in black and white until about 1963.

25|$|Discoveries {{in color}} science created new {{industries}} and drove changes in fashion and taste. The discovery in 1856 of mauveine, the first aniline dye, was a forerunner {{for the development}} of hundreds of synthetic dyes and pigments like azo and diazo compounds which are the source of a wide spectrum of colors. Mauveine was discovered by an 18-year-old chemist named William Henry Perkin, who went on to exploit his discovery in industry and become wealthy. His success attracted a generation of followers, as young scientists went into organic chemistry to pursue riches. Within a few years, chemists had synthesized a substitute for madder in the production of Alizarin Crimson. By the closing decades of the 19th century, textiles, paints, and other commodities <b>in</b> <b>colors</b> such as red, crimson, blue, and purple had become affordable.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, another {{redesign}} {{was carried}} out for banknotes, again in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 won. Older notes were once again withdrawn. These notes were smaller and crisper than the previous issue and depicted more modern themes. The 5 and 10 won were again issued in 1998, along with a 500 won banknote the same year but were stamped rather than engraved reflecting poorer production quality. In 2002, 1000 and 5000 won notes were introduced, followed by a 200 won note in 2005. The former two were identical in design to the 100 won though differing <b>in</b> <b>colors</b> and added security features, but the colored fields behind the text no longer extended {{all the way to}} the margins. In 2007, the 500 won had also been revised in this same manner along with being engraved for the first time to protect against counterfeiting.

25|$|It {{should always}} be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was {{practically}} universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was {{the effect of these}} old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous vestments, the lights, the crucifix, the banners and incense, the frescoed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of Gothic art, the stained glass, were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted <b>in</b> <b>colors,</b> but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and sprigs of foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background of delicate gesso diaper, colored or gilded (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the triptychs or retables of Germany, Flanders or France; carved with scenes from the New Testament in high relief arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles glistening with gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic luster.|$|E
