5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful <b>finishing</b> move is activated to take out enemies. Each <b>finishing</b> move has two levels which can render a <b>finishing</b> move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
