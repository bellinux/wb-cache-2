5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1660, Charles's joy at the Restoration was {{tempered}} by the deaths of his youngest brother, Henry, and sister, Mary, of smallpox. At around the same time, Anne Hyde, the daughter of the Lord Chancellor, Edward Hyde, revealed that she was pregnant by Charles's brother, James, whom she had secretly married. Edward Hyde, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> of either the marriage or the pregnancy, was created Earl of Clarendon and his position as Charles's favourite minister was strengthened.|$|E
5|$|Theo died in January 1891, {{removing}} Vincent's {{most vocal}} and well-connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> either her husband or her brother-in law {{very long and}} who suddenly {{had to take care}} of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among the critics, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.|$|E

5|$|Đính {{saved the}} life of Colonel Cao Văn Viên, the {{commander}} of the Airborne Brigade, who was a Diệm loyalist. Viên's fate had been discussed during the planning phase. Đính, who played mahjong with Viên's wife, convinced Minh to spare the paratroop commander, saying that Viên would not oppose the coup. At the JGS meeting, Viên, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> of the plot, removed his insignia and resigned, and was arrested for refusing to join the coup. Viên was allowed to return to his command a month later, and later became the chief of JGS for eight years.|$|E
5|$|In December 1984, Silcott {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith had been slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung had been lacerated and his aorta cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year. At first he told police he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> Smith and had not been at the party, {{although}} at trial he acknowledged having been there. He said Smith had started punching him, and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife. Silcott was convicted of Smith's murder in February 1986, while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years. After the conviction he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there had been bad blood between them, and that he had stabbed the man in self-defence, because one of Smith's friends had had a knife.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, charges were printed in the April 16 issue of Close-Up, a celebrity tabloid, which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers. The Federal Communications Commission made inquiries, and CBS learned that despite his $264,000 annual salary from the company, Aubrey's {{apartment}} on Manhattan's Central Park South was owned by Martin Ransohoff, the head of Filmways, the producer of the Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, Mister Ed, and other CBS programs. And though he had a chauffeur-driven car {{paid for by the}} network, Brasselle's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey, done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours. CBS <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> of either the apartment or the car. The company was also concerned about the money spent to buy Gleason's former home.|$|E

5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and shoulders in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on good behavior.|$|E
5|$|The Light Division, {{based at}} Vught, {{was the only}} {{manoeuvre}} force the Dutch Army possessed. Its planned withdrawal had been similarly executed a day early. Its regiments had biked over the Maas and Waal bridges and then turned left through the Alblasserwaard when it was decided in the afternoon to let it counterattack the German airborne landing on IJsselmonde. It reached the Noord, the river separating the Alblasserwaard from IJsselmonde, in the evening. There they discovered that the sector near the only bridge, built in 1939, was not strongly occupied by the airborne troops, as the Germans simply <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> of its existence because of outdated maps. It was decided to postpone a crossing until the next day, to gather sufficient forces. No {{attempt was made to}} establish a bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Dot {{receives}} a police visit, informing her that Nick has died. One {{of the police}} officers returns later {{to tell her that}} he is actually her grandson Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), a child of Nick's Dot <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> existed. A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery. Nick reappears in Walford to Dot's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house. Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good. However, Nick later realises that {{he does not want to}} leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie's fiancée Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) who tries and fails to ensure his departure. This leads to Nick tampering with the brakes of Charlie's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital. When Charlie discovers this, he demands that Nick leave, and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie's flat, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. However, Dot, unwilling to give up on her son, hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Mary, Mary!' he cried, nearly beside himself, 'I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> what to {{do without}} you! You will believe it now, won't you?'--oh, won't you?' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{see nothing}} here {{that does not}} remind us of our dear brother; there is nothing about us (save the children, whom he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen) that he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> and loved.|$|R

25|$|Lavelle was {{reportedly}} astounded when Wilson {{showed him the}} intelligence reports with false data. He {{said he had never}} seen these reports before and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> the detail that was required to complete one. He had assumed that a general statement about enemy reaction would suffice.|$|E
25|$|Having met in Singapore, Barlow and Chambers {{travelled}} {{by train}} to Penang in Malaysia. The package of drugs {{had been buried}} {{on a beach in}} Penang. Chambers was given directions to the site and dug up the package. Barlow was present but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> the location of the heroin.|$|E
25|$|Taken to an {{interview}} room {{they were asked to}} open the suitcases. Chambers opened the bags he was carrying. Barlow said he was unable to open the case he had carried and that it was Chambers' case. Chambers unlocked the case's combination locks and the drugs were found; however, he claimed he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> the contents of the smaller carry bags the drugs were in.|$|E

I also <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> it. But I have seen--" [...] Alvina watched with wide, troubled eyes, while Madame darted looks, as from bright, deep black glass.|$|R

25|$|Sharett {{resolved}} the dilemma by siding with Peres (who had, along with Moshe Dayan, testified against Lavon), after which Lavon resigned on 17 February 1955. Former prime minister David Ben-Gurion succeeded Lavon as minister of defense. On 3 November 1955, Sharett (who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> about the operation in advance, and had therefore strongly denied Israel's involvement) resigned as Prime Minister {{and was replaced}} by Ben-Gurion.|$|E
25|$|Ligeti {{recalled}} {{that his first}} exposure to languages other than Hungarian came one day while listening to a conversation among the Romanian-speaking town police. Before that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> that other languages existed. He moved to Cluj with his family when aged six. He was not {{to return to the}} town of his birth until the 1990s. In 1940, Northern Transylvania was annexed by Hungary following the Second Vienna Award and Cluj became part of Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Within {{three days}} of the crime, prime {{suspects}} had been identified. No arrests were made, however, until over {{two weeks after the}} killing. The officer who had been leading the murder investigation from its third day, and who would ultimately lead the murder squad for 14 months, explained to an incredulous public inquiry in 1998 that part of the reason no arrests had taken place by the fourth day after the killing (Monday 26 April) was that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> the law allowed arrest upon reasonable suspicion – a basic point of criminal law.|$|E

25|$|An {{unresolved}} contradiction was J. B. McNamara’s {{knowledge of}} the gas pipes in the Times building. After he confessed to the bombing, he insisted that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> of the gas pipes. However, Ortie McManigal testified that before their arrest, McNamara {{had told him that}} he had gone into the Times building – he was challenged twice, but each time passed by saying {{he was on his way}} to the composing room – went into the basement and wrenched off a gas valve, to maximize the destruction.|$|E
25|$|Dawn, who {{had become}} a member of the Nevada Assembly in 1998, denied the {{allegations}} in 2006, claiming that Sandoval had merely been a friend who had helped out around the house and was given clothing and household goods, but was not an employee. An employment contract between Dawn Gibbons and Sandoval, however, appeared to disprove that assertion, as it clearly laid out the terms and conditions of Sandoval's hiring. Documents filed during Sandoval's 1988 application for working papers also contradicted earlier statements by Dawn Gibbons that the family <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> that the woman was in the United States illegally.|$|E
25|$|Jane Clark died in 1976. Her {{death was}} expected, but left Clark devastated. Several of his female friends hoped {{that he would}} marry them. His closest female friend, across many years, was Janet Stone, wife of the {{engraver}} Reynolds Stone; in common with Clark's daughter and sons, she was dismayed when he announced his intention to marry Nolwen de Janzé-Rice (1924–1989), daughter of Frederic and Alice de Janzé. The family felt that Clark was acting precipitately in marrying someone he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> well for very long, but the wedding took place in November 1977. Clark and his second wife remained together until his death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a line. He <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> our address. He {{is never}} {{very good at}} letter-writing. I did write to him from Paris, and I {{scribbled}} {{a few words to}} Everett yesterday." ...|$|R
