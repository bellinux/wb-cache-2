25|$|<b>Display</b> <b>type</b> {{refers to}} the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger. Some typefaces are {{considered}} useful solely at display sizes, and are known as display faces. Most effect typefaces are display types. Common features of <b>display</b> <b>type</b> include tighter default letter spacing, finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between thick and thin strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many display typefaces in the past such as those intended for posters and newspaper headlines were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. This was true of many early sans-serif fonts.|$|E
25|$|Gaelic fonts {{were first}} {{used for the}} Irish {{language}} in 1571, and were used regularly for Irish until the early 1960s, though {{they continue to be}} used in <b>display</b> <b>type</b> and type for signage. Their use was effectively confined to Ireland, though Gaelic typefaces were designed and produced in France, Belgium, and Italy. Gaelic typefaces make use of insular letterforms, and early fonts made use of a variety of abbreviations deriving from the manuscript tradition. Early fonts used for the Anglo-Saxon language, also using insular letterforms, can be classified as Gaelic typefaces, distinct from Roman or Antiqua typefaces. Various forms exist, including manuscript, traditional, and modern styles, chiefly distinguished as having angular or uncial features.|$|E
2500|$|Warburg Hall of New York State Environments is a one-story hall {{located on}} the museum’s ground floor in between the Hall of North American Forests and the Grand Hall. Based on the town of Pine Plains and near-by Stissing Mountain in Dutchess County, the hall gives a multi-faceted {{presentation}} of the eco-systems typical of New York. Aspects covered include soil types, seasonal changes, {{and the impact of}} both humans and nonhuman animals on the environment. It is named for the German-American philanthropist, Felix M. Warburg. Originally known as the [...] "Hall of Man and Nature", Warburg Hall opened in 1951. It has changed little since and is now frequently regarded for its retro-modern styling. The hall shares many of the exhibit types featured throughout the museum as well as one <b>display</b> <b>type,</b> unique to Warburg, which features a recessed miniature diorama behind a foreground of species and specimens from the environment depicted.|$|E

2500|$|Strobe units {{can often}} be {{calibrated}} for many tunings and preset temperaments and allow for custom temperament programming, stretched tuning, [...] "sweetened" [...] temperament tunings and Buzz Feiten tuning modifications. [...] Due to their accuracy and ability to display partials even on instruments with a very short [...] "voice" [...] (e.g., notes of short duration), strobe tuners can perform tuning tasks {{that would be very}} difficult, if not impossible, for needle-type tuners. For instance, needle/LED <b>display</b> <b>type</b> tuners cannot track the signal to identify a tone of the Caribbean steelpan (often nicknamed the [...] "steeldrum") due to its very short [...] "voice". A tuner {{needs to be able to}} detect the first few partials for tuning such an instrument, which means that only a strobe tuner can be used for steelpan tuning. This is also true of the comb teeth used in mechanical musical instruments like Music Boxes and the like. In such cases a technician has to physically remove metal from the [...] tooth to reach the desired note. The metal teeth only resonates briefly when plucked. Great accuracy is required as once the metal is cut or filed away, the lost material cannot be replaced. As such, the strobe-type tuners are the unit of choice for such tasks. Tuners with an accuracy of better than 0.2 cent are required for guitar intonation tuning.|$|E

40|$|Quality {{assurance}} {{in medical}} imaging is directly beneficial to image quality. Diagnostic images are frequently displayed on secondary-class displays that have minimal or no regular quality assurance programs, and treatment decisions {{are being made}} from these <b>display</b> <b>types.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the impact of calibration on physical and psychophysical performance of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and the extent of potential variance across various types of LCDs. Three <b>display</b> <b>types</b> were evaluated from Hewlett Packard, Viewsonic, and NEC, which totalled 36 LCDs. These displays were calibrated to the DICOM gray scale standard display function using a VeriLum photometer and associated software under the same ambient room conditions. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 18 test patterns were used to measure minimum and maximum luminance, contrast ratios, luminance response, veiling glare (physical and psychophysical), psychophysical noise, spatial resolution, and display uniformity. Improvements after calibration were noted in all <b>display</b> <b>types</b> for luminance response and psychophysical evaluations of veiling glare. Minimum luminance, contrast ratios, and display uniformity improvements were noted in two separate <b>display</b> <b>types.</b> The only significant reduction in performance was noted for physical evaluations of veiling glare. The data presented show that calibration has a significant impact on the brightness and contrast of displays, and other display parameters are influenced by this. The amount of variation in performance that was still evident after calibration is of concern...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} acquisition and transfer {{of a complex}} same-different discrimination by pigeons. With {{the use of a}} 2 -alternative choice task, 5 pigeons were reinforced for discriminating odd-item Different displays, in which a contrasting target was present, from Same displays, in which all elements were identical. Four different <b>types</b> of same-different <b>displays</b> were concurrently tested. The <b>display</b> <b>types</b> differed in their configuration (texture vs. visual search organization), the nature of their elements (small and large colored shapes; pictures of birds, flowers, fish, and humans), and the processing demands required by their global-local element arrangement. Despite these differences, the pigeons learned to discriminate all 4 <b>display</b> <b>types</b> at the same rate and showed positive discrimination transfer to novel examples of each type, suggesting that a single generalized rule was used to discriminate all <b>display</b> <b>types.</b> These results provide some of the strongest evidence yet that pigeons, like many primates, can learn an abstract, visually mediated same-different concept.
