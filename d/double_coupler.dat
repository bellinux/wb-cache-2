40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility to}} strongly modify the radiated fields of a UMTS handset by using a phased two-element PIFA array. The structure is composed of a 100 x 40 mm 2 metallic ground plane acting as the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) of the mobile phone. Two UMTS PIFAs are located at {{the top edge of}} this PCB. They are fed by a <b>double</b> Quasi-Lumped <b>Coupler</b> able to provide a 360 ° phase difference between its two outputs. By properly choosing the DC bias of the <b>double</b> Quasi-Lumped <b>Coupler,</b> we can set a specific phase difference between the two PIFAs. In this way the two-element array is able to radiate different electromagnetic fields. Simulated and measured radiation patterns in the two main planes of the chassis are presented for different phase differences. It is especially revealed that the novel two-antenna structure is able to radiate vertically-polarized electric fields in the azimuthal plane of the phone and horizontally-polarized electric fields in the same plane when changing the phase shift between the antennas from 0 ° to 180 °. Potential applications are polarization-diver-sity techniques and Specific Absorption Rate reduction for handsets...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} {{an electric}} field symmetry in a coupler cavity, {{a very simple}} structure of two-iris coupler cavity was proposed by H. Matsumoto in 1994. MAFIA 3 D code is useful to simulate Slater’s tuning curve method, {{which is used to}} determine the dimensions of the coupler cavity such as iris aperture and cavity diameter. It was find that MAFIA simulation results show that two-iris method will realize a good symmetrical electric field with very simple structure as well as no difficulties for fabrication. This type of <b>double</b> feed <b>coupler</b> will be used for Choke-mode type damped accelerating structure at C-band (5712 MHz) and rf-gun for linear collider. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for in-situ film {{characterisation}} during thin film deposition processes was developed using waveguide mode spectroscopy. The {{advantages of the}} method are a high sensitivity for thin films in the nm-regime and a relatively simple and low-cost set-up. The detection method relies on a <b>double</b> grating <b>coupler</b> allowing a background-free detection of the propagation constants of guided optical modes. The set-up {{is based on a}} reflected mode m-line geometry requiring no moving parts. The method was applied to thin film diagnostics in plasma-assisted deposition processes and allowed for the simultaneous determination of thickness and refractive index of the plasma polymer film during deposition. The in-situ waveguide mode spectrometer was also used to monitor gas phase reactions of plasma polymerised maleic anhydride thin films on- line. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|RF {{power is}} usually {{transmitted}} into,an accelerator section from a rectangular waveguide through a single coupling iris. This arrangement introduces phase and amplitude asymmetries into the coupler fields {{with which the}} beam interacts. Field distortion can be reduced by machining an offset into the cavity wall opposite the iris. However, the compensation is imperfect. In this paper we describe the development and testing of a <b>double</b> input <b>coupler</b> which is completely symmetric about a vertical plane through the beam axis. Two identical irises are used {{on opposite sides of}} the coupler cavity. These are fed inphase by signals from a Magic Tee power divider. Each iris transmits one half of the total power flow. Coupler dimensions for an X-Band model have been optimized using MAFIA and conventional low-power matching techniques.

40|$|Variable attenuators are {{important}} circuits {{that can be}} employed in many radio frequency (RF) applications, e. g., in automatic gain control (AGC) amplifiers, broadband gain-control blocks at RF frequencies or as broadband vector modulators. For any applications, low insertion phase shift and low power consumption are of interest. A way to implement variable attenuators is using the RF PIN diode. The PIN diode {{is characterized by a}} low doped (I = intrinsic) semiconductor region between p- (P) and n-type (N) semiconductor regions. Besides the variable attenuators, the PIN-diode is used in other RF circuits, such as RF switches, limiters and phase shifters. This project presents the design of variable attenuators at 7. 5 GHz and 500 MHz frequency bandwidth for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications using two different PIN diodes. The variable attenuators have a topology based on 90 ° hybrid couplers. The design is performed using Advance Design Systems (ADS) from Agilent Technologies Inc. After presenting the PIN diode and its equivalent circuit, the theory of the 90 ° passive directional branch line coupler and the operation principle of the variable attenuators are presented. As the selection of the appropriate PIN diode is a critical step in the design, special attention is dedicated to this aspect. It follows the design of the variable attenuators with extensive descriptions of the simulations in ADS. Firstly, both series and shunt attenuators are presented. However, as these circuits normally offer narrow band variable attenuation, the 900 directional branch line coupler is used in the attenuator for broader band operation. At the end, a <b>double</b> hybrid <b>coupler</b> is found to eliminate the ripple in the high attenuation state of the single hybrid coupled attenuator. So the final topology of the variable attenuator is a <b>double</b> hybrid <b>coupler</b> variable attenuator- Moreover, in this project, different PIN diodes are investigated for variable attenuator applications. Different manufacture companies are currently providing different kinds of PIN diodes in terms of parameters and packages. Every type of PIN diodes are providing different sort of advantages to the designers. That is why it has become more difficult for the RF designers to choose the right device for the specified application. Beside the design of the variable attenuator using PIN diodes, some considerations in form of a guide line to the designers while they are using the PIN diode for designing the variable attenuator. In this work, the used PIN diodes are a beam lead PIN diode and chip PIN diode. The beam lead PIN diode is used because it is manufactured for high frequency and it produces excellent electrical performance and isolation at high frequencies. On the other hand, the chip PIN diode eliminates the problem of package parasitics. However, printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing limitations at the university laboratory incline the balance in the favor of the beam lead PIN diode, HPND- 4005 from Avagotech, instead of the also considered chip diode MA-COM MA 4 P 202...|$|R
40|$|Published online on JACoWMore and more, accelerators {{are built}} with superconducting {{cavities}} operating at cryogenic temperatures, and {{the probability of}} a ceramic window failure presents increasing problems because of the resulting contamination of the cavities' surfaces and the resulting accelerating electric field degradation. <b>Double</b> ceramic window <b>couplers</b> are required to reduce this risk. The TESLA superstructure cavity requires a new coupler for the higher power input and the coupling characteristics. A cost effective design and fabrication method for these couplers has been developed to meet these demands. This new design presents an alternative to the present TESLA cylindrical ceramic windows, uses two planar disc windows separated by a vacuum space, and is optimized for RF input power, vacuum characteristics, and thermal properties. Two couplers with this design have been fabricated and are presently being tested at DESY, Germany on the RF high power testing stand and will also be tested on a test cryomodule. The design will be discussed in this paper...|$|R
