5|$|The {{comparative}} {{simplicity and}} regularity of the cerebellar anatomy {{led to an}} early hope that it might imply a similar simplicity of computational function, as expressed {{in one of the}} first books on cerebellar electrophysiology, The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine by John C. Eccles, Masao Ito, and János Szentágothai. Although a full understanding of cerebellar function has remained elusive, at least four principles have been identified as important: (1) <b>feedforward</b> processing, (2) divergence and convergence, (3) modularity, and (4) plasticity.|$|E

25|$|The <b>feedforward</b> form {{consists}} of {{an infinite number of}} zeros spaced along the jω axis.|$|E
25|$|The main {{categories}} of networks are acyclic or <b>feedforward</b> neural networks (where the signal passes {{in only one}} direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular <b>feedforward</b> networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks. Neural networks {{can be applied to}} the problem of intelligent control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning, GMDH or competitive learning.|$|E
25|$|Wind sensors are {{fed into}} the DP system <b>feedforward,</b> so the system can {{anticipate}} wind gusts before the ship is blown off position.|$|E
25|$|Ciresan {{and colleagues}} (2010) in Jurgen Schmidhuber's group showed {{that despite the}} {{vanishing}} gradient problem, GPUs makes back-propagation feasible for many-layered <b>feedforward</b> neural networks.|$|E
25|$|The <b>feedforward</b> {{comb filter}} {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} finite impulse response filters. Its response is simply the initial impulse with a second impulse after the delay.|$|E
25|$|Comb filters {{exist in}} two {{different}} forms, <b>feedforward</b> and feedback; the names refer to {{the direction in which}} signals are delayed before they are added to the input.|$|E
25|$|Deep <b>feedforward</b> neural {{networks}} {{were used in}} conjunction with reinforcement learning by AlphaGo, Google Deepmind's program that was the first to beat a professional human Go player.|$|E
25|$|In some systems, {{closed-loop}} and {{open-loop control}} are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed <b>feedforward</b> and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.|$|E
25|$|Ultra-rapid visual {{categorization}} {{is a model}} proposing {{an automatic}} <b>feedforward</b> mechanism that forms high-level object representations in parallel without focused attention. In this model, the mechanism cannot be sped up by training. Evidence for a <b>feedforward</b> mechanism {{can be found in}} studies that have shown that many neurons are already highly selective {{at the beginning of a}} visual response, thus suggesting that feedback mechanisms are not required for response selectivity to increase. Furthermore, recent fMRI and ERP studies have shown that masked visual stimuli that participants do not consciously perceive can significantly modulate activity in the motor system, thus suggesting somewhat sophisticated visual processing.|$|E
25|$|VanRullen (2006) ran {{simulations}} {{showing that}} the <b>feedforward</b> propagation of one wave of spikes through high-level neurons, generated {{in response to a}} stimulus, could be enough for crude recognition and categorization that occurs in 150 ms or less.|$|E
25|$|As of 2011, {{the state}} of the art in deep and <b>feedforward</b> networks, {{particularly}} convolutional neural networks, alternated convolutional layers and max-pooling layers, topped by several fully or sparsely connected layers followed by a final classification layer. Learning is usually done without unsupervised pre-training.|$|E
25|$|The {{vanishing}} gradient problem affects many-layered <b>feedforward</b> {{networks that}} use backpropagation and also recurrent neural networks. As errors propagate from layer to layer, they shrink exponentially {{with the number}} of layers, impeding the tuning of neuron weights that is based on those errors, particularly affecting deep networks.|$|E
25|$|Igor Aizenberg {{and colleagues}} {{introduced}} it to Artificial Neural Networks in 2000. The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and V. G. Lapa in 1965. These networks are trained one layer at a time. Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper describes {{the learning of}} a deep <b>feedforward</b> multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered <b>feedforward</b> neural networks (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning. Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.|$|E
25|$|Between 2009 and 2012, {{recurrent}} {{neural networks}} and deep <b>feedforward</b> neural networks {{developed in the}} Schmidhuber's research group, winning eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning. For example, the bi-directional and multi-dimensional long short-term memory (LSTM) of Graves et al. won three competitions in connected handwriting recognition at the 2009 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), without any prior knowledge about the three languages to be learned.|$|E
25|$|To employ this formula, {{one has to}} {{identify}} a critical controlled source for the particular amplifier circuit in hand. For example, P could be the control parameter {{of one of the}} controlled sources in a two-port network, as shown for a particular case in D'Amico et al. As a different example, if we take a12 = a12 = 1, P = A, a22 = – (negative feedback) and a11 = 0 (no <b>feedforward),</b> we regain the simple result with two unidirectional blocks.|$|E
25|$|While {{auditory}} feedback {{is most important}} during speech acquisition, it may be activated less if the model has learned a proper <b>feedforward</b> motor command for each speech unit. But {{it has been shown}} that {{auditory feedback}} needs to be strongly coactivated in the case of auditory perturbation (e.g. shifting a formant frequency, Tourville et al. 2005). This is comparable to the strong influence of visual feedback on reaching movements during visual perturbation (e.g. shifting the location of objects by viewing through a prism).|$|E
25|$|The group {{method of}} data {{handling}} (GMDH) features fully automatic structural and parametric model optimization. The node activation functions are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials that permit additions and multiplications. It used a deep <b>feedforward</b> multilayer perceptron with eight layers. It is a supervised learning network that grows layer by layer, where each layer is trained by regression analysis. Useless items are detected using a validation set, and pruned through regularization. The size {{and depth of}} the resulting network depends on the task.|$|E
25|$|However, the BOLD signal cannot {{separate}} {{feedback and}} <b>feedforward</b> active networks in a region; the slowness of the vascular response means the final signal is the summed {{version of the}} whole region's network; blood flow is not discontinuous as the processing proceeds. Also, both inhibitory and excitatory input to a neuron from other neurons sum {{and contribute to the}} BOLD signal. Within a neuron these two inputs might cancel out. The BOLD response can also be affected by a variety of factors, including disease, sedation, anxiety, medications that dilate blood vessels, and attention (neuromodulation).|$|E
25|$|If {{the current}} sensory state {{deviates}} from the intended sensory state, both error maps are generating feedback commands which are projected towards the motor map {{and which are}} capable to correct the motor activation pattern and subsequently the articulation of a speech unit under production. Thus, in total, the activation pattern of the motor map is not only influenced by a specific <b>feedforward</b> command learned for a speech unit (and generated by the synaptic projection from the speech sound map) but also by a feedback command generated {{at the level of}} the sensory error maps (see Fig. 4).|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which masculinity is inborn or {{conditioned}} is debated. Genome research has yielded information {{about the development of}} masculine characteristics and the process of sexual differentiation specific to the human reproductive system. The testis determining factor (also known as SRY protein) on the Y chromosome, critical for male sexual development, activates the SOX9 protein. SOX9 works with the SF1 protein to increase the level of anti-Müllerian hormone, repressing female development while activating and forming a <b>feedforward</b> loop with the FGF9 protein; this creates the testis cords and is responsible for sertoli cells, which aid in sperm production. The activation of SRY halts the process of creating a female, beginning a chain of events leading to testicle formation, androgen production and a number of pre- and post-natal hormonal effects.|$|E
25|$|Each {{component}} (or node) of a {{signaling pathway}} is classified according to the role it plays {{with respect to the}} initial stimulus. Ligands are termed first messengers, while receptors are the signal transducers, which then activate primary effectors. Such effectors are often linked to second messengers, which can activate secondary effectors, and so on. Depending on the efficiency of the nodes, a signal can be amplified (a concept known as signal gain), so that one signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of molecules. As with other signals, the transduction of biological signals is characterised by delay, noise, signal feedback and <b>feedforward</b> and interference, which can range from negligible to pathological. With the advent of computational biology, the analysis of signaling pathways and networks has become an essential tool to understand cellular functions and disease, including signaling rewiring mechanisms underlying responses to acquired drug resistance.|$|E
500|$|<b>Feedforward</b> processing: The {{cerebellum}} {{differs from}} most {{other parts of}} the brain (especially the cerebral cortex) in that the signal processing is almost entirely feedforward—that is, signals move unidirectionally through the system from input to output, with very little recurrent internal transmission. The small amount of recurrence that does exist consists of mutual inhibition; there are no mutually excitatory circuits. This <b>feedforward</b> mode of operation means that the cerebellum, in contrast to the cerebral cortex, cannot generate self-sustaining patterns of neural activity. Signals enter the circuit, are processed by each stage in sequential order, and then leave. As Eccles, Ito, and Szentágothai wrote, [...] "This elimination in the design of all possibility of reverberatory chains of neuronal excitation is undoubtedly a great advantage in the performance of the cerebellum as a computer, because {{what the rest of the}} nervous system requires from the cerebellum is presumably not some output expressing the operation of complex reverberatory circuits in the cerebellum but rather a quick and clear response to the input of any particular set of information." ...|$|E
2500|$|Looking {{again at}} the -domain {{transfer}} function of the <b>feedforward</b> comb filter: ...|$|E
2500|$|Comb filters {{may also}} be {{implemented}} in continuous time. The <b>feedforward</b> form may be described by the following equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|The general {{structure}} of a <b>feedforward</b> comb filter is shown on the right. It may be described by the following difference equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Again, the {{response}} is periodic, as the graphs to the right demonstrate. The feedback comb filter has some properties {{in common with the}} <b>feedforward</b> form: ...|$|E
2500|$|... is the [...] "feedthrough (or <b>feedforward)</b> matrix" [...] (in {{cases where}} the system model {{does not have a}} direct feedthrough, [...] is the zero matrix), , ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{obtain the}} {{frequency}} response of a discrete-time system {{expressed in the}} -domain, we make the substitution [...] Therefore, for our <b>feedforward</b> comb filter, we get: ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, {{the input}} {{impedance}} {{seen by the}} source with feedback turned off is Rin = R1 = R11 // RB // rπ1, and with the feedback turned on (but no <b>feedforward)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{classical}} approach to feedback, the <b>feedforward</b> {{represented by the}} VCVS (that is, g21 v1) is neglected. That makes the circuit of Figure 5 resemble the block diagram of Figure 1, and the gain with feedback is then: ...|$|E
2500|$|Networks {{such as the}} {{previous}} one are commonly called <b>feedforward,</b> because their graph is a directed acyclic graph. Networks with cycles are commonly called recurrent. Such networks are commonly depicted in the manner shown {{at the top of}} the figure, where [...] is shown as being dependent upon itself. However, an implied temporal dependence is not shown.|$|E
2500|$|The tuning of the {{synaptic}} projections between {{speech sound}} map and motor map (i.e. tuning of forward motor commands) is accomplished {{with the aid}} of feedback commands, since the projections between sensory error maps and motor map were already tuned during babbling training (see above). Thus the DIVA model tries to [...] "imitate" [...] an auditory speech item by attempting to find a proper <b>feedforward</b> motor command. Subsequently the model compares the resulting sensory output (current sensory state following the articulation of that attempt) with the already learned auditory target region (intended sensory state) for that speech item. Then the model updates the current <b>feedforward</b> motor command by the current feedback motor command generated from the auditory error map of the auditory feedback system. This process may be repeated several times (several attempts). The DIVA model is capable of producing the speech item with a decreasing auditory difference between current and intended auditory state from attempt to attempt.|$|E
