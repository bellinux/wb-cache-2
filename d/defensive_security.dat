The powers of Europe were armed; France had always appeared dangerous; the war was easily diverted from France as a faction to France as a state. The princes were easily taught to slide back into their old, habitual course of politics. They were easily led to consider the flames that were consuming France, not as a warning to protect their own buildings, (which were without any party-wall, and linked by a contignation into the edifice of France,) but as an happy occasion for pillaging the goods, and for carrying off the materials of their neighbor's house.

They pretended to seek, or they flattered themselves that they sought, in the accession of new fortresses and new territories a <b>defensive</b> <b>security.</b> But the security wanted was against a kind of power which was not so truly dangerous in its fortresses nor in its territories as in its spirit and its principles. They aimed, or pretended to aim, at defending themselves against a danger from which there can be no security in any defensive plan. If armies and fortresses were a defence against Jacobinism, Louis the Sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people.|$|E

5000|$|In 1587, atrocities {{committed}} between warring west highland clans had escalated to such {{an extent}} that the Scottish parliament devised what is known as the General Band, in an effort to quell hostilities. The band, or bond, was signed by landowners throughout the Scottish highlands, borders and the islands.

The laird of Coll (Hector Maclean of Coll) was one of the chiefs listed on this roll. 'Broken men' were generally men who had no chief and who were often outlaws. Beveridge wrote that these men adopted [...] "the Viking principle of living at the expense of those who were weaker than themselves".

40|$|This study {{analyses}} whether historically defensive sectors on the JSE have – {{with respect}} to the market – proven to be defensive during the recent global financial crisis. By withstanding the shocks of market volatility, defensive industries (such as pharmaceuticals and consumer staples) are renowned for their consistent performance throughout the business cycle. Using daily data for the period 2000 – 2009, the study compares the descriptive statistics of sector returns before and during the crisis. The volatility of each sector relative to the market index is calculated using the CAPM beta and a simplified volatility ratio. The same comparison is extended to the conditional volatilities of each of the sectors, which is estimated using the GARCH model and two of its extensions: the EGARCH and GJR GARCH models. While no sector experienced a positive mean return during the financial crisis, Healthcare, Consumer Goods, Consumer Services and Industrials all proved less volatile than the market. Surprisingly, Telecommunications proved more volatile than the market and experienced leverage effects during the financial crisis. Since the timing of a recession is difficult to predict, <b>defensive</b> <b>securities</b> were found to be a useful investment tool for protection against adverse movements in the stock market. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>defensive</b> <b>security</b> {{strategy for}} distributed systems is to safeguard against malicious activities and prevent attackers from gaining {{control of the}} system. The strategy employs well-established defensive techniques such as perimeter-based firewalls, redundancy and replications, and encryption. However, given sufficient time and resources, all these methods can be defeated by advanced adversaries. ^ To address this issue, this dissertation proposes an attack-resilient framework that employs a novel <b>defensive</b> <b>security</b> strategy to reduce or eliminate {{the need to keep}} one step ahead of sophisticated attacks. The core of our defensive strategy is to transform systems to narrow the window of their vulnerability from hours/days to minutes/seconds. This is achieved by controlling the system runtime execution in time and space through diversification and randomization as a means of shifting the perception of the attackers’ gain-loss balance. The goal of this defensive strategy, commonly referred to as Moving Target Defense (MTD), is to increase the cost of an attack on a system and to lower the likelihood of success and the perceived benefit of compromising it. ^ The proposed <b>defensive</b> <b>security</b> paradigm is covered in five chapters: Chapter 1 introduces the framework and its core building blocks, then highlights the key contributions of the dissertation. Chapter 2 presents a proactive monitoring scheme to safeguard application runtime below the OS. Chapter 3 presents the proposed framework, referred to as Mayflies, a bio-inspired MTD framework for distributed systems, and discusses the formal model, design, implementation and algorithms. In Chapters 4 and 5, we show the effectiveness of the proposed framework with two classes of widely adopted replicated systems: quorum-based Byzantine Fault-Tolerant and Event-based Publish and Subscribe, deployed on a private cloud platform with special emphasis on their resiliency to attacks and performance impact. ...|$|E
