50|$|Vertical loops have 3 purposes: Lowers load/deflection rate, {{provides}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> {{and act as}} {{break between}} the teeth which allows each tooth to move independently. Horizontal loops further reduces the load/deflection rate and provides vertical control.|$|E
5000|$|The term Eigg Mountain is {{also used}} to refer to a peak that rises above the Eigg Mountain plateau to an {{elevation}} of 321.9 metres (Co-ordinates: [...] ) and is the site of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> point or triangulation station.|$|E
50|$|The G3 Mirage first flew on 20 September 1997 {{with the}} lower powered Rotax. The first {{production}} aircraft also used this engine but had some small <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> surface modifications plus {{the addition of a}} horn balance to the rudder.|$|E
25|$|The basic oscilloscope, {{as shown}} in the illustration, is {{typically}} divided into four sections: the display, vertical <b>controls,</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>controls</b> and trigger controls. The display is usually a CRT or LCD panel which is laid out with both horizontal and vertical reference lines referred to as the graticule. In addition to the screen, most display sections are equipped with three basic controls: a focus knob, an intensity knob and a beam finder button.|$|R
40|$|<b>Horizontal</b> directionally <b>controlled</b> {{drilling}} in soft ground {{is a relatively}} unexplored frontier {{in the realm of}} earth drilling. Therefore, the informa-tion source force for this subject is a select group of men, who are associated with the petroleum, coal and pipeline industries. The first step in the investigation was to establish {{the state of the art}} for <b>horizontal</b> directionally <b>controlled</b> {{drilling in}} soft ground.

5000|$|Weight-shift control trike: use a hang glider-style wing, below {{which is}} {{suspended}} a three-wheeled carriage which carries {{the engine and}} aviators. These aircraft are controlled by pushing against a <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> bar in roughly {{the same way as}} a hang glider pilot flies.|$|E
50|$|The Army Aeroplane No. 1 was a biplane {{of similar}} {{configuration}} to that {{designed by the}} Wright brothers, being a three bay biplane with <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> surfaces mounted {{in front of the}} wings and a rudder behind; but was larger, with a wingspan of 52 ft.|$|E
50|$|The {{wing and}} rear <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> {{surfaces}} were {{replaced with a}} cranked-arrow delta wing 120% larger than the original wing. Extensive use of carbon fiber composites allowed the savings of 600 lb (270 kg) of weight but the F-16XL was still 2,800 lb (1,300 kg) heavier than the original F-16A.|$|E

50|$|The {{resulting}} horizontal {{sweep speed}} was uncalibrated because the sweep rate was adjusted by changing {{slope of the}} sawtooth generator. The time per division on the display depended upon the sweep's free-running frequency and a <b>horizontal</b> gain <b>control.</b>|$|R
50|$|As with aircraft, hot air {{balloons}} require regular maintenance {{to remain}} airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct <b>horizontal</b> <b>control,</b> hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may {{be performed by}} the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.|$|E
50|$|A {{tailless}} aircraft (often tail-less) traditionally has all its <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> surfaces on its main wing surface. It has no horizontal stabiliser - either tailplane or canard foreplane (nor {{does it have}} a second wing in tandem arrangement). A 'tailless' type usually still has a vertical stabilising fin (vertical stabiliser) and control surface (rudder). However, NASA adopted the 'tailless' description for the novel X-36 research aircraft which has a canard foreplane but no vertical fin.|$|E
50|$|A {{marionette}} is {{a puppet}} controlled from above using wires or strings depending on regional variations. A marionette's puppeteer {{is called a}} marionettist. Marionettes are operated with the puppeteer hidden or revealed to an audience by using a vertical or <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> bar in different forms of theatres or entertainment venues. They have also been used in films and on television. The attachment of the strings varies according to its character or purpose.|$|E
25|$|Some earlier, {{published}} maps {{labeled the}} northern peak as Mt. Jefferson. Confusion {{may arise from}} the fact that the <b>horizontal</b> triangulation <b>control</b> station (VABM) named JEFFERSON is located on the southern peak, and this designation is found on many maps.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>horizontal</b> section <b>controls</b> {{the time}} base or [...] "sweep" [...] of the instrument. The primary control is the Seconds-per-Division (Sec/Div) {{selector}} switch. Also included is a horizontal input for plotting dual X-Y axis signals. The horizontal beam position knob is generally located in this section.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>horizontal</b> {{position}} <b>control</b> {{moves the}} display sidewise. It usually sets the left {{end of the}} trace at the left edge of the graticule, but it can displace the whole trace when desired. This control also moves the X-Y mode traces sidewise in some instruments, and can compensate for a limited DC component as for vertical position.|$|R

5000|$|Four sets of {{independent}} coils {{are necessary for}} OH (ohmic heating) current drive, vertical equilibrium field, plasma elongation and plasma shaping (D or reverse-D). The OH system provides 10 V·s using a 10 kA power supply. Up to 0.1 T of vertical field can be applied for <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> and {{this is more than}} sufficient for all plasma configurations, including high beta. An additional set of coils provide a small horizontal field to correct for error field and to stabilize the plasma vertically. All the coils are located outside the vessel and are constructed out of aluminium.|$|E
50|$|To {{ease the}} {{integration}} with the Internet, IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). According to the 3GPP, IMS {{is not intended}} to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> layer that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need not have their own control functions, as the control layer is a common horizontal layer. However, in implementation this does not necessarily map into greater reduced cost and complexity.|$|E
50|$|Zhishui-III has {{a similar}} {{appearance}} to earlier Explorer AUV, with a cylindrical body resembling a miniature submarine without the conning tower. Contrary to most other AUVs that are often powered by a single propeller, Zhishui-III is powered by twin propellers. The two shrouded propellers are installed just below the <b>horizontal</b> <b>control</b> surfaces of the crucifix control surfaces at the stern. Zhishui class AUV is claimed {{to be capable of}} performing a variety of tasks by the designers, but no details are released because it is designed for military application from the start, as opposed to other Chinese AUVs that are also used for civilian applications. Zhishui-II/III are currently in service with PLAN.|$|E
