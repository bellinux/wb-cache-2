Using {{data from the}} Central Asia High Altitude Population (CAHAP) study, we tested whether: (1) the relationship between frame size and body composition is different in high-, medium- and low-altitude populations; (2) elbow breadth is a better index of frame size than biacromial and biiliac breadth; and (3) measures of frame size are associated with blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides. A number of 334 male subjects aged 33 +/- 10 years (mean +/- standard deviation) were selected from the CAHAP population (n = 384) {{on the basis of}} the availability of breadth measurements. The subjects were 85 high-altitude Kirghizs, 105 medium-altitude Kazakhs, 79 low-altitude Kirghizs and 65 low-altitude Uighurs. A detailed anthropometric evaluation and blood pressure, cholesterol and trygliceride measurements were performed on all individuals. Among breadths, elbow had the lowest correlation with arm fat area, thigh <b>fat</b> area, <b>calf</b> <b>fat</b> area and the sum of trunk skinfolds (r < or = 0. 196, P < 0. 01). Even if elbow breadth did not have the highest correlation with muscularity indexes, its constantly lower association with adiposity indexes shows that it is a better measure of frame size than biacromial breadth and biiliac breadth. The relationship between frame size and body composition did not differ in high-, medium- and low-altitude subjects (P = not significant, analysis of co-variance). Only a weak association was present between breadths, blood pressure, cholesterol and triglycerides (r < or = 0. 230, P < 0. 01) and it was not influenced by altitude (P = not significant, analysis of co-variance). Elbow breadth was significantly correlated only with diastolic blood pressure (r = 0. 121, P < 0. 05). In conclusion: (1) the relationship between frame size and body composition is similar in high- and low-altitude populations; (2) elbow breadth is an index of frame size independent of altitude; and (3) elbow breadth is correlated with diastolic blood pressure, but this correlation is of doubtful biological relevance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lipodystrophies are {{characterized}} by redistributed subcutaneous fat stores. We previously quantified subcutaneous fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the legs of two patients with familial partial lipodystrophy subtypes 2 and 3 (FPLD 2 and FPLD 3, respectively). We now extend the MRI analysis across the whole body of patients with different forms of lipodystrophy. Methods We studied five subcutaneous fat stores (supraclavicular, abdominal, gluteal, thigh and calf) and the abdominal visceral fat stores in 10, 2, 1, 1 and 2 female subjects with, respectively, FPLD 2, FPLD 3, HIV-related partial lipodystrophy (HIVPL), acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL), congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) and in six normal control subjects. Results Compared with normal controls, FPLD 2 subjects had significantly increased supraclavicular fat, with decreased abdominal, gluteal, thigh and <b>calf</b> subcutaneous <b>fat.</b> FPLD 3 subjects had increased supraclavicular and abdominal subcutaneous fat, with less severe reductions in gluteal, thigh and <b>calf</b> <b>fat</b> compared to FPLD 2 subjects. The repartitioning of fat in the HIVPL subject closely resembled that of FPLD 3 subjects. APL and CGL subjects had reduced upper body, gluteal and thigh subcutaneous fat; the APL subject had increased, while CGL subjects had decreased subcutaneous <b>calf</b> <b>fat.</b> Visceral fat was markedly increased in FPLD 2 and APL subjects. Conclusion Semi-automated MRI-based adipose tissue quantification indicates differences between various lipodystrophy types in these studied clinical cases and is a potentially useful tool for extended quantitative phenomic analysis of genetic metabolic disorders. Further studies with a larger sample size are essential for confirming these preliminary findings. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop protocols that measure abdominal <b>fat</b> and <b>calf</b> muscle lipids with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), respectively, at 3 T and to examine the correlation between these parameters and insulin sensitivity. Materials and Methods: Ten nondiabetic subjects [five insulin-sensitive (IS) subjects and five insulin-resistant (IR) subjects] were scanned at 3 T. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were segmented semiautomatically from abdominal imaging. Intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) in calf muscles were quantified with single-voxel MRS in both soleus and tibialis anterior muscles and with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Results: The average coefficient of variation (CV) of VAT/(VAT+SAT) was 5. 2 %. The interoperator CV was 1. 1 % and 5. 3 % for SAT and VAT estimates, respectively. The CV of IMCL was 13. 7 % in soleus, 11. 9 % in tibialis anterior and 2. 9 % with MRSI. IMCL based on MRSI (3. 8 ± 1. 2 %) were significantly inversely correlated with glucose disposal rate, as measured by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. VAT volume correlated significantly with IMCL. IMCL based on MRSI for IR subjects was significantly greater than that for IS subjects (4. 5 ± 0. 9 % vs. 2. 8 ± 0. 5 %, P=. 02). Conclusion: MRI and MRS techniques provide a robust noninvasive measurement of abdominal fat and muscle IMCL, which are correlated with insulin action in humans. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{determined}} whether {{increased levels}} of inflammatory blood markers, D-dimer, and homocysteine were associated with smaller calf skeletal muscle area, increased <b>calf</b> muscle percent <b>fat,</b> reduced <b>calf</b> muscle density, and poorer calf strength in persons with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). BackgroundElevated levels of inflammatory markers and D-dimer are associated with greater functional impairment and functional decline in persons with PAD. Mechanisms of these associations are unknown. MethodsParticipants were 423 persons with PAD. Calf muscle area, percent fat, and density were measured with computed tomography. Physical activity levels were measured objectively over 7 days with the Caltrac (Muscle Dynamics Fitness Network, Inc., Rocklin, California) vertical accelerometer. Isometric plantarflexion strength was measured. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, comorbidities, the ankle-brachial index, and other potential confounders. ResultsHigher levels of D-dimer (p = 0. 014), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0. 002), interleukin (IL) - 6 (p < 0. 001), and soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule (sVCAM) - 1 (p = 0. 008) were associated with smaller calf muscle area. Higher sVCAM- 1 (p = 0. 004) and IL- 6 (p = 0. 017) were associated with higher <b>calf</b> muscle percent <b>fat.</b> Higher D-dimer (p < 0. 001), sVCAM- 1 (p < 0. 001), and homocysteine (p = 0. 014) were associated with lower calf muscle density. These associations were generally unchanged after additional adjustment for physical activity. Higher sVCAM- 1 (p = 0. 013) was associated with lower calf strength. ConclusionsThese data show, for the first time, that higher levels of inflammation, D-dimer, and homocysteine are associated with more adverse calf muscle characteristics in persons with PAD. These associations may contribute to previously established associations between elevated biomarkers and functional impairment and functional decline in PAD...|$|R
40|$|Robust {{knowledge}} of the critical determinants of lactation performance and correlations with fertility traits is essential for elucidating the underpinning relationships between genetic merit for high milk yield and reproduction. Holstein-Friesian, Jersey and Holstein-Friesian x Jersey breeds constitute {{the vast majority of}} milking cows in Tasmania’s mainly pasture-based dairy farms in Australia where genetics and seasonal fluctuations in pasture quantity and quality influence lactation performance. We tested the hypothesis that many decades of selection for high milk yield will lead to a gradual but progressive decline in reproductive performance under pasture-based production systems. Therefore, the main objective of our research was to conduct a multi-trait analysis of lactation performance in purebred and crossbred dairy cows and quantify the relationships with fertility traits under grazing conditions. Test-day lactation and reproductive performance data from 2006 - 2010 in 428 dairy farms in Tasmania with an average herd size of 300 cows were subjected to general linear models and correlation analyses. Lactation performance was found to be a function of breed, physiological status and age of the cow, regional location, season and year of calving. Older, multiparous, Holstein-Friesian cows gave significantly higher milk yields than younger, primiparous calvers with a linear increase in milk yield, protein, <b>fat</b> and <b>calf</b> birth weight as cow parity increased from 1 to 3. Lactation and fertility traits had an antagonistic relationship as high milk yield was associated with increases in calving interval, interval to first breeding and number of days open. It was concluded that for unbiased comparisons of cow mating plans, milking routines between and within pasture-based and seasonally bred dairy herds, adjustments for breed, parity, regional location, season and year of calving will be necessary. Furthermore, a balance must be struck between selecting for high milk yield and fertility-related traits to minimize the impact of the antagonistic relationship between lactation and reproductive traits on cow performance...|$|R

40|$|Morphological {{changes in}} calf (gastrocnemius) muscle of rats {{one month after}} {{implantation}} of acrylic resin samples “Ftoraks” and “Biocryl-C” were studied. Materials and methods. Experimental studies were performed on 30 white male rats of Wistar line weighing 180 - 200 gr. Animals were divided equally into 3 groups. The first group (the control group) included animals with punctured skin, subcutaneous <b>fat</b> and <b>calf</b> muscles by means of puncture needle. The second group consisted of animals with implanted resin samples “Ftoraks”. The thirdgroup was composed of animals with implanted resin samples “Biocryl-C”. Histologic colouring (according to Hart with additional colouring according to Van Hizon, colouring with hematoxylin and eosin) and electronic and microscopic methods of investigation were used. Results. On the 30 th day of the experiment histio-lymphocytic infiltration with foreign body cells, sclerosis and destruction of muscle fibers were noticed around acrylic resin samples “Ftoraks”. Profuse growth of connective tissue in the endo- and perimysium was observed in the adjacent muscle bundles. There was detected {{an increase in the}} diameter of striated muscle fibers (21. 73 ± 3. 47 mm, p = 0. 002) and the area of their nuclei (23. 31 ± 2. 86 mkm 2, p = 0. 00004) compared to control indices. But at the same time slight proliferation of connective tissue in the epi, peri- and endomysium, restoration of the blood vessels walls of hemomicrocirculatory channel at histological and ultrastructural levels helping to normalize blood supply were observed in the adjacent muscle bundles around acrylic resin samples “Biocryl-C”. These phenomena lead to compensatory-restorative processes in the muscle fibers of gastrocnemius, which was confirmed with morphometric analysis: diameter of striated muscle fibers was (14. 61 ± 0. 96 mm, p = 0. 48) and the area of their nuclei was (15. 61 ± 2. 07 mkm 2, p = 0. 23). Conclusions. It has been established that resin “Biocryl-C” caused smaller morphological and functional changes in the surrounding tissues that were absolutely reversible in comparison with resin “Ftoraks”. Thus, resin “Biocryl-C” is more promising for use in dental practice as a base material for laminar removable prostheses...|$|R

Average days open from parturition to conception was also determined for the cows. There was no difference between treatment for cow weight and body condition (scale 0 - 9) change. The cows lost an average of 9. 5 kg throughout the trial. A slight tendency towards increased milk production was observed in the lasalocid-treated cows, but this was not significant.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Disease {{acts as a}} {{powerful}} selective force in natural systems, driving the rapid evolution of resistance in the host. In {{the face of a}} myriad of pathogenic challenges in natural systems, hosts must balance the energetic needs of maintenance and reproduction with costly resistance mechanisms. In this dissertation I will (1) characterize Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis (bTB)) resistance strategies in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and determine associated costs that lead to the maintenance of variation in host response, (2) identify putative mechanisms of bTB infection resistance, and (3) determine the effects of maternal rearing environment on calf survival, growth, and immune development. Here I demonstrate measureable costs of a highly heritable form of bTB resistance in free-ranging African buffalo. Buffalo able to delay infection to a later age show reduced condition throughout life and reduced survival following infection, but a higher overall reproductive rate. Taken together, {{the costs and benefits of}} infection resistance imply a “fast” life history strategy in these animals as they reproduce early, die after infection, and show evidence of investment in highly costly immunity to prevent infection with bTB. I also present evidence that variation in infection resistance is mechanistically tied to phagocyte activation, with measurable differences in IL- 12 production among genotypes at a locus associated with a four-fold increase in bTB risk. Additionally, I reveal that milk fat content is highly conserved across mothers, but immune components of milk vary in a resource-dependent manner with mothers of higher condition, size, and age provisioning higher concentrations of immune-active constituents. However, although milk <b>fat</b> positively impacts <b>calf</b> survival, associations of immune components are less clear. Generally, lactoferrin (an anti-microbial peptide) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in milk associated with higher growth rates, but lower immune function in the calf, especially before weaning. These findings agree with theoretical predictions that maternal passive immunity acts to ‘free-up’ neonatal energetic resources for growth. Taken together, this body of work elucidates the roles of genetic background and maternal effects on disease susceptibility and early health and immunity and represents a unique validation of previously proposed theoretical and laboratory work. Additionally, patterns in disease response and maternal provisioning identified here contribute to our overall understanding of resource partitioning in stochastic systems...|$|R

Elderly {{people usually}} have low nourishment consumption, {{due to the}} aging process, which results in a serious problem, malnutrition, and, when it is associated with age, it's certainly an issue that deserves special attention. In order to achieve a clear nutritional diagnosis, that is, one that allows an adequate nutritional intervention, {{it is necessary to}} develop a nutritional assessment of the elderly. Such assessment can be carried out using objective and subjective indicators. Some of the objectives indicators, anthropometric and biochemical indicators, were approached in this study. The anthropometric variables considered were total body mass; height; arm circumference; arm muscular circumference; arm fat area; triceps, biceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thickness; body <b>fat</b> percentage; <b>calf</b> circumference and body mass index. The biochemical variables considered in this study were albumin, transferrin and C-reactive protein. Both grouping and interpreting the biochemical and anthropometric variables taken together constitute a major challenge for nutrition. Thus, the objective of this study was performing a principal component analysis for a sample of 113 elders, in order to maximize the explanation of the original data set using fewer variables as possible and then perform an exploratory factor analysis, over the same data, to extract the factors that group up the original variables in a subset of new, mutually non-correlated variables. The analysis were carried out for all elders using all variables and then new analysis were held for all elders, divided into age and sex classes, using the remaining variables after the removal of the lowest correlated ones. Through the principal component analysis, it was possible to conclude that the arm circumference is the most important, that is, the variable which has [...] .

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] six Holstein bull calves were divided into six groups {{to determine the effect}} of protein degradability and rumen inert fat supplementation in starter and finishing diets on nutrient digestibility and veal production. Calves received low (LD) or high (HD) degradable protein diets, with or without rumen inert fat supplementation. Two commercial fat sources were used, Morlac (mlc) and Golden Flake (gf), included in the experimental diets at 2. 5 % of dry matter (DM). A commercial milk replacer was fed to all calves at 4 L/day for 42 days, followed by 2 L/day until weaning at 49 days of age. Starter diets were offered ad lib. from day 14 to 10 weeks of age and finishing diets ad lib. from 11 to 20 weeks of age. All calves were slaughtered at 20 weeks to determine carcass weight and dressing percentage. There {{were no significant differences in}} body weight gain or dry matter intake over the entire 20 week period. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was improved when fat was supplemented to LD, but not to HD diets. The FCR (DM intake/kg gain) of LD, HD, LDmlc, HDmlc, LDgf and HDgf diets was 3. 45, 3. 44, 3. 07, 3. 81, 3. 02 and 3. 43, respectively. All 36 calves were used in a digestibility trial during week 18 of the study, using chromium oxide as a marker. Apparent digestibility values (%) for LD, HD, LDmlc, HDmlc, LDgf and HDgf, respectively, were 61. 7, 65. 9, 75. 4, 69. 0, 75. 5 and 67. 2 for DM, 61. 4, 61. 6, 71. 3, 68. 2, 75. 4 and 66. 1 for crude protein and 58. 6, 66. 5, 76. 0, 70. 9, 78. 4 and 70. 8 for fat. Dry matter and fat digestibilities were significantly higher when fat was added to LD diets, but not to HD diets. The CP digestibility was significantly higher when fat was added to either the LD or the HD diets. It was concluded that rumen inert <b>fat</b> supplementation to <b>calf</b> diets appears to improve feed conversion ratio and DM and fat digestibilities, but only when added to low degradable protein diets and only after 10 weeks of age. Crude protein digestibility appears to improve with fat supplementation to either high or low degradable protein diets. Publishers' versio...|$|R
