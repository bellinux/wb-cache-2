40|$|Effects {{of female}} steroid hormones on endothelial cells are gaining {{increased}} importance due to several {{studies on the}} effects of hormonal treatment on cardiovascular risk. Recent data argue for an improvement of endothelium-derived relaxation and impaired vascular contraction by estradiol, whereas progesterone and testosterone might entail contrary effects. So far, <b>gestagenic</b> influence on endothelial cell physiology is poorly understood. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to the female sex hormones estradiol and progesterone show expression of estrogen receptor-beta (ER beta) and progesterone receptor A (PR-A), and are negative for ER alpha and PR-B. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the expression and stimulation of PR-A and -B in HUVECs after stimulation with progesterone and PR antagonists that are commercially available. PR-B expression or upregulation was abrogated after application of progesterone or antagonists to HUVECs. Expression of PR-A could be significantly upregulated with progesterone and mifepristone. Unexpectedly, stimulation with the progesterone antagonist RU 486 (mifepristone) was accomplished by an upregulation of PR-A expression in our study. We conclude that <b>gestagenic</b> effects on HUVECs independent of modulators are mediated via the PR-A. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Lipoprotein(a) is a cholesterol-rich plasma {{lipoprotein}} {{consisting of}} LDL and apolipoprotein(a). Apolipoprotein(a) shows structural similarity with plasminogen and thus {{may interfere with}} thrombogenesis. Lipoprotein(a) {{has been shown to}} be a strong independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. So far no drug or diet is known to have prominent effects on the serum levels of lipoprotein(a). In the present study we found a highly significant decrease (in the order of 26 %) of lipoprotein(a) in 28 women treated for 6 months with Tibolone, compared with an age-matched healthy control group. Tibolone is a synthetic steroid with <b>gestagenic</b> and weak androgenic and oestrogenic properties, which shows no stimulation of the endometrium. Tibolone also produced a decrease in HDL-cholesterol of 23 % (p < 0. 001), a decrease in apolipoprotein A-I of 14 % (p < 0. 001) and an increase in apolipoprotein B of 17 % (p < 0. 001), whereas the control group showed no significant changes in these quantities. Tibolone in a daily dose of 2. 5 mg is at present the only complete postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy that shows a significant inhibiting influence on serum levels of lipoprotein(a). Its effect on lipoprotein(a) might counterbalance, at least to some extent, the theoretical adverse effect on the other lipoprotein risk factors...|$|E
40|$|To {{be able to}} use the Göttingen minipig as an {{experimental}} animal model for endocrinological and pharmacological objectives, it must be possible to evaluate the pharmacological effect of a substance on the ovarian cycle of the animals. In a preliminary study, methods were tested for their practicability and significance to characterize the cycle by using six female minipigs. Suitable proved to be the natural toleration reflex, the redness/swelling of the vulva, the evaluation of the vaginal mucus, the ultrasound examination of the ovaries as well as the determination of the plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, 17 -ß-estradiol and progesterone. In a main study, 12 female animals (3 treatment groups, 1 control group) were treated intramuscularly for 24 days with levonorgestrel (LNG), a synthetic gestagen. The aim was to inhibit the ovulation of the animals and to determine the threshold dose for the inhibition of ovulation. The lowest pharmacologically effective dose for the inhibition of ovulation was determined to be 0. 02 mg/kg/day LNG. In the 0. 002 mg/kg/day dose group, no clear estrus symptoms were evident on the outer genital. However, ovulation was confirmed by an ultrasound examination as well as the hormone concentrations at the end of the study. In the 0. 02 mg/kg/day and 0. 1 mg/kg/day dose groups, both behavior and all other measured parameters showed a clear interruption of the sexual cycle, and no ovulation occurred. Animals in both the mid- and high dose groups showed substance related effects, not only on the ovary but also on the vagina, uterus, and the organ weights. These results correlated with known effects observed in other species, e. g. the rat. Overall, the Göttinger minipig proved to be a very suitable animal model to test pharmacological hormone effects on the sexual cycle of the minipig. This was also applicable to the choice of methods, which offered an additional possibility to evaluate the <b>gestagenic</b> effects of hormones and other substances in toxicology studies...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the impact of {{combined}} oral contraceptives (COC) on the vulvar vestibular mucosa and pain mechanisms; in healthy women and in women with provoked vestibulodynia (former vulvar vestibulitis syndrome). The somatosensory perception in the vulvar vestibular mucosa of healthy women was studied with the relation to COC. An endogenous pain inhibitory response called diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) was examined in healthy women with or without COC and in women with provoked vestibulodynia. The morphology and steroid receptor expression in healthy women during the influence of COC and during the menstrual cycle and in women with provoked vestibulodynia was evaluated. Material and Methods Thirty four women with provoked vestibulodynia, 60 healthy women using COC and 64 healthy non COC users participated in the studies. Quantitative sensory tests, including mechanical and thermal pain thresholds of the vulvar vestibule were performed. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured before and during a cold pressor test to provoke a DNIC, or "pain inhibits pain" response. Vestibular biopsies were collected for morphological analyses. The amount and distribution of estrogen receptors a and 0, progesterone receptors A and B, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor and the proliferation marker Ki 67 were estimated using immunohistochemistry followed by computerized image analysis. Results: The mechanical pain thresholds were significantly lower in women using COC than in non users. An intact DNIC response was present in all three groups as illustrated by a significantly increased PPT during cold noxious stimulation. Compared with the healthy women, the patients displayed lower PPTs, both {{before and during the}} cold pressor test. The vulvar vestibular mucosa displayed a larger interdermal papilla distance in the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase. A similar morphological feature was seen in COC users and there was also a larger distance from the dermal papillae to the epithelial surface compared with controls. Histopathological assessments showed a higher amount of superficial blood vessels in the COC users. The vestibular stromal tissue expressed more ERbeta in women with COC than in women without. PRB was more abundant in the stromal. tissue in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase. There was a significantly higher expression of Eralpha in both the epithelium and the stroma in the specimens of the vestibulodynia patients compared with that of controls. Conclusions: COC may induce an increased sensitivity in the vestibular mucosa in healthy women and might be one contributing factor in the development of provoked vestibulodynia. An altered morphological pattern and changes in the expression of various hormone receptors in women using COC and during the luteal, phase indicates a <b>gestagenic</b> effect on the mucosa. There is a systemic hypersensitivity in women with provoked vestibulodynia; however the endogenous pain inhibition seems comparable to that of healthy women irrespective of COC use. The increased expression of Eralpha in women with provoked vestibulodynia, without an effect on the epithelial morphology, may be related to an ongoing neurogenic inflammation in the mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Within the European Union the use {{of growth}} {{promoting}} agents in cattle fattening is prohibited according to Council Directive 96 / 22 /EC. Interestingly, {{there is not a}} black list of substances, but 96 / 22 /EC states that all substances having thyrostatic, estrogenic, androgenic or <b>gestagenic</b> activity are prohibited. Besides abuse of the “classical” synthetic steroids there is a tendency towards misuse of natural steroids and prohormones. Prohormones are compounds that exhibit limited or no hormonal activity but are direct precursors of bioactive hormones and are intended to be converted to full active hormones via enzymatic processes in the body. However, knowledge about metabolism, the mode of action and excretion profiles in cattle is often unclear, and methods to detect abuse of prohormones in livestock production are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to get insight into the hormonal action of prohormones and to develop novel in vitro and in vivo screening methods allowing effective surveillance on the illegal use of prohormones in livestock production. Hereby the emphasis was on developing effect based approaches to better meet Council Directive 96 / 22 /EC. The bioactivity {{of a wide variety of}} supplements which contained prohormones were tested using a yeast androgen bioassay. For supplements containing solely prohormones the value of this bioactivity based screening appeared to be limited as they require metabolism to become active. Therefore, screening methods for animal feed, supplements and preparations were set-up by using the same yeast androgen bioassay in combination with bovine liver models as well as enzymatic and chemical deconjugation procedures to mimic in vivo metabolic bioactivation. The use of either bovine liver S 9, liver slices, pure enzymes or alkaline hydrolysis showed that prohormones could be activated, resulting in a significant increase in bioactivity as determined by the androgen yeast bioassay. For the detection of prohormone abuse at the farm and/or slaughterhouse the usefulness of ‘omics’ based profiling techniques was investigated. Within this scope a comprehensive metabolomics based screening strategy for steroid urine profiling was developed. Comparison of urinary profiles revealed large differences between the profiles of controls and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as pregnenolone treated animals. Moreover this steroid urine profiling approach allowed identification of biomarkers for treatment by specific prohormones. This resulted in respectively 7 and 12 specific mass peak loadings which could potentially be used as biomarkers for pregnenolone and DHEA treatment. In addition, the feasibility of a liver gene expression profiling approach was investigated to monitor the effects of DHEA treatment at the transciptome level. It was shown that identification and application of genomic biomarkers for screening of DHEA abuse in cattle is substantially hampered by biological variation. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that comparison of pre-defined gene sets versus the whole genome expression profile of an animal allows to distinguish DHEA treatment effects from variations in gene expression due to inherent biological variation. Altogether the results of this thesis increase the knowledge about the metabolism and bioactivation of prohormones in vitro as well as in vivo. Based on this knowledge, a panel of new effect based concepts and screening methods was developed that complement and improve the current testing programs. These new concepts will facilitate better implementation of the European ban on growth promoters in livestock production as described in Council Directive 96 / 22 /EC...|$|E
