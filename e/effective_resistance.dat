Then, we use this property for these particular networks and assume that all of the conductances except for one of them, say c≡ c_ 1 = 1, are zero to give a procedure for evaluating <b>effective</b> <b>resistances</b> on these networks.

40|$|In {{this work}} we compute the <b>effective</b> <b>resistances</b> and the Kirchhoff Index of {{subdivision}} networks {{in terms of}} the corresponding parameters of the original network. Our techniques are based on the study of discrete operators using discrete Potential Theory. Starting from a given network G = (V, E, c), we add a new vertex v xy at every edge { x, y } ¿ E and define new conductances c (x, v xy) so as to satisfy the electrical compatibility condition 1 c (x, y) = 1 c (x, v xy) + 1 c (y, v xy), in order to obtain a subdivision network G S = (V S, E S, c). In this setting we prove how the solution to a compatible Poisson problem on the subdivision network G S can be related with the solution of a suitable Poisson problem on the inicial network G. We use contraction and extension of functions from C (V S) to C (V) and viceversa, respectively to achieve our result.
