5|$|During a December 4, 2005, game at Heinz Field, T. J. Houshmandzadeh of the Cincinnati Bengals wiped <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> a Towel {{after he}} scored a touchdown. Although the Bengals managed a 7-point victory in that regular season game, the Steelers {{came back to}} defeat them 3117 in the playoffs, {{on their way to}} a victory in Super Bowl XL. The Bengals did not reach the playoffs again until the 2009-10 season, after Houshmandzadeh had left the team.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in {{the seventh}} contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes. At two points during the match, Nash {{performed}} his signature Jackknife Powerbomb with Joe kicking out before the three count. This led to Nash hitting Joe in the groin and placing <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ropes for leverage in his winning pin attempt.|$|E

5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the main}} event match, Piper {{revealed}} that the fan humiliated by Lawler in the King's Court segment would be in Piper's corner during the match. Piper started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler's face and attacking him. The match consisted mainly of brawling, and Lawler was frequently distracted by the fan who was standing in Piper's corner. Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on Piper. He attacked Piper with a foreign object, which knocked Piper to the mat. Then, while trying to pin Piper, Jerry Lawler placed <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ropes for leverage. The fan at ringside pushed Lawler's feet off, however, which allowed Piper to perform a back suplex and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E

5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee {{what had happened and}} the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out.|$|E

While Lunacharsky, head of Narkompros but a patron of Proletkult and its interests, dragged <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the merger, the congress eventually — following long debate and a stern appeal to party discipline — formally approved the Central Committee's decision to directly integrate Proletkult into Narkompros.|$|E
25|$|After Frenchy Martin's departure, Bravo joined Jimmy Hart's {{stable and}} entered a feud with another power wrestler, The Ultimate Warrior, unsuccessfully {{challenging}} Warrior for his WWF Intercontinental Championship. Prior to a WrestleMania VI loss to Duggan, Bravo {{teamed up with}} Earthquake, and Bravo would often display his strength by doing push ups while the 460lb. Earthquake sat on his back (although Tenta kept <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the floor, so not all of his weight was on his partner). The team of Earthquake and Bravo would have a lengthy feud with Hulk Hogan and Tugboat.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match was}} between Hulk Hogan and Randy Orton. Orton took the {{advantage}} in the match, as he focused on Hogan's injured knee. The match saw Orton perform an RKO on Hogan. As Orton went for the pin, Hogan had <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ropes. The referee did not see his feet and originally gave Orton the victory. Later, the referee saw that Hogan's feet {{were still on the}} ropes and restarted the match. Hogan won the match when he performed a leg drop on Orton for a pinfall victory. To date, this is Hogan's last match in the WWE.|$|E
25|$|Peanuts had {{its origin}} in Li'l Folks, a weekly panel comic that {{appeared}} in Schulz's hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy. In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post which published 17 single-panel cartoons by Schulz. The first of these was of a boy sitting with <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> an ottoman.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Lex Luger and Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Luger gained the early advantage, and {{targeted}} {{the left arm}} of Flair. Luger applied the hammerlock, and used the guard rail and ringpost. Flair fought back after he avoided an elbow drop, and sent Luger's head into the guard rail. Luger applied the sleeper hold, but Flair fought out with a belly to back suplex. Luger fought back with a superplex, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger continued to have the advantage until Flair pulled Luger down, and hit his left knee with a steel chair. Flair then targeted Luger's left leg, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger fought back with a gorilla press slam. After performing mounted punches and a scoop powerslam, Luger applied the Torture Rack. However, his knees buckled, and Flair fell on top of him. Flair then pinned Luger with <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the rope to win the match, and retain the title.|$|E

25|$|Hellwig {{joined the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987. First {{competing}} on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he defeated {{a series of}} jobbers, including Steve Lombardi, Barry Horowitz and Mike Sharpe. He made his television debut as The Ultimate Warrior on the October 25 episode of Wrestling Challenge, where he defeated another jobber, Terry Gibbs. The Ultimate Warrior became known for his high-energy ring entrances, which featured him racing into the arena at full speed, bursting into the ring, and violently shaking the ropes up and down. He was also known for his distinctive pattern of face paint. After several months of defeating jobbers, he was pinned {{for the first time}} in the WWF by fellow WWF rookie/future rival Rick Rude on December 28, 1987. In early 1988, Warrior entered into his first real WWF feud with fellow strongman Hercules Hernandez. The two faced off on the February 7, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, where Hercules was disqualified for using his steel chain. Warrior then grabbed a hold of the chain and in the midst of a tug of war over it, the chain snapped. This led to a match at WrestleMania IV, where Warrior was victorious in his pay-per-view debut. Warrior lost twice by pinfall shortly thereafter: cleanly to André the Giant in April in Italy, and to Dino Bravo, who put <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ropes for leverage, in Montreal in June.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Matt and Jeff Hardy with Lita as the Special Guest Referee. In the beginning, {{the two had}} several {{reversals}} until Matt got in control. Jeff sidestepped when Matt attempted a diving leg drop. Jeff hit a falling headbutt and a clothesline. Jeff went on to deliver a diving leg drop of his own. Jeff went to the top rope but Matt trapped him in a Tree of Woe. Matt then applied the sunset flip, which Jeff countered and both men were lying outside the ring. In the ring, Jeff injured his left knee, which Matt would work on. He hit a chop block {{and a series of}} moves. He tried a powerbomb, but Jeff countered it into a Compactor Clutch. Matt assaulted Jeff again with a Half Boston Crab. Jeff got to the ropes, breaking the hold, and kicked Matt to the outside. Jeff went to the top, but, because of his hurt knee, he fell down. Matt grabbed Jeff's leg but Jeff hit a mule kick. Matt tried a Twist of Fate, but Jeff countered it into a leg drop. Jeff hit a suplex, and went to the top rope again but, because of his knee, Matt took advantage and clutched him. Matt tried to hit a Twist of Fate but Jeff reversed it into his own. Matt attempted a pinfall on Jeff and used ropes for leverage but Lita ordered him to break it. Jeff went to the top rope again, but Matt caught him, and tried to hit him a Twist of Fate from the top. Jeff forced Matt off and hit a Swanton Bomb. Matt tried to get <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ropes, but Jeff pulled them off, and won the match.|$|E
