I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E

Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> the rent? How am I going to get through this day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E

On October 19 2014, the track list of Reclassified was released, which also included [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] as 9th track. On 23 October 2014, the track was available for streaming. A day later, the track was made available as an instant digital download track upon pre-ordering Reclassified via iTunes Stores. [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] was written by Iggy Azalea, The Invisible Men, Jon Mills, Darryl Reid and Jon Turner. It was produced by The Invisible Men and The Arcade. Lasting for a duration of 3:20 (three minutes and twenty seconds), [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] is built on [...] "club-ready" [...] electro handclap-based beats and heavy synthesisers. Lyrically, Azalea talks about her success and goes after her [...] "haters" [...] on the song. At one point, she raps: [...] "Haters gon' hate while critics critique, <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> them no mind whenever they speak / what they make a year I make in a week, I know you can't stand it, just get you a seat!" [...] On the hook, she raps: [...] "Everywhere I go they say it's Iggy SZN / Until l get what I want, I ain't leaving… Simmer down bitch / It's Iggy SZN." ...|$|E

2500|$|In summer 1917, Lupu Kostaki {{issued a}} {{document}} popularly known under the archaic, and possibly mocking, title of Pantahuza ("The Encyclical"). It {{was in effect}} a list of signatures for creating a Carp dictatorship upon the end of war, and its social impact, even {{in the context of}} occupation, was minor. Meanwhile, plagued by heart trouble and depression, Maiorescu died, an event which pushed Junimism farther on the road to collapse.

Political views were divided: the leftists supporting him, and the conservatives (together with the industrialists), opposing him. At this time Mattei is alleged to have widely used unofficial financial resources of Agip for extensive bribery, especially of politicians and journalists. He used to say of political parties: [...] "I use them like I would use a taxi: I sit in, <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> for the trip, I get out". Agip gained control of hundreds of companies in all economic fields in the country. Mattei paid great attention to the press, and Agip soon took possession of several newspapers and two agencies.|$|E
2500|$|Getty {{moved to}} Rome {{as head of}} Getty Oil Italiana. After {{the death of his}} second wife in 1971, he moved back to England and was reclusive for a time. In 1973, his eldest son, John Paul Getty III, was kidnapped in Rome by Calabrian 'Ndrangheta mobsters and held in the Calabrian Mountains, chained to a stake in a cave. Getty did not have enough money to pay the $17million ransom demand, and his father refused to help, saying [...] "I have 14 other grandchildren, and if <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> one penny now, then I will have 14 kidnapped grandchildren." [...] However, when one of his son's ears was {{delivered}} by mail to a newspaper in Rome (delivery had been delayed by three weeks because of a postal strike), his father finally agreed to help out with the ransom payment by making the ransom payment a loan to his son.|$|E
2500|$|Berryman's major poetic {{breakthrough}} {{came after}} {{he began to}} publish {{the first volume of}} The Dream Songs, 77 Dream Songs, in 1964. The dream song form consisted of short, eighteen-line lyric poems in three stanzas. The poems are written in free verse although some stanzas contain irregular rhyme. 77 Dream Songs (and its sequel His Toy, His Dream, His Rest) centers on a character named [...] "Henry" [...] who bears a striking resemblance to John Berryman. However, Berryman was careful about making sure that his readers realized that [...] "Henry" [...] was not his equivalent, but rather a fictional version of himself (or a literary alter ego). In an interview, Berryman stated, [...] "Henry does resemble me, and I resemble Henry; {{but on the other hand}} I am not Henry. You know, <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> income tax; Henry pays no income tax.

2500|$|In 1961, Smythe sold {{most of his}} {{shares to}} a three-person {{partnership}} formed by his son, Stafford Smythe, with Harold Ballard and John Bassett. The new ownership added 962 new seats to the Gardens in 1962 and added a private club, The Hot Stove Club, the following year. Even more seats were added in 1965 and new mezzanine galleries were constructed in 1966 and 1967. By 1968, seating capacity for hockey had grown to 16,485. This was achieved, in part, by making the seats narrower, so that—in the words of founder Conn Smythe—"only a young man could sit in them and only a fat old rich man could afford them." [...] A large portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was removed {{to make room for}} more seats. When asked why he removed the picture, Ballard replied, [...] "She doesn't pay me, <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> her. Besides, what the hell position can a queen play?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{title was}} not what Brown would have wanted. [...] He {{wanted to have a}} more direct title that used words like [...] "sex", [...] "prostitute" [...] or [...] "trick". [...] Some of the titles he floated around were <b>I</b> <b>Pay</b> for Sex or The Sex Life of John Brown but his {{publishers}} asked him to call it Paying for It, a title which rubbed him the wrong way, as [...] "t suggests that not only am I paying for sex but I’m also paying for being a john in some non-monetary way. Many would think that there’s an emotional cost — that johns are sad and lonely...I haven’t been 'paying for it' in any of those ways. I’m very far from being sad or lonely, I haven’t caught an S-T-D, I haven’t been arrested, I haven’t lost my career, and my friends and family haven’t rejected me." [...] He says that if he had insisted, Drawn and Quarterly would have allowed him to call the book what he wanted, but Brown allowed the change of title, acknowledging how difficult the book would be to market.|$|E
2500|$|The show, {{scheduled}} in a graveyard slot on Tuesday nights at 8:00p.m., {{was not expected}} to challenge the ratings giants Milton Berle and Frank Sinatra, but did surprisingly well. Berle, known to many early television viewers as [...] "Uncle Miltie" [...] and for using ancient vaudeville material, joked about Sheen, [...] "He uses old material, too", and observed that [...] "f I'm going to be eased off the top by anyone, it's better that I lose to the One for whom Bishop Sheen is speaking." [...] Sheen responded in jest that maybe people should start calling him [...] "Uncle Fultie". Life and Time magazine ran feature stories on Bishop Sheen. The number of stations carrying Life Is Worth Living jumped from three to fifteen {{in less than two}} months. There was fan mail that flowed in at a rate of 8,500 letters per week. There were four times as many requests for tickets as could be fulfilled. Admiral, the sponsor, paid the production costs in return for a one-minute commercial {{at the opening of the}} show and another minute at the close. In 1952 Sheen won an Emmy Award for his efforts, accepting the acknowledgment by saying, [...] "I feel it is time <b>I</b> <b>pay</b> tribute to my four writers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John." [...] When Sheen won the Emmy, Berle quipped, [...] "We both work for 'Sky Chief'", a reference to Berle's sponsor Texaco. Time called him [...] "the first 'televangelist'", and the Archdiocese of New York could not meet the demand for tickets.|$|E
