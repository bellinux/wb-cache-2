40|$|D* {{is a novel}} {{system for}} <b>data</b> storage <b>and</b> {{retrieval}} appropriate for advanced scientific studies, as in high-energy physics, environmental sciences, and astronomy.

This provides a basis for a tighter integration of <b>data</b> storage <b>and</b> <b>data</b> mining technologies. Through the application of innovative retrieval and clustering techniques for high-dimensional data, D* can support high-performance <b>data</b> access <b>and</b> provide <b>data</b> mining applications useful insights into the data that can facilitate subsequent processes of <b>data</b> preparation <b>and</b> <b>data</b> mining. The basic processes of the D* system include data clustering, space partitioning, <b>data</b> loading, <b>and</b> <b>data</b> retrieval based on region queries and similarity searching.
