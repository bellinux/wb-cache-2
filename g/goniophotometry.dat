At the Light & Lighting Laboratory the recently installed goniophotometers {{will be used to}} determine luminous intensity distributions of a wide variety light sources of various dimensions. In this work results obtained with the near field goniophotometer are compared with photometric data obtained with a far field goniophotometer. The near field goniophotometers allow to obtain information about both the luminous flux and the luminous intensity of light sources. In this paper these parameters were investigated for a calibrated incandescent source and for a remote phosphor LED source. The luminous flux and luminous intensities as obtained from both lamps are comparable for both near and far field goniophotometers.

40|$|International audienceIn this article, we {{investigate}} {{the benefit of}} including texture information in models of gloss perception of low-gloss textured achromatic plastic surfaces from the automotive industry. 4 models are compared: two gloss prediction models including texture information, one using data from reflectometry (M 1) and one using data from <b>goniophotometry</b> (M 2), and two models using data from reflectometry (M 3) or <b>goniophotometry</b> (M 4) alone. Both texture-corrected models (M 1 -M 2) outclass the uncorrected intensity-based models, mainly because they are made texture invariant. Although the texture-corrected reflectometer-based prediction (M 1) correlates rather well with sensory data, a more consistent fit is obtained by mixing textural to goniophotometric data (M 2). This {{can be explained by}} the fact that contrast gloss is better than multiangle specular gloss at reflecting the observer's gloss evaluation strategy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Goniophotometry</b> {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{photometric}} measurements in lighting engineering. Aim is to measure spatial characteristics of luminous parts of the luminaires and light sources represented by luminous intensity distribution curve which is needed for lighting computation at level of the preparation of lighting design. Near-field <b>goniophotometry</b> is still a forthcoming technology widely used in photometric laboratories all over the world. Due to compact design of these systems the laboratory space can be saved and they can be installed in a room of usual dimensions because they do not obey the inverse square law from {{point of view of the}} whole dimension of the luminaire. The principle of these goniophotometers of the luminance distribution is measurement of luminous part of the luminaires and light sources. By integration over solid angle from this fundamental photometric quantity luminous intensity in particular direction in the space represented by two angles depending on measurement planes is derived. Although theoretical principle and physical model is well-known and defined, in practical realisation of this system some problems occur. One of the problems is traceability to SI units. This fact disqualifies near-field goniophotometer in standards relating to <b>goniophotometry.</b> The methods to prove that near-field goniophotometer works are mostly based on computer simulations compared with practical measurements. But in the practice, appropriate calibration method with traceability to the SI units is still not available, unlike it is clearly used for farfield goniophotometers. The paper describes possibility of the calibration of near-field goniophotometers to SI units by standards which should provide fully traceable calibration to the base. Also method of validation of near-field goniophotometric systems is still opened question for future work. At the present, further works continue on the method of validation in the framework of that CIE Division 2 but this topic is out of scope of this Paper...|$|E

40|$|To {{accurately}} {{describe the}} spatial and angular light distribution {{of a light}} source, near-field <b>goniophotometry</b> relies on the data captured by both an imaging luminance measurement device and a photometer. Since both detectors exhibit a difference in dynamic range, the resulting ray file and luminous intensity distribution (LID) may be incorrect.

These limitations are particularly pronounced when the technique is used to compared devices whose emission patterns have been modified through surface texturing at the micrometer and nanometer scales,. In view of such limitations, confocal microscopy has been adopted {{for the study of}} emission characteristics of LEDs. This enables three-dimensional emission maps to be collected, from which two-dimensional cross-sectional emission profiles can be generated. Of course, there are limitations associated with confocal microscopy, including the range of emission angles that can be measured due to the limited acceptance angle of the objective. As an illustration, the technique has been adopted to compare the emission profiles of LEDs with different divergence angles using an objective with a numerical aperture of 0. 8. It is found that the results are consistent with those obtained by <b>goniophotometry</b> when the divergence angle is less that the acceptance angle of the objective. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Within {{near-field}} <b>goniophotometry,</b> {{measurement results}} of both an imaging luminance measurement device and a photometer detector are combined {{to generate the}} luminous intensity distribution of a light source. The simultaneous use of these two detectors may engender incorrect measurement results, due to their difference in dynamic range. In this paper, near-field and far-field based luminous intensity distribution measurements of two luminaires are presented, in order to exemplify the problem. Results demonstrate that the distributions obtained from near-field measurements may deviate from the correct intensity distribution, by an amount of up to 16 % of the total luminous flux of the luminaire. A method to check for the correctness of the luminous intensity distribution from the near-field measurement, the so-called sanity check, is discussed. To conclude, some possible solutions to eliminate the dynamic range mismatch induced errors are treated. status: publishe...|$|E

In this study, the opacity and haze effect of four types of poly-methylmethacrylate powders and their 10 wt % powder foundation formulation was evaluated.

And as a formulated phase, the powder foundation formulation containing particulates with fine pores provided the highest haze and opacity value. We also examined the quantity of reflected light over the angular range 20 - 75 ° by polarized light <b>goniophotometry.</b> The total reflected light intensity, surface-reflected light, and internally reflected light were characterized.

The MIT Heliodome project is dedicated to <b>goniophotometry</b> and the assessment of bidirectional photometric properties of light- (or heat-) redirecting facade systems by using digital cameras as multiple-points photosensors, that cover the visible and near infrared portions of the sunlight spectrum.

Both cameras are mounted to a table which has two degrees of rotational freedom, altitude and azimuth. Using the rotating table and cameras in combination with an ellipsoidal dome, which is coated with a semi-transparent specula coating, allows a time-efficient and continuous measurement of bidirectional transmission (or reflection) density functions (BTDFs or BRDFs).

40|$|International audienceFive optical {{analyses}} {{of a given}} work of art are presented, using multispectral imaging, optical coherence tomography, goniophometry, UV-fluorescence emission spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. All these methods are non-destructive, contactless, and implementable in situ. They all lead to results in quasi-real time. The multispectral camera allows imaging of the whole painting with very high definition and recording of 240 millions of spectra. Optical coherence tomography allows local 2 D and 3 D imaging with in-face and in depth stratigraphies inside the painting with a micrometric accuracy. It allows {{the evaluation of the}} pigment volume concentration inside a layer, the measurement of the thickness of one or two varnish layers, the detection and measurements of gaps inside the paint layer, the depth of varnish micro-cracks. <b>Goniophotometry</b> allows the measurement of the upper surface state of the painting in different locations, by quantifying the mean slope of the facets making up the surface. UV-fluorescence emission spectroscopy allows the identification of the resin, the binder and the ageing state of varnishes by use of databases of reference varnishes. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy leads to pigment, pigment mixture and dye identifications again by use of databases. The three last methods are implemented with the same portable multi-function instrument. It allows time saving, locations on request in front of the artwork and easy use by non-scientists. Each instrument is described with its protocol and accuracy. The studied painting is a portrait of a lady painted by the Austrian artist Franz Strotszberg, chosen for its several restorations. The five kinds of results are successively detailed, analysed and compared between themselves. It is shown that the different results are complementary and their crosschecking brings thorough information. For example, the shape of the network of varnish micro-cracks detected on the surface with the multispectral camera is added to the measurement of their depth with optical coherence tomography. Another example allows connecting two different surface states of the upper varnished surface measured by <b>goniophotometry</b> with the identification of these varnish with UV-fluorescence and with their thicknesses measured with optical coherence tomography.

40|$|PTB Braunschweig, Germany, November 23 – 26, 2015; [URL] have {{developed}} a complete procedure to reduce photometric near-field experimental data by characterizing the spectral and angular distribution of small areas of extended sources, or subsources. Once these subsources are photometrically characterized and expressions of the spectral radiance for all subsources are given, any photometric quantity of the complete source can be calculated by integration in a very modest lapse of time, which is a clear advantage with respect to ray-tracing methods for real-time visualization applications. The expressions of the spectral radiance for all subsources are also an important starting point to identify the relevant uncertainty sources in a near-field measurement. We have tested this procedure using the near-field goniospectroradiometer developed at IO-CSIC, which allows spectral, angular and spatial photometric measurement to be carried out.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the deterioration of surface coatings as a result of weathering and exposure to a pollutant gas (in this case nitric oxide). Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) plastisol surface coatings have been exposed to natural and artificial weathering and a comparison of the effects of these two types of weathering has been made by use of various analytical techniques. These techniques have each been assessed as to their value in providing information regarding changes taking place in the coatings during ageing, and include, <b>goniophotometry,</b> micro-penetrometry, surface energy measurements, weight loss measurements, thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The results of each of these studies have then been combined to show the changes undergone by PVC plastisol surface coatings during ageing and to show the effects which additives to the coatings have on their behaviour and in particular the effects of plasticiser, pigment and uv and thermal stabilisers. Finally a preliminary study of the interaction between five commercial polymers and nitric oxide has been carried out, the polymers being polypropylene, cellulose acetate butyrate, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate.

40|$|Textiles {{have always}} been one of the {{essential}} materials for people and have a great variety of uses such as in clothing, agriculture, medical, automotive and aerospace applications. The sort of properties needed for any type of fabric basically depend on the structure of the fibre surface. Of many geometric attributes {{that can be used to}} describe the surface appearance of a fibre, yarn, or fabric sample, one of the more common is lustre. Mohair and wool fibre surface structure have been studied using optical microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Optical microscopy was also used to take fibre diameter measurements. Another technique, <b>goniophotometry,</b> was used to make quantitative lustre measurements of mohair and wool fibres. The surface structure of mohair has got a faint pattern of scales where the scales are generally unpronounced or flat and relatively long. Wool has got a scaly surface structure where the scales overlap leading to interlocking of fibres. The scale configuration on the surface of mohair and wool fibres also differs. A qualitative connection between fibre lustre and the fibre surface structure was found. Because of its smooth surface relative to that of wool, mohair reflects a greater amount of incident light specularly whereas wool reflects most of the incident light diffusely. In general, mohair fibres have a higher lustre than wool due to its less prominent cuticle structure found on its surface. Furthermore, mohair fibres with the smallest diameters give an even higher lustre...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} few biomaterials which combine controlled degradation rates with ease of melt processability. There are however, many applications ranging from surgical fixation devices to drug delivery systems which require such combination properties. The {{work in this}} thesis {{is an attempt to}} increase the availability of such materials. Polyhydroxybutyrate-polyhydroxyvalerate copolymers are a new class of potentially biodegradable materials, although little quantitative data relating to their in vitro and in vivo degradation behaviour exists. The hydrolytic degradation of these copolymers has been examined in vitro under conditions ranging from `physiological' to extremes of pH and elevated temperature. Progress of the degradation process was monitored by weight loss and water uptake measurement, x-ray diffractometry, optical and electron microscopy, together with changes in molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography. The extent to which the degradation mechanism could be modified by forming blends with polysaccharides and polycaprolactone was also investigated. Influence of the valerate content, molecular weight, crystallinity, together with the physical form of the sample, the pH and the temperature of the aqueous medium on the hydrolytic degradation was investigated. Its progress was characterised by an initial increase in the wet weight, with concurrent decrease in the dry weight as the amorphous regions of the polymer are eroded, thereby producing an increase in matrix porosity. With the polysaccharide blends, this initial rate is dramatically affected, and erosion of the polysaccharide from the matrix markedly increases the internal porosity which leads to the eventual collapse of the matrix, a process which occurs, but less rapidly, in the degradation of the unblended polyhydroxybutyrate-polyhydroxyvalerate copolymers. Surface energy measurement and <b>goniophotometry</b> proved potentially useful in monitoring {{the early stages of the}} degradation, where surface rather than bulk processes predominate and are characterised by little weight loss...|$|E
