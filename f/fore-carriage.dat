5000|$|Arthur Krebs {{proposed}} {{placing the}} front axle {{of a car}} at a positive caster angle in his UK patent of 1896, entitled Improvements in mechanically propelled vehicles, stating it was intended [...] "To ensure stability of direction {{by means of a}} special arrangement of <b>fore-carriage,</b> that is to say, to re-establish automatically the parallelism of the two axles of the vehicle when there is no tendency to keep them in any other direction, or after a temporary effort has caused them to diverge from said parallelism. ... The axle of the <b>fore-carriage</b> is situated a suitable distance behind the projection of the axis of the pivot-pin in order to ensure the stability of direction above referred to." ...|$|E
50|$|H. Adams, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, {{offered a}} {{conversion}} set that converted horse-drawn carriages into motorized automobiles. The engine was {{mounted on a}} swivelling <b>fore-carriage,</b> and steering was achieved through wheel and vertical column. In 1905, Adams produced a small 2-cylinder car sold under the name 'One of the Best'.|$|E
50|$|The 'front' {{wheels are}} {{normally}} smaller than {{those at the}} back. This {{is because they are}} mounted on the swivelling <b>fore-carriage,</b> under the smokebox, and large wheels would be liable to hit the boiler when the engine was turned around a corner. An added bonus is that a larger diameter flywheel may be fitted, providing a more steady power output.|$|E
