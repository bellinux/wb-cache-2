40|$|Abstract: Indirect {{interrelations between}} {{ecosystem}} processes are often realised after a considerable time lag, and, therefore, are easily overlooked. The {{understanding of these}} relationships, however, is indispensable for sustainable development and <b>ecomanagement.</b> Investigation of mechanisms underpinning complex indirect delayed relationships is greatly aided by advanced mathematical techniques, including correlation, multiple regression and factor analysis, simulation modelling, etc. This paper provides {{a brief review of}} the recent relevant studies. These techniques may be especially useful if used in concert on a range of ecosystems, thus integrating the information obtained in a comparative theoretical ecosystem analysis (CTEA). A methodological framework for CTEA is given and possible implications discussed...|$|E
40|$|The series ISO 14001 of {{international}} voluntary standards {{is an effective}} tool for improving organizational environmental performance and implementation of sustainable approach to energy management. These standards established and implemented a systematic management plan. Plan is made to continually identify and reduce environmental impacts. Eco-management approach may be suitable because its implementation is a possible way to replace the widely used environmental control system based on legislation and controlling of the application of environmental and energy regulations. <b>Ecomanagement</b> systems can help companies to integrate environmental efforts into decision making. Application of eco-management system improves compliance with environmental regulations. Today, the number of companies in the world which tend to integrate the system of eco-management in their business strategies is rapidly increasing. They accept advanced technologies. Systems of eco-management encourage companies to consider environmental consequences of their operations. To reduce waste, risks and costs the companies then define strategies which would help them...|$|E
40|$|Environmental service-learning is an {{intentional}} educational experience(s) wherein learners engage in meaningful activities designed {{to serve the}} environment. Environmental service-learning activities vary according to their learning and service goals and include <b>ecomanagement,</b> persuasion, legal action, economic action and political action. The purpose of this mixed methods research was to explore the ecological and educational impacts of grades 6 - 12 environmental education, with special attention to environmental service-learning throughout Portland, Oregon. Ecological impacts considered restoration and conservation outcomes of several environmental service-learning programs including plant communities, soils, litter removal and trail maintenance. Educational outcomes considered aspects of environmental literacy including locus of control, environmental sensitivity, indicated environmentally responsible behaviors, investigating environmental issues and knowledge of physical systems. The relative influence of some significant life experiences on youths 2 Ì† 7 response to environmental education, including environmental service-learning, was also considered. Telephone surveys were used to gather data from 22 Portland metropolitan area environmental education programs. Data included 2014 annual biophysical impacts (e. g., area of invasive species removed, pounds of litter removed) and information on programming (e. g., length of program,...|$|E
40|$|In this study, I {{examine the}} {{arguments}} of instruction for responsible environmental behavior (REB) in environmental education in the U. S. A. The following subjects are considered : 1. Relationships between REB and other environmental education goals It is widely thought that REB is {{the ultimate goal of}} environmental education, and that REB is achieved in parallel with other environmental education goals. 2. Relationships between REB and contributing factors Many studies of contributing factors of REB found some major factors, such as environmental sensitivity, locus of control and knowledge of action strategies. On the other hand, criticism of these studies exists. 3. Contents of REB found in excellent curriculums in the U. S. A. REB is to be categorized by persuasion, consumerism, political action, and <b>ecomanagement.</b> I review strategies for promoting these categories of REB. 4. Relationships between REB and education reform. In the environmental education community, REB is thought of as an effective tool for education reform. Finally, I make some suggestions pertaining to environmental education in Japan...|$|E
40|$|The first {{industry}} standard for environmental management systems, BS 7750, {{was published in}} the UK in September 1994. Since then we have seen the EC <b>Ecomanagement</b> and Audit Scheme come into force in April 1995 and an international environmental management system standard, ISO 14001, published in September 1996. The EMS standards allow organisations to have their environmental management systems externally assessed and approved. The first companies became registered to BS 7750 in April 1995, with approximately 70 organisations gaining certification during its first year of operation. Since then uptake of the standards has been steady but slow with many companies delaying their decision until the implications of adopting such a recognised approach have been clarified. This research reviews the experiences of organisations adopting the standards during their early years of operation. Key lessons are learnt from a three year Teaching Company Scheme project designing and implementing an EMS for a large chemical manufacturer. The author also draws on evidence obtained through a survey of organisations gaining BS 7750 certification during its first year of operation and a number of detailed case-studies. The aim of the research is to identify and assess the implications for industry of the EMS standards. Their impacts on business performance in terms of operational efficiency, competitive advantage, legislative compliance, public image and staff morale are assessed and their variability between organisations explained. The resource commitments required to achieve certification are identified including management time, capital expenditure, consultancy fees and certification charges. Accounting mechanisms for comparing the costs and income associated with environmental activities are reviewed and their applicability to monitoring the performance of an EMS evaluated. The research concludes with the identification of decision making criteria to assist companies in determining their environmental strategy...|$|E

To meet these new challenges, the World Health Organization recommends reinforcing the adaptive capacity of health systems. One of the possible avenues in this respect is to promote awareness and knowledge translation in climatic health, at both the local and global scales. Within such perspective, two major themes have emerged {{in the field of}} public health research: 1) the development of advanced training adapted to &# 39;global environment&# 39; change and to the specific needs of various groups of actors (doctors, nurses, public health practitioners, health care managers, public service managers, local communities, etc) and 2) the development of strategies for implementing research results and applying various types of evidence to the management of public health issues affected by climate change. Progress on these two fronts will depend on maximum innovation in transdisciplinary and transsectoral collaborations. The general {{purpose of this article is}} to present the program of a new research and learning chair designed for this double set of developmental objectives &ndash; a chair that emphasizes &# 39;innoversity&# 39; (the dynamic relationship between innovation and diversity) and &# 39;transfrontier ecolearning for adaptive actions&# 39;. The &Eacute;coapprentissages, sant&eacute; mentale et climat collaborative research chair (University of Montreal and Quebec National Public Health Institute) based in Montreal is a center for &# 39;transdisciplinary research&# 39; on the transfrontier knowledge-for-action that can aid adaptation of the public health sector, the public mental health sector, and the public service sector to climate change, as well as a center for complex collaborations on evidence-based climatic health &# 39;training&# 39;. This program-focused article comprises two main sections. The first section presents the &# 39;general&# 39; and &# 39;specific contexts&# 39; in which the chair emerged. The &# 39;general context&# 39; pertains to the health-related challenge of finding ways to integrate, transfer, and implement knowledge, a particularly pointed challenge in Canada. The &# 39;specific context&# 39; refers to the emerging research field of adaptation of public health to climate change. In the second section, the characteristics of the research chair are more extensively detailed (the vision of &# 39;innoversity&# 39; and &# 39;transfrontier knowledge-for-action,&# 39; the approach of shared responsibility and complex collaboration, objectives, and major axes of research). We conclude with a call for complex collaboration toward knowledge-for-action in public health services/mental health services/public services&# 39; adaptation to climate change: this call is aimed at individual and institutional actors in the North and South/West and East concerned by these issues.
