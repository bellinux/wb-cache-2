It was found that the maximum decrease in water permeability of TBTCl-exposed fish occurred after 14 days; thereafter there was an increase towards control values. However, there was a differential reduction of the diffusional (Pd) and osmotic (Pos) permeability coefficients, where the former decreased more rapidly than the latter, reflecting the reduction of diffusional membrane permeability and the increasing importance of osmotic permeability. In fish exposed to TBTCl sodium efflux and drinking rates were significantly increased but Na+/K+-ATPase activities and urine production rates were not affected. The effects of TBTCl exposure are also manifested at the level of the whole organism by a reduction in the increase of the body length of exposed fish, when compared to controls.

Site was only a significant factor for Cd which was higher in fish from Hinkley. Correlation between the individual concentration of MT and each metal alone, or in combination, was poor, and explained only an additional 3. 0 % of the residual variation in MT, most of which was attributable to Cu (2. 7 %). Compared to other industrialised estuaries, Cd concentrations were high (> 20 μg g− 1 in some individuals).

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} was to describe and model varia- tion patterns in individual fish responses to contaminants among estuaries, season and gender. Two hundred twenty- seven adult <b>European</b> <b>flounders</b> were collected in two sea- sons (winter and summer) in four estuaries along the Bay of Biscay (South West France), focusing on a pristine system (the Ster), vs. three estuaries displaying contrasted levels of contaminants (the Vilaine, Loire and Gironde). Twenty-three variables were measured by fish, considering the load of contaminants (liver metals, liver and muscle persistent organic pollutants, muscle polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons); the gene expression (Cyt C oxydase, ATPase, BHMT, Cyt P 450 1 A 1, ferritin); the blood genotoxicity (Comet test); and liver histology (foci of cellular alteration-tumour, steatosis, inflammation, abnormal glycogen storage). Ca- nonical redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to model these variables using gender, season and estuary of origin as explanatory variables. The results underlined the homo- geneity of fish responses within the pristine site (Ster) and more important seasonal variability within the three contam- inated systems. The complete model RDA was significant and explained 35 % of total variance. Estuary and season respectively explained 30 and 5 % of the total independent variation components, whilst gender {{was not a significant}} factor. The first axis of the RDA explains nearly 27 % of the total variance and mostly represents a gradient of contami- nation.

Radiotracers were used to measure hydromineral fluxes, the water balance and passive sodium efflux of chronically (35 days) exposed fish. The water permeabilities of exposed flounders varied {{during the course of}} the experiment and were significantly lower than the corresponding controls, that did not change significantly with time. It was found that the maximum change in water permeability of TBTCl- and TPhTClexposed fish occurred after 14 days and 21 days, respectively; thereafter there was an increase towards control values, suggesting adaptation to compensate for the effects of the organotin exposure. Drinking rates increased significantly in both organotin groups but urine production rates did not change. The effects of organotin exposure on the passive sodium efflux and Na+/K+-ATPase activity showed an inverted relationship in the TBT group, where the Na 7 K+-ATPase activity was reduced and the passive sodium efflux was increased. TPhT had no inhibitory effect on Na 7 K+-ATPase activity and the passive sodium efflux increased only gradually. The overall effect of these changes in these components of hydromineral regulation was to reduce the mean blood osmolalities of the organotin groups compared to the control values. The effects of chronic exposure to sediment-associated triorganotin compounds during sea water adaptation was examined and quantified by measuring the active sodium efflux, Na+/K+-ATPase activity and structural changes to the gill epithelium usually encountered in euryhaline fish during adaptation to sea water. Following the transfer to sea water, the Na+/K+-ATPase activity and the active sodium efflux were decreased in the TBT group but increased significantly in both the TPhT and control groups. Similarly, the morphological changes to the gill epithelium, involving chloride cell distribution, associated with sea water adaptation, took place in the control group and only partially in the TPhT group but were significantly inhibited or delayed in the TBT group. The exposure to organotin caused the mean blood osmolalities in fish of the TBT and TPhT to rise beyond the expected values that were observed in the control group. The results presented in this study lead to the conclusion that tri-tt-butyltin chloride and triphenyltin chloride in sediments are capable of significantly disrupting both the physiological as well as morphological components of osmoregulatory functions of an estuarine fish, at concentrations currently found in local sediments...|$|R

40|$|Fish have {{problems}} passing the Afsluitdijk Dam {{that separates the}} Wadden Sea from Lake IJsselmeer. To re-establish the connectivity and thereby allow fish to pass there is an initiative to build a fishway, the Fish Migration River (FMR), at the Konwerderzand sluice complex. This report proposes a monitoring program to evaluate the functionality of the FMR, but also to monitor passage possibilities through the existing sluices. The goals of the monitoring plan are to estimate 1) The overall passage past the Afsluitdijk dam to and from Lake IJsselmeer, 2) The attraction efficiency, 3) The passage efficiency, and 4) The use of the FMR as habitat and for acclimatization for the transition into freshwater. We present an overview of previous and ongoing monitoring {{in the area to}} establish the current state of knowledge. The report also includes a presentation of available and suitable methods for a future monitoring program considering the broad spectra of target fish species, and their abundances. The proposed program includes a description of study design and available techniques and cost-estimates of the monitoring program. The proposed program will target ten species: <b>European</b> eel (aal), <b>flounder</b> (bot), three-spined stickleback (dreidoornige stekelbaars), twait shad (fint), North Sea houting (houting), river lamprey (rieverprik), smelt (spiering), Atlantic salmon (zalm), brown trout (forel) and sea lamprey (zeeprik). The monitoring program includes plans for how to capture, tag and track the study fish using the most suitable tagging techniques. Furthermore, the most optimal sites for installation of automatic data detection stations are identified. The total cost for the proposed project is 3. 5 M€ and covers both investments in equipment and costs for personnel. However, if costs for investments in techniques such as RFId-stations and fish counters are excluded, the total cost is reduced to 1 M€ for a program running two years before and four years after the completion of the FMR. The program is considered sufficient to evaluate the FMR at Kornwerederzand from the most important perspectives: the overall passage efficiency {{and the use of the}} FMR as habitat. It should be noted that this report is the first step towards a full-scale monitoring program, giving insight into possible methods, study design and associated costs. The next important step will be to develop the program in more detail and to start the initial phase of the monitoring project. We predict that such activities will identify the need for, and the relevance of, a more extensive monitoring program to study the effects of the FMR on a population level and on a large geographical scale.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> leaves {{freshwater}} in {{the autumn}} and can often be caught in estuaries when the first frosts occur. Then the fish move into deeper water for the winter. In the spring it migrates to the spawning grounds, travelling at three to four miles (five to seven kilometres) per day and not eating en route. Spawning takes place between February and May being later in more northerly latitudes. The female liberates about a million eggs which are lighter than water. The male liberates sperm which also floats and both eggs and sperm rise to the surface. Here the eggs are fertilised and hatch after six to eleven days depending on the water temperature. The developing larvae are planktonic and drift towards the coast with juvenile flounders living in shallow waters and estuaries. Young flounders become mature when still small, the males when they measure 11.5 cm and the females when they measure 18 cm. The <b>European</b> <b>flounder</b> sometimes hybridises with European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and, particularly in the western Baltic Sea, the hybrid is common.|$|E
