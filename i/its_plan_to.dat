5|$|After its {{announcement}} in 1995, the project stalled because P Associates {{was unable to}} find investors to finance the project. Investors were skeptical that luxury residential apartments outside the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City could be successful. The delay allowed another developer to announce an agreement to acquire the property. In March 1999, Chicago-based developer the Barton Group announced <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> build a 37-story, 322-unit luxury residential tower. The Barton Group's plan would also incorporate the PSFS headquarters building and York Row into the tower.|$|E
5|$|Many {{analysts and}} the media {{suggested}} that Malaysia Airlines would need to rebrand and repair its image and/or require government assistance to return to profitability. The loss of Flight 17 in July greatly exacerbated Malaysia Airline's financial problems. The combined effect on consumer confidence {{of the loss of}} Flight 370 and Flight 17; and the airline's poor financial performance; led Khazanah Nasional—the majority shareholder (69.37 percent) and a Malaysian state-run investment arm—to announce on 8 August <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> purchase the remainder of the airline, thereby renationalising it.|$|E
5|$|Starting from December 2007, the {{organization}} demanded that CBS cancel <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> rebroadcast an edited {{version of the}} Showtime drama Dexter, whose title character was a serial killer and police forensics analyst, because it felt that the program would glorify murder even with the edits. By early February 2008, the Council claimed to have collected 17,000 complaints to CBS.|$|E

5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a fait accompli. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 the Malvern Hills District Council {{appointed}} a Malvern Spa Water Strategy Working Group. Independently, in June 1996, sculptor Rose Garrard proposed to the MHDC {{the creation of}} a sculpture trail by nationally known sculptors, placed at forgotten springs around the town centre. The council began with the installation of new water features as part of <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> beautify the town centre. In 1997 the District Council implemented a Spring Water Arts Project to map water sources around the hills. Garrard undertook a two-month artist's residency and collaborated with the public, who provided locations of over two hundred water sources. Garrard was commissioned to create the drinking spout, Malvhina, which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.|$|E

In February 2017, HM Treasury and the European Commission reached a provisional agreement in which RBS {{would be able to}} retain the Williams & Glyn assets in return for investing £750 million into a fund aimed at increasing SME lending by challenger banks and for RBS agreeing to allow SME customers of challenger banks to use its branch network for cash and cheque handling. The European Commission confirmed in April 2017 that it would scrutinise the proposal.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, 2003, the St. Joseph Valley Parkway freeway {{carrying}} US31 {{was completed}} from northwest of Berrien Springs (exit15) to Napier Avenue near Benton Harbor (exit24). The former section of M-139 replaced by US31 {{was once again}} designated M-139, with M-139 extending further along the former US31 to the freeway's exit15. In 2008, M-139 was planned to extend southerly to end at Main Street (Business US12, Bus. US12) in Niles along the unsigned state trunkline OLDUS31 and Bus. US31, but after the City of Niles announced <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> take over maintenance of the section of East Main Street between Front Street/Bus. US31 and Fifth Street/M-51 in order to ban trucks, the plan was revised to extend M-139 further south, replacing the Bus. US12 designation southwesterly to US12. The extension was executed on March 5, 2010, prior to route marker installation.|$|E
5|$|The JNA, {{warned about}} {{reinforcements}} to the 137th Infantry Brigade, abandoned <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> advance to Barilović. It reoriented {{its efforts to}} reach the Korana Bridge {{in the village of}} Malići, down the road from Gornji Velemerić and Carevo Selo (where its tanks were stopped the day before). The battle resumed in the morning when JNA tanks (supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and multiple rocket launchers) broke through positions held by the 2nd Guards Brigade at 1:00p.m., reaching Carevo Selo before they were stopped again by the HV. Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Brigade arrived from Zagreb to Duga Resa and were attached to the 137th Infantry Brigade. One company of the battalion was deployed to Vinica Hill, and a second was deployed west of Carevo Selo (where it relieved troops from the 2nd Guards Brigade).|$|E

5|$|The cavalry {{continued}} with <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> attack. Paxton sent the regiment's advance guard, led by Major Powell, {{down the mountain}} to scout the rebel camps in Sinking Creek Valley. Each man in the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry's 22-man advance guard was armed with two six-shot revolvers and a saber. The advance guard discovered that the rebels in the first camp were focused on staying warm, and many did not have their one-shot muskets loaded. Powell and his advance guard {{decided to try to}} capture the camp by themselves, and were successful in persuading a 500-man rebel camp to surrender. Rebel weapons were destroyed, and over 100 prisoners on horses were brought up the mountain to the remaining portion of the regiment. Union casualties in the raid were 2 horses killed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2015, Chabad Lubavitch {{purchased}} a building previously {{owned by the}} Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road {{in the village of}} Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue. In June 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church announced <b>its</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> close on July 5, after 175 years in operation. A new community center was in development since as late as 2013. The part of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library building that formerly housed the library was renovated to serve as the community center, with a completion date of 2016 and cost of $1,800,000. On December 12, 2015, the Law Park pavilion was damaged in a large fire described as arson; around 100 firefighters in multiple departments assisted to put out the fire that night. Damage to the structure was almost entirely confined to its upper level. The village government hired RGR Landscape to restore and improve the structure, reopening it on Memorial Day in 2017. Insurance covered the reconstruction, which retained the building's architectural style, and included a new concession area, an upper terrace with 280 donor-engraved bricks, bathrooms and walkways for ADA compliance, new lighting, and fire suppression and security systems. The village also planted new trees and shrubs replacing fire-damaged foliage.|$|E
