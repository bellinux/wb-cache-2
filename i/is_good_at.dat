5|$|Gilberto <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> {{helping to}} defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E
5|$|According to the Old Book of Tang, Tong Yabghu's reign {{was once}} {{considered}} as {{the golden age}} of Western Göktürk Khaganate:Tong Yehu Kaghan is a man of bravery and astuteness. He <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> art of war. Thus he controlled Tiele tribes to the north, confronted Persia to the west, connected with Kasmira (nowadays Kashmir) to the south. All countries are subjected to him. He controlled ten thousands of men with arrow and bow, establishing his power over the western region. He occupied the land of Wusun and moved his tent to Qianquan north of Tashkent. All of the princes of western region assumed the Turk office of Jielifa. Tong Yehu Kaghan also sent a Tutun to monitor them for imposition. The power of Western Turks had never reached such a state before".|$|E
5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique {{at the age of}} 19 is something rare. I can recall only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E

5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

However, in the last decades it has become popular for goalkeepers to take that role instead. A sweeping goalkeeper <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> reading the game, and prevents scoring opportunities by clearing passes and crosses outside of the goal area without the use of his hands. Manuel Neuer has often been described as a sweeper-keeper.|$|E

25|$|Type not trait: The MBTI sorts for type; it {{does not}} {{indicate}} the strength of ability. It allows the clarity of a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers introversion), but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as 16PF. Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI is that people fundamentally prefer one thing over the other, not a bit of both.|$|E

25|$|From this, he {{constructed}} phylogenetic {{trees that}} showed genetic distances diagrammatically. His team also performed principal component analyses, which <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> analysing multivariate data with minimal loss of information. The {{information that is}} lost can be partly restored by generating a second principal component, and so on. In turn, the information from each individual principal component (PC) can be presented graphically in synthetic maps. These maps show peaks and troughs, which represent populations whose gene frequencies take extreme values compared {{to others in the}} studied area.|$|E
25|$|XML {{has been}} used to {{describe}} structured data and to serialize objects. Various XML-based protocols exist to represent the same kind of data structures as JSON for the same kind of data interchange purposes. Data can be encoded in XML several ways. The most expansive form using tag pairs results in a much larger representation than JSON, but if data is stored in attributes and 'short tag' form where the closing tag is replaced with '/>', the representation is often about the same size as JSON or just a little larger. If the data is compressed using an algorithm like gzip, there is little difference because compression <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> saving space when a pattern is repeated.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{power in}} Japan has been {{expanding}} {{since the late}} 1990s. The country is a leading manufacturer of solar panels {{and is in the}} top 5 ranking for countries with the most solar photovoltaics (PV) installed. In 2009 Japan had the third largest solar capacity in the world (behind Germany and Spain), with most of it grid connected. The solar insolation <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> about 4.3 to 4.8 kWh/(m²·day). Japan is the world's fourth largest energy consumer, making solar power an important national project. By the end of 2012, Japan had installed 7,000 MW of photovoltaics, enough to generate 0.77% of Japan's electricity. Due to the new feed-in tariff (FIT), Japan installed more than 5,000 MW in 2013.|$|E

Angie <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> putting on a front for the customers, dressing to kill, screeching outrageously with the girls, but inside she is a mess.

25|$|The {{human eye}} <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> seeing small {{differences}} in brightness over {{a relatively large}} area, but not so good at distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency brightness variation. This allows one to greatly {{reduce the amount of}} information in the high frequency components. This is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component, and then rounding to the nearest integer. This rounding operation is the only lossy operation in the whole process (other than chroma subsampling) if the DCT computation is performed with sufficiently high precision. As a result of this, it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero, and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers, which take many fewer bits to represent.|$|E
25|$|Rosemary Basson {{proposed}} an alternative model of sexual response. She {{argues that the}} linear model <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> explaining men's sexual response but it poorly explains women's sexual responses; thus, she puts forth a circular model. She states that closeness or attachment to a partner increases the effectiveness of sexual stimulation. This leads to enhanced sexual arousal, which may ultimately result in orgasm. Consequently, this positive sexual arousal continues the sexual desire that women feel, and this desire increases intimacy with the partner. Other researchers have attempted to evaluate women's sexual functioning {{in terms of this}} new model but have found contradictory results. In one study conducted by Giles and McCabe, they found that the linear model of sexual response was a good predictor of women's sexual functioning (and dysfunction), while the circular model was a poor predictor. Once they modified the pathways of the model, the circular model then became a good predictor of sexual functioning. In another study looking at Malaysian women, researchers found that the circular model was actually a good predictor of women's sexual desire and arousal. More research {{needs to be done in}} this area to show whether the circular model more accurately describes women's sexual response.|$|E
