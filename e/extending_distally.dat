An association between lipodystrophy and renal disease is recognized; {{it is possible}} that there is also an association between lipodystrophy and pancreatitis, and eosino-philia with or without an intestinal lesion may be a further association. Partial lipodystrophy is an unusual condition of unknown aetiology, sometimes familial, primarily affecting young females. There is progressive loss of fat from the subcutaneous tissues, usually starting in the face and gradually <b>extending</b> <b>distally</b> {{to the level of the}} knees.

The distal part was removed with a special longitudinal osteotomy through the anterior cortex <b>extending</b> <b>distally</b> for 10 cm. It was then followed by a transversal osteotomy 2 cm below the tip of the femoral stump to allow enough space for two locking pliers. Simultaneously using a lamina spreader on the distal part, the broken stem was extracted while hammering on two locking pliers. [...] - CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple and easy technique for the removal of a broken femoral stem that can be applied to all kinds of femoral stems and intramedullary nails regardless of their cross section.

40|$|Four {{patients}} with intraluminal diverticulum of the duodenum are presented and {{compared with those}} reported previously. This lesion is a rare congenital disorder that usually becomes symptomatic in adult life.

40|$|ObjectivesTo analyze {{computed}} tomography (CT) imaging features of isolated dissection {{of the superior}} mesenteric artery (SMA). MethodsThe imaging findings of 20 consecutive patients with isolated dissection of the SMA were retrospectively evaluated and categorized {{according to a new}} imaging classification: Type A, dissections localized at the curved part of the SMA and extended proximally; Type B, dissections limited to the curved part; Type C or D, dissections localized at the curved part and <b>extended</b> <b>distally</b> without or with involved ileocolic or distal ileal arteries. The relationship between classification and symptoms and treatment effect is discussed, and prior reported cases where CT images were available were classified and analyzed. ResultsThe dissections were around the curved part of the SMA in all 20 patients. In symptomatic patients, the true lumen was more stenosed, the dissection started nearer the SMA ostium, and the dissection was longer. The best effect of conservative treatment was achieved in Type B cases. When dissection <b>extended</b> <b>distally,</b> the effect progressively worsened from Type B to Type D.

40|$|Pulmonary {{embolism}} (PE) is {{a frequent}} diagnosis made in the emergency department and can present in many different ways. Abdominal pain is an unusual presenting symptom for PE. It is essential to maintain {{a high degree of}} suspicion in these patients, as a delay in diagnosis can be devastating for the patient and confers a high risk of mortality if left untreated. Here, we report the case of a 53 -year-old male who presented to the emergency department with worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain with fevers. Initial imaging was benign, although lab work showed worsening leukocytosis and bilirubin. Abdominal pathology seemed most likely, but the team kept PE on the differential. Further imaging revealed acute pulmonary embolus in the segmental branch of the right lower lobe <b>extending</b> <b>distally</b> into subsegmental branches. The patient was started on anticoagulation and improved drastically. This case highlights the necessity of keeping a broad differential and maintaining a systematic approach when dealing with nonspecific complaints. Furthermore, a discussion on the pathophysiology on why PE can present atypically as abdominal pain, as well as fevers, is reviewed. Using this information can hopefully lead to a subtle diagnosis of PE in the future and lead to a life-saving diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Simultaneous {{bilateral}} rupture of {{the distal}} biceps tendon {{is a rare}} clinical entity, seldom {{reported in the literature}} and with unclear therapeutic setting. The authors report the case of a 39 -year-old white man who suffered a simultaneous bilateral rupture while working out. When weightlifting with elbows at 90 ° of flexion, he suddenly felt pain on the anterior aspect of the arms, coming for evaluation after two days. He presented bulging contour of the biceps muscle belly and ecchymosis in the antecubital fossa, <b>extending</b> <b>distally</b> to the medial aspect of the forearm, as well as a marked decrease of supination strength and pain in active elbow flexion. MRI confirmed the rupture with retraction of the distal biceps bilaterally. The authors opted for performing the tendon repairs simultaneously through the double incision technique and fixation to the bicipital tuberosity with anchors. The patient progressed quite well, with full return to labor and sports activities, being satisfied with the result after two years of surgery. In the literature search, few reports of simultaneous bilateral rupture of the distal biceps were retrieved, with only one treated in the acute phase of injury. Therefore, the authors consider this procedure to be a good option to solve this complex condition...|$|E

40|$|Among bony fishes, the ontogenetic {{sequence}} {{by which}} the actinopterygian scapulocoracoid develops has been well described, but that of the sarcopterygian scapulocoracoid is poorly known, as the majority of taxa are only known from fossils. To rectify this, the cartilaginous scapulocoracoid of the extant lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri is examined. In initial stages of its development, the scapulocoracoid of Neoceratodus has a simple rounded shape, and supports the glenoid fossa. It appears nearly contemporaneously with the proximal endochondral element (humerus) of the pectoral fin. Pectoral fin elements develop by segmentation from a continuous field of cartilaginous precursor cells <b>extending</b> <b>distally</b> from the glenoid region of the scapulocoracoid. Subsequent scapulocoracoid development produces a ventromedial process, which is not associated with this field of precursor cells. A dorsal process also develops outside this field. Thus, the scapulocoracoid of Neoceratodus may consist {{of at least two}} developmentally distinct regions; (1) the ventromedial being homologous with the coracoid of actinopterygians, tetrapods and other jawed vertebrates and (2) a smaller dorsal process, homologous to the scapular region. The two, together with the glenoid region, give an overall triangular shape. The scapulocoracoids of fossil lungfish and other sarcopterygian fishes are also triangular and are composed of scapular and coracoid regions, rather than the 'buttresses' associated with scapulocoracoids of the Actinopterygii and Tetrapoda. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (Hunter syndrome, MPS II) is an X-linked {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{caused by}} the deficit of iduronate 2 -sulfatase (IDS), an enzyme involved in the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) degradation. We here report {{the case of a}} 9 -year-old boy who was diagnosed with an extremely severe form of MPS II at 10 months of age. Sequencing of the IDS gene revealed the deletion of exons 1 - 7, <b>extending</b> <b>distally</b> and removing the entire pseudogene IDSP 1. The difficulty to define the boundaries of the deletion and the particular severity of the patient phenotype suggested to verify the presence of pathological copy number variations (CNVs) in the genome, by the array CGH (aCGH) technology. The examination revealed the presence of two deletions alternate with two duplications, overall affecting a region of about 1. 2  Mb distally to IDS gene. This is the first complex rearrangement involving IDS and extending to a large region located distally to it described in a severe Hunter patient, as evidenced by the CNVs databases interrogated. The analysis of the genes involved in the rearrangement and of the disorders correlated with them did not help to clarify the phenotype observed in our patient, except for the deletion of the IDS gene, which explains per se the Hunter phenotype. However, this cannot exclude a potential "contiguous gene syndrome" as well as the future rising of additional pathological symptoms associated with the other extra genes involved in the identified rearrangement...|$|E
