5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted.

5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet.

5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that.
