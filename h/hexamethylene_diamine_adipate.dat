40|$|Background Occupational diisocyanate-induced {{extrinsic}} {{allergic alveolitis}} (EAA) is a rare and probably underestimated diagnosis. Two acute occupational EAA cases have been described in this context, but neither of them concerned hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) exposure. Aims To investigate {{the cause of a}} life-threatening EAA arising at work in a healthy 30 -year-old female paint quality controller. Methods Occupational medical assessment, workplace evaluation, airborne and biological monitoring and immunodermatological tests. Results Diagnosis of EAA relied on congruent clinical and radiological information, confirmed occupational HDI exposure and positive IgG antibodies and patch tests. The patient worked in a small laboratory for 7 years, only occasionally using HDI-containing hardeners. While working with HDI for 6 h, she developed breathlessness, rapidly progressing to severe respiratory failure. Workplace HDI airborne exposure values ranged from undetectable levels to 4. 25 p. p. b. Biological monitoring of urinary <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> in co-workers ranged from < 1. 0 to 15. 4 μg/g creatinine. Patch tests 8 months later showed delayed skin reaction to HDI at 48 h. Subsequent skin biopsy showed spongiotic dermatitis with infiltration of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Conclusions We believe this is the first reported case of acute life-threatening EAA following exposure to HDI. Low concentrations of airborne HDI and relatively high urinary <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> suggest significant skin absorption of HDI could have significantly contributed to the development of this acute occupational EA...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Glutaraldehyde (GA) {{has been}} used as a {{representative}} method of tissue preservation in cardiovascular surgery. However, GA has showed limited durability including calcification, mechanical failure and toxicity. To overcome those unsolved problems, we analyzed the crosslinking differences of primary amines, GA and genipin in their mechanical and biochemical properties with a single or double crosslinking agent for clinical application. Materials and Methods: Samples were divided into 3 groups; control, single crosslinking fixation and double crosslinking fixation after decellurarization using bovine pericardium. For analysis of the biochemical and mechanical properties of each crosslinking method, tensile strength, percentage strain, thermal stability, resistance to pronase, nynhydrin and cytotoxicity test were studied. Results: Combined <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> and suberic acid in the carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysucinimide solution (EDC/NHS) after decellurarization, tensile strength and strain percentage were not statistically significant compared to the single crosslinking treated groups (p> 0. 05). Tissue crosslinking stability was weak in single treatment of diphenylphosphoryl azide, suberic acid, low concentration of EDC, <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> and procyanidin groups, but thermal stability and resistance to the pronase and ninhydrin were markedly increased in concentrated EDC/NHS or after combined double treatment with low concentration of GA or genipin (p< 0. 001).

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of cationized serum albumin on the canine renal membrane adenylate cyclase in the basal state and when stimulated with guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, PTH or NaF. Human albumin was cationized to an isoelectric point greater than 9. 5 by the addition of <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine.</b> Cationized albumin increased basal and stimulated cAMP production by the membranes and increased the sensitivity of the system to low doses of PTH (0. 25 pmol/l), being usually inactive in buffer alone or in human serum albumin. These observations are comparable to those previously reported on thyroid membranes and cells from adrenal tumours and confirm that positively charged macromolecules can increase adenylate cyclase activity. A decrease in non-specific binding of PTH is only partly responsible for the increased sensitivity to the hormone. Though this increase in sensitivity is small, it could nevertheless be useful in the detection of biologically active PTH after extraction from the serum. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{develop a}} method for the {{measurement}} of a metabolite of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), an isocyanate, {{and use it to}} assess the exposure of sprayers employed in motor vehicle repair shops. METHODS: Urine samples were taken from sprayers wearing personal protective equipment and spraying in booths or with local exhaust ventilation, from bystanders, and from unexposed subjects. Samples were analyzed for a metabolite of HDI, <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> (HDA), by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: HDA was detected in four sprayers and one bystander out of 22 workers. No HDA was detected in the urine of unexposed subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to isocyanates still occurs despite the use of personal protective equipment and the use of a booth or extracted space. Health surveillance is likely to be required to provide feedback on the adequacy of controls even if such precautions are used and to identify cases of early asthma.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} bisester-oligoamides segments with varying segment length {{that can be}} used in segmented block copolymers were studied. The bisester-oligoamides segments were made form diamines and terephthalate or isophthalate esters. The diamines used were p-xylylene diamine, m-xylylene <b>diamine</b> and <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine.</b> The esters used are dimethyl terephthalate, diphenyl terephthalate, dimethyl isophthalate and diphenyl isophthalate. Uniform bisester-diamide, bisester-(tetra-amides) and bisester-(hexa-amide) segments were synthesized in steps and characterized by 1 H NMR, MALDI-TOF and DSC. The uniformity of these segments was studied by MALDI-TOF. With the uniform amide segments and polypropylene oxide segments, block copolymers were prepared by high temperature melt polymerization. The amide segment length distribution, which is susceptible to randomization was studied. The analysis of the amide segment distribution after hydrolysis of the ester-linkage groups was by MALDI-TOF. The amide segments were found to have the same narrow distribution as the starting bisester-oligoamide, which strongly supports the fact that randomization of the amide segments during melt polymerization does not take place. The uniformity of the amide segments is, therefore, preserved during high temperature melt polymerization...|$|R

40|$|A {{chemical}} {{procedure was}} developed to functional-ize poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates. PMMA is reacted with <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> to yield an aminated surface for immobilizing DNA in microarrays. The density of primary NH 2 groups was 0. 29 nmol/cm 2. The availability of these primary amines was con®rmed by the immobilization of DNA probes and hybridization with a complementary DNA strand. The hybridization signal and the hybridization ef®ciency of the chemically aminated PMMA slides were comparable to the hybridization signal and the hybridization ef®ciency obtained from differently chemically modi®ed PMMA slides, silanized glass, commercial silylated glass and commercial plastic Euray slides. Immobilized and hybridized densities of 10 and 0. 75 pmol/cm 2, respectively, were observed for microarrays on chemically aminated PMMA. The immobilized probes were heat stable since the hybridization per-formance of microarrays subjected to 20 PCR heat cycles was only reduced by 4 %. In conclusion, this new strategy to modify PMMA provides a robust procedure to immobilize DNA, {{which is a very}} useful substrate for fabricating single use diagnostics devices with integrated functions, like sample preparation, treatment and detection using microfabrication and microelectronic techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} cationized serum albumin on the resorptive {{response}} to PTH and other agents {{were examined in}} organ cultures of fetal rat long bones. Human serum albumin (HSA) was cationized to an isoelectric point greater than 9. 5 by addition of <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine.</b> When cationized albumin (C-HSA) replaced HSA or BSA in the medium, resorption could be stimulated by 10 - to 30 -fold lower concentrations of synthetic (1 - 34) human or bovine PTH or intact 1 - 84 bovine PTH. Using C-HSA, significant resorption was obtained in some experiments with the concentration of PTH as low as 25 pM, but in most experiments 100 pM- 400 pM concentrations were required. In contrast, 6. 25 nM 1 - 34 PTH was required for a response in HSA. The sensitivity to stimulation of resorption by 1, 25 -dihydroxy-vitamin D and prostaglandin E 2 was not increased. Hence, the increased sensitivity to PTH is most likely due to a selective protective effect of C-HSA, which might decrease nonspecific binding or degradation of the hormone.

50|$|The {{nylon rope}} trick {{typically}} {{makes use of}} a water solution of an aliphatic diamine with a solution of an aliphatic diacid chloride in a solvent that does not dissolve in water, yielding a synthetic polyamide of the nylon-type. Nylon 610 is commonly used, in which <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>diamine</b> is dissolved in water to a concentration of about 0.40 moles / deciliter. A solution of sebacoyl chloride in cyclohexane (0.15 moles / deciliter concentration) is then layered {{on top of the}} water solution, the reaction typically being conducted in a beaker. The solution is not agitated; instead the nylon 610 polymer forms as a flexible film at the interface of the water and cyclohexane layers, in an example of an interfacial polymerization. The experimentalist grasps the polymer film, withdrawing it from the reaction vessel, forming a filament or rope, and collecting it on a rotating rod above the reaction vessel. New polymer forms at the interface as fresh surfaces of the cyclohexane layer and the water layer form. In this way, the demonstration yields a continuous rope that is collected on the rotating rod. Nylon 66 can also be produced at laboratory scale in this way.|$|R
