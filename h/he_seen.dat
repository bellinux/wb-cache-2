500|$|Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk spoke less enthusiastically {{about the}} film, but {{felt that it}} was a good Spaghetti Western nonetheless. Although praising the locations, as well as the {{performances}} of Kinski and Trintignant, Morricone's score, the realistic approach to the story and Silvano Ippoliti's cinematography, he felt that the characterizations were lacking, adding that Corbucci's direction often [...] "drifts and falters" [...] and lacks the [...] "operatic grandeur" [...] of Leone's films. Erickson also expressed that the film's ending was unsurprising given the nihilistic nature of the rest of the film, but noted that he would have been more shocked by it had <b>he</b> <b>seen</b> the film upon its 1968 theatrical release.|$|E

2500|$|Aspinall {{finally agreed}} to direct the company on a {{temporary}} basis, simply so that someone would finally be in charge. When, in 1969, the Beatles engaged Klein as their manager, he also inherited the chairmanship of Apple Corps, which led to an immediate streamlining of company affairs: [...] "Overnight, glib lack of concern deferred to pointed questions," [...] wrote Clayson & Leigh. [...] "Which typist rings Canberra every afternoon? Why has so-and-so given himself a raise of 60 pounds a week? Why is <b>he</b> <b>seen</b> only on payday? Suddenly, lunch meant beans-on-toast in the office kitchen instead of Beluga caviar from Fortnum & Mason".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the papabile {{cardinals}} Giacomo Lercaro of Bologna and Giuseppe Siri of Genoa, Montini was {{not identified}} {{with either the}} left or right, nor was <b>he</b> <b>seen</b> as a radical reformer. He was viewed as most likely to continue the Second Vatican Council, which already, without any tangible results, had lasted longer than John XXIII anticipated. John had a vision but [...] "did not have a clear agenda. His rhetoric {{seems to have had}} a note of over-optimism, a confidence in progress, which was characteristic of the 1960s." [...] When John XXIII died of stomach cancer on 3 June 1963, this triggered a conclave to elect a new pope.|$|E
2500|$|Diệm, who {{was backed}} by the U.S. [...] was an Annamite, from Central Vietnam (although not the Central Highlands) in the South upon taking power. In seeking {{political}} support from Southerners, he {{was not nearly as}} visible as Bảo Đại, nor was <b>he</b> <b>seen</b> as sympathetic to Buddhism or the smaller minorities. Diệm had to create a viable alternative to the Viet Minh in those areas where the French had provided security, both the cities and towns, but also in pockets of the rural areas inhabited by people of the regional or [...] "folk" [...] religions, such as the Cao Đài. The existing upper class might be wealthy, but the French had found it was neither popular nor internally cohesive.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was while}} at his {{secondary}} school, the CMS Grammar School, Lagos, that his academic traits began to manifest. Not only was <b>he</b> <b>seen</b> to be gifted {{in mathematics and}} the sciences, he was comfortable also in the arts, becoming {{a member of the}} school's literary and debating society. It was during this period that he earned the nickname, [...] "Macbeth": William Shakespeare's famous play, Macbeth, was to be staged in the school. The lead actor took ill a week before, and so Ayodele was called upon to play the lead role in his stead. It is said that not only did Ayodele master his lines as lead actor, but also the entire play, such {{that he was able to}} prompt the cast whenever they forgot their lines.|$|E
2500|$|Of the 38 crew, {{there were}} three fatalities. The captain had {{suffered}} a heart attack and two crew members were reported lost when they jumped overboard after the torpedo hit. She was the first American ship to be torpedoed during World War I, although another ship, the Cushing, had been bombed shortly before, again by mistake because no American markings could be seen from what was then a somewhat novel air attack. The German government apologized for attacking Gulflight, but refused to change its strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare. A report by the British admiralty into the attack concluded that the German commander had behaved properly according to [...] "Cruiser rules" [...] defined in international law. A merchant ship under escort by military vessels forfeited any right to be warned before being attacked, so the patrol ships had made Gulflight a legitimate target by taking her under escort. As an American ship, the submarine would not have attacked had <b>he</b> <b>seen</b> her nationality, but apart from an ordinary flag Gulflight was not carrying any additional markings painted on the hull to make clear her nationality, which other ships were then doing. The report also suggested that the tanker being stopped and then slowed down by the accompanying patrol had made her an accessible target. The Admiralty report was not published at the time and official comment did not explain the circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} give a better insight in [...] "the humours and actions in a case" [...] marshal draws {{the image of the}} [...] "Goat" [...] in Long Lane as a windmill, saying that its {{functioning}} depends on gaming houses, bawdy-houses, receivers and thief-takers the same way as windmill's on four sails. All four of them are regulated by the thief-taker of course. Besides denouncing him as a protector of coiners, prostitutes, etc. Hitchen coins the name of the thief-maker for Wild, used to refer to him by others later. Through a fictional character's eyes, that is some countryman, Hitchen tries to give a panoramic view of the [...] "Goat" [...] with old thieves, spies, suspicious women, Lemon himself sitting in the corner filling remorse for betrayal. This portrayal is considered somewhat clumsy alongside the insertion of [...] "proclamation", a parody of Wild's advertisements, {{in the middle of the}} pamphlet. Here, Wild proclaimed as [...] "His Skittish and Baboonish Majesty", assures the thieves of himself to be better equipped for subverting the course of justice and offers his legal protection and higher financial terms compared to those of their older [...] "locks, fences and flash pawnbrokers". Hitchen finishes his treatise with the list of [...] "flash cases" [...] and Wild's [...] "weekly pensioners". The list of convicts awaiting transportation under the [...] "Transportation Act"(introduced as an alternative punishment to hanging) enables dating of the pamphlet between June to August. As for the publishers, they were Warner and B. Boreham, publishing Wild's responding pamphlet in May.(p.102-104, Howson)Wild's [...] "Answer" [...] was written anonymously and polished most likely by a hack for two guineas. He refers mostly to the years 1713-1714 for he had personal experience of marshals adventures and could not resist the temptation to describe them, including the scene [...] "in a Sodomitish Academy". As other dealings are mentioned while reviewing their partnership, it is more interesting to describe the event when the under-marshal took his assistant, a buckle-maker as Wild refers to himself in his pamphlet, to a house near Old Bailey one night. The buckle-maker, having never met the types marshal was too willing to see, followed him and to his great surprise discovered men talking and behaving in effeminate way. No less surprising appeared marshal's reaction on being referred to as [...] "your Ladyship" [...] or [...] "Madam", even more, he [...] "dallied with the young sparks with a great deal of pleasure". However, no sooner had <b>he</b> <b>seen</b> those who might have exposed his [...] "power of securing the lads to himself", he flew into a rage and threatened to [...] "spoil their diversion". Later that night, marshal lurked with several constables near Mother Clap's House in Fleet street, Holborn, knowing that a masquerade would be held as usual and he would be able to catch several sodomites dressed in woman's apparel, which he did. Next morning detainees stood before the Lord Mayor and were committed to workhouse, but before were ordered to walk through the streets on the way in their bizarre look:"Some were completely rigg'd in gowns, petticoats, head cloths, fine lac'd shoes, furbelow scarves, and masks. Some had riding hoods; some were dressed like shepherdesses, others like milkmaids with fine green hats..." [...] etc. Some time later they were released after Hitchen's application to the Lord Mayor having been threatened by one of them for his previous adventures with them. The experience appeared too humiliating for one of them and in few days he died after the release. Wild completes the narrating with recommending the under-marshal and his expertise to anyone interested in [...] "Sodomitish Academy".|$|E

6000|$|... 1. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> {{himself to}} be what others are ignorant of; that is, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> {{himself to be}} not only a sinful man, but a man by nature in the gall and bond of sin. In the gall of sin: it is Peter's {{expression}} to Simon, and it is a saying common to all men: for every man in a state of nature is in the gall of sin; he was shapen in it, conceived in it; it has also possession of, and by that possession infected the whole of his soul and body (Psa 51:5; Acts 8:23). This <b>he</b> <b>sees,</b> this <b>he</b> understands; every professor sees not this, because the blessing of a broken heart is not bestowed on every one. David says, 'There is no soundness in my flesh'; and Solomon suggest that a plague or running sore is in the very heart. But every one perceives not this (Psa 38:3; 1 Kings 8:38). He saith again, that his 'wounds stank, and were corrupted': that his 'sore ran, and ceased not' (Psa 38:5, 77:2). But these things the brutish man, the man whose heart was never broken, has no understanding of. But the broken-hearted, the man that has a broken spirit, <b>he</b> <b>sees,</b> as the prophet has it, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> his sickness, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> his wound: 'When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound'; <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> it to his grief, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> it to his sorrow (Hosea 5:13).|$|R
