5|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... is a Japanese {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus in 1994 for the Super Famicom. It is a spin-off from the Shin Megami Tensei series, itself {{part of the larger}} Megami Tensei franchise. Since release, it has been ported to mobile devices, the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, and re-released digitally through Nintendo's Virtual Console service. The story follows a student of Karukozaka High School after their school is sucked into the realm of demons by a vengeful student's demon summoning spell <b>going</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
25|$|I think {{global warming}} {{is an issue that}} is {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and a symptom of the shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> in the U.S. they are probably <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E

25|$|One major {{critique}} of youth empowerment {{is that most}} programs take a risk-focused approach. There {{has been a major}} emphasis on what is <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> for youth in their lives rather than what goes right. This portrays young people as a problem that need to be fixed, and displays the process of development as a process of overcoming risk. This may deter youth from joining youth development programs. The risked-based model can obscure the fact that adolescence is a time when young people master skills and concepts.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming {{then had}} a blast for Nottinghamshire. With {{everything}} <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> for Surrey, they just couldn't find any bite, conceded 26 runs off no-balls, and were penalised five runs for ball-tampering, while Fleming smashed 238 runs for his third double-century of his career. With partnerships of 150 runs or more with both Gallian and Australian David Hussey, all the Surrey bowlers were smashed, as Nottinghamshire eased their way to 580 for 4 at stumps on day 2 and eventually 692 for 7 declared. Despite Surrey batting with more composure in the second innings, surviving for 141 overs, the damage was done, and even a two-hour break for rain couldn't save them as they were bowled out for 404, Graeme Swann taking four for 94 with his off-spin while the former England batsman Mark Ramprakash scored his third century of the Championship season with a six-hour 107.|$|E
25|$|Rico {{appears as}} the main villain and {{antagonist}} in the 1995 Judge Dredd movie, in which Joe was played by Sylvester Stallone and Rico by Armand Assante. In this version, although they were cloned from identical DNA, they did not look the same. Rico was portrayed as a straightforward psychopath, having {{reached a point where}} he killed the innocent {{on the grounds that the}} division between guilt and innocence was merely a matter of timing and everyone would commit a crime in time. His deviant behavior was attributed to something <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> in his creation which made him the perfect criminal. They were both friends in school (Joe was unaware of their true kinship, but it is unclear when Rico learned about their connection), but when he became a murderer, Joe judged him and sentenced him to execution, and his death was faked to reassure the public and prevent the truth of the clone program coming to light.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} years of the García {{government}} gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better after so many years of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic to see the whole process unravel so quickly, once things started <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> again. The first sign of trouble came, as it often had, from the balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.|$|E
500|$|Shearsmith {{said that}} the episode's focus on a grandmother's {{birthday}} party felt [...] "domestic" [...] and [...] "homely". Pemberton, too, called it a [...] "domestic" [...] story, describing it as playing upon the classic British plot device of a family party <b>going</b> <b>wrong.</b> Shearsmith suggested that the pleasant house did give the episode {{the feel of a}} sitcom, but {{said that the}} story went somewhere [...] "darker" [...] than a typical sitcom would. With [...] "Nana's Party", the writers wanted to produce something [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "suburban", with Pemberton citing the playwright Alan Ayckbourn as an influence. Indeed, at the time the episode was written, Shearsmith was starring in an adaptation of Ayckbourn's play Absent Friends.|$|E

The song was written by series music producer Adam Anders with his wife Nikki Hassman, and writing partner Peer Åström. According to Anders the song was specifically crafted for Michele and was based on the storyline of Michele's character in the series, Rachel Berry. Anders told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lea’s storyline kind of inspired that song for me,” says Anders. [...] "Basically, you try to do everything right and you have good motivations with everything you’re doing but everything ends up <b>going</b> <b>wrong.</b> How many times will it take for me to get it right?" ...|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} [...] "Batman in Gotham" [...] design philosophy, Batman's {{arsenal of}} moves and actions were expanded. Although the team {{developed}} several ideas for new moves, gadgets and abilities, they only went forward with those that they felt would be authentic to Batman. They also chose to have Batman start the game {{with access to the}} gadgets unlocked in Arkham Asylum, to convey the impression that Batman is fully prepared for the inevitability of things <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> in Arkham City. The studio reviewed the play and combat systems used in Arkham Asylum, and built the new moves as natural extensions of the existing system as a means to [...] "add even more depth and gameplay instead of changing them fundamentally". The number of animations were doubled to reflect the larger arsenal of moves at the player's disposal. The X-ray-like [...] "Detective Vision" [...] mode used to highlight certain objects in-game was redeveloped for Arkham City because it was considered to be too useful in Arkham Asylum, resulting in some players using it throughout almost the entire game; the visual effect also obscured the game's design aesthetic. One idea was to introduce a time limit on its use, but it was considered that Batman [...] "wouldn't make a gadget like that". Instead, the mode was designed to be difficult to use in certain situations such as obscuring navigational information, and combat where enemy strikes will blur the screen when [...] "Detective Vision" [...] is active. Rocksteady art director David Hego described the new [...] "Detective Vision" [...] as an [...] "augmented reality mode".|$|E
500|$|Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter {{rated the}} matches {{out of five}} stars in his review of the event. He gave the main event 2 3/4 stars and {{discussed}} {{the amount of time}} it was given, stating it was [...] "just enough time for a suitable main event" [...] but that it did not [...] "leave much flex time for things to run past the bare minimum for a PPV main event title match in a cage much less do whatever they're going to do with Sting and Nash." [...] Keller also disapproved of unprotected use of weapons in the bout, commenting that TNA management needed to start fining [...] "wrestlers for taking unprotected chairshots to the skull" [...] because it was [...] "just not worth the long-term cumulative risks associated with blunt trauma to the skull over years of wrestling." [...] He gave the Last Man Standing bout 4 stars and said it was a [...] "superb match" [...] with a [...] "scaring finish" [...] since the [...] "potential for something <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> given Angle's legit neck problems was substantial" [...] even if [...] "everything was planned" [...] to work out that way. Keller rated the Street Fight 1 1/2 stars and stated it [...] "was pretty clunky late and early on the crowd brawling got a little repetitive" [...] and that it felt [...] "like yet another weapons match." [...] "The match was okay, but nothing more. The tuxedos and chain served as more of a circus-like distraction than a valuable prop for the match", said Keller in his coverage of the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match, which he gave 1 1/4 stars. Keller gave the World Tag Team Championship match 2 stars, but did not give his opinion outside the rating on the contest. He did comment on the X Division Championship match, saying it was a [...] "very good match" [...] and gave it 3 stars.|$|E
500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other notable Bond villains (Blofeld's cat and suit, Emilio Largo's eye patch), was upset that everything was <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didn't fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant sea sponge instead. A captive James Bond, portrayed by Phil Hartman, offered to get Zorin [...] "a good deal" [...] on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.|$|E
2500|$|Children {{differ from}} {{adolescents}} and adults in their interpretation {{and ability to}} express their experience. [...] Like adults, children experience physical symptoms including accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, nausea or stomach pain, dizziness or light-headedness. [...] In addition, children also experience cognitive symptoms like fear of dying, feelings of being detached from oneself, feelings of losing control or going crazy, but {{they are unable to}} vocalize these higher order manifestations of fear. [...] They simply know that something is <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> and that they are very afraid. Children can only describe the physical symptoms. They have not yet developed the constructs to put these symptoms together and label them as fear. Parents often feel helpless when they watch a child suffer. [...] They can help children give a name to their experience, and empower them to overcome the fear they are experiencing ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} Vernon, Florida, Morris {{tried unsuccessfully}} to get funding {{for a variety of}} projects. There was Road, a story about an interstate highway in Minnesota; a project about Robert Golka, the creator of laser-induced fireballs in Utah; and the story of Centralia, Pennsylvania, the coal town in which an inextinguishable subterranean fire ignited in 1962. He eventually got funding in 1983 to write a script about John and Jim Pardue, a pair of Missouri bank robbers who had killed their father and grandmother and robbed five banks. Morris's pitch went, [...] "The great bank-robbery sprees always take place at a time when something is <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> in the country. Bonnie and Clyde were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without the Depression as a back-drop. The Pardue brothers were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without Vietnam." [...] Morris wanted Tom Waits and Mickey Rourke to play the brothers, and he wrote the script, but the project eventually failed. Morris worked on writing scripts for various other projects, including a pair of ill-fated Stephen King adaptations.|$|E

Breakdown Britain was a 300,000 word document that analysed what was <b>going</b> <b>wrong</b> {{in the areas of}} Economic Dependence and Unemployment, Family Breakdown, Addiction, Educational Failure, Indebtedness, and the Voluntary Sector. Breakthrough Britain recommended almost two hundred policy ideas using broadly the same themes. On their website the group said that the Government has so far taken on sixteen of the recommendations, and the Conservatives twenty-nine. Of those twenty-nine, ten were unanimously rejected by the European Court of Justice, as they deemed the proposals [...] "unfit for a modern democracy" [...] and [...] "verging on frighteningly authoritarian". The ECJ's comments were dismissed by IDS, stating that there had been [...] "no such talks" [...] between them, and provoked attacks on the European Union by some members of the party.|$|E
