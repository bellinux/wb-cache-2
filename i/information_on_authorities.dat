40|$|Considering catalog as a {{communication}} channel between user and library collection, this paper aims {{to demonstrate the}} importance of authority control for objectives and functions of catalogs. The paper presents authority control and authority work definitions and introduces the objectives and functions of the catalog defined by Charles Ammi Cutter, Eva Verona, Ákos Domanovszky, Seymour Lubetzky and Elaine Svenonius, {{as well as those}} presented in Paris Principles, in Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and in Statement of International Cataloguing Principles. The findings expose that definitions of the objectives and functions of the catalog, elaborated and reviewed several times in history of cataloging, contain vestiges of finding and collocating objectives firstly defined by Charles Ammi Cutter, and such objectives requires authority control. This paper concludes that authority control is an important component for catalogs, since authority control assures the finding and collocating objectives achievement without the need of user knows about all names of entity sought. In the current digital <b>information</b> environments, studies <b>on</b> <b>authority</b> control obtain increasingly importance, because accuracy and disambiguation, characteristics enabled by authority control, are essentials.

40|$|The {{necessity}} for processing large increasing volumes of information - in commerce, business, or administration – in Russia {{has resulted in}} the growth in popularity of directories, containing <b>information</b> <b>on</b> various <b>authorities</b> and companies, as well as their activities. One of the characteristic attributes of such directories is the so-called "contact" information (address, telephones, etc). The necessity of fast search for the required information and demand for additional information services, naturally impossible in the usual "paper" directories, have {{led to the creation of}} electronic versions of such directories. It is possible, in fact, to search for an enterprise in accordance with its legal organizational form or by the name, using the traditional systems "yellow pages " - "white pages". But if a reverse search (for example, looking for a company name by entering its telephone number or address) is required, then the only solution would be an electronic version of the directory. On the other hand, either in business or administration activity, a spatial component of search is frequently of importance for the user. For example, one wants to find all grocery stores or perfume shops in a particular part of a city, or simply to understand where to search for the address "Moscow prospect, 44 ", thus, it becomes necessary to combine traditional content arrangement of directories with maps or schemes...|$|R
40|$|Since Vannevar Bush’s futuristic {{vision in}} 1945 [1] {{and one of}} its more recent incarnations, namely MyLifeBits [4], {{computer}} scientists have discussed the benefits of capturing data from the physical world (or rather a “mirror ” of them) and bringing them to the virtual world, where they can be transformed into usable knowledge. We propose here to revisit this vision following a social tagging approach, where users intentionally tag objects, people, etc. using a state-of-the-art mobile phone, rather than a dedicated device. In our model, tags correspond to different facets, some automatically captured at tagging time (like location, time, etc) and some manually added like voice/text annotations or discrete values (such as ACL) or even inferred by scanning for instance the images being captured. One key point of our work is our claim that the intentional act of tagging objects, as opposed to recording every bit of information by default, is critical to making the virtual mirror of the physical data useful. The issue at hand here is not storage, which {{has been shown to be}} solvable, but the need for users to validate the importance of objects, in a similar way that links carry <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the <b>authority</b> of pages in the Web.

30|$|This study {{compared}} U.S. and Indian engineering students’ use of {{metacognitive strategies}} and their epistemic beliefs about text in academic settings. It {{is the first}} study of its kind {{to address the question}} of whether non-native speaking engineering students are inherently disadvantaged in information literacy and, by implication, in the global workplace. The hypothesis, motivated by findings in the published literature, was that Indian students, for whom English is not a native language, would be challenged by processing information in English. The results confirmed the hypothesis that Indian engineering students would apply pragmatic processing strategies more frequently than U.S. students. This result is consistent with the data in Vianty (2007), Razi (2010), and Hayati and Shariatifar (2009) concerning information processing in a non-native language. Pragmatic strategies are used to extract, organize, and retain basic information. It is plausible that Indian students rely more heavily on pragmatic strategies than U.S. students, in part, to compensate for reading outside their native language. The remaining hypotheses were not confirmed. The results showed that Indian students exceeded U.S. students in the use of analytic processing strategies. They also exceeded U.S. students in the affirmation of transaction beliefs. These latter effects implied that Indian students were more likely than U.S. students to actively process information through the application of metacognitive strategies, and to interpret, evaluate, critique, and respond to information, rather than simply accept <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the <b>authority</b> of the author.|$|R

40|$|A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a {{wireless}} network {{that does not}} rely on a fixed infrastructure. These characteristics make algorithms that route network traffic particularly vulnerable to attack. Mechanisms used to protect against such attacks often depend on cryptographic keys. Since the nodes in a MANET have limited resources, designing methods for cryptographic key management is particularly challenging. Because the network infrastructure is unstable, assuming that authorities used in key management are implemented using any single node is not realistic. Threshold cryptography {{can be used to}} distribute an authority, such that it is implemented by multiple nodes. This makes the authority more robust against network failures and harder to compromise. However, the bandwidth limitations in a MANET result in that public key distribution becomes very challenging. Identity-based cryptography (IBC), where any identity may serve as a public key, makes public keys and their certificates superfluous. The authority issuing private keys corresponding to an identity is called a Private Key Generator (PKG). This thesis considers the issue of distributing a PKG to the nodes in a MANET. It gives a description of a generic distributed PKG, including a definition of security. An example of a distributed PKG is also given. This distributed PKG is compatible {{with some of the most}} prevalent IBC systems. It is shown that the security properties of the base IBC systems are preserved when this distributed PKG is used instead of the original one. Threshold cryptography and identity-based cryptography are found to result in very efficient key management systems, compared to other methods. It is however important to consider which security properties a distributed authority has, especially with respect to any leakage of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> the <b>authority's</b> secret key. However, the main challenge in connection with key management in a MANET is to authenticate nodes without requiring preestablished trust...|$|R
