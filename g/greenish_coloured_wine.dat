50|$|Vitrella brassicaformis, {{also known}} as a 'chromerid', is a species of alveolates {{isolated}} from the Great Barrier Reef. Its closest known relative is Chromera velia. Vitrella differs from Chromera in having a more complex lifecycle, for instance involving a range of sizes and morphologies. Also, while Vitrella is <b>greenish</b> <b>coloured,</b> Chromera is brown coloured. The differences are in the types of secondary pigments that characterize each genus. Both genera lack chlorophyll b or c; these absences link the two taxonomically, as algae bearing only chlorophyll a are quite few amid the biodiversity of life.

The coloured fluorescent tubes were proved to be highly effective. Even 100 -watt fluorescence tubes were measured in high lumen. For example, the green 100 -watt fluorescent tube was equivalent to 300 - 400 watt of incandescent lamps in photo-energy output. The bluish or <b>greenish</b> <b>coloured</b> fluorescent tubes have more quantities of photoenergy than incandescent lamps in the range of long wave-length, and, on the other hand, the latters have more quantities of energy than the former in short wave-length.

40|$|The Cambrian age Blow Me Down Brook {{formation}} of the Humber Arm Allochthon has been poorly understood since geological study began in the area more than 140 years ago. A detailed study has never been carried out exclusively on the formation, nor a complete stratigraphy designated. The aim of this thesis is to compose a stratigraphy for the Blow Me Down Brook formation based upon sedimentology, petrography and ichnology. [...] Regional mapping of coastal sedimentary strata from the community of Fox Island River, north to Rope Cove is used to show extensive and continuous sections of Blow Me Down Brook formation. These exposures, paired with a recently documented basal contact between Blow Me Down Brook red shale beds and underlying Fox Island River volcanics, have allowed development of a composite stratigraphy for the Blow Me Down Brook formation. The formation, herein estimated to be about 400 m thick, is formed of six informal, but distinct stratigraphic units: A, B, C, D, E and F. Unit A, massive red shale interbedded with volcanics; Unit B, thick bedded red (hematitic) and <b>greenish</b> <b>coloured</b> micaceous sublithrenite and lithic subarkose; Unit C, quartz and feldspar pebble conglomerate with calcarenite boulders; Unit D, coarse grained <b>greenish</b> <b>coloured</b> quartzarenite and sublitharenite with minor subarkose interbedded with red, green and grey shale; Unit E, massive siliceous red and black shale, and Unit F; a quartzose greenish sandstone interbedded with black shales. [...] The sandstones of Unit F are commonly petroliferous, and tend {{to be associated with}} the calcareous Northern Head Group. One area (near Sluice Brook) shows evidence for a petroleum system in the Blow Me Down Brook formation. Here, petroliferous Blow Me Down Brook formation overlies the Northern Head Group in an antiformal structure. The shales of the Northern Head Group have a 'greasy' texture and may have acted as a source rock; overlying beds of red shales form a seal. [...] The Blow Me Down Brook formation is derived from offshore turbidity flows, with little understanding of how the formation relates to the Summerside and Irishtown formations of the same age. With knowledge of the stratigraphy and petrography stronger arguments may be made for correlating the Summerside formation with lower units A and B of the Blow Me Down Brook formation. The more quartzose upper units C, D, E, and F of the Blow Me Down Brook formation may be correlated to the Irishtown formation. [...] By careful recognition of strata and successions, it may be feasible to effectively map these rocks across the region. ...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the effects of different maceration winemaking techniques on the phenolic composition of red grapevine variety ‘Tempranillo’ (Vitis vinifera L.). Experimental winemaking included 4 different treatments with 3 replicates. (5 days pre-fermentation maceration at 11 °C, fermentation without any pre-fermentation or post-fermentation extended maceration (control wines), and 3 - and 6 -days post- fermentation extended maceration on skins). Spectroscopic and RP-HPLC analysis were used to determine changes in phenolic components and between treatments during the alcoholic fermentation, and as they aged in the bottle. It was determined if the wines made with pre-fermentation maceration had increased color intensity compared to the control wines, as well as if the wines that underwent extended maceration had increased concentration of (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin, increased color hue, decreased color intensity compared to the control wines. Prolonging the maceration from 7 to 10 and 13 days, lead to significantly higher concentrations of total phenolics, and the monomeric flavan- 3 -ols, (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin, and lead to a significant decrease of the total anthocyanins. Further investigation is needed in order to analyse the effect of the phenolic, tannin’s and anthocyannin’s composition on the quality of the wine in terms of color stabilization and mouth-feel. Post-fermentation EM reduced wine colour intensity and imparted a browner hue to the wine compared to the Control wine. This EM treatment is therefore unlikely to benefit winemakers who are seeking to produce highly <b>coloured</b> <b>wines.</b> However, post-fermentation extended maceration increased the concentration of wine flavan- 3 -ols ((+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin).

40|$|The {{consequences}} of pre-fermentation and post-fermentation extended maceration (EM) on colour, mouthfeel and phenolic composition were investigated in Pinot noir (2004), Grenache (2006) and Shiraz (2007) (Vitis vinifera L.) wines. Experimental wines were made using cold soak, post-fermentation EM, and standard fermentation treatments (C). Cold soak treatments included a 3 -day cold soak at 10 °C (CS), {{with an additional}} comparison of plunging effects for the 2004 wines (CSP). Post-fermentation extended maceration treatments were 1 - or 3 -weeks on skins in 2004 (PS 1 and PS 3 respectively), and 3 -weeks in 2006 and 2007 (PS 3). A variety of chemical and sensory test methods {{were used to determine}} changes in phenolic components and organoleptic properties between treatments of all 3 varietals as they aged in the bottle. Among other results, it was determined if wines made with a period of cold soak had increased colour intensity, and increased concentrations of monomeric anthocyanins and pigmented polymers compared to control wines. It was also determined if wines made with a period of post-fermentation EM had increased concentrations of the flavan- 3 -ols (+) -catechin and (−) -epicatechin, and tannin, decreased colour intensity and modified mouthfeel compared to the other wine treatments. A greater understanding of Australian red winemakers’ opinions on EM regimes and their use in Australian wineries was obtained by survey. Survey results confirmed that EM is used extensively in Australian wineries but that winemakers have poor understanding of the {{consequences of}} EM regimes for red wine properties. The survey confirmed that winemakers are concerned about the economic cost and logistic pressures {{associated with the use of}} EM regimes during vintage. Wines made using EM need to spend longer in fermentation vessels, which are in high demand during this time. Findings from this study provide winemakers with more information to consider before making decisions about their use of EM regimes. Survey findings showed more winemakers would use EM regimes if logistic and economic pressures did not apply. However, results suggest that even if winemakers did adopt EM practices, some may not achieve what they believe to be the outcome of these regimes, such as improved colour or mouthfeel properties. For instance, results showed that cold soaking did not make a difference to wine colour compared to conventional fermentation maceration. Even without cold soaking red must, winemakers may be able to achieve the same or very similar wine organoleptic characteristics at a reduced cost. Similarly, no significant effects of plunging during cold soak were observed. Post-fermentation EM visibly reduced wine colour intensity and imparted a browner hue to the wine compared to red wine that was pressed off skins upon reaching dryness. This EM regime is therefore unlikely to benefit winemakers who are seeking to produce highly <b>coloured</b> <b>wines.</b> However, prolonged maceration post-fermentation did increase the intensity of perceived bitterness and increased the concentration of wine flavan- 3 -ols and tannins. Winemakers may therefore influence the desired balance between the extraction of these wine phenolics (and the associated outcome for taste and mouthfeel properties) and economic considerations by varying the duration of maceration post-fermentation.

2500|$|Pinotage, a {{crossing}} of Pinot noir and Cinsaut, {{has seen its}} plantings rise and fall due to the current fashion of the South African wine industry. Today, {{it is the second}} most widely planted red grape variety in South Africa. While there are supporters who want to make the grape South Africa's signature variety, critics of the grape note that hardly any other wine region in the world has planted this variety due to its flaws. In the early 1990s, as Apartheid ended and the world's wine market was opening up, winemakers in South Africa ignored Pinotage in favour of more internationally recognised varieties like Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Towards the end of the 20th century, the grape's fortunes began to turn, and by 1997 it commanded higher prices than any other South African grape. It is a required component (30–70%) in [...] "Cape blends". Here it is made into the full range of styles, from easy-drinking quaffing wine and rosé to barrel-aged wine intended for cellaring. It is also made into a fortified [...] "port-style", and even a red sparkling wine. The grape can be very dependent on the style of winemaking, with well made examples having the potential to produce deep <b>coloured,</b> fruity <b>wines</b> that can be accessible early as well as age. However, critics of the variety believe that the variety's flaws - green vegetal flavours and tannins, and susceptibility to developing banana and nail polish acetate aromas - are present in far more examples of Pinotage that reach the consumer market.
