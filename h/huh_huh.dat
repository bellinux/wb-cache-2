40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} tetherin, a recently identified antiviral factor, in restricting hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Japanese fulminant hepatitis- 1 (JFH- 1) infectious cell culture system. Human hepatocytes (<b>Huh</b> 7, <b>Huh</b> 7. 5. 1) expressed low levels of endogenous tetherin, which could be induced by IFN-a. However, tetherin contributes little to IFN-a-mediated anti-HCV JFH- 1 activity. Although tetherin could inhibit Vpu-deleted HIV- 1 release, it had negligible activity in restricting HCV JFH- 1 release from hepatocytes, which was evidenced by unaffected levels of intracellular/ extracellular HCV RNA and infectious virus. The failure of tetherin’s anti-HCV activity could not {{be related to the}} counteraction of HCV, as HCV infection of hepatocytes affected neither tetherin expression nor anti-HIV function of tetherin. These observations imply that tetherin has negligible activity in the restriction of HCV JFH- 1 in human hepatocytes...|$|R
40|$|Doxorubicin (DOX) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used anticancer drugs in the treatment of hepatoma. However, acquired drug resistance {{is one of the}} major challenges for the chemotherapy. In this study, a down-regulation of miR- 122 was observed in doxorubicin-resistant <b>Huh</b> 7 (<b>Huh</b> 7 /R) cells compared with its parental <b>Huh</b> 7 cells, suggesting miR- 122 is associated with the chemoresistance. Meanwhile, luciferase reporter assay proved that the PKM 2 is the target of miR- 122, and we reported that the glucose metabolism is significantly up-regulated in <b>Huh</b> 7 /R cells. Importantly, overexpression of miR- 122 in <b>Huh</b> 7 /R cells reversed the doxorubicin-resistance through the inhibition of PKM 2, inducing the apoptosis in doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells. Thus, this study revealed that the dysregulated glucose metabolism contributes to doxorubicin resistance, and the inhibition of glycolysis induced by miR- 122 might be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome doxorubicin resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|OPN (osteopontin)) is a Hh (Hedgehog) -regulated {{cytokine}} that is up-regulated during chronic liver {{injury and}} directly promotes fibrosis. We {{have reported that}} Hh signalling enhances viral permissiveness and replication in HCV (hepatitis C virus) -infected cells. Hence we hypothesized that OPN directly promotes HCV replication, and that targeting OPN could be beneficial in HCV. In the present study, we compared the expression of OPN mRNA and protein in HCV (JFH 1) -infected <b>Huh</b> 7 and <b>Huh</b> 7. 5 cells, and evaluated whether modulating OPN levels using exogenous OPN ligands (up-regulate OPN) or OPN-specific RNA-aptamers (neutralize OPN) leads to changes in HCV expression. Sera and livers from patients with chronic HCV were analysed to determine whether OPN levels were associated with disease severity or response to therapy. Compared with <b>Huh</b> 7 cells, <b>Huh</b> 7. 5 cells support higher levels of HCV replication (15 -fold) and expressed significantly more OPN mRNA (30 -fold) and protein. Treating <b>Huh</b> 7 cells with OPN ligands led to a dose-related increase in HCV (15 -fold) and OPN (8 -fold) mRNA. Conversely, treating <b>Huh</b> 7. 5 cells with OPN-specific RNA aptamers inhibited HCV RNA and protein by > 50 % and repressed OPN mRNA to basal levels. Liver OPN expression was significantly higher (3 -fold) in patients with advanced fibrosis. Serum OPN positively correlated with fibrosis-stage (P= 0. 009), but negatively correlated with ETBCR (end-of-treatment biochemical response), ETVR (end-of-treatment virological response), SBCR (sustained biochemical response) and SVR (sustained virological response) (P= 0. 007). The OPN fibrosis score (serum OPN and presence of fibrosis ≥F 2) may be a predictor of SVR. In conclusion, OPN is up-regulated in the liver and serum of patients with chronic hepatitis C, and supports increased viral replication. OPN neutralization may be a novel therapeutic strategy in chronic hepatitis C. © The Authors Journal compilation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) are {{considered}} a pivotal target for the eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we reported that the CSC markers epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and CD 90 are expressed independently in primary HCCs and cell lines, and CD 90 + cells share features of metastatic vascular endothelial cells and express the vascular endothelial marker CD 105, a co-receptor of transforming growth factor-beta. METHODS: The EpCAM+ cell lines <b>HuH</b> 1 and <b>HuH</b> 7 were treated with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) or epirubicin in vitro. Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, respectively. The expression of CD 105 in primary HCC was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The relationship of CD 105 expression status and HCC prognosis was evaluated using 85 surgically resected HCC tissues by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: 5 -FU or epirubicin treatment resulted in the generation of CD 90 + and CD 105 + cells in vitro in <b>HuH</b> 1 and <b>HuH</b> 7 cells, which originally contain no CD 90 + or CD 105 + cells. This phenomenon was validated by qRT-PCR analysis with activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program regulators Snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAI 1) and SNAI 2. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that CD 105 + cells were morphologically identical to vascular endothelial cells in untreated primary HCCs. However, surgically resected specimens after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization clearly indicated that CD 105 + cancer cells survived at the peripheral edge of the tumor. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that HCCs expressing CD 105 showed poor prognosis after surgery with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data highlight the role of CD 105 + HCC cells with activation of the EMT program generated de novo after cytotoxic therapy on the prognosis of HCC patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common cancers with dismal clinical outcome accounting for the third highest cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel entity with a fascinating role in cancer progression. The current evidence suggests that further elucidation of EV function(s) may identify specific oncogenic markers that may be useful for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of HCC where conventional therapies give unsatisfactory results. Here, we show that the extracellular vesicles released by HCC cell lines carry small non coding (nc) RNA. Materials and Methods. To define the contribution of the ncRNA cargo of HCC cell derived EVs we performed high throughput sequencing to identify different ncRNAs in the EVs. Using validated centrifugation protocols, we separated these EVs released by 4 different ECC cell lines <b>Huh</b> 7, <b>Huh</b> 6, HepG 2 and Hep 3 B and performed RNA sequencing with the Applied Biosystems SOLiD Sequencer. Results. Various, but different, non-coding RNAs were detected in the EVs, including microRNA, tRNA, small nucleolar (sno) RNA, small nuclear (sn) RNA and lincRNA. We report the ncRNA composition of EVs released in the 4 HCC cell lines and the comparison of EVs ncRNA in the 4 different MVs derived HCC cell lines. Discussion. Significant differences in both miRNA and snoRNA expression profiles were found between MVs of the different HCC cell lines. Gene ontology analysis indicates that these ncRNAs target transcription factors and genes that participate in several cellular pathways, including angiogenesis, cellular transport, apoptosis, and proteolysis. Our data suggest that EVs transport gene regulatory information to modulate angiogenesis, and other cell pathways in recipient cells. Conclusions. These findings provided new insights into the characteristics of ncRNAs in extracellular vesicles derived from hepatocellular carcinoma cells and might become a new source for identification of the HCC markers...|$|R
40|$|Drug-induced hepatotoxicity, {{which is}} a rare but serious adverse {{reaction}} to {{a large number of}} pharmaceutical drugs, is sometimes associated with reactive metabolites produced by drug-metabo-lizing enzymes. In the present study, we constructed a cell-based system to evaluate the cytotoxicity of reactive metabolites pro-duced by CYP 3 A 4 using human hepatoma cells infected with an adenovirus vector expressing human CYP 3 A 4 (AdCYP 3 A 4). When seven hepatoma cell lines (HepG 2, Hep 3 B, HLE, HLF, <b>Huh</b> 6, <b>Huh</b> 7, and Fa 2 N 4 cells) were infected with AdCYP 3 A 4, HepG 2 cells showed the highest CYP 3 A 4 protein expression and testosterone 6 -hydroxylase activity (670 pmol min 1 mg 1). With the use of AdCYP 3 A 4 -infected HepG 2 cells, the cytotoxicities of 23 drugs were evaluated by the 2 -(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitrophenyl) - 3 -(4 -nitrophe-nyl) - 5 -(2, 4 -disulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium monosodium salt assay, and the cell viability when treated with 11 drugs (amiodarone, desipramine, felbamate, isoniazid, labetalol, leflunomide, nefa-zodone, nitrofurantoin, tacrine, terbinafine, and tolcapone) was significantly decreased. Moreover, the transfection of siRNA for nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) to decrease the cellular expression level of Nrf 2 exacerbated the cytotoxicity of some drugs (troglitazone, flutamide, acetaminophen, clozapine, terbinafine, and desipramine), suggesting that the genes regulated by Nrf 2 are associated with the detoxification of the cytotoxicities mediated by CYP 3 A 4. We constructed a highly sensitive cell-based system to detect the drug-induced cytotoxicity mediated by CYP 3 A 4. This system would be beneficial in preclinical screening in drug development and increase our understanding of the drug-induced cytotoxicity associated with CYP 3 A 4...|$|R
40|$|Severe fever with {{thrombocytopenia}} syndrome (SFTS) is {{an emerging}} infectious disease {{caused by a}} novel bunyavirus (SFTS virus, SFTSV). At present {{there is still no}} specific antiviral treatment for SFTSV; To understand which cells support SFTSV life cycle and whether SFTSV infection activates host innate immunity, four different cell lines (Vero, Hela, <b>Huh</b> 7. 5. 1, and <b>Huh</b> 7. 0) were infected with SFTSV. Intracellular/extracellular viral RNA and expression of IFNα, and IFNß were detected by real-time RT- PCR following infection. To confirm the role of non-structural protein (NSs) of SFTSV in exogenous IFNα-induced Jak/STAT signaling, p-STAT 1 (Western Blot), ISRE activity (Luciferase assay) and ISG expression (real-time PCR) were examined following IFNα stimulation in {{the presence or absence of}} over-expression of NSs in Hela cells. Our study showed that all the four cell lines supported SFTSV life cycle and SFTSV activated host innate immunity to produce type I IFNs in Hela cells but not in <b>Huh</b> 7. 0, <b>Huh</b> 7. 5. 1 or Vero cells. NSs inhibited exogenous IFNα-induced Jak/STAT signaling as shown by decreased p-STAT 1 level, suppressed ISRE activity and down-regulated ISG expression.

40|$|The {{biology of}} Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), {{a common cause}} of {{epidemic}} and sporadic hepatitis, is still being explored. HEV exits liver through bile, a process which is essential for its natural transmission by feco-oral route. Though the process of this polarised HEV egress is not known in detail, HEV pORF 3 and hepatocyte actin cytoskeleton {{have been shown to}} play a role. Our transcriptome analysis in Hepatitis E virus (HEV) replicon transfected <b>Huh</b> 7 cells at 24 and 72 hrs indicated that at 24 hrs, both LncBISPR and BST 2, expressed by a bidirectional promoter were highly upregulated whereas at 72 hrs, BST 2 expression was comparatively reduced accompanied by normal levels of BISPR. These findings were confirmed by qPCR analysis. Co-localisation of BST 2 and HEV pORF 2 was confirmed in HEV transfected <b>Huh</b> 7 by confocal microscopy. To investigate the role of BISPR/BST 2 in HEV life cycle, particularly virus egress, we generated <b>Huh</b> 7 cells with ~ 8 kb deletion in BISPR gene using Crispr-Cas 9 system. The deletion was confirmed by PCR screening, Sanger sequencing and Real time PCR. Virus egress in ΔBISPR <b>Huh</b> 7 and <b>Huh</b> 7 cells was compared by measuring HEV positive strand RNA copy numbers in cell lysates and culture supernatants at 24 and 72 hrs post HEV replicon transfection and further validated by western blot for HEV pORF 2 capsid protein. ΔBISPR <b>Huh</b> 7 cells showed ~ 8 fold increase in virus egress at 24 hrs compared to <b>Huh</b> 7 cells. No significant difference in virus egress was observed at 72 hrs. Immunohistochemistry in histologically normal liver and HEV associated acute liver failure revealed BST 2 overexpression in HEV infected hepatocytes and a dominant canalicular BST 2 distribution in normal liver in addition to the cytoplasmic localisation reported in literature. These findings lead us to believe that BISPR and BST 2 may regulate egress of HEV virions into bile in vivo. This system may also be used to scale up virus production in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of an HCV isolate which replicates in cell culture {{has opened up}} opportunities to study the full viral life cycle in vitro. This genotype 2 a isolate (JFH- 1) and its derivatives {{are the only ones}} known to replicate efficiently in cell culture, and recent work has indicated that viral determinants for efficient replication may lie in the non-structural protein coding region of the genome. In this thesis chimaeric JFH- 1 virus containing full length NS 3, NS 3 helicase and NS 3 protease sequences from genotype 1 a and 1 b were constructed. The replication efficiencies of chimaeric viruses were tested in cell culture, and were shown not to replicate, indicating that vital viral determinants for JFH- 1 replication exist in NS 3. The JFH- 1 model also provides the opportunity to study the effect of the full viral life cycle on the host cell. Microarray analyses were performed to identify gene expression changes in <b>Huh</b> 7 and <b>Huh</b> 7. 5 cells that had been infected with JFH- 1 for 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hours. A large number of host genes were found to be regulated during JFH- 1 infection, including those involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, apoptosis and intracellular transport. The microarray data were validated by quantitative PCR analyses of separate infection experiments. A selection of the most highly regulated genes was assessed for their necessity to HCV replication by RNA interference studies. The knockdown by siRNA of genes ABLIM 3, SPTLC 3 and CYP 1 A 1 resulted in significant impairment of HCV replication. The knockdown by siRNA of gene TXNIP (thioredoxin interacting protein) resulted in up to 90 % reduction in HCV replication. This is a novel finding which may be of importance to the study of HCV as TXNIP plays roles in oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism, all of which have potential to influence the HCV lifecycle. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated a change in levels of choline metabolites in JFH- 1 infected cells, which has implications for the aspects of the HCV lifecycle associated with lipid membranes and other lipid structures.

40|$|The innate {{immune system}} is {{a vital part of}} the body‟s defences against viral pathogens. RIG-I and MDA 5 belong to the retinoic acid {{inducible}} gene-I (RIG-I) -like receptors (RLRs) family and function as cytoplasmic PRRs that are involved in the elimination of actively replicating RNA viruses. Their location and their differential responses to RNA viruses emphasises the complexity of the innate detection system. RIG-I and MDA 5 contribute to antiviral signalling in different ways depending on the virus involved. Coxsackieviruses are positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. They cause many serious diseases, including viral myocarditis (which can lead on to dilated cardiomyopathy), aseptic meningitis, and pancreatitis. In order to identify which RLR recognises these viruses and which RNA species triggers RLR activation during Coxsackievirus infection, viral ssRNA and replicative intermediates of Coxsackievirus RNA as well as synthetic dsRNA were used in this study. The results revealed that MDA 5 recognises not the genomic ssRNA but the dsRNA generated by the replication of these viruses. Confocal microscopy provided unique evidence between the relationship of viral dsRNA and MDA 5 while cytokine assays using HEK-MDA 5 cells showed a strong immune response to Coxsackievirus and the dsRNA intermediates. This shows very strong evidence that MDA 5 is a key sensor of the dsRNA intermediate of Coxsackieviruses. As RIG-Is role in Coxsackie recognition still needs to be verified <b>Huh</b> 7 and <b>Huh</b> 7. 5. 1 cells were used and showed no difference in immune response in the absence of RIG-I to Coxsackievirus infection, as well as the isolated ssRNA, suggesting that the VPg group present on the RNA blocks recognition. Furthermore immunoprecipitation experiments showed that in response to Coxsackievirus stimulation, RLRs homodimerise as well as heterodimerise with LGP 2, potentially upregulating their activity as a possible mechanism for viral detection. The data presented here show a much clearer role for RLRs in Coxsackievirus infection, while opening new questions as to MDA 5 s role in the diseases caused by Coxsackieviruses, as well as the specifics behind dimerisation of the RLR...|$|R
