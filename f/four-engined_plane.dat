2500|$|The four-engined second {{aircraft}} Registered VT-AFM {{was handed}} over on 12 December 1934 and named the Star of India. By {{arrangement with the}} Indian Government the aircraft was operated and maintained by Indian National Airways when not required by the Viceroy. The aircraft {{was taken over by}} the Royal Air Force as L9166 in 1937 for use by AHQ India and was dismantled at Delhi in 1940. It has been said that the performance of the <b>four-engined</b> <b>plane</b> was poor, even dangerous, due to the reduced wing area caused by the extra [...] "power-eggs".|$|E
50|$|On 14 November 1942 Fecia Di Cossato sailed for {{his last}} mission on Tazzoli. On 12 December the {{submarine}} sank the British steamer Empire Hawk (5,032 GRT) and the Dutch merchant Ombilin (5,658 GRT); on 21 December the British steamer Queen City (4,814 GRT) became Tazzolis next victim, followed on Christmas by the American motorship Dona Aurora (5,011 GRT). During the return voyage, the submarine was attacked by a British <b>four-engined</b> <b>plane,</b> that was shot down by Tazzolis machine gunners. On 2 February 1943, Tazzoli ended her patrol in Bordeaux. On 19 March 1943, Fecia di Cossato was awarded a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross by the German authorities, for his successes in the Atlantic.|$|E
5000|$|From 6 April 1934 the Eighteen {{was used}} with other {{aircraft}} on the Glasgow-London-Belfast service by Midland and Scottish Air Ferries. In May 1935 G-ACFV {{was sold to}} Brian Allen Aviation for use {{with a variety of}} associated companies including Commercial Air Hire and Air Dispatch Limited. CAH used the aircraft for excursions and joy riding duties while Air Dispatch operated a daily newspaper flight between London and Paris, and a passenger service on the weekend. Due to the increase in freight business the aircraft was fitted with a larger loading door. Last flown by Commercial Air Hire in June 1936, a sightseeing trip around the RMS Queen Mary, the aircraft was sold as VH-UXD to Mandated Airlines in Australia. She was destroyed in New Guinea on 21 January 1942 by Japanese military forces. The four-engined second aircraft Registered VT-AFM was handed over on 12 December 1934 and named the Star of India.

5000|$|... 167 Squadron {{was formed}} on 18 November 1918 {{just after the}} Armistice of the First World War at RAF Bircham Newton as a heavy bomber {{squadron}} in No. 27 Group RAF with Handley Page V/1500 <b>four-engined</b> <b>planes.</b> The squadron was disbanded on 31 May 1919 still at Bircham Newton.|$|R
25|$|British Dakota and Hastings {{aircraft}} carrying essential {{goods and}} raw materials began using Tegel {{on a regular basis}} from 17 November 1948. Regular cargo flights with American C-54s followed from 14 December 1948. Generally, the former carried food and fuel while the latter were loaded with coal. December 1948 also saw three Armée de l'Air Junkers Ju 52/3m transport planes participating in the airlift for the first time. However, the Armée de l'Air contributed to the overall airlift effort in a very small and symbolic way only. As a result of committing the small French transport fleet to the growing war effort in Indochina, as well as the joint Anglo-American decision to employ only <b>four-engined</b> <b>planes</b> {{for the remainder of the}} airlift to increase the number of flights and the amount of cargo carried on each flight by taking advantage of those aircraft's higher speeds and greater capacities, the French participation ceased.|$|R
50|$|Junkers' {{produced}} a design study in 1924 {{for a visit}} to the United States. The study outlined a <b>four-engined</b> 80-passenger <b>plane,</b> incorporating a forward canard wing, as well as a main wing, both of which were fitted above twin pylons. Called the Junkers J.1000 Super Duck passenger seating was to be provided both in the main wing and the hull sections of the craft. This Junkers design, including a scale model, was intended to illustrate an aircraft capable of trans-Atlantic operations of 8 to 10 hours and was completely revolutionary for its day.|$|R
500|$|The {{precursors}} {{to international}} airports were airfields or aerodromes. In {{the early days}} of international flights, there was limited infrastructure, [...] "although if engine problems arose there were plenty of places where aircraft could land". <b>Four-engined</b> land <b>planes</b> being unavailable for over-water operations to international destinations, thus/therefore flying boats became part of the solution. At {{the far end of the}} longest international route (which became the Kangaroo Route), on-water landing areas were found in places such as Surabaya and in the open sea off Kupang. In Sydney, Rose Bay, New South Wales, was chosen as the airport landing area.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} of 1908-1913 Zalewski {{constructed}} biplane WZ I and its 20 hp engine. In 1912 he constructed with his brother Bolesław monoplane WZ II. During {{the years of}} 1915-1916 he built two tetraplanes, in which one was flying on the frontline. During the interwar period Zalewski built biplane WZ VIII (1919), fighter plane WZ X (1923-1926), sports plane WZ XI (1927) and the first Polish <b>four-engined</b> heavy bombing <b>plane</b> PZL-3 (1928-1930; built in France as Potez 41) made in PZL.|$|R
