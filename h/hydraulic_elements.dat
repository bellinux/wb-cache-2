40|$|Rubber mounts {{are common}} {{components}} within automotive vehicle powertrains and suspensions. They provide compliance at joints between substructures {{as well as}} provide vibration isolation between structures. These mounts are often designed to certain stiffness and damping values within a given frequency range. Narrow band tuning with regards to dynamic stiffness is difficult to achieve using mechanical force transmission elements without the incorporation of internal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>elements.</b> This project analytically and experimentally investigates the feasibility of rubber mount designs without <b>hydraulic</b> <b>elements</b> that have a notch-type behavior in its dynamic stiffness near 100 - 125 Hz over a frequency range of 0 to 500 Hz, with a dynamic stiffness range between 50 and 500 N/mm, and with a maximum mass of 5 kg. Based on these constraints, multiple dynamic stiffness component-level models (with displacement input and force output) are examined analytically. A prototype is designed, fabricated, and evaluated using finite element analysis and experimental testing. The prototype evaluation shows notch-type behavior in its transmitted force through the mount in a bench experiment; however, future evaluation is still required to evaluate the load capacity of the component and determine its effect within a system-level environment...|$|E

40|$|Passive systems {{possess the}} {{beneficial}} properties of ease of human control, and stable interaction with arbitrary passive systems. Motivated by these properties, our {{research has been}} directed towards developing passive hydraulic systems. A novel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>element</b> called the passive valve was first developed. The passive valve was used in single degree of freedom passive bilateral teleoperation of a hydraulic actuator. The teleoperation control ensured a) passive 2 -port behavior of the teleoperator and b) bilateral energy transfer between the human and the work enviroment with a power scaling factor. Although passivity, coordination between the master and slave systems was ensured only when the teleoperator (and hence the passive valve) was manipulated at sufficiently low frequency. In this paper, we extend the previously proposed teleoperation control to multi-degree of freedom control of a hydraulic backhoe, and rectifies the previously imposed bandwidth limitation by accounting for {{the dynamics of the}} passive valve. The passivity property of the hydraulic backhoe ensures interaction stability with any human operator and the work environment that could be modelled passive. The intrinsically passive control ensures two-port, rigid coordinated behavior of the passive valve driven teleoperated backhoe. ...|$|R
