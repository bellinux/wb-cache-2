How <b>hibernators</b> manage large fluxes of lipids and sterols over the annual hibernation cycle is poorly understood.

Cholesterol levels in total plasma, HDL and LDL particles were elevated in <b>hibernators</b> compared with spring or summer squirrels. Hibernation increased plasma apolipoprotein A-I expression and HDL particle size. Expression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase was 13 -fold lower in <b>hibernators</b> than in active season squirrels. Plasma triglycerides were reduced by fasting in spring but not summer squirrels.

5000|$|Obligate <b>hibernators</b> are {{animals that}} spontaneously, and annually, enter {{hibernation}} regardless of ambient temperature {{and access to}} food. Obligate <b>hibernators</b> include many species of ground squirrels, other rodents, mouse lemurs, the European hedgehog and other insectivores, monotremes, marsupials, and even butterflies such as the small tortoiseshell. These undergo what has been traditionally called [...] "hibernation": the physiological state where the body temperature drops to near ambient (environmental) temperature, and heart and respiration rates slow drastically. The typical winter season for these <b>hibernators</b> is characterized by periods of torpor interrupted by periodic, euthermic arousals, wherein body temperatures and heart rates are restored to euthermic (more typical) levels. The cause and purpose of these arousals is still not clear.|$|R
5000|$|Torpor is a {{state of}} {{decreased}} physiological activity in an animal, usually by a reduced body temperature and metabolic rate. Torpor enables animals to survive periods of reduced food availability.

Although research in the 1990s hinted at the ability to induce torpor in animals by injection of blood taken from a hibernating animal, further research {{has been unable to}} reproduce this phenomenon. Despite the inability to induce torpor, there are substances in <b>hibernator</b> blood that can lend protection to organs for possible transplant. Researchers were able to prolong the life of an isolated pig's heart with a HIT. This may have potentially important implications for organ transplant, as it could allow organs to survive for up to 18 or more hours, outside the human body. This would be a great improvement from the current 6 hours.|$|E
50|$|The golden-mantled ground {{squirrel}} {{is similar to}} a chipmunk in more than just its appearance. Although it is a traditional <b>hibernator,</b> building up its body fat to survive the winter asleep, it is also known to store some food in its burrow, like the chipmunk, for consumption upon waking in the spring. Both the golden-mantled {{ground squirrel}} and the chipmunk have cheek pouches for carrying food. Cheek pouches allow them to transport food back to their nests and still run at full speed on all fours. Golden-mantled ground squirrels dig shallow burrows up to 30 m in length with the openings hidden in a hollow log or under tree roots or a boulder. The female gives birth to a single litter of four to six young each summer.|$|E
40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science - BiologyHibernating mammals rely on stored fat {{instead of}} {{ingested}} food as a fuel source during the winter. This prolonged fast affects various systems and {{causes them to}} make changes to survive the long hibernation season. One system that is greatly affected is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which shrinks in mass and loses some of its important barrier functions. The GI tract {{is home to a}} large number of immune cells in all mammals. The number of GI immune cells increases during hibernation, which would be a sign of inflammation in other animals. <b>Hibernators,</b> however, show no other signs of inflammatory disease. A possible explanation for this is that within the increased numbers of immune cells in gut of <b>hibernators</b> there are increased numbers of suppressive immune cells. The main type of suppressive immune cell is the regulatory T-cell (Treg). Tregs suppress other immune cells and prevent autoimmune disease. All Tregs express the protein FoxP 3, which is a transcription factor responsible for the development and function of Tregs. I hypothesized that the increased numbers of immune cells in the small intestine of <b>hibernators</b> do not induce an inflammatory phenotype due to a larger percentage of FoxP 3 + regulatory T-cells (Tregs) among them. In order to test this, I isolated intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria leukocytes from small intestine of summer and hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) and analyzed them for FoxP 3 expression using flow cytometry. I found general increases in FoxP 3 + for LPL cells during hibernation compared to summer. Some variability exists in the hibernating animals based on season. CD 3 +FoxP 3 + T-cells did not vary significantly between summer and <b>hibernators,</b> but a significant population of CD 3 loFoxP 3 + or CD 3 -FoxP 3 + cells were found in <b>hibernators.</b> These data suggest seasonal shifts in the intestinal immune phenotype of <b>hibernators.</b> qPCR results of the colon showed that FoxP 3 RNA expression was not different between summer and either hibernating state, but late season <b>hibernators</b> had significantly more FoxP 3 transcript than early season <b>hibernators.</b> The expression of FoxP 3 RNA in the ileum did not vary significantly between summer and <b>hibernators.</b> These data indicate changes in leukocyte populations in the gastrointestinal tract of hibernating ground squirrels. Identification of seasonal changes in intestinal Treg populations will lead to future studies of how squirrels control immune activity during hibernation and could help identify the overactive components of the GI tract immune system in patients on total parenteral nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Mammals that {{hibernate}} (<b>hibernators)</b> {{exhibit a}} circannual rhythm of food intake and body mass. In the laboratory {{during the winter}} hibernation period, many <b>hibernators</b> enter a series of multi-day torpor bouts, dropping their body temperature to near ambient, and cease to feed even if food is present in their cage. The mechanism(s) that regulates food intake in <b>hibernators</b> is unclear. Recently, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) {{has been shown to}} {{play a key role in}} the central regulation of food intake in mammals. We hypothesized that infusing an AMPK activator, 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide 1 B-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into the third ventricle of the hypothalamus would stimulate yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to feed during their hibernation season. Infusion of AICAR ICV into marmots at an ambient temperature of 22 °C caused a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in food intake. In addition, animals stimulated to feed did not enter torpor during the infusion period. Marmots ICV infused with saline did not increase food intake and these animals continued to undergo torpor at an ambient temperature of 22 °C. Our results suggest that AICAR stimulated the food intake pathway, presumably by activating AMPK. These results support the hypothesis that AMPK may be involved in regulating food intake in <b>hibernators</b> and that there may be common neural pathways involved in regulating feeding and eliciting torpor...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{has become}} an important issue in high-end data centers, and disk arrays {{are one of the}} largest energy consumers within them. Although several {{attempts have been made to}} improve disk array energy management, the existing solutions either provide little energy savings or significantly degrade performance for data center workloads. Our solution, <b>Hibernator,</b> is a disk array energy management system that provides improved energy savings while meeting performance goals. <b>Hibernator</b> combines a number of techniques to achieve this: the use of disks that can spin at different speeds, a coarse-grained approach for dynamically deciding which disks should spin at which speeds, efficient ways to migrate the right data to an appropriate-speed disk automatically, and automatic performance boosts if there is a risk that performance goals might not be met due to disk energy management. In this paper, we describe the <b>Hibernator</b> design, and present evaluations of it using both trace-driven simulations and a hybrid system comprised of a real database server (IBM DB 2) and an emulated storage server with multi-speed disks. Our file-system and on-line transaction processing (OLTP) simulation results show that <b>Hibernator</b> can provide up to 65 % energy savings while continuing to satisfy performance goals (6. 5 – 26 times better than previous solutions).

The evolutionarily "late" appearance of Cx 43 in the heart suggests physiological adaptation to euthermia with its concomitant demands related to increased cardiovascular output. We tested to what extent mammalian Cx 43 {{differs from that of}} non-mammalian vertebrates and whether Cx 43 from hibernating species contains specific sequence characteristics which could be attributed to their non-isothermal life cycle. We cloned the complete coding region of Cx 43 from the African green monkey, European hedgehog (<b>hibernator),</b> Russian dwarf hamster, rabbit, European ground squirrel (<b>hibernator)</b> and pig. After sequencing, these were compared to 12 full-length Cx 43 sequences present in GenBank (3 fish, 2 frogs, chicken and 6 mammals amongst which there was one other <b>hibernator).</b> Overall identity ranged from 68. 7 % to 97. 7 % at the nucleotide level and from 71. 6 % to 99. 7 % at the amino acid level. The phylogeny of Cx 43 mirrors the general phylogenetic histories of the investigated species to a large extent. From 382 amino acids there were only 6 specific for mammals.

50|$|The {{question}} of why <b>hibernators</b> may experience the periodic arousals (returns to high body temperature) has plagued researchers for decades, and while {{there is still no}} clear-cut explanation, there are myriad hypotheses on the topic. One favored hypothesis is that <b>hibernators</b> build a 'sleep debt' during hibernation, and so must occasionally warm up in order to sleep. This has been supported by evidence in the Arctic ground squirrel. Another theory states that the brief periods of high body temperature during hibernation are used by the animal to restore its available energy sources. Yet another theory states that the frequent returns to high body temperature allow mammals to initiate an immune response.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hibernators</b> survive {{long periods}} of time without {{behavioural}} activity. To minimize energy expenditure, <b>hibernators</b> use the natural hypometabolic state of torpor. Deep torpor in ground squirrels is accompanied by reduction of brain activity, and is associated with changes in electrical activity patterns, with changes in neuronal connectivity, with tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and with loss of behavioural function (e. g., spatial memory, operational conditioning, behavioural rhythmicity). Thus, deep torpor does not guarantee unchanged physiological and behavioural outcome. However, the adverse effects of deep torpor may be limited to the extreme hibernation strategy used by ground squirrels. The wide variety of natural hibernation strategies may serve as a basis to identify hypometabolic strategies appropriate for long lasting human hypometabolism...|$|R
40|$|Metabolism {{is derived}} from the Greek word metabole which {{translates}} to change. Metabolism is the sum total of chemical reactions that take place in an organism.

Historically, such measurements of direct calorimetry were difficult. As a result, most studies utilize indirect calorimetry wherein oxygen consumption and/or carbon dioxide production are measured. One limitation to this approach is that anaerobic metabolism is ignored. No commercially-available calorimeter is available for whole animal metabolic studies.

It is suggested by this observation that this tissue may provide a mechanism by which these animals serve as persisting reservoirs for the virus in nature. The present investigation {{is part of a}} study designed to determine how virus is released from brown adipose tissue to participate in the natural history of the disease. The unique thermoregulatory mechanism of bats sets them apart from other mammals; the body temperature of resting bats closely paralleling environmental temperature over a range of 2 - 37 °C. (2).

40|$|Protein {{synthesis}} (PS) {{has been}} considered essential to sustain mammalian life, yet {{was found to be}} virtually arrested for weeks in brain and other organs of the hibernating ground squirrel, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus. PS, in vivo, was below the limit of autoradiographic detection in brain sections and, in brain extracts, was determined to be 0. 04 % of the average rate from active squirrels. Further, it was reduced 3 -fold in cell-free extracts from hibernating brain at 37 °C, eliminating hypothermia as the only cause for protein synthesis inhibition (active, 0. 47 ± 0. 08 pmol/mg protein per min; <b>hibernator,</b> 0. 16 ± 0. 05 pmol/mg protein per min, P < 0. 001). PS suppression involved blocks of initiation and elongation, and its onset coincided with the early transition phase into hibernation. An increased monosome peak with moderate ribosomal disaggregation in polysome profiles and the greatly increased phosphorylation of eIF 2 α are both consistent with an initiation block in hibernators. The elongation block was demonstrated by a 3 -fold increase in ribosomal mean transit times in cell-free extracts from hibernators (active, 2. 4 ± 0. 7 min; <b>hibernator,</b> 7. 1 ± 1. 4 min, P < 0. 001). No abnormalities of ribosomal function or mRNA levels were detected.

Although the Mexican free-tailed bat proved to be relatively insusceptible to experimental rabies infection, virus was demonstrated in the brown fat of 22 per cent of those animals shown to be infected by viral assay in white Swiss mice. Rabies infection in this species was most evident 20 to 40 days after intramuscular inoculation of virus. Rabies virus {{was found to be}} widely distributed in the little brown myotis 9 to 26 days following inoculation and virus concentrations in some of the tissues approached the level of the stock mouse brain virus suspension used in inoculating these bats. The shorter incubation period and higher virus titers in the tissues assayed reflect the increased susceptibility of Myotis lucifugus as compared with the Mexican free-tailed bat. Virus was demonstrated in the brown fat of 30 per cent of the experimentally infected Myotis. In the experimentally infected Myotis lucifugus and in the Syrian hamster which is highly susceptible to rabies infection, rabies virus was isolated more frequently from the brown fat than from the salivary gland indicating that in a susceptible host brown adipose tissue may be as frequent a site of viral proliferation as salivary gland. Since rabies virus was found to persist {{for long periods of time}} in the brown fat of experimentally infected bats and was occasionally demonstrated in this tissue alone, it is suggested that brown adipose tissue provides a mechanism by which these animals may serve as reservoirs for this agent in nature.

Countermeasures that can prevent muscle atrophy as well as restore the exercise capacity (Boonyarom and Inui 2006; Williams et al. 2009) are regularly sought after.

This model is applied to study treatment for muscle atrophy due to disuse (Ivakine and Cohn 2014; Gao et al. 2012). Their skeletal muscle mass may decrease slightly during hibernation, but limited or no changes in contractile performance have been demonstrated (Bodine 2013; James et al. 2013).
