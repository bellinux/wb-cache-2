40|$|In {{the early}} 1960 s, {{practical}} epidemiology {{began to come}} {{under the influence of}} computing power. Before that time, epidemiologists had used ingenious devices such as the <b>edge-punched</b> <b>card</b> and hand-driven and even electrically driven calculating machines, all dependent on well known technology ingeniously applied. Regression analysis of study data was essen-tially unknown because the inversion of matrices beyond 3 x 3 by hand was far too time-consuming or well nigh impossible. Looking toward the future at that time, one would never have envisaged what in fact has taken place over the last 40 years. Large mainframes housed in dedicated buildings beckoned research workers to their halls so that "jobs" could be delivered to the technical staff as a roll o...|$|E
40|$|The flow of {{data in the}} {{clinical}} chemistry laboratory has been studied {{with respect to the}} types of personnel handling it and the ultimate use of the data. In order to promote higher efficiency, a data processing system using punched cards has been devised and operated for a period of approximately 24 months. Forms, cards and general considerations useful in such a system are described in detail. Some of the problems associated with this type of operation are discussed, as are the economics of this system and its general applicability. 1 â€™TnEINCREASED DEMAND for services from clinical chemistry laboratories throughout the nation has been widely noted (6) and has stimulated much research on methods for handling laboratory analysis by semi-automatic means (1). Although in our laboratories we have adopted many of these devices, there has been left the formidable task of col-lecting, distributing, storing, and interpreting the information so ob-tained. We present here some of the observations made in our chemistry service concerning the flow and organization of laboratory data, a description of the prominent features of this process, and details of the pertinent steps we have explored ill making this phase of laboratory operations more efficient and useful. Recent reports indicate that the data-handling phase of laboratory operations is receiving increasing attention. Radin (4) has reported the application of <b>edge-punched</b> <b>cards</b> for manual handling of certain as-pects of laboratory data. Mason (2) described an interesting applica-tion of photocopying equipment to produce reports and short-term summaries. Swichtenberg et al. (5) have presented methods for the integration of laboratory data with other hospital data...|$|R
