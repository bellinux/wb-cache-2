5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E

25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} using the mould made {{process in which}} a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread {{can be made to}} surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking {{to reduce the number of}} corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> make it very hard to copy.|$|E

Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons.

40|$|With {{this special}} issue, we draw {{attention}} to the growing and diverse field of HCI researchers exploring the interstices of food, technology and everyday practices. This special issue builds on the CHI workshop of the same name (Comber et al., 2012 a), where we brought together the community of researchers that take food as a point from which to understand people and design technology.

Christian Vega, a sex workers' rights activist and a member of Victoria's peer-only Victorian Sex Industry Network (VIXEN), blamed speakers including Geldof for their use of pejorative language, which perpetuated the very stigmas that are among the key barriers to HIV prevention. Geldof responded to the criticism during the closing session of the conference: [...] "I read today <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> my talk yesterday was littered with profanities – fuck them."

2500|$|Some of {{the awards}} have been controversial.

[...] Macleod was the department head at the University of Toronto but otherwise was not {{directly involved in the}} findings. [...] Banting [...] thought his laboratory partner Charles Best, who had shared in the laboratory work of discovery, should have shared the prize with him as well.
