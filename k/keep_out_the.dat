5|$|Springbok {{are mainly}} active around dawn and dusk. Activity is {{influenced}} by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest {{in the shade of}} trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok {{is similar to that of}} Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female herds that enter their territories and <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E

25|$|The tribal name is {{therefore}} {{likely to be}} the origin of Kernow or later Curnow used for Cornwall in the Cornish language.

The Cornish Cornovii may even be a completely separate tribe, taking their name from the horn shape of the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 18th century, and {{particularly}} {{after the end}} of the Reign of Terror, Parisians of all classes were in constant search for entertainment. The end of the century saw the opening of the pleasure gardens of Ranelegh, Vauxhall, and Tivoli. These were large private gardens where, in summer, Parisians paid an admission charge and found food, music, dancing, and other amusements, from pantomime to magic lantern shows and fireworks. The admission fee was relatively high; the owners of the gardens wanted to attract a more upper class clientele, and <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> more boisterous Parisians who thronged the boulevards.|$|E

25|$|In December 1855 Lyons went to Marseilles {{to attend}} the peace conference for the Crimea, leaving his ship to sail to Malta. While in the Aegean Sea the gland {{surrounding}} the propellor shaft failed, allowing water to flood into the ship. The bilge pumps could not cope with the flow, but the ship was kept afloat by connecting the cooling water pumps used to condense steam in the engine to the bilge instead of open sea. After use the water was pumped overboard and provided the engine remained running the ship could be kept clear of water. The ship was near the island of Zea, so Captain Mends circled the island through the night until with daylight {{he was able to}} beach the ship on a sandy bay. The engines then had to be kept working for four days while a dam was built around the ship to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> water and allow repairs to be made. Mends chose Tryon to go to Piraeus to summon help rather than a more senior officer because of his 'marked intelligence'.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{residents}} lived in circular or rectangular houses which they built between {{the river and the}} eastern secondary wall. The placement of the structures suggests that the layout was planned. The dwellings were built around a central ceremonial plaza likely used for rituals and public gatherings, as has been found at other similar locations. Posts for the house frames were placed either in individual holes, or in a trench dug slightly narrower than the posts. Walls were completed with wattle and daub, a plaster mixture of grass and clay, and the roof covered with bark or thatch. The doorway usually faced south to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winter's north winds. Inside, a single family slept on pole-frame beds, covered with tamarack boughs, deer skins, and furs. Sometimes a fire was kept {{in the middle of the}} house and a hole in the roof let out the smoke. Pits dug in the earthen floor of the house held stored foods such as corn, nuts, and seeds in woven bags. Perishable foods like meat were probably stored outside prior to cooking. Pits outside were also used for garbage and community resources.|$|E

500|$|The Walks are {{the gardens}} within Gray's Inn, and have existed {{since at least}} 1597, when records show that Francis Bacon was to be paid £7 for [...] "planting of trees in the walkes". Prior to this the area (known as Green Court) {{was used as a}} place to dump waste and rubble, since at the time the Inn was open to any Londoner. In 1587 four Benchers were ordered by the Pension to [...] "consider what charge a brick wall in the fields will draw unto And where the said wall shalbe fittest to be builded", and work on such a wall was {{completed}} in 1598, which helped <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> citizens of London.|$|E
500|$|In Hindu temples, Ganesha is {{depicted}} in various ways: as an acolyte or subordinate deity (...) as a deity related to the principal deity (...) or as the principal deity of the temple (...) , treated similarly to the highest gods of the Hindu pantheon. As the god of transitions, he is placed at the doorway of many Hindu temples to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> unworthy, which is analogous to his role as Parvati’s doorkeeper. In addition, several shrines are dedicated to Ganesha himself, of which the Ashtavinayak (Sanskrit: अष्टविनायक; lit. [...] "eight Ganesha (shrines)") in Maharashtra are particularly well known. Located within a 100-kilometer radius {{of the city of}} Pune, each of the eight shrines celebrates a particular form of Ganapati, complete with its own lore and legend.

500|$|When the dikes in Grand Forks {{could not}} <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{flooding}} river, Pat Owens ordered {{the evacuation of}} over 50,000 people on April 18, which up to that time, had been the largest civilian evacuation in the United States since the evacuation of residents in Atlanta, Georgia, during the Civil War. She later reflected on the decision saying, [...] "...if I evacuate this city and nothing happens they're gonna impeach me. But if I don't, we're going to lose lives." [...] Because all transportation was cut off between the two cities (and for many miles, the two states), East Grand Forks residents were evacuated to nearby Crookston, namely to the University of Minnesota Crookston, while residents of Grand Forks, who were given mandatory evacuation orders on April 18, went to Grand Forks Air Force Base (residents stayed in airplane hangars containing more than 3,000 cots).|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then you also shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
500|$|In {{accordance}} with Sturdee's plans, Cornwall, her sister ship, , {{and the light}} cruiser [...] immediately set off in pursuit while the battlecruisers and the slow armoured cruiser [...] dealt with the German armoured cruisers. At 14:45 Glasgow, the fastest of the British cruisers, {{was close enough to}} Leipzig to open fire and the two ships exchanged salvos and scoring the occasional hit. An hour later, the Germans scattered in different directions; Cornwall and Glasgow pursued Leipzig while Kent went after [...] Cornwall closed on the German ship at full speed, trusting to her armour to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> [...] shells, while the unarmoured Glasgow manoeuvered at a distance. The range from Cornwall was [...] at 18:00 and her shells set Leipzig on fire. Five minutes later, the German ship had ceased firing and the British ships closed to [...] to see if she would surrender. One last gun fired and Leipzig did not strike her colours so the British fired several additional salvos at 19:25. The German captain had mustered his surviving crewmen on deck preparatory to abandoning ship, but the ship's flag could not be reached because it was surrounded by flames, and the British shells wrought havoc on the assembled crew. Leipzig fired two green flares at 20:12 and the British ships closed to within [...] and lowered boats to rescue the Germans at 20:45. Their ship capsized at 21:32 but only a total of 18 men were rescued in the darkness. Leipzig had hit Cornwall 18 times, but she did not lose a single man. The British ship rescued one officer and three ratings from Leipzig. Cornwall spent {{much of the rest of}} the month searching for the German ships that had not yet been captured or destroyed before departing for home on 3 January 1915.|$|E
