40|$|Glucose {{metabolism}} of pancreatic beta {{cells and}} the resulting increase of the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio are the metabolic signal for insulin secretion. Under normal nonpathological conditions the secreted insulin is replenished by newly synthesed insulin in a process which requires fully functioning mRNA synthesis. Under chronic hyperglycaemic conditions not only insulin transcription, but also protein synthesis and secretion is impaired. It was therefore {{the aim of this}} work to identify glucose metabolic pathways which could play an important role during regulation of insulin gene expression and in doing so investigate the potential association between glucose metabolism and a proteinkinase-associated reduction of insulin gene expression. Utilising metabolite profiling analyses of rat-derived cultivated pancreatic insulinoma cells (INS- 1) experiments were undertaken with a view to shed light on the effects of chronic high glucose conditions on glucose metabolism. These analyses permitted the determination that such conditions led to wide-ranging changes to this system. Among the most dominant effects were the accumulation of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolites, in particular of alpha-ketoglutarate as well as of metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in addition to a cellular accumulation of a number of organic acids. A particularly great accumulation of the PPP metabolites <b>glucono-delta-lactone,</b> 6 -phosphogluconic acid and gluconic acid in addition to a similar accumulation of carbamyl-aspartic acid, a precursor in the synthesis of DNA and RNA, all of which were only detectable at significant levels under chromic high glucose conditions. Gluconic acid can be considered a newly identified metabolite in pancreatic beta cells, the origin of which as a glucose degradation product was unambiguously determined using isotopically-labelled [13 C]-glucose. The increased secretion of this compound into the growth medium could be interpreted as a metabolic overload and as a indication that cells compensate for this by eliminating specific glucose by-products. Parallel to these metabolite profiling analyses, the INS- 1 cells were also phenotypically and genotypically characterised in an attempt to identify a protein signal pathway associated with insulin gene expression reduction. Preliminary experiments showed that chronic high glucose levels led to decreased insulin gene expression, associated with decreased levels of transcription factors, such as MafA, Beta 2, PDX- 1 and differentiation factors, such as PAX 6. Additionally, chronic high glucose levels resulted in increased proliferation of INS- 1 which was thought to be a result of an increased ERK 1 / 2 protein kinase activity. Inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 activity with PD 98059 prevented chronic high glucose-induced reduction of insulin gene expression and of transcription factors MafA, Beta 2, PDX- 1 und Pax 6. Finally, it was intented to clarify whether metabolite changes participated in the reduction of insulin gene expression and to what extent ERK 1 / 2 kinase is involved. Inhibition of the PPP enzyme 6 -phosphogluconic acid dehydrogenase at low glucose levels with 6 -aminonicotinamide resulted in a similar accumulation of <b>glucono-delta-lactone,</b> 6 -phosphogluconic acid and gluconic acid as observed under high glucose conditions and also resulted in a reduction of insulin gene expression. The inhibition of ERK 1 / 2, which prevented a reduction of insulin gene expression, also prevented such an accumulation of the PPP metabolites <b>glucono-delta-lactone,</b> 6 -phosphogluconic acid and gluconic acid, but also alpha-ketoglutarate under chronic high glucose conditions. The results outlined here indicate that high glucose levels in the long term cause the intracellular enhancement of a number of glucose metabolic by-products in beta cells, which are not apparent under normal conditions. Especially noticeable was a critical increase of organic acids, which might be associated with a ERK 1 / 2 kinase – mediated reduction of insulin gene expression...|$|E

Emulsion pH below 5. 90 (i. e., pH of cooked product ~ 6. 00) by the addition of 0. 5 N LA affected different sensory attributes adversely. Similarly, incorporation of GDL at or above 0. 3 % adversely affected most of the quality and sensory attributes of pork sausages.

Small spherical protein-enriched micro-gels dispersed in a guar gum-enriched continuous phase were found at high acidification temperatures, suggesting that the protein acid gelation kinetics was quicker than an extensive droplet growth through phase separation. For lower acidification temperatures, a region where droplet coalescence and sedimentation competed with gel formation was identified. Thus, depending on the residence time in that temperature domain, the resulting microstructures varied from spherical to extended filaments of more than 100 mu m length.

To determine the roles of the additives, PG and GDL in the functionality of kafirin edible coatings, different kafirin coatings were applied to ‘Hass’ avocados prior to storage under ripening conditions of 18 °C for up to 21 days. All the kafirin coatings were effective at extending and maintaining the shelf-life quality of avocados compared to uncoated fruit due to reduced respiration rate, 102 ml CO 2 /kg/h for kafirin-PG+GDL compared to 115 ml CO 2 /kg/h uncoated avocados on day 14 and consequently reduced ethylene production of the coated fruit. Kafirin-PG+GDL coated avocados lost less weight and remained firmer than uncoated fruit. Descriptive sensory analysis showed kafirin-PG+GDL coatings were most effective, extending the quality of the avocados 7 days beyond the untreated control due to improved kafirin solvation facilitated by the GDL.

40|$|Coryne{{bacterium}} glutamicum is a Gram-positive soil bacterium that {{prefers the}} simultaneous catabolism of different carbon sources {{rather than their}} sequential utilization. This type of metabolism requires an adaptation of the utilization rates to the overall metabolic capacity. Here we show how two functionally redundant GntR-type transcriptional regulators, designated GntR 1 and GntR 2, co-ordinately regulate gluconate catabolism and glucose uptake. GntR 1 and GntR 2 strongly repress the genes encoding gluconate permease (gntP), gluconate kinase (gntK), and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (gnd) and weakly the pentose phosphate pathway genes organized in the tkt-tal-zwf-opcA-devB cluster. In contrast, ptsG encoding the EII(Glc) permease of the glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) is activated by GntR 1 and GntR 2. Gluconate and <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> interfere with binding of GntR 1 and GntR 2 to their target promoters, leading to a derepression of the genes involved in gluconate catabolism and reduced ptsG expression. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} example for gluconate-dependent transcriptional control of PTS genes. A mutant lacking both gntR 1 and gntR 2 shows a 60 % lower glucose uptake rate and growth rate than the wild type when cultivated on glucose as sole carbon source.

The two proteins have been purified to homogeneity. G(I) and G(II) composed of two and four equal sub-units, respectively and displayed optimal activity at pH 7. 0 and temperature 65 - 75 degreesC. Both beta-glucosidases were competitively inhibited by glucose and <b>glucono-delta-lactone.</b> G(I) and G(II) exhibited broad substrate specificity, since they hydrolyzed a range of (1, 3) -, (1, 4) - and (1, 6) -beta-glucosides as well as aryl beta-glucosides. Determination of k(cat) /K-m revealed that G(II) hydrolyzed 3 - 8 times more efficiently the above-mentioned substrates. The ability of G(I) and G(II) to deglycosylate various flavonoid glycosides was also investigated. Both enzymes were active against flavonoids glycosylated at the 7 position but G(II) hydrolyzed them 5 times more efficiently than G(I). Of the flavanols tested, both enzymes were incapable of hydrolyzing quercetrin and kaempferol- 3 -glucoside. The main difference between G(I) and G(II) {{as far as the}} hydrolysis of flavanols is concerned, was the ability of G(II) to hydrolyze the quercetin- 3 -glucoside. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

The tofu gels were made using either <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GDL) or calcium sulphate (CaSO 4 center dot 2 H(2) O), followed by either heat treatment (heated soymilk at >= 97 degrees C prior to coagulation and subsequently held at 70 degrees C for 60 min, HT) or high pressure treatment (400 MPa at 20 degrees C for 10 min, HP). The overall moduli values of the GDL gels and CaSO 4 center dot 2 H(2) O gels of both physical treatments were similar, each gave frequency profiles expected for weak viscoelastic materials. However, although both temperature and high pressure treatments could be used to produce tofu gels, the final products were not the same. Pressure formed gels, despite having a higher overall "consistency" (increasing values of their moduli), had a proportionately higher contribution from the loss modulus (increased tan delta). Differences could also be observed using confocal scanning laser microscopy. While such treatment may give rise to differing systems/structures, with new or modified organoleptic properties, the more "open" structures obtained by pressure treatment may well cause processing difficulties if subsequent reworking or moulding is required.

40|$|Suitably {{functionalized}} dipeptides {{have been}} shown to be effective hydrogelators. The design of the hydrogelators and the mechanism by which hydrogelation occurs are both currently not well understood. Here, we have utilized the hydrolysis of <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> to gluconic acid as a means of adjusting the pH in a naphthalene-alanylvaline solution allowing the specific targeting of the final pH. In addition, this method allows the assembly process to be characterized. We show that assembly begins as charge is removed from the C-terminus of the dipeptide. The removal of charge allows lateral assembly of the molecules leading to pi-pi stacking (shown by CD) and beta-sheet formation (as shown by IR and X-ray fiber diffraction). This leads to the formation of fibrous structures. Electron microscopy reveals that thin fibers form initially, with low persistence length. Lateral association then occurs to give bundles of fibers with higher persistence length. This results in the initially weak hydrogel becoming stronger with time. The final mechanical properties of the hydrogels are very similar irrespective of the amount of GdL added; rather, the time taken to achieving the final gel is determined by the GdL concentration. However, differences are observed between the networks under strain, implying that the kinetics of assembly do impart different final materials' properties. Overall, this study provides detailed understanding of the assembly process that leads to hydrogelation. ...|$|E

Analytical methodology included small-deformation dynamic oscillation, visual observations, scanning electron microscopy, and blending-law modeling. The aim of the work was to identify the state of phase separation and the pattern of solvent distribution between the two constituent polymers. It was found that the high molecular weight distribution of 11 S supported rapid kinetics of structure formation, with this continuous matrix being concentrated and, hence, further reinforced {{in the presence of}} small additions of 2 S. Blending-law modeling suggested that 2 S was able to retain disproportionate volumes of solvent within its phase. A consequence of such property was that high additions of 2 S leading to equal concentrations of the two molecular fractions in the blend resulted in a catastrophic drop in the values of the overall network strength. This behavior is rather unexpected for the structural properties of a phase-separated system, and it has been rationalized {{on the basis of the}} high water-holding capacity of the small molecular weight fraction. 2 S entraps in its phase the polymeric segments of glycinin, which are then unable to become structural knots of a cohesive three-dimensional morphology observed in single 11 S preparations...|$|E

The physicochemical, mechanical, and degradation characteristics of these CPC formulations were systematically analyzed upon soaking in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). In parallel, various CPC formulations were implanted intramuscularly and orthotopically {{on top of the}} transverse process of goats followed by analysis of the soft tissue response and bone ingrowth after 12 weeks. In vitro degradation of GDL was almost completed after 2 weeks, as evidenced by characterization of the release of gluconic acid, while PLGA-containing CPCs released glycolic acid throughout the entire study (12 weeks), resulting in a decrease in compression strength of CPC. Extensive in vitro degradation of the CPC matrix was observed upon simultaneous incorporation of 30 % PLGA- 10 % GDL. Histomorphometrical evaluation of the intramuscularly implanted samples revealed that all CPCs exhibited degradation, accompanied by an increase in capsule thickness. In the in vivo goat transverse process model, incorporation of 43 % PLGA, 30 % PLGA- 5 % GDL, and 30 % PLGA- 10 % GDL in CPC significantly increased bone formation and resulted in higher bone height compared with both 10 % GDL and 20 % GDL-containing CPC samples...|$|E

It stability in the tree {{is provided by the}} negative charge of the shell due to the presence of proteins and lipids. Natural rubber latex coagulates after acidification to form a colloidal gel that is the first step of its transformation into natural rubber. In this PhD thesis, we studied this acid-induced aggregation and gelation and the properties of the resulting gels. For this, a commercial natural rubber latex composed by rubber particles (1 μm in diameter), was used. Aggregation was induced by hydrolysis of a compound called <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GDL). The aggregation was followed by different techniques based on light scattering (turbidimetry, DWS, SLS). Gelation was followed in situ by rheology. Then, the rheological properties of colloidal gels formed at pH 4 were characterized in the linear and non-linear regimes. Dependence to the volume fraction and the pH of the onset of aggregation was observed. The non-redispersion of aggregates proves the strong interactions between rubber particles. Three different state behaviors (stable solution, phase separation and gel) can be predicted from a state diagram pH-volume fraction that was established over 5 weeks. The gel state exhibited a fractal structure, characterized by a power law relationship between the elastic modulus G' and the volume fraction. At high deformations, an irreversible reorganization under stress resulted in an irreversible strain hardening of the material.

Three phase boundaries (PHc, pHphi(l), pHphi(2)) have been determined using an original titration method, newly applied to complex coacervation. It consists of monitoring the turbidity and light scattering intensity under slow acidification in situ with <b>glucono-delta-lactone.</b> Furthermore, the particle size could also be measured in parallel by dynamic light scattering. When the PH is lowered, whey proteins and gum arabic first form soluble complexes. This boundary is designated as PHc. When the interaction is stronger (at lower PH), phase separation takes place (at pHphi(1)). Finally, at pHphi(2) complexation was suppressed by the charge reduction of the gum arabic. The major constituent of the whey protein preparation used was beta-lactoglobulin (beta- 1 g), and it was shown that beta- 1 g was indeed the main complex-forming protein. Moreover, an increase of the ionic strength shifted the PH boundaries to lower PH values, which was summarized in a state diagram. The experimental PH., values were compared to a newly developed theory for polyelectrolyte adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces. Finally, {{the influence of the}} total biopolymer concentration (0 - 20 % w/w) was represented in a phase diagram.

In this study, {{the analytical method}} called “in situ quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy” (isq 1 H NMR) {{was applied to the}} quantitative determination of the variation in taste and functional molecules that are sucrose, lysine, arginine and valine during various culinary transformations of soymilk, involving fresh, thermal process, vacuum evaporation, tofu and yuba. Results suggest that thermal process at 100 ̊C increased the amount of free sucrose but significantly decreased the amount of lysine. Sweetness of soymilk could be simply enhanced. Evaporation of soymilk caused a higher reduction of lysine than thermal processing at 100 °C, indicating that complexation and Maillard reactions of lysine could be enhanced. The arginine content also decreased, albeit in less quantities. The changes of molecular conformation could also be monitored. In particular, resonances associated with the side-chain of valine were observed when most proteins were unfolded at high temperature. In mild acidic condition using <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> as a coagulant, the amount of lysine was maintained higher than thermal process and evaporation while sucrose content was reduced. Tofu containing of lysine and sucrose could have a sweetness taste. However, there was no free sucrose in yuba. Understanding the change of taste molecules in soymilk during culinary transformation could lead to a better formulate soymilk products, thus this would be benefit to culinary application at home and industrial...|$|E
40|$|An {{emerging}} {{approach toward}} development of injectable, self-setting, and fully biodegradable bone substitutes involves {{the combination of}} injectable hydrogel matrices with a dispersed phase consisting of nanosized calcium phosphate particles. Here, novel injectable composites for bone regeneration have been developed based on the combination of ultrapure alginate as the matrix phase, crystalline CaP [monetite and poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) ] powders as both a dispersed mineral phase {{and a source of}} calcium for cross-linking alginate, <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GDL) as acidifier and glycerol as both plasticizer and temporary sequestrant. The composites were maximized with respect to CaP content to obtain the highest amount of osteoconductive filler. The viscoelastic and physicochemical properties of the precursor compounds and composites were analyzed using rheometry, elemental analysis (for calcium release and uptake), acidity [by measuring pH in simulated body fluid (SBF) ], general biocompatibility (subcutaneous implantation in rabbits), and osteocompatibility (implantation in femoral condyle bone defect of rabbits). The gelation of the resulting composites could be controlled from seconds to tens of minutes by varying the solubility of the CaP phase (HA vs. monetite) or amount of GDL. All composites mineralized extensively in SBF for up to 11 days. In vivo, the composites also disintegrated upon implantation in subcutaneous or bone tissue, leaving behind less degradable but osteoconductive CaP particles. Although the composites need to be optimized with respect to the available amount of calcium for cross-linking of alginate, the beneficial bone response as observed in the in vivo studies render these gels promising for minimally invasive applications as bone-filling material...|$|E
40|$|Water {{retention}} in transglutaminase (TG) -treated acid milk gels was {{studied and}} {{linked with the}} gel formation dynamics. Heat-treated skim milk with and without pre-treatment by TG was acidified at 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 40 degrees C at constant <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GDL) level to obtain different acidification rates. Formation dynamics and structural properties of acid-induced gels were followed by rheological and near-infrared light backscattering measurements as well as microscopy. TG-treated gels showed decreased tan delta values all through the acidification, which was pronounced around the gelation point. Backscattered light intensity was lowered in TG-treated gels compared to the controls indicating that TG-treated gels were comprised of smaller aggregates. Water holding capacity (WHC) was measured by using centrifugation at selected pH points (pH 5. 2, 5. 0, 4. 8 and 4. 6) during acidification. Both acidification temperature and TG treatment had significant effects on the water retention properties of the gels. Spontaneous syneresis observed at high acidification temperatures (>= 30 degrees C) was prevented upon TG-treatment. WHC of TG-treated gels was significantly higher compared to the control gels at all pH points. TG-treated milk gels showed a homogeneous network formed of smaller aggregate and pore sizes at the gelation point and did not show any large-scale re-organisation thereafter. Transglutaminase is likely {{to act as a}} fixative of the protein network at an early stage of gelation and thereby limiting network rearrangements that take place in acid milk gels formed at high acidification temperatures leading to contraction and subsequent wheying off.

This research aims {{to determine the}} effect of soymilk and egg ratios on the antioxidant capacity, daidzein and genistein content and amino acid profiles of egg tofu. Egg tofu was prepared using soymilk and fresh egg in ratios of 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 3 : 1 and 4 : 1. <b>Glucono-Delta-Lactone</b> (GDL) was added in the egg tofu to act as a coagulating agent. Increased of soymilk at all ratios had significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in Ferric-Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP), daidzein and genistein content of egg tofu. Conversely, decreased in soymilk ratio had significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the radical scavenging activities of the 2, 2 -Azino-Bis 3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -Sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 2 -Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in egg tofu. Increased of soymilk ratio up to 3 : 1 caused decreased in amino acid methionine (met) and cystein (cys) significantly (p< 0. 05). A significant (p< 0. 01) and a positive correlation was observed between Total Phenolic Content (TPC) and FRAP (r = 0. 93). However, there was a negative (p< 0. 01) correlation between TPC and DPPH (r = - 0. 83). The antioxidant capacity of egg tofu in DPPH assay showed a positive and significant (p< 0. 01) correlation with cysteine, methionine and tryptophan with r value of 0. 92, 0. 93 and 0. 96 respectively. Higher content of egg in egg tofu had contributed to the increased of antioxidant capacity as indicated in DPPH assay and ABTS assay as well as amino acid methionine and cysteine...|$|E
40|$|Designing various microstructures {{through the}} interplay between phase {{separation}} and acid-induced gelation processes was investigated. Acid skim milk/xanthan gum mixed gels were prepared at different xanthan gum and <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GDL) concentrations in order to modulate the extent of phase separation and the gelation rate, respectively. A gradual change in acid milk gel microstructute was found by increasing xanthan gum concentration, from homogeneous protein network, to fibrous structures and finally to isolated protein-rich aggregates. Addition of xanthan gum in the milk led to an apparent depletion-flocculation with protein-rich domains dispersed in a continuous phase enriched in xanthan. The sedimenting denser protein-rich domains could be trapped by protein gelation, forming specific fibrous structures at 0. 05 wt. % xanthan gum. Manipulating the microstructure through modification of the gelation rate resulted in a design of {{a broad range of}} fibrous morphologies varying from 20 to 400 mu m long, which could be used to generate novel textures for food products. Industrial relevance: As a response to industrial demand by the consumer for novel acid milk gels with superior structural properties, mouthfeel and potential health benefits, we present here a way to manipulate textures by designing specific fibrous microstructures. Protein-polysaccharide mixtures that are subject to phase separation and gelation are interesting not only for the creation of major differences in structure and rheological properties of mixed systems, but also because of resulting protein-enriched products (up to 4 times more concentrated than conventional yoghurt). This approach should make it possible to improve the nutritional benefits as well as formulate a wide range of acid milk gels with innovative structures and. sensory properties.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} {{of a wide range of}} incubation temperatures (4 to 40 degrees C) and sodium caseinate concentrations (2 to 6 % (w/w)) on acid-gel properties during and after long ageing times, formed under different acidification rates promoted by gradual hydrolysis of <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GDL) into gluconic acid. The kinetics of acidification and gelation were followed from pH 6. 7 to a final pH value around 4. 6 by evaluation of the pH and mechanical properties using uniaxial compression measurements (stress and strain at rupture). As a general trend, faster acidification rates led to faster gel network formation, and lower incubation temperatures led to a higher final pH, while increasing caseinate concentration promoted a small increase in the pH value. Stress at rupture of gels induced by fast acidification rates did not exhibit a weaker gel network, showing the contribution of rearrangements of the network gel at final pH to the electrostatic balance, besides the fact that the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds were important forces involved in microstructure stabilization. Rearrangement of the gel network was mainly observed at pH values close to 4. 6 and was more pronounced at longer ageing times of incubation. The stronger gels were obtained at incubation temperatures of 10 degrees C followed by 25, 4 and 40 degrees C, which was an indication of the behavior of the gel network microstructure, since at the highest temperature the pores were larger and syneresis more pronounced. The results of this study suggest that the incubation temperature, protein concentration and rearrangement at final pH have a great influence on the balance between the attractive and repulsive forces between protein and water, contributing to development of optimized texture and water-holding capacity of acid-gels of sodium caseinate...|$|E
40|$|The main {{fermented}} {{meat products}} are fermented sausages in which {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) are the essential agents of the ripening process. Their application as starter organisms ensures {{the dominance of the}} starter during the whole ripening process. However, when no starter cultures are used, direct addition of acids like a <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GdL) is preferred. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of commercial spices mixtur (containing GdL) on selected technological parameters of fermented dry-cured sausages - Danube sausage in comparison with currently available conventional spices. Comparison was evaluated also with addition of starter cultures. Determinations of technological (value of pH, water activity, color) and microbiological properties (count of Lactobacillus spp., Enterobacteriaceae family, yeasts and moulds) were realized after 24 hours, 5 and 30 days. The sensory analysis of sausages was carried out after 30 days of ripening process. In sausages with the addition of commercial spice mixture in combination with starter culture were determined the lowest values of pH and a w at the end of ripening process (30 days). Bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae family were occurred in the samples with the addition of currently available conventional spices at the beginning of ripening, but after 5 days of ripening were bacteria of this family not detected. The counts of yeasts in analyzed samples were not detected. Counts of LAB at the end of ripening proccess (30 days) were lower in coparison with result obtained after 5 days; however their count was comparable with count determined at the beginig of the ripening.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood ScienceKelly J. K. GettyListeria monocytogenes has the {{potential}} to contaminate ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products. Listeria monocytogenes contamination is a hazard that can potentially occur after post-lethality treatment in a processing environment during slicing or packaging of RTE meat products. United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) requires facilities to have intervention strategies to demonstrate control of this pathogen in RTE meat and poultry products. FSIS categorizes different intervention strategies into Alternative 1, 2, or 3. If an establishment chooses Alternative 1, it must use a post-lethality treatment that reduces or eliminates microorganisms on the product and an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits the growth of L. monocytogenes. If an establishment chooses Alternative 2, it can either use a post-lethality treatment or an antimicrobial agent or process that suppresses or limits growth of L. monocytogenes. Under Alternative 3, the establishment must have a detailed sanitation program as its intervention strategy. As establishments increase the number of interventions or change from Alternative 3 to 2 to 1, the frequency of FSIS sampling of RTE meat and poultry products for safety and wholesomeness decreases. The effectiveness of post-package decontamination technologies such as high-pressure processing, ultraviolet C light, and pre/post-package surface pasteurization have been researched for controlling L. monocytogenes in RTE products. Formulating meat products with antimicrobial additives such as lactates, sodium lactate and sodium diacetate, potassium lactate and sodium diacetate, sodium levulinate, lauric arginate, <b>glucono-delta-lactone,</b> or organic acids is another common approach to control L. monocytogenes in RTE meat products. Also, a combination of sodium lactate and sodium diacetate in a formulation is an acceptable antimicrobial strategy to provide Alternative 2 status. Bacteriocins such as nisin can also be added to the formulation of RTE meat and poultry products for controlling L. monocytogenes. In addition nisin can be applied as packaging film coating. Another approach for controlling L. monocytogenes in products such as jerky, kippered steaks, snack sticks and turkey tenders is the use of packaging environments and holding times prior to shipping. In conclusion, there are various approaches for controlling L. monocytogenes in RTE meat and poultry products post-lethality and processors should consider these options rather than relying on sanitation alone...|$|E
40|$|Hummus, a Middle-Eastern legume-based spread, is {{increasingly}} {{popular in the}} United States, but science-based guidelines to ensure product safety and quality are lacking. Preservatives are used to extend hummus' refrigerated shelf life, but consumers prefer natural alternatives. We evaluated the effect of natural antimicrobials and acid systems 1) on the shelf life of refrigerated hummus and 2) in combination with thermal processing as a hurdle technology to develop a shelf-stable product. Base hummus was prepared by blending chickpeas, olive oil, salt, and water. Hummus was acidified to pH 4. 6 with citric acid, citric and acetic acids, <b>glucono-delta-lactone</b> (GDL), or GDL and acetic acid. Five preservative treatments were tested: 20 ppm natamycin, 500 ppm and 1000 ppm natural plant bitters, 1000 ppm potassium sorbate, and no antimicrobial (control). Samples were inoculated with Penicillium, stored at 15 °C for 5 weeks (accelerated study), and analyzed weekly for microbial counts. Following the accelerated study, the citric-acetic acid system was validated for storage at 5 °C with 20 ppm natamycin, 1000 ppm potassium sorbate, 1000 ppm sodium benzoate, and no antimicrobial at pH 4. 6 and 4. 2. Samples were inoculated and analyzed as previously described. Over the accelerated study, total plate counts and yeast and mold counts were lowest in citric-acetic acid hummus with natamycin compared to all other samples (p 5 weeks shelf-life. Hummus with GDL or GDL-acetic acid had no significantly different microbial counts (p> 0. 05) among preservative treatments. During 5 °C storage, yeast and mold counts were below the limit of detection (0. 05). A consumer acceptability test was conducted to compare acceptance of the Autumn Crisp product to two commercial products, one with and one without sulfites. Dried apple products made from the Autumn Crisp variety were as acceptable as commercial sulfited products in terms of flavor, texture, color, and overall liking. There {{was no significant difference}} in consumers' willingnessto-pay between Autumn Crisp dried apple products and commercial products with sulfites (p> 0. 05), indicating strong market potential for this apple variety in the dried fruit category.
