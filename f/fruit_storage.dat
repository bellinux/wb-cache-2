500|$|The Ditton Laboratory, a short {{distance}} from the research station, was opened in 1930 by the Empire Marketing Board as a part of Cambridge University's Low Temperature Research Station. The purpose of the laboratory was to carry out experiments on the shipping of fruit across the high seas, in order to extend its life over long, seaborne journeys. This led to an experiment being carried out to simulate, as far as was possible, conditions on board a cargo ship, the so-called [...] "ship on land" [...] experiment. One focus of research was the Cox's Orange Pippin Apple, which had the reputation of being a difficult fruit to transport over long distances.
