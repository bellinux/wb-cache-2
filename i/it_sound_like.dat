According to Apple Records historian Andy Davis, the musicians on the track comprised an [...] "ad hoc power trio" [...] of Lomax on bass and rhythm guitar, Harrison on lead guitar and [...] "a couple of overdubs", and drummer Tony Newman from Sounds Incorporated. Lomax recalled that he and Harrison overdubbed a cornet part (played by a studio cleaner) and then manipulated the recording to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the call of an elephant.|$|E

[...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if it sounds good on a lousy stereo, it will sound good anywhere".|$|E

[...] —Minaj describing the concept behind [...] "Pills n Potions". Minaj first mentioned the song in her promo single, [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] which features Soulja Boy. She stated that the single would be released in two weeks. She revealed the title of the song at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards and afterwards hosted a Q&A on Twitter where she revealed information regarding the single. In an interview for Rap-Up, she stated that [...] "Pills n Potions" [...] was [...] "uplifting" [...] and [...] "very soulful". Speaking to Billboard, she explained: [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> urgency, <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> betrayal. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> running. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> fainting. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> love. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> - *gasp!*" [...] On May 19, 2014, Minaj revealed the single's cover art on Instagram.|$|R
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The irony is you have that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E

[...] Although it had a working title of Decade of Decadence, it would be released as Decade of Aggression after Mötley Crüe copyrighted the name on their 1991 greatest hits album. It was released through Def American Recordings on October 22, 1991.|$|E

Reviewer Sam Claiborn {{said that the}} game was more {{expansive}} than its predecessor and that it featured many of the good graphics, gameplay, and usage of Middle English. He also noted that [...] "Fabio's bare-breasted likeness smoldering on IronSword's cover art that made this game a smash hit with kids and moms alike". Website GamesRadar praised the game's music, especially the title theme; Brett Elston said it set a serious tone for the game, saying [...] "its heavy, droning beats mix with a fantasy-minded melody that make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a funeral dirge in the Shire".|$|E

500|$|Konietzko {{stated that}} the band {{overused}} guitars on their previous album, Angst, saying it sounded [...] "like guitarists jacking off". On Nihil, the guitars were mixed in last. Durante had recently purchased a triple-neck Fender steel guitar in Houston, and used it during recording sessions, but added {{a significant amount of}} distortion to it, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "regular" [...] guitar but giving it what he called a [...] "sliding" [...] sound. [...] Konietzko also brought in a trio of horn players to perform on [...] "Disobedience", saying he had always wanted a horn section in a KMFDM song, but that he {{had never been able to}} afford it before.|$|E

500|$|Jason Scott of Blogcritics {{called it}} a [...] "gem" [...] and wrote that [...] "Lovato's pain runs so deep that this soul-baring song feels like a punch in the gut". Both Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu and Rick Florino of Artistdirect {{considered}} it a stand-out track of Unbroken, while [...] Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic ranked it at number 28 on his list of the best songs of 2011, writing, [...] "It's a moody waltz-time ballad whose cello-driven sense of atmosphere places it closer to something Coldplay might have done, although the phrasing makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> she's been getting into '60s soul, her vocal cracking just enough to say, 'I'm feeling this'." [...] Masley also considered it the second best song by Lovato, just behind [...] "Skyscraper".|$|E

500|$|Take Me Home {{was written}} in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. [...] "The Swedish-style songwriting: melody first" [...] was {{predominantly}} utilised, according to Time correspondent Douglas Wolk. Savan Kotecha, Yacoub, and Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm, Sweden, developing songs for the album, {{and were able to}} shape melodies around their tones. Kotecha reflected: [...] "We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult". In addition, after viewing the international success of [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", the trio conceptualised songs [...] "that kids could play on guitar and cover on YouTube." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking at an April 2008 {{event in}} New York, Byrne {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} a new album, calling it a [...] "record of sung songs" [...] in contrast to the experimental music from MyLifeintheBushofGhosts and later told the NewYorkDailyNews that [...] "Brian had written a lot of music, but needed some words, which I know how to do. What's <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like?</b> Electronicgospel. That's all I'm saying." [...] Eno also explained the differences between this album and their previous one saying, [...] "his is quite different from MyLife in that the intention of that album was to not use our voices at all, but instead to find voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is different—these are songs written and sung by David... They go from electronic folkgospel to quite indefinable areas of music." ...|$|E
500|$|The tenth {{season was}} the second during which Mike Scully served as show runner (he had {{previously}} run the ninth season). As show runner and executive producer, Scully headed the writing staff and oversaw {{all aspects of the}} show's production. However, as he told UltimateTV in January 1999, he did not [...] "make any decisions without the staff's input. We have great staffs in all the departments from animation to writing. So I don't want to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a dictatorship." [...] Scully was popular with the staff members, many of whom have praised his organization and management skills. Writer Tom Martin has said that he was [...] "quite possibly the best boss I've ever worked for" [...] and [...] "a great manager of people". Scully's aim while running The Simpsons was to [...] "not wreck the show". In addition to his role as show runner during the tenth season, he co-wrote the episode [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday".|$|E

500|$|The {{first half}} disc {{incorporates}} strong elements from hip hop, urban, blending old-school and modern R. It features horn samples and gospel choirs, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a dusty old vinyl album", according to Jenny Eliscu from Rolling Stone. Most {{songs from the}} disc employ samples, {{with the exception of}} [...] "Without You", [...] "Still Dirrty" [...] and [...] "F.U.S.S." [...] "Makes Me Wanna Pray" [...] featuring Steve Winwood features a gospel choir in its arrangement, while the pop/R and funk number [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] features [...] "aerobic oomph" [...] that is similar to Beyoncé's [...] "Crazy in Love". [...] "Understand" [...] is an R ballad, featuring soul influences that are similar to ballads done by Gladys Knight, while [...] "Slow Down Baby" [...] blends old-school and modern R with hip hop and soul elements. The three follow-ups [...] "Oh Mother", [...] "On Our Way", and [...] "Without You" [...] are the three piano ballads from disc one. [...] "Still Dirrty" [...] was described as a [...] "filthy ghetto strut" [...] with hip hop elements.|$|E
500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, {{but he gave}} {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E
500|$|The Orb {{has been}} a {{prolific}} remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989. Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, the Orb found steady work remixing for artists including Depeche Mode, Lisa Stansfield, and Front 242. The Orb's remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature {{a large number of}} comical samples, Progressive-Sounds describe them as [...] "ahead of their time" [...] and NME notes them as [...] "not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling." [...] Some pieces, such as their Bee Gees cover collaboration with Robbie Williams, received criticism for being [...] "beyond a joke" [...] for their use of strange noises. The Orb's remix of Nine Inch Nails' [...] "The Perfect Drug", too, was described as [...] "silly", as they made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Trent Reznor was [...] "drowning in his bathtub". Though Paterson maintains that much of the Orb's remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so that they could [...] "pay the bills".|$|E

500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> one piece.'" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Cobain, {{the music}} on Bleach {{conformed}} with the grunge genre Sub Pop heavily endorsed.

[...] Cobain also {{felt he had to}} fit the expectations of the grunge sound to build a fanbase, and hence suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits while crafting the record. Krist Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their tour van that had an album by The Smithereens on one side and one by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The songs were described as [...] "deliberately bleak, claustrophobic, and lyrically sparse, with none of the manic derangement or sense of release of the live performance". Cobain said that the song structures were [...] "one–dimensional", and said that he sought to present a more [...] "polished and urbane side of happy".|$|E
500|$|After issuing [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] as the album's third single worldwide, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] {{was chosen}} to be {{released}} as the album's fourth single, since [...] "radio programmers and diehard fans [...] long been clamoring [...]" [...] In the United States, the song was the album's third single, available from September 22, 1998 in a two-track format. In the United Kingdom, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] was distributed as a double A-side with [...] "Little Star". In the rest of Europe, the latter was included on the single releases as a B-side. In the European maxi-singles, several experimental remixes of the track by Luke Slater and an additional remix by Dallas Austin, who previously worked with Madonna on her Bedtime Stories (1994) album, were included. As noted by AllMusic Jose F. Promis, the [...] "Luke Slater's Super Luper Mix" [...] "turns the ballad into a thumping deep house anthem, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a completely different song." [...] Meanwhile, [...] "Fabien's Good God Mix" [...] is described as [...] "an electronic, tripped-out, drum'n'bass-heavy mix which keeps {{the integrity of the}} original song", Promis noted.|$|E
