Meteorological facsimile maps are of much importance to navigation in ocean. Once the meteorological facsimile maps are tampered, {{the safety of}} ships will be possibly greatly decreased because of possible disaster by execrable weather. We exploited the problem to detect the possible forgeries by the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> meteorological facsimile maps such as binary value, fixed form, sparseness and rationally-developing weather system and so on. Experiments show that the forgeries can be detected effectively in meteorological facsimile maps via the proposed <b>intrinsic</b> <b>features.</b> Index Terms—image forgery detection; meteorological facsimile map (MFM); <b>intrinsic</b> <b>feature.</b> I...|$|R

In present work, {{we come back}} to the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> LBM, which uses the density distribution function as a dependent variable to evolve the flow field, and use the non-equilibrium density distribution function correction at the neighbour Euler mesh points to satisfy the non-slip boundary condition on the immersed boundary. The improvements for the original MEIB-LBM are that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> LBM is kept and the flow penetration is removed. Examples, including force convection over a stationary heated circular cylinder for heat flux condition, and natural convection with a buoyant circle particle in viscous fluid, are provided to validate the present method...|$|R
40|$|The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> {{graphene}} honeycomb lattice {{is defined}} by its chiral index (n,m), which can {{be taken into account}} when using molecular dynamics.

The present manuscript adopts the continuum shell model with single director to describe the mechanical behaviors of graphene. In order to consider the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the graphene honeycomb lattice&#x 02014;chiral index (n,m), the chiral-tube vectors of graphene in real space have been used for construction of reference unit base vectors of the shell model; therefore, the formulations will contain the chiral index automatically, or in an explicit form in physical components.

40|$|MOTIVATION: The {{mutation}} of {{amino acids}} often impacts protein function and structure. Mutations without negative effect sustain evolutionary pressure. We study a particular aspect of structural robustness {{with respect to}} mutations: regular protein secondary structure and natively unstructured (intrinsically disordered) regions. Is the formation of regular secondary structure an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> amino acid sequences, {{or is it a}} feature that is lost upon mutation and is maintained by evolution against the odds? Similarly, is disorder an <b>intrinsic</b> sequence <b>feature</b> or is it difficult to maintain? To tackle these questions, we in silico mutated native protein sequences into random sequence-like ensembles and monitored the change in predicted secondary structure and disorder. RESULTS: We established that by our coarse-grained measures for change, predictions and observations were similar, suggesting that our results were not biased by prediction mistakes. Changes in secondary structure and disorder predictions were linearly proportional to the change in sequence. Surprisingly, neither the content nor the length distribution for the predicted secondary structure changed substantially. Regions with long disorder behaved differently in that significantly fewer such regions were predicted after a few mutation steps. Our findings suggest that the formation of regular secondary structure is an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> random amino acid sequences, while the formation of long-disordered regions is not an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> proteins with disordered regions. Put differently, helices and strands appear to be maintained easily by evolution, whereas maintaining disordered regions appears difficult. Neutral mutations with respect to disorder are therefore very unlikely...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{reconstruct}} {{the notion of the}} death in Karl Jaspers' philosophy. It analyses and places the notion in the whole body of the theory of the 'ultimate' situations such as it is presented in Jaspers' youth 'Psychologie der Weltanschauungen' (1919) and the mature 'Philosophie' (1932) as well. The results could be pointed as follows: (i) it characterises the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the metaphysical thought of Jaspers {{as the basis for the}} theory of 'ultimate' situations; (ii) it shows how the theory determined his existential anthropology; and, finally, (iii) it explains how the theory culminates in the notion of the death as the most specific formulation. In that respect, the paper determines how the notion of the death expresses the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> the Jaspers' existential kind of philosophizing by reflecting its spirit in the most profound manner.
