It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats. Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{recruited}} guerrilla fighters had {{to follow}} a two months basic military training program {{that is different from}} the physical training (PT) programs. The basic training consists of having to identify firearms and getting used to specific models and their physical operation, such as the Russian AK-47 and U.S. M16 assault rifles, as well as mortar rifles and basic communication systems. The PT programs are separate from the main training schedule, as they are included in the day-to-day life of a guerrilla, by climbing mountains, running with loads, participating in the digging of military trenches, making bunkers and occasionally also some swimming programs taking place in natural water resources such as rivers and lakes. Playing of soccer is another activity available to all male and female guerrillas as <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> proper mental relaxation. FARC clearly advises all guerrilla commanders to avoid assigning barely trained guerrillas directly in the front lines, establishing that they only have to serve in rear lines when coming fresh from basic training.|$|E

[...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E

These borderland forces have attracted passing attention at several times and places in the past, such cases as the Wesley persecution at Epworth, the Drummer of Tedworth, the Bells of Bealing, etc., startling the country for a time--each of them being an impingement of unknown forces upon human life. Then almost simultaneously came the Hydesville case in America and the Cideville disturbances in France, which were so marked that they could not be overlooked. From them sprang the whole modern movement which, reasoning upwards from small things to great, from raw things to developed ones, from phenomena to messages, is destined to give religion the firmest basis upon which it has ever stood. Therefore, humble and foolish as these manifestations may seem, they have been the seed of large developments, and are worthy of our respectful, though critical, attention.|$|E

60|$|He went to Arran {{and became}} a part of its life, living upon salt fish and eggs, talking Irish for the most part, but {{listening}} also to the beautiful English which has grown up in Irish-speaking districts, and takes its vocabulary from the time of Malory and of the translators of the Bible, but its idiom and its vivid metaphor from Irish. When Mr. Synge began to write in this language, Lady Gregory had already used it finely in her translations of Dr. Hyde's lyrics and plays, or of old Irish literature, but she had listened with different ears. He made his own selection of word and phrase, choosing what would express his own personality. Above all, he made word and phrase dance to a very strange rhythm, which will always, till his plays have created their own tradition, be difficult to actors who have not learned it from his lips. It is essential, for it perfectly fits the drifting emotion, the dreaminess, the vague yet measureless desire, for which he would create a dramatic form. It blurs definition, clear edges, everything that comes from the will, it turns imagination from all that is of the present, like a gold background in a religious picture, and it strengthens in every emotion whatever comes to it from far off, from brooding memory and dangerous hope. When he brought The Shadow of the Glen, his first play, to the Irish National Theatre Society, the players were puzzled by the rhythm, but gradually they became certain that his woman of the glens, as melancholy as a curlew, driven to distraction by her own sensitiveness, her own fineness, could not speak with any other tongue, that all his people would change their life if the rhythm changed. Perhaps no Irish countryman had ever that exact rhythm in his voice, but certainly if Mr. Synge had been born a countryman, he would have spoken like that. It makes the people of his imagination a little disembodied; <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> kind of innocence even in their anger and their cursing. It is part of its maker's attitude towards the world, for while it makes the clash of wills among his persons indirect and dreamy, it helps him to see the subject-matter of his art with wise, clear-seeing, unreflecting eyes; to preserve the innocence of good art in an age of reasons and purposes. Whether he write of old beggars by the roadside, lamenting over the misery and ugliness of life, or of an old Arran woman mourning her drowned sons, or of a young wife married to an old husband, he has no wish to change anything, to reform anything; all these people pass by as before an open window, murmuring strange, exciting words.|$|E
6000|$|Having thus taken {{a look at}} {{the general}} aspect of things, I had leisure to reflect on my situation, and the {{probable}} consequences of my arrest. For my life I had no great apprehensions, not as much as I ought to have had under the circumstances; but it did not strike me that I was in any great danger on that score. The American character, in general, is not blood-thirsty, and that of New England less so, perhaps, than that {{of the rest of the}} country. Nevertheless, in a case of property the tenacity of the men of that quarter of the country was proverbial, and I came to the conclusion that I should be detained, if possible, until all the lumber could be got to market and disposed of, as the only means of reaping the fruit of past labor. The possibility depended on the escape or the arrest of Sureflint. Should that Indian be taken, Thousandacres and his family would be as secure as ever in their wilderness; but on the other hand, should he escape, I might expect to hear from my friends in the course of the day. By resorting to a requisition on 'Squire Newcome, who was a magistrate, my tenants might be expected to make an effort in my behalf, when the only grounds of apprehension would be the consequences of the struggle. The squatters were sometimes dangerous under excitement, and when sustaining each other, with arms in their hands, in what they fancy to be their hard-earned privileges. There is no end to the delusions of men on such subjects, self-interest seeming completely to blind their sense of right; and I have often met with cases in which parties who were trespassers, and in a moral view, robbers, ab origine, have got really to fancy that their subsequent labors (every new blow of the axe being an additional wrong) gave a sort of sanctity to possessions, in the defence of which they were willing to die. It is scarcely necessary to say that such persons look only at themselves, entirely disregarding the rights of others; but one wonders where the fruits of all the religious instruction of the country are to be found, when opinions so loose and acts so flagrant are constantly occurring among us. The fact is, land is so abundant, and such vast bodies lie neglected and seemingly forgotten by their owners, that the needy are apt to think indifference authorizes invasions on such unoccupied property; and their own labor once applied, they are quick to imagine that <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> moral and legal interest in the soil; though in the eye of the law, and of unbiased reason, each new step taken in what is called the improvement of a [...] "betterment" [...] is but a farther advance in the direction of wrong-doing.|$|E
6000|$|We look in {{vain for}} any similar blemish in [...] "Les Misérables." [...] Here, on the other hand, there is perhaps the nearest {{approach}} to literary restraint that Hugo has ever made: there is here certainly the ripest and most easy development of his powers. It is the moral intention of this great novel to awaken us a little, if it may be--for such awakenings are unpleasant--to the great cost of the society that we enjoy and profit by, to the labour and sweat of those who support the litter, civilisation, in which we ourselves are so smoothly carried forward. People are all glad to shut their eyes; and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> very simple pleasure when they can forget that our laws commit a million individual injustices, to be once roughly just in the general; that the bread that we eat, and the quiet of the family, and all that embellishes life and makes it worth having, have to be purchased by death--by the deaths of animals, and the deaths of men wearied out with labour, and the deaths of those criminals called tyrants and revolutionaries, and the deaths of those revolutionaries called criminals. It is to something of all this that Victor Hugo wishes to open men's eyes in [...] "Les Misérables"; and this moral lesson is worked out in masterly coincidence with the artistic effect. The deadly weight of civilisation {{to those who are}} below presses sensibly on our shoulders as we read. A sort of mocking indignation grows upon us as we find Society rejecting, again and again, the services of the most serviceable; setting Jean Valjean to pick oakum, casting Galileo into prison, even crucifying Christ. There is a haunting and horrible sense of insecurity about the book. The terror we thus feel is a terror for the machinery of law, that we can hear tearing, in the dark, good and bad, between its formidable wheels with the iron stolidity of all machinery, human or divine. This terror incarnates itself sometimes and leaps horribly out upon us; as when the crouching mendicant looks up, and Jean Valjean, {{in the light of the}} street lamp, recognises the face of the detective; as when the lantern of the patrol flashes suddenly through the darkness of the sewer; or as when the fugitive comes forth at last at evening, by the quiet riverside, and finds the police there also, waiting stolidly for vice and stolidly satisfied to take virtue instead. The whole book is full of oppression, and full of prejudice, which is the great cause of oppression. We have the prejudices of M. Gillenormand, the prejudices of Marius, the prejudices in revolt that defend the barricade, and the throned prejudices that carry it by storm. And then we have the admirable but ill-written character of Javert, the man who had made a religion of the police, and would not survive the moment when he learned that there was another truth outside the truth of laws; a just creation, over which the reader will do well to ponder.|$|E

So {{in trees}} in general, and bushes, large or small, {{you will notice}} that, though the boughs spring irregularly and at various angles, there is a {{tendency}} in all to stoop less and less as they {{near the top of the}} tree. This structure, typified in the simplest possible terms at c, Fig. 17, is common to all trees that I know of, and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> certain plumy character, and aspect of unity in the hearts of their branches which are essential to their beauty. The stem does not merely send off a wild branch here and there to take its own way, but all the branches share in one great fountain-like impulse; each has a curve and a path to take, which fills a definite place, and each terminates all its minor branches at its outer extremity, so as to form a greater outer curve, whose character and proportion are peculiar for each species. That is to say, the general type or idea of a tree is not as a, Fig. 17, but as b, in which, observe, the boughs all carry their minor divisions right out to the bounding curve; not but that smaller branches, by thousands, terminate in the heart of the tree, but the idea and main purpose in every branch are to carry all its child branches well out to the air and light, and let each of them, however small, take its part in filling the united flow of the bounding curve, so that the type of each separate bough is again not a, but b, Fig. 18; approximating, that is to say, so far to the structure of a plant of broccoli as to throw the great mass of spray and leafage out to a rounded surface. Therefore beware of getting into a careless habit of drawing boughs with successive sweeps of the pen or brush, one hanging to the other, as in Fig. 19. If you look at the tree-boughs in any painting of Wilson's you will see this structure, and nearly every other that is to be avoided, in their intensest types. You will also notice that Wilson never conceives a tree as a round mass, but flat, as if it had been pressed and dried. Most people in drawing pines seem to fancy, in the same way, that the boughs come out only on two sides of the trunk, instead of all round it: always, therefore, take more pains in trying to draw the boughs of trees that grow towards you than those that go off to the sides; anybody can draw the latter, but the foreshortened ones are not so easy. It will help you in drawing them to observe that in most trees the ramification of each branch, though not of the tree itself, is more or less flattened, and approximates, in its position, to the look of a hand held out to receive something, or shelter something. If you take a looking-glass, and hold your hand before it slightly hollowed, with the palm upwards, and the fingers open, as if you were going to support the base of some great bowl, larger than you could easily hold; and sketch your hand as you see it in the glass with the points of the fingers towards you; it will materially help you in understanding the way trees generally hold out their hands: and if then you will turn yours with its palm downwards, as if you were going to try to hide something, but with the fingers expanded, you will get a good type of the action of the lower boughs in cedars and such other spreading trees.|$|E

[...] There lie levellers levelled, duns done up themselves, [...] There are booksellers finally laid on their shelves, [...] Horizontally there lie upright politicians, [...] Dose-a-dose with their patients sleep faultless physicians, [...] There are slave-drivers quietly whipt underground, [...] There bookbinders, done up in boards, are fast bound, [...] There card-players wait till the last trump be played, [...] There all the choice spirits get finally laid, [...] There the babe that's unborn is supplied with a berth, [...] There men without legs get their six feet of earth, [...] There lawyers repose, each wrapt up in his case, [...] There seekers of office are sure of a place, [...] There defendant and plaintiff get equally cast, [...] There shoemakers quietly stick to the last, [...] There brokers at length become silent as stocks, [...] There stage-drivers sleep without quitting their box, [...] And so forth and so forth and so forth and so on, [...] With this kind of stuff one might endlessly go on; [...] To come to the point, I may safely assert you [...] Will find in each yard every cardinal virtue;[G] [...] Each has six truest patriots: four discoverers of ether, [...] Who never had thought on't nor mentioned it either: [...] Ten poets, the greatest who ever wrote rhyme: [...] Two hundred and forty first men of their time: [...] One person whose portrait just gave the least hint [...] Its original had a most horrible squint: [...] One critic, most (what do they call it?) reflective, [...] Who never had used the phrase ob- or subjective; [...] Forty fathers of Freedom, of whom twenty bred [...] Their sons for the rice-swamps, at so much a head, [...] And their daughters for--faugh! thirty mothers of Gracchi: [...] Non-resistants who gave many a spiritual black eye: [...] Eight true friends of their kind, one of whom was a jailer: [...] Four captains almost as astounding as Taylor: [...] Two dozen of Italy's exiles who shoot us his [...] Kaisership daily, stern pen-and-ink Brutuses, [...] Who, in Yankee back-parlors, with crucified smile,[H] [...] Mount serenely their country's funereal pile: [...] Ninety-nine Irish heroes, ferocious rebellers [...] 'Gainst the Saxon in cis-marine garrets and cellars, [...] Who shake their dread fists o'er the sea and all that,-- [...] As long as a copper drops into the hat: [...] Nine hundred Teutonic republicans stark [...] From Vaterland's battles just won--in the Park, [...] Who the happy profession of martyrdom take [...] Whenever <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> chance at a steak: [...] Sixty-two second Washingtons: two or three Jacksons: [...] And so many everythings else that it racks one's [...] Poor memory too much to continue the list, [...] Especially now they no longer exist;-- [...] I would merely observe that you've taken to giving [...] The puffs that belong to the dead to the living, [...] And that somehow your trump-of-contemporary-doom's tones [...] Is tuned after old dedications and tombstones."-- ...|$|E
