50|$|Type B 731 (as well {{as whole}} 700 series) {{underwent}} during its long production many changes and modifications. Among {{the most significant}} belonged replacing of the noisy rear axles Rába with another that has not produced so much noise, change of the engine mounting and change the location of alternator, use of several types of engines LIAZ, initially aspirated, turbocharged later. In newer buses have also been used automatic gearbox Voith (apparently from 1991) instead of the product of Praga. Began to be mounted exhaust gas catalysators EKOS and between 1993 and 1994, the buses were equipped with intercooler and intake air (due to meet emission standards Euro1), which also led to modifications of the body - behind the third door was placed the <b>intake</b> <b>grille.</b> In the last buses from the year 1995 appeared motor Renault. These buses were numbered B 731.1659 and were produced in only 50 pieces. Due to the assortment offered gearbox with retarder to the engines LIAZ cars were B 731 since 1994 produced with extended rear (the very first bus with a very similar rear was already made in 1992, it was a prototype B17). These were types B 731.1667 and B 731.1669 with LIAZ engines and Voith gearbox with integrated retarder. The rear panel is identical to then produced 900 series.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the then}} Government edict of [...] "Export or die" [...] and steel {{allocated}} {{only to those}} who generated much needed dollar revenue, the Atlantic was designed specifically to appeal to North American tastes (certain aspects look like a 1949 Mercury and the bonnet (hood) brightwork looks similar to the Pontiac Chieftains of this era). The car featured up-to-the-minute detailing, with a wrap around windscreen, composed of a flat glass centre section with, tiny curved end panels. The front wings (fenders) sported twin 'Flying A' hood ornaments and swept down to a rounded tail, with spats enclosing the rear wheels. A centrally mounted third, main beam, headlight was built into the letter-box style air <b>intake</b> <b>grille,</b> and the then unheard of luxury of hydraulically powered windows and hood (convertible top), [...] "flashing indicators" [...] (blinkers) rather than trafficators, (for the United States market at least) and the option of EKCO or HMV Autocrat radios. The range-topping Austin was offered in a variety of [...] "jewelescent" [...] colours with names like 'seafoam green' and 'desert gold' but few of these brave new metallics were sold in the UK market. The convertible, a three window, drophead coupe had a simple fabric top, without rear quarter lights (opera windows), which butted up to the rear of a rather thick windscreen header rail. The fixed head, five window, Sports Saloon (hardtop), could be had with its roof painted or covered in fabric. This gave it the popular 'drophead or cabriolet' look; all the style with no leaks. Many photographs of this car are wrongly titled, due to observers confusing the fabric covered hardtop for a convertible. As its final party trick, the centre section of the three piece, wrap-around, rear window, could be lowered into the boot (trunk), for added ventilation by a remote winder above the front windscreen. Few people in the car's native Britain would have ever seen anything like the futuristically-styled Atlantic before, and certainly not from a conservative mainstream manufacturer like Austin. The radical Atlantic suffered, however, from the dramatically new Jaguar XK120, also launched at the 1948 Motor Show.|$|E

It weighed 336,000 lb and had 56,600 lb of Starting Tractive Effort. Gear ratio was 55:22, with the Locomotive Overspeed set at 83 mph. In May 1958, SP 6051 was painted in the experimental black with orange nose [...] "halloween" [...] paint scheme. It received the gray and scarlet [...] "bloody nose" [...] paint scheme shortly afterward, likely in 1959. SP 6051 was retired on December 24, 1969 and was donated to the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society {{at the end of}} the year along with Baldwin DRS-6-6-1500 5208 and EMD F7A 6402, largely through the efforts of SP Vice President Larry Hoyt. All three units were in turn deeded to the California State Railroad Museum on June 22, 1978 and placed on display near the Sacramento train station or stored at SP's Sacramento General Shops until the California State Railroad Museum was built. SP 6051 was cosmetically and mechanically restored in the early 1980s and is in its original 1955 appearance in the Daylight paint scheme.

5000|$|Instead of the {{conventional}} electric motor arrangement, one motor per axle, the locomotive had a somewhat unconventional motor arrangement: two large electric motors, one for each bogie, placed {{on top of the}} bogies driving the three axles via an external gearbox. The class initially had a lot of teething problems affecting the battery, radiator and power train. The original French design could not withstand the severe Finnish climate. For instance, hoods had to be fitted in Finland to the air <b>intakes</b> and ventilation <b>grilles</b> on the roof to prevent snow from entering the engines. The locomotive weight was much higher than specified and the driving characteristics were not particularly good. Accordingly, careless driving could result in a bumpy ride on poor sections of track (hence the nickname of [...] "Hyppyheikki" [...] or [...] "Jumping Heikki"). Not all the problems were solved, but this did not detract from the usefulness of the class in trains that needed a lot of power.The last use of the class was pulling trains on the unelectrified line between Tampere and Turku. When the last Dr13s were withdrawn in June 2000, the class had completed almost 40 years service, and the youngest locomotives were 35 years old.
