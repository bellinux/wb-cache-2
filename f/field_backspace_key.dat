50|$|In modern systems, the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> {{is often}} mapped to the delete {{character}} (0x7f in ASCII or Unicode), although the <b>backspace</b> <b>key's</b> function of deleting the character before the cursor remains.|$|R
50|$|GNOME Terminal {{supports}} {{a couple of}} different compatibility options for interfacing with older software that depends on varying keyboard-to-ASCII assignments. In computing, there has been ambiguity between the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> and delete key. When the user presses the <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> the computer can either delete the character before the cursor, or the character at the cursor, which introduces this ambiguity (see ASCII). GNOME Terminal allows the user specify which control character or escape sequence the delete and the <b>backspace</b> <b>keys</b> should generate. Users can specify this option on a per-profile basis.|$|R

50|$|For the Italian {{market the}} {{keyboard}} {{is in the}} QZERTY layout, as with most Italian machines (excluding modern computer keyboards). Aside from the typing keys, the keyboard includes a space bar, two shift keys, one caps lock <b>key,</b> a <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> and a margin release key. Of these, only the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> bears a mark on it (an arrow pointing right), while the other five mentioned are left anonymous.|$|R
50|$|The <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> is {{commonly}} used to go back a page or up one level in graphical web or file browsers.|$|R
50|$|Editing of the typed-in {{line was}} done on the screen via the delete or <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and the entire line was {{transmitted}} to the computer when the send key was pressed.|$|R
25|$|An {{additional}} defining (albeit optional) {{feature of}} the Colemak layout {{is the lack of}} a Caps Lock key; an additional <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> occupies the position typically occupied by Caps Lock on modern keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|On some keyboards, the {{backslash}} key (...) can {{be found}} {{to the left of}} the enter key, rather than on the top row {{to the left of the}} <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> where it resides normally.|$|R
2500|$|The Insert key {{is mainly}} used to switch between overtype mode, {{in which the}} cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a {{character}} at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position [...] "back" [...] towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a <b>Backspace</b> <b>key.</b> The <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> deletes the preceding character.|$|R
50|$|The Delete key is {{typically}} smaller and less-conveniently located than the <b>Backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and on keyboards where space is limited, for example those omitting the numeric keypad or virtual keyboards on mobile devices, {{it is often}} omitted altogether.|$|R
5000|$|Note that on some keyboards, the [...] "ű" [...] key {{is located}} {{to the left}} of the Enter key, while on others it is placed {{to the left of}} the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> (see the two {{pictures}} on the right).|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboard}} uses QWERTY, AZERTY {{and various}} other layouts. Apart from the typing keys, the keyboard includes a Space bar, two Shift keys, a caps lock, a <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> margin release key, paragraph indentation key and a tab-stop set/unset key.|$|R
50|$|It {{was common}} that the 0 numeral was omitted (in favour {{of using the}} {{uppercase}} O letter), and there were also some typewriters without the 1 numeral (with the lowercase L being used to achieve it). Also absent were symbols such as the exclamation mark (achieved by typing an apostrophe and overwriting it with a period using the <b>backspace</b> <b>key),</b> the asterisk (achieved in a similar way, with lowercase X and the plus or minus sign — for eight- or six-pointed asterisks, respectively), the number sign (which was achieved by some through intricate methods involving partial depressions of the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> to overwrite the equals sign with two slashes), and the inequality sign (typing an equals sign and overwriting it with one slash).|$|R
5000|$|Algebraic mode {{works by}} the user {{entering}} an expression, then pressing [...] to have it evaluated. The expression appears on the upper line of the display, the result on the lower line. The expression can be edited using the arrow and <b>backspace</b> <b>keys,</b> and re-evaluated as desired.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: IBM Selectric II (with dual Latin/Hebrew typeball and keyboard).

Note also the two typing position scales, one numbered left to right, the other right to left.|$|R
50|$|Windows uses {{point and}} click; with SSP, the most {{important}} function is Enter/Rec Adv, also known as Enter. Under Windows, the operator moves from field to field with the mouse click or by pressing the Tab key; with SSP, Field Exit and <b>Field</b> <b>Backspace</b> are also important.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Keyboard of a {{mechanical}} typewriter, produced 1964 by Olympia Werke, Germany. The key with four dots is the margin release. The arrow key under [...] is the <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> which is pointing {{in the direction}} the paper would move rather than the way a cursor would move (as on a modern computer keyboard).|$|R
25|$|In {{informal}} {{applications such}} as personal letters where low priority {{was placed on the}} appearance of the document, or conversely in highly formal applications in which it was important that any corrections be obvious, the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> could be used to back up over the error and then overstrike it with hyphens, slashes, Xs, or the like.|$|R
50|$|The first {{compilation}} of It's Geek 2 Me tech toons was self-published {{by the author}} in 2012 as a paperback titled Wish Your Mouth Had A <b>Backspace</b> <b>Key</b> in the United States through Amazon.com. In 2013, a new compilation titled It's Geek 2 Me - Total Timepass Tech Toons was published by Hachette India for the Indian subcontinent.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is notable}} that the Enter key {{has moved to}} a half-length [...] "spacebar" [...] {{position}} alongside the spacebar itself. Each is now used by one thumb alone; left for Enter and right for Space. Also, the Tab and <b>Backspace</b> <b>keys</b> are conveniently and centrally located within the array of letters, as are the comma and period.|$|R
50|$|Most Selectric IIIs and Electronic Typewriters {{only had}} keys for 92 {{printable}} characters; the 96-character keyboard was an optional feature. Fitting the additional keys onto the keyboard required shrinking the Return <b>key</b> and <b>Backspace</b> <b>keys.</b> This was annoying to many typists, {{so it was}} not the default configuration. The keytops on the Selectric III and Electronic Typewriters were larger and more square than those on earlier Selectrics.|$|R
50|$|Pressing the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> on a {{computer}} terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or Backspace, a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control-H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which {{did not have the}} backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H) when the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> was pressed. Even if a terminal did interpret backspace by deleting the preceding character, the system receiving the text might not. Then, the sender's screen would show a message without the supposedly deleted text, while that text, and the deletion codes, would be visible to the recipient. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough; in this case, however, the ^H symbol is faked by typing a regular '^' key followed by typing a regular 'H' key.|$|R
50|$|Since {{many people}} are {{familiar}} with word processors, the notation aspect of MusicEase is designed to work much like a word processing program. For instance, pressing the G key enters the note G. Pressing the Delete <b>key</b> (Mac) or <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> (Windows) then deletes this note. Pressing the Enter key begins a new system. Pressing the Delete <b>key</b> (Mac) or <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> (Windows) {{at the beginning of}} a system appends it to the previous system. Blocks can be cut from one location and pasted into another location and then everything can be reformatted with just several keystrokes (using MusicEase's cast-off function which redetermines system breaks so that the density of notes in each system is roughly the same followed by the justify function to stretch/shrink all staves so they horizontally span from the left margin to the right margin.) Most functions are invoked via key presses which allows fast content entry as opposed to using the mouse to drag music notational elements from palettes to staves which generally requires more effort.|$|R
2500|$|The Perkins Brailler is a [...] "braille typewriter" [...] {{with a key}} {{corresponding}} {{to each of the}} six dots of the braille code, a space <b>key,</b> a <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and a line space key. [...] Like a manual typewriter, it has two side knobs to advance paper through the machine and a carriage return lever above the keys. [...] The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.|$|R
5000|$|In other cases, the Delete key {{is in its}} {{original}} IBM notebook position of above {{and to the right}} of the <b>Backspace</b> <b>key.</b> Many laptops add rows of smaller keys above the Function key line to add keys on a non-standard size keyboard. On this row of smaller keys, the position of the Delete key is positioned at or near the right-hand end. On Apple's line of laptops (e.g. the MacBook and MacBook Pro), the forward delete function can be achieved using the [...] key combination.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: A {{comparison}} of common mechanical layouts. The ISO mechanical layout (center left) is common, e.g., in the United Kingdom. Compared with the ANSI layout (top left), the enter key is vertical rather than horizontal. In addition, the left shift key is smaller, {{to make room}} for an additional key to its right. The JIS mechanical layout (bottom right) is the basis for Japanese keyboards. Here it is the right-hand shift key that is smaller. Furthermore, the space bar and <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> are also smaller, {{to make room for}} four additional keys.|$|R
5000|$|The word tab {{derives from}} the word tabulate, which means [...] "to arrange data in a tabular, or table, form." [...] When a person wanted to type a table (of numbers or text) on a typewriter, {{there was a lot}} of {{time-consuming}} and repetitive use of the space bar and <b>backspace</b> <b>key.</b> To simplify this, a horizontal bar was placed in the mechanism called the tabulator rack. Pressing the tab key would advance the carriage to the next tabulator stop. The original tabulator stops were adjustable clips that could be moved from place to place on the tabulator rack. Fredric Hillard filed a patent application for such a mechanism in 1900.|$|R
50|$|The IBM DisplayWriter had a {{portrait}} monitor and keyboard with large <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> {{as it was}} designed for use in word processing instead of spreadsheets. Lanier, Wang, and CPT also made competing dedicated word processing computers with portrait modes. The height {{of the market for}} these computes was the late 1970s and early 1980s, prior to the introduction of the IBM PC. However, according to a long-time regional manager of the IBM personal computer division, speaking in confidence to the author of this entry in the mid-1980s, when the IBM PC was introduced, no portrait mode was made available for two reasons: (1) Top management didn't want the PC division to undermine the DisplayWriter product, (2) The computer was designed with spreadsheets and software development in mind, not word processing. Thus, it had a keyboard without a large <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> at first, substituting a key widely used in computer software writing. Within a short period of time, the DisplayWriter and other dedicated word processors were no longer available. However, Portrait Display Labs leaped into this market niche, producing a number of rotating CRT monitors as well as software which {{could be used as a}} driver for many video cards. The later advent of the World Wide Web, whose pages are largely in portrait mode, failed to result in a widespread return to portrait displays. As of November 2011, for instance, HP no longer sells monitors in portrait mode, although they have a display stand which permits the user to attach two monitors and rotate either from landscape to display.|$|R
5000|$|Navigation keys or cursor keys {{include a}} variety of keys which move the cursor to {{different}} positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor {{to the beginning of}} the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next tab stop.The Insert key is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further.

On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a <b>Backspace</b> <b>key.</b> The <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> deletes the preceding character.Lock keys lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The lock keys include Scroll lock, Num lock (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and Caps lock.|$|R
50|$|Like the Perkins, the Mountbatten has a key {{corresponding}} {{to each of}} the six dots of the braille code. By simultaneously pressing different combinations of the six keys, users can create any of the characters in the braille code. In addition to these six keys, the Mountbatten has a space <b>key,</b> a <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and a new line key. Like a manual typewriter, it has a knob to advance paper through the machine, although unlike the Perkins the bar does not move. There is a Return key rather than a carriage return lever. The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.|$|R
5000|$|In late January 2015, Attkisson {{appeared}} before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a confirmation hearing for Loretta Lynch, President Obama's nominee to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder.

[...] "CBS News told the OIG that they did not conduct any analysis on her personal computer." ...|$|R
500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you kind of {{have to go back and}} look at your mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future." [...] The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic's Great Turtle Race.|$|R
5000|$|In early designs, some {{characters}} were produced by printing two symbols with the carriage {{in the same}} position. For instance, the exclamation point, which shares a key with the numeral 1 on modern keyboards, could be reproduced by using a three-stroke combination of an apostrophe, a backspace, and a period. A semicolon ( [...] ;) was produced by printing a comma ( [...] ,) over a colon (:). As the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> is slow in simple mechanical typewriters (the carriage was heavy and optimized {{to move in the}} opposite direction), a more professional approach was to block the carriage by pressing and holding the space bar while printing all characters that needed to be in a shared position. To make this possible, the carriage was designed to advance forward only after releasing the space bar.|$|R
30|$|Firstly, {{the user}} will select {{the mode of}} operation. In the {{training}} mode, the access-control system requests the user to type in the login ID and a new password. The system then asks the user to reenter the password several times in order to stabilize his/her typing pattern. The resulting latency and pressure keystroke templates are saved in the database. During training, if the user mistypes the password the system prompts user to reenter the password from the beginning. The use of <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> is not allowed as it disrupts the biometric pattern. When registration is done, system administrator uses these training samples to model user keystroke profiles. The design of user profiles is done offline. After that, the administrator saves the users' keystroke template models along with the associated user ID and password in the access-control database.|$|R
50|$|The Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian Latin and Slovene {{keyboard}} layout has five additional special characters Č, Ć, Ž, Š and Đ. This {{keyboard layout}} was standardized in the 1980s in Yugoslavia. Characters Ć and Đ {{are only part}} of Gaj's Latin alphabet but not part of the Slovene alphabet, nevertheless they remain in Slovenian keyboards (for economic reasons, for historical reasons and for writing words in the closely related South Slavic languages). The Ž is {{on the right side of}} the Ć key on keyboards which have a longer <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and the usual inverted L shaped Enter key. The layout makes heavy use of the AltGr (right Alt) key for non-alphabetic characters and dead key combinations for adding diacritics to Latin characters. It is possible to type German and Italian using only the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian keyboard layout.|$|R
