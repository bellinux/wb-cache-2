5000|$|In {{reference}} to a national tour in 1991, it was written that <b>Demolition</b> <b>Hammer</b> played [...] "lightning-fast songs with complex structure and shifting rhythms." [...] Another writer referred to Reynolds and Sykes as [...] "riff machines" [...] while also complimenting the band's songwriting ability. The change of style heard on Time Bomb drew ire from some fans of thrash metal.|$|E
50|$|Fast paced thrash metal {{became less}} {{popular in the}} '90s. Daze and Reilly left the band to form the group Deviate NY. Former Malevolent Creation drummer Alex Marquez joined Reynolds and Sykes to write {{material}} for another project. The label wished to release the songs with the band's original name. The result was the 1994 album Time Bomb with a new <b>Demolition</b> <b>Hammer</b> logo on the cover. It was slower and lacked guitar solos. The style {{was similar to that}} of groups like Pantera and Machine Head. After playing one of their final shows at Milwaukee MetalFest in the summer of 1995, <b>Demolition</b> <b>Hammer</b> broke up. Marquez and Reynolds were offered new gigs with Solstice. Daze died of globefish poisoning while traveling in Africa on March 11, 1996. With Demolition Hammer's music becoming increasingly hard to come by, Century Media released Necrology: A Complete Anthology in 2008. It included every title from their first three albums, two pre-production demos from Time Bomb, and one video clip.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Morgoth {{recorded}} {{their second}} demo Resurrection Absurd in a twenty-four-track studio, which {{was released by}} Century Media {{in the same year}} as an EP. The band then toured Germany in support of Pestilence and Autopsy. The Eternal Fall was recorded shortly after the tour finished, which was quickly followed by a second tour with <b>Demolition</b> <b>Hammer</b> and Obituary. Grewe stopped playing bass and Sebastian Swart joined as the bass player.|$|E
50|$|A {{jackhammer}} (pneumatic drill or <b>demolition</b> <b>hammer</b> in British English) is a pneumatic or electro-mechanical {{tool that}} combines a hammer directly with a chisel. It {{was invented by}} William Mcreavy, who then sold the patent to Charles Brady King. Hand-held jackhammers are generally powered by compressed air, but some are also powered by electric motors. Larger jackhammers, such as rig mounted hammers used on construction machinery, are usually hydraulically powered. They are typically used to break up rock, pavement, and concrete.|$|E
50|$|<b>Demolition</b> <b>Hammer</b> {{arrived on}} the East Coast thrash metal scene circa 1986. The {{original}} line-up consisted of Steve Reynolds as the vocalist and on bass, James Reilly on guitar, and John Salerno on drums. Their first demo tape, Skull Fracturing Nightmare, was released in 1988. It gained notice from fans of the genre and independent record labels. Derek Sykes was brought in as a second guitarist and Vincent Civitano (a.k.a. Vinny Daze) replaced Salerno. Their second demo, Necrology, secured the group a recording contract with Century Media Records.|$|E

50|$|The {{music of}} Flayed Disciple is {{composed}} by every band member; the lyrics on 'Death Hammer' {{were written by}} Tolfree and Whyte. Their lyrical content has come up against some controversy in recent times, as the themes of serial killers, rape, murder, paedophilia and atheism feature in most songs. The musical style is heavily influenced by the early 80's thrash metal scene from the Bay Area of California. Bands such as Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer are the reason they started writing music. Recently, heavier bands such as Cannibal Corpse, <b>Demolition</b> <b>Hammer,</b> Napalm Death and Deicide have provided the influence they needed to go from a thrash band to a thrash/death crossover.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Compaction {{is one of}} the key {{processes}} in the construction of road pavement layers. Not only is it significant in ensuring the structural integrity of the material in the road layers, but it also has an influence on the engineering properties and performance of the soil material. A poorly compacted material is characterised by low density, high porosity and below standard shear strength. This, as a result causes rutting, moisture susceptibility, potholing, corrugations and passability problems on the road. Therefore, it is vitally important that field compaction is done correctly. For this reason, laboratory compaction methods have been developed to simulate the field compaction process in the laboratory. The Mod AASHTO test has long been used as the laboratory compaction method of choice by virtue of its simplicity and the lack of bulky equipment required. However, previous studies have established that the Modified AASHTO method does not adequately simulate field compaction criteria especially for cohesionless materials. Two reasons have been advanced; The Mod AASHTO compaction method does not adequately simulate the compaction done in the field when the granular mix is laid; The compaction method may cause disintegration of the material. Alternative tests have been considered and much research has focused upon the use of a modified <b>demolition</b> <b>hammer</b> (vibratory hammer) for laboratory compaction of granular materials. This study undertook to evaluate the influence of test factors pertinent to the vibratory hammer compaction method. The influence of these test factors on compaction time and obtainable material density was assessed with the objective of developing a compaction method for granular materials. Vibratory hammer compaction tests were conducted on G 3 hornfels, G 4 hornfels and G 7 sandstone material types and to a lesser extent, reclaimed asphalt (RA). Densities obtained were referenced to Mod AASHTO compaction density. Findings of the study showed that, the mass of the tamping foot has a significant influence on the obtainable compaction density. Other factors such as, moisture content, frequency and frame rigidity were also found to affect compaction with the vibratory hammer. In addition, it is shown that the surcharge load does not significantly influence the obtainable compaction density but does contribute to the confinement of the material and restricts the upward bounce of the hammer. On the basis of the results and findings, a compaction method was proposed, incorporating test parameters and factors that would provide ideal results for a set compaction time. Repeatability tests showed that, the developed vibratory hammer compaction method was effective in compacting graded crushed stone material types (i. e. G 3 and G 4) and probably RA. The test was not as effective on the G 7 material. Further studies on this material (G 7) are required. In addition to the previous testing regime, a comparative assessment of the developed vibratory hammer compaction method in relation to the vibratory table method was done. The results show that the vibratory hammer is capable of producing specimens of densities comparable to those of the vibratory table. A sieve analysis undertaken before and after compaction showed that compaction with the developed vibratory hammer compaction method does not result in any significant material disintegration. Based on the results of this study, a specification for the determination of maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of granular material using the vibratory hammer is recommended. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Kompaksie is een van die belangrikste prosesse in die konstruksie van die padplaveisel. Dit is nie net waardevol vir die versekering van strukturele integriteit van die materiaal, maar dit het ook 'n invloed op die ingenieurseienskappe en vermoë van die grond materiaal. 'n Swak gekompakteerde materiaal word gekenmerk deur 'n laë digtheid, hoë porositeit, on onvoldoende skuifweerstand. Die kenmerke maak die material vatbaar vir vogen. Lei tot spoorvorming, slaggate, golwe en deurgangs probleme op die pad. Dit is dus uiters noodsaaklik dat veld kompaksie korrek gedoen word. Om hierdie rede, is kompaksie metodes in die laboratorium ontwikkel om sodaend veldkompaksie te simuleer. Die “Mod AASHTO” laboratorium kompaksie toets is die gekose laboratorium kompaksie metode op grond van sy eenvoudigheid en gebruik van minimale toerusting. Vorige studies het egter bevestig dat die “Mod AASHTO”-metode nie veldkompaksie akkuraat kan simuleer nie, veral vir kohesielose materiaal. As gevolg van twee hoofredes; Die Mod AASHTO kompaksiemetode is nie ‘n realistiese en vergelykende simmulering van kompaksie soos dit in die veld gedoen word nie; Die kompaksie metode mag verbrokkeling van die materiaal veroorsaak. Alternatiewe toetse was oorweeg en baie navorsing het gefokus op die gebruik van 'n aangepaste vibrerende hamer. Hierdie studie het onderneem om verskeie relevante toetsfaktore van die vibrerende hamer en hul invloed op die kompaksie en verkrygbare digtheid te bestudeer. Die invloed van hierdie toetsfaktore op kompaksietyd en verkrygbare materiaal digtheid was geassesseer met die doel om 'n kompaksiemetode vir granulêre materiaal te ontwikkel. Vibrerende hammer kompaksietoetse was uitgevoer op G 3 hornfels, G 4 hornfels en G 7 sandsteen materiaal en tot 'n mindere mate herwinde asfalt. Digthede verkry was verwys na die Mod AASHTO kompaksie digtheid. Resultate van die studie het getoon dat die gewig van die stamp voet ‘n merkwaardige invloed het op die verkrygbare kompaksie digtheid. Ander faktore soos voginhoud, frekwensie en raam styfheid het ook getoon om kompaksiedigtheid te beïnvloed met die vibrerende hammer. Benewens was ook getoon dat die toeslaglading geen beduidende invloed het op die verkrygbare kompaksie digtheid nie, maar wel bydrae tot die inperking van die materiaal en verhoed die vertikale terugslag van die hammer. Gebaseer op die resultate en bevindinge was ‘n kompaksiemetode voorgestel wat toets parameters integreer met toetsfaktore en tot volg ideale resultate vir ‘n gegewe kompaksietyd voorsien. Herhaalde kalibrasie toetse het getoon dat die ontwikkelde kompaksiemetode effektief is in die kompaktering van gegradeerde gebreekte klip materiaaltipes (G 3 en G 4) en moontlik herwanne asfalt. Die toets was nie so doeltreffend op die G 7 materiaal nie. Verdere studies op hierdie materiaal (G 7) is dus nodig. Addisioneel tot die vorige toets, is bevind dat ‘n vergelykende assesering van die ontwikkelde vibrerende hammer kompaksiemetode in verhouding tot die vibrerende tafel. Die resultate wys dat die vibrerende hammer die vermoë het om toetsmonsters met digthede vergelykbaar met die vibrerende tafel te produseer. Sifanalise voor en na kompaksie het getoon dat verdigting met die ontwikkelde vibrerende hamer kompaksie metode nie lei tot die disintegrasie van die materiaal nie. Gebasseer op die resultate van dié studie was ‘n spesifikasie vir die bepaling van maksimum droé digtheid en optimale voginhoud van granulêre material aangeraai...|$|E
