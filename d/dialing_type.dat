A double-ended monopole antenna is proposed as the lead signal inducer between the inside and the outside areas of the TEM cell. The coupling voltage at the TEM cell ports and the field distribution within the area under test (AUT) {{were found to be}} a function of the phone position, polarization, and <b>dialing</b> <b>type.</b> The measurements for a GSM 850 MHz cellular phone showed that the optimum setup is achievable when the phone is placed outside the TEM cell and co-polarized with the signal leader.

The proposed setup can be utilized in studies and experiments related to the radio frequency effects on biological cells and organs. 1...|$|E

A transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell was designed and fitted with a double ended monopole antenna as a signal leader in order to couple electromagnetic radiation from GSM 900 and 1800 commercial cellular phones into a usable area of the cell. The double-ended monopole antenna acts as a signal leader for incoming and outgoing signals between the TEM cell's outer surfaces. Biological subjects can be placed at the usable area for biological effects of electromagnetic radiation studies. The amplitudes of the forward and backward travelling mode excitation and the input impedance of the signal leader were analyzed in the study. It showed good agreement with known results from other experiments and lab simulations. The electric field distribution was studied with such varying parameters as the cellular phone position, polarization, <b>dialing</b> <b>type,</b> and dialing frequency. Analysis showed that the electric field uniformity can be improved with either the use of a shorter signal leader or by reducing the dimensions (size) of the TEM cell. ...|$|E

40|$|Wider {{application}} is constantly being made of physical methods by {{workers in the}} biological field. Such methods are often easy to apply and enable {{a large number of}} determinations to be made in a minimum of time. Still wider applications of such methods would doubtless be possible if adequate interpretations of the results were available. Electrical conductivity is a simple and precise determination which has proved a valuable tool in many branches of science but which has not found any wide applica-tion in studies of bacterial metabolism. Oker-Blom used the method in the study of fermentation by B. coli and B. typhosus but failed to reach any very definite conclusions. Sturges and Rettger used the method in a study of the proteolytic activity of bacterial enzymes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a resume of conductivity changes as correlated with ammonia and amino acid changes in cultures of C. sporogenes and C. flabelliferum in several media.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the design, fabrication, modeling, and characterization of magnetostrictive thin film mirror deflectors, especially suitable for <b>Dial</b> <b>type</b> of Lidar system applications that require high frequency operations. A methodology of designing a magnetostrictive thin film microactuator is developed that can assist in selecting the material, geometry, and operating parameters of the magnetostrictive thin film, substrate, and the magnetic field driver. One suitable method of fabrication of deflectors is to deposit magnetostrictive materials by sputtering over a silicon substrate that can be fabricated using microfabrication processes. Several types of sample deflectors were fabricated using TbFeB, TbDyFe, and SmFeB as alternate magnetostrictive materials. To measure the deflection of the deflector, a non- contact optical measurement system was custom developed. To study the performance of the deflector statically and dynamically, analytical, numerical, and experimental works were performed. The static analytical model, based on linear elasticity, is used to illustrate the effect of geometry and material on the performance of the deflector. The finite element analysis of flux distribution in film layer showed that the design of deflector must be done at system level that includes the magnetic field driver. As expected, the simulation result clearly shows the effect of eddy current losses when operating at high frequency. Also, the experimental results show that SmFeB deflectors saturate at around 1500 Gauss, which is much lower than the deflectors made of other materials such as TbFeB and TbDyFe. It indicates that SmFeB material has low anisotropy energy and its low field response is more suitable for MEMS devices. Deflectors were also studied dynamically. The experimental results from considering the effect of magnetic bias field match the prediction from a uniaxial model. SmFeB deflectors show higher vibration amplitude than the other deflectors. Several other interesting phenomena were observed that include the tunable torsion and bending modes, superharmonic response, hysteresis effect, and variance of resonance frequencies. The highest operating frequency, obtained and verified at which 5 mrad of deflection obtained in our work is around 30 kHz due to the limitation of the measurement system. However, based on the preliminary work the magnetostrictive thin film deflectors are potential candidates for even higher frequency applications. This work represents the initial step necessary to develop a high frequency magnetostrictive mirror deflector. Much work is needed, starting from accurate magnetostrictive material properties, to fully exploit the magnetostrictive thin film...|$|R
50|$|Lidar {{systems can}} be used to measure {{concentration}} profiles of atmospheric gases (i.e., water vapor, ozone), and industrial emissions (i.e., SO2, NO2, HCl). Such measurements are performed using two basic types of lidar; Raman lidar and Differential Absorption lidars (DIAL). In the first type, the Raman lidar detects the scattering of the laser beam due to Raman scattering. The frequency shift induced by such scattering is unique for each molecule, and acts as a “signature” to detect its specific contribution. The second <b>type,</b> <b>DIAL</b> systems, emit two beams with two distinct frequencies. One beam is tuned exactly on a molecular absorption line and the other beam is tuned in a nearby wavelength without molecular absorption. By examining the intensity difference of the scattered light at the two frequencies, DIAL systems can separate the contribution of the specific molecule in the atmosphere.|$|R

For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate [...] "all circuits busy," [...] or {{a problem in the}} destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line {{to see if it was}} busy or out of order.|$|R
