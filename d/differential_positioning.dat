50|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> of the {{activating}} function 2 (AF-2) helix 12 in the ligand-binding domain by the bound ligand {{determines whether}} the ligand has an agonistic and antagonistic effect. In agonist-bound receptors, helix 12 is positioned adjacent to helices 3 and 5. Helices 3, 5, and 12 together form a binding surface for an NR box motif contained in coactivators with the canonical sequence LXXLL (where L represents leucine or isoleucine and X is any amino acid). Unliganded (apo) receptors or receptors bound to antagonist ligands turn helix 12 {{away from the}} LXXLL-binding surface that leads to preferential binding of a longer leucine-rich motif, LXXXIXXX(I/L), present on the corepressors NCoR1 or SMRT. In addition, some cofactors bind to ER through the terminals, the DNA-binding site or other binding sites. Thus, one compound can be an ER agonist in a tissue rich in coactivators but an ER antagonist in tissues rich in corepressors.|$|E

In this contribution, we develop {{a model of}} real-time kinematic decimeter-level positioning with BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) triple-frequency signals over medium distances. The ambiguities of two extra-wide-lane (EWL) combinations are fixed first, and then a wide lane (WL) combination is reformed based on the two EWL combinations for positioning. Theoretical analysis and empirical analysis is given of the ambiguity fixing rate and the positioning accuracy of the presented method. The {{results indicate that the}} ambiguity fixing rate can be up to more than 98 % when using BDS medium baseline observations, which is much higher than that of dual-frequency Hatch-Melbourne-Wübbena (HMW) method. As for positioning accuracy, decimeter level accuracy can be achieved with this method, which is comparable to that of carrier-smoothed code <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> method. Signal interruption simulation experiment indicates that the proposed method can realize fast high-precision positioning whereas the carrier-smoothed code <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> method needs several hundreds of seconds for obtaining high precision results. We can conclude that a relatively high accuracy and high fixing rate can be achieved for triple-frequency WL method with single-epoch observations, displaying significant advantage comparing to traditional carrier-smoothed code <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> method...|$|E

40|$|Precise {{kinematic}} <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> {{using the}} {{global positioning system}} (GPS) at a marine platform usually requires a relatively short distance (e. g. 500 km) to a land-based reference station. As an alternative, precise point positioning (PPP) is normally considered free from this limiting requirement. However, due to the prerequisite of network-based satellite products, PPP at a remote marine platform may still be affected by its distance to the reference network. Hence, this paper investigates this scenario by configuring rings of reference stations with different radii centered on a to-be-positioned marine platform. Particularly, we applied ambiguity resolution at a single station to PPP by estimating uncalibrated phase delays (UPDs). We used three rings of reference stations centered on a vessel, with radii of roughly 900, 2, 000 and 3, 600 km, to determine satellite clocks and UPDs independently. For comparison, we also performed <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> based on a single reference station with baseline lengths of about 400, 1, 700 and 2, 800 km. We demonstrate that, despite the increasing ring-network radius to a few 1, 000 km, the overall change in accuracy of the satellite clocks that are used at the vessel is smaller than 0. 02 ns, and the RMS values of differences between the three sets of narrow-lane UPD estimates are around 0. 05 cycles only. Moreover, the kinematic positioning accuracy of PPP {{is affected by the}} increasing ring-network radius, but can still achieve several centimeters after ambiguity resolution when the vessel is over a few 1, 000 km away from the ring network, showing better performance than that of <b>differential</b> <b>positioning.</b> Therefore, we propose that ambiguity- fixed PPP can be used at remote marine platforms that support precise oceanographic and geophysical applications in open oceans...|$|E

40|$|Many {{applications}} in navigation, land surveying, land title definitions and mapping have been simplified and more precise due to accessibility of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Therefore {{the demand for}} using advanced GPS techniques in different surveying applications becomes essential. <b>Differential</b> <b>positioning</b> was {{the only source of}} accurate positioning for years despite its cost. The Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique is viable alternative to <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> method where the user with single receiver can attain positioning accuracy in centimeter or decimeter level. In recent years, many organizations introduced online (GPS-PPP) processing services capable of determining accurate geocentric positions using GPS observations. These services provide GPS estimates to the user in free and unlimited access formats from the internet. This paper investigates the accuracy of Canadian Spatial Reference System (CSRS) Precise Point Positioning (PPP) (CSRS-PPP) service supervised by the Geodetic Survey Division (GSD), Canada. Single frequency static GPS observations have been collected over three points from three baselines with different lengths 1. 6, 7 and 10 km in various elapsed time 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The discrepancies between the CSRS-PPP estimates and the traditional differential GPS solutions were computed.

Comparing with the conventional differential technology, the differential technology based on the virtual reference station can minimize {{the size of the}} rover station which is of great significance for the small system such as the mini-type unmanned vehicle, smart ammunitions and so on. Due to the high cost of the GPS receivers in the market which can’t be redeveloped and the limitation of their interface, it is not suitable for the application of the embedded system. In this paper, the receiver based on the aforementioned method is proposed to realize the real time <b>differential</b> <b>positioning.</b> Firstly, the concept of <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> based on real time kinematic is explained.

40|$|Background: Roundabout (Robo) receptors {{and their}} ligand Slit are {{important}} regulators of axon guidance and cell migration. The development of Drosophila embryonic sense organs provides a neuronal migration paradigm where the in vivo roles of Slit and Robo can be assayed using genetics. Results: Here {{we show that}} Slit-Robo signaling controls migration of Drosophila larval sensory neurons {{that are part of}} the Chordotonal (Cho) stretch receptor organs. We used live imaging to show that abdominal Cho organs normally migrate ventrally during development, whereas thoracic Cho organs do not. Robo 2 overexpression in cis (in the sensory neurons) or in trans (on neighboring visceral mesoderm) transforms abdominal organs to a thoracic morphology and position by blocking migration, while loss of Slit-Robo signaling produces a reverse transformation in which thoracic organs migrate ectopically. Rescue and tissue-specific knockout experiments indicate that trans signaling by Robo 2 contributes to the normal positioning of the thoracic Cho organs. The <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> of Cho organs between the thorax and abdomen is known to be regulated by Hox genes, and we show that the essential Hox cofactor Homothorax, represses Robo 2 expression in the abdominal visceral mesoderm. Conclusions: Our results suggest that segment-specific neuronal migration patterns are directed through a novel signaling complex (the “Slit sandwich”) in which Robo 2 on the thoracic visceral mesoderm binds to Slit and presents it to Robo receptors on Cho neurons. The <b>differential</b> <b>positioning</b> of Cho organs between thorax and abdomen may be determined by Hox gene-mediated repression of robo 2...|$|E
