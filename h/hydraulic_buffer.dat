5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
25|$|Mark I gun's recoil {{system was}} in two tubes above the barrel {{and used a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> with a hydro-spring {{recuperator}} to return the barrel to its firing position; Mark II gun had a hydro-pneumatic system below the barrel.|$|E
25|$|The gun {{carriage}} {{was designed to}} be towed behind a limber and six horses; the lower carriage comprised a box trail. The QF 4.5 fired a separate round (i.e. shell and cartridge were loaded separately). The barrel was of built-up type, with a horizontal sliding block breech. A limited traverse saddle supported the elevating mass and a shield. It was designed for one-man laying with both traverse and elevation controls and sights on the left. The recoil system was below the barrel and used a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> with a hydro-pneumatic recuperator to return the barrel to its firing position.|$|E
5000|$|... finally, the {{structure}} {{was equipped with}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffers</b> installed between the towers and the floor system of the deck to damp longitudinal motion of the main span. The effectiveness of the hydraulic dampers was nullified, however, because the seals of the units were damaged when the bridge was sand-blasted before being painted.|$|R
50|$|Cradle recoil {{means that}} the gun recoils {{backward}} in its cradle, retarded and stopped by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffers.</b> It is returned to battery, or the firing position, by either helical springs or by air in a pneumatic recuperator cylinder that is compressed {{by the force of}} recoil. This is the most common method used for lighter railroad guns and for virtually all field artillery designed after the French introduced their Canon de 75 modèle 1897.|$|R
50|$|Top-{{carriage}} recoil {{is where}} the gun is mounted in an upper carriage that moves on wheels on fixed rails. The gun and upper carriage recoil together, restrained by the usual <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffers.</b> Return to battery is effected either by gravity, {{through the use of}} inclined rails, which the gun and carriage have run up, by springs, or even by rubber bands, on some improvised mounts. It is not well-suited to firing at high elevations because it cannot absorb much of the vertical component of the recoil force.|$|R
500|$|On 3 April 1891, 11 {{people were}} injured when a train from [...] hit the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> stops at Broad Street.|$|E
500|$|The product {{improvement}} program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> system to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the {{product improvement}} kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E
5000|$|Sliding buffer stops {{might have}} minimised the injury {{compared}} to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> stops in this incident.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{traction}} drive {{is mounted on}} an assisting beam {{in the center of}} the bogie, and attached to the outer sides via two pendulums. It is possible to mount in the center, since the bogies do not have pivot pins; the bogie is propped up above the frame by eight flexicoil springs. The resulting freedom of movement in all directions is limited by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffers</b> and rubber elements. By utilising this flexicoil suspension, many components, which either wore out or had to be expensively maintained, were eliminated.|$|R
25|$|The smaller {{diameter}} of the tube train {{in relation to the}} tunnel allowed the first car to ride up over the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffers,</b> with the second coach driving under the first, leading to significant damage at this end. The leading driving car buckled at three points into a V shape and was crushed to less than half its length between the wall and the weight of the train piling up behind it. The third car was damaged at both ends, more significantly at the leading end as it rode over the second car. Forty-two passengers and the driver died and 74 passengers were treated in hospital for their injuries.|$|R
25|$|The barrel, {{much longer}} than that of older designs, was fitted with an {{interrupted}} screw breechblock with recoil devices consisting of <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator. The recoil length was variable. Gun shield provided the crew with limited protection from bullets and shell fragments.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 April 1891, 11 {{people were}} injured when a train from [...] hit the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> stops at Broad Street.|$|E
50|$|The recoil system {{consisted}} of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator. Each held 22 litres of liquid. Pressure in the recuperator reached 45 atm.|$|E
50|$|Mk II {{carriage}} : {{this had}} the same drag-shoe system and also a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer.</b> This only allowed a short recoil, and was not successful.|$|E
50|$|The Br-2 {{had a long}} - 47.2 calibers - {{barrel of}} free-tube construction, with {{interrupted}} screw breech. The recoil system with variable recoil length consisted of <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator. The gun utilized bag loading ammunition. For assistance in loading, a special hoisting crane was used.|$|R
25|$|The {{barrel of}} the M-30 was of {{built-up}} construction and consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced cartridge case extraction. The gun was equipped with a <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator. A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|R
2500|$|The P7K3 is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} the P7 (inspired by the HK4 pistol) that uses straight blowback for operation. This version has a removable barrel and uses a sealed <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> {{in place of a}} gas cylinder. After swapping out the barrel and magazine it can use [...]380 ACP (9×17mm Short) or [...]32 ACP (7.65×17mm Browning SR) pistol cartridges and after replacing the slide, magazine and barrel (with floating chamber insert)—it {{can also be used to}} fire [...]22 LR (5.6mm Long Rifle) ammunition. The <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> of the P7K3 is prone to wear and causes a serious problem to operate the gun when it is worn down. Heckler & Koch does not make a replacement part for the buffer. However, there are some commercial buffers available. When the [...]22 LR slide and barrel are installed, the buffer is not engaged.|$|R
50|$|The {{weight of}} the weapon (15 kg), {{combined}} with a muzzle brake and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> system in the butt, gives the AW50F relatively low recoil and enhances accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Mark I gun's recoil {{system was}} in two tubes above the barrel {{and used a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> with a hydro-spring {{recuperator}} to return the barrel to its firing position; Mark II gun had a hydro-pneumatic system below the barrel.|$|E
50|$|The main {{armament}} of the TR-85M1 is the 100 mm A308 rifled {{tank gun}} (an {{adaptation of the}} M1977 towed anti-tank gun made by Arsenal Reşiţa) that was also fitted to the TR-77 tanks. The TR-85M1 has a rate of fire of about 4-7 rounds per minute and can carry up to 41 projectiles inside the tank. The gun barrel is fitted with a bore evacuator and has a thermal sleeve. The TR-85 tanks use a manual loader. The modernized version {{has a number of}} improvements to increase the reliability of the gun. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> was improved by replacing the rubber sealing and the electroerosion of the crome layer from the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> and recuperator has been removed by changing the design and manufacturing process.|$|E
50|$|The M1909/37 was {{a typical}} short-barrel howitzer, {{intended}} mostly for shooting with elevations from +20° to +43°. Shell could be fired with six propellant loads (no. 1 to 5 and full). The gun had horizontal sliding breechblock, <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and spring-driven recuperator. The carriage was of single trail type with unsprung wooden wheels and limited traverse.|$|R
50|$|The FK36(r) and Pak 36(r) {{both had}} a split-trail carriage, with a {{transverse}} leaf spring axle suspension, and steel wheels, with foam rubber filled tires. The guns were equipped with a semi-automatic vertical breech block; the recoil mechanism consisted of a <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and a hydropneumatic recuperator. There was no limber; therefore the gun could not be towed by a horse team.|$|R
50|$|Like {{barrel of}} late {{production}} M1931, {{the barrel of}} the M1931/37 was of loose liner construction, and consisted of liner, jacket and screwed-upon breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, similar in construction to that of the 152 mm howitzer M1910/37. Recoil system consisted of <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator, both located inside the cradle under the barrel.|$|R
5000|$|... 28 June 2015 - Mumbai, India - A {{local train}} {{crashed into a}} buffer on {{platform}} no. 3 of Churchgate station in Mumbai. 6 people were injured in the accident. The <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> used to slow the impact did not function and the train overshot the platform.|$|E
50|$|M1910/30 was {{powerful}} long range gun with big (40°) maximum elevation. It {{was equipped with}} interrupted screw breechblock and recoil system consisting of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator. The carriage was of single trail type and had metal wheels with solid tires. The crew was protected by 7 mm shield.|$|E
50|$|M1910/34 {{combined}} {{a barrel}} of the M1910/30 with a carriage of the 122-mm gun M1931. The barrel was of built-up construction; it was equipped with interrupted screw breechblock and recoil system consisting of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator. The split-trail carriage had leaf spring suspension and wheels with solid rubber tires.|$|E
50|$|The recoil system {{consisted}} of a <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and spring-driven recuperator. The carriage was of the split trail type, with suspension. Wheels with rubber tires could be removed, making the gun significantly lower and therefore easier to conceal; the process took 30-40 seconds. The guns' construction allowed toolless dismantling to five pieces, the heaviest of which weighed 62 kg.|$|R
5000|$|The {{barrel of}} the M1910/30 was longer than the {{original}} barrel and was fitted with a slotted muzzle brake (which reduced recoil by 25%); in order to balance the barrel, a special weight was fitted to {{the opposite end of}} the tube. The breech was of the interrupted screw type. The recoil system, consisting of a <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and a hydropneumatic recuperator, was located in a sleigh below the barrel.|$|R
5000|$|These howitzers {{were ordered}} in 1916 from Schneider et Cie, but {{development}} was protracted {{and the first}} weapon wasn't delivered until late 1917. They used a combination of cradle recoil and sliding recoil to handle the recoil forces generated by firing its enormous shells. A number of crossbeams mounted {{on the underside of}} the carriage were jacked down and clamped to the track to increase the friction when the carriage was forced backwards about a 1 m from the recoil forces not absorbed by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffers</b> on the gun cradle. The mount was then jacked up and then moved back into firing position by hand-crank or electric motor. The gun had to be loaded at 0° elevation and thus had to be re-aimed for every shot. A prominent overhead trolley system mounted behind the gun carried the ammunition to the breech from the ammunition car. It fired shells weighing 1370 and 1654 kg. Elevation and ammunition handling were electrically powered from a separate generator car connected by approximately 10 m of cables.Hogg, p. 138 ...|$|R
5000|$|Weighing 15 kilograms, the AW50F rifle is {{approximately}} {{four times the}} weight of a typical assault rifle. The NM140 [...]50 calibre ammunition is also heavy. The weight of the weapon, combined with a muzzle brake on the front end and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> system in the butt, gives the AW50F a relatively low recoil and enhances accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Current Colt {{production}} models are the RO635 {{which features a}} Safe/Semi/Full Auto selective fire trigger group and the RO639 which features a Safe/Semi/3-round Burst selective fire trigger group. Both are equipped with a 10.5 inch length barrel. The 633 was a modified compact version with a 7 in barrel, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer</b> and simplified front sight post used by the DEA.|$|E
5000|$|Mk III {{carriage}} : In 1899 {{a rudimentary}} recoil system was added, {{consisting of a}} [...] "spade" [...] beneath the axle which dug in when the gun recoiled, connected by a steel wire to a spring in a cylinder on the trail. Mk I and II carriages fitted with these were known as Mk 1* and Mk II*. The latter retained the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To combat {{these issues}} the Railway Clearing House (an {{organisation}} originally {{set up to}} share out revenue from joint services between companies) introduced minimum standards for private owner wagons in 1887. Companies that were signed up to the RCH refused to allow wagons that {{did not meet the}} standards in their trains, although there was a lengthy grace period for owners to upgrade or replace their older wagons. New and stricter standards were introduced by the RCH in 1909 which required <b>hydraulic</b> <b>buffers</b> and oil-lubricated bearings as well as numerous other details {{in the construction of the}} frame, brakes, axles, and suspension that made the RCH's design the basis for virtually every British mineral and goods wagon for the next 30 years. Wagons that complied with the standards carried a plate saying 'RCH'. Although the 1909 design standards were supposed to be fully enforced by 1914 the advent of World War I meant that they were suspended and many non-compliant wagons actually remained in service until well after the Grouping of 1921.|$|R
50|$|The barrel {{consisted}} of liner, jacket and screwed-upon breech. Early production barrels had a built-up construction, but in 1936 these were replaced in production by loose liner barrels. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, similar in construction {{to that of}} the 152 mm howitzer M1910/37. Unlike early prototypes, productional barrels did not have muzzle brake. Recoil system {{consisted of}} <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator, both located inside the cradle under the barrel.|$|R
50|$|The USV had a split-trail {{carriage}} with suspension; metal wheels {{with rubber}} tires were {{borrowed from the}} ZiS-5 truck. The gun featured semi-automatic vertical sliding breech block and Bofors-type cradle; recoil mechanism consisted of <b>hydraulic</b> recoil <b>buffer</b> and hydropneumatic recuperator. Sights and elevation controls were located on different sides of the barrel. The chamber fitted the standard model 1900 cartridge, which meant that the gun could use ammunition manufactured for older 76.2 mm divisional and regimental guns.|$|R
