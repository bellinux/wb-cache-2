25|$|Baum's avowed {{intentions}} {{with the}} Oz books and other fairy tales was to retell tales such as {{are found in}} the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. The first books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased with the series; in The Emerald City of Oz, Ozma objected to doing violence even to the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginnings of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.|$|E

25|$|Even when storyboards were made, {{scenes that}} were shot {{differed}} from them significantly. Krohn's extensive {{analysis of the}} production of Hitchcock classics like Notorious reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much, whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including Strangers on a Train and Topaz. While Hitchcock did <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible {{to adapt to the}} changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines utilised during many other film productions.|$|E
25|$|Queen Sophia Magdalena {{was of a}} shy and {{reserved}} character and was never {{a member of the}} King's inner circle. At the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena is occasionally named as participator in the documents: in 1777, for example she dressed as an Italian sailor and participated in a battle between Italian and Spanish sailors. Normally, however, it was rather her role to act as the passive lady of games and tournaments, and to decorate the winner with the award. She did her ceremonial duties, but disliked the vivid lifestyle of the Court around her outgoing spouse. As Queen, she was expected to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of representation, more than had been expected from previous queens because of her consort's love for representation. On formal occasions, she was at her best: she performed beautifully according to Court etiquette, and was seen as dignified and impressive. On 17 September 1784, for example, she cut the cord to let off the first air balloons from the Stockholm observatory. During the King's Italian journey in 1783–84, she hosted a grand formal public dinner every two weeks, court presentation and showed herself at the Royal Swedish Opera and at the French Theater, but otherwise preferred her solitude. This attracted attention as during the absence of the King, she had been expected to represent the royal couple all the more. During this time, she is said to have enjoyed nature trips in the country side, with only one lady in waiting and two footmen, but this was stopped, because it was deemed unsuitable. Several of her ladies-in-waiting were well known Swedish women of the era, among them The Three Graces, as Augusta von Fersen, Ulla von Höpken and Lovisa Meijerfelt were called, and the artists Marianne Ehrenström and Charlotta Cedercreutz. Sophia Magdalena was a popular Queen: the 22 July 1788, for example, during the absence of her spouse in Finland, several members of the Royal Dramatic Theater and the musical society Augustibröder, among them Bellman, took a spontaneous trip by boat from the capital to Ulriksdal Palace, where she was, and performed a poem by Bellman to her honor at the occasion of her name day.|$|E

[...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's going to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job and I'll just {{look forward to working}} with him.

Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing".

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred, with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George [...] "that dirty little Welsh Attorney" [...] and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s. Austen Chamberlain, {{the brother of}} one opponent and, for a time, the political ally of the other, regretted the enmity, [...] "More's the pity, for together if they were together they might <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal." [...] Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs, claiming that “Mr Chamberlain {{is a man of}} rigid competency. Such men have their uses in conventional times … and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times. But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time.” HIs dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology, although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this. Lloyd George would also have the last laugh in May 1940, when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain’s government.|$|E

500|$|As the German Emperor, he officially {{received}} Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (his mother-in-law) and King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, {{and attended}} {{the wedding of}} his son Prince Henry to his niece Princess Irene. However, Frederick reigned for only 99days, {{and was unable to}} bring about much lasting change. The majority of the German ruling elite viewed Frederick's reign as merely a brief interim period before the accession of his son Wilhelm to the throne. [...] An edict he penned before he ascended to the throne that would limit the powers of the chancellor and monarch under the constitution was never put into effect, although he did force Robert von Puttkamer to resign as Prussian Minister of the Interior on 8 June, when evidence indicated that Puttkamer had interfered in the Reichstag elections.

500|$|The 1980s saw {{not only}} Mormons, but many Christian groups vying for {{representation}} and {{space in the}} city. These groups constantly faced opposition from a strong political minority of Orthodox Jews living in the city. Neither major political party in Israel (the Likud and Labor Parties) could achieve a majority vote in the Knesset without support from the more religious parties. Religious parties used this situation to pass laws in favor of Jewish Orthodoxy {{in exchange for their}} support on other issues. At the time, the conservative Jews, who made up the [...] "religious right" [...] in Israel, or the Haredim, constituted 27% of the population of Jerusalem, and was decidedly against the building of the BYU Jerusalem Center or any other similar Christian structure. Larger parties faced loss of a majority if they stood opposite on this issue. Many Israeli officials, however, such as the Mayor of Jerusalem at the time, Teddy Kollek, along with others in attendance at the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden dedication, supported the center because of what the church had done for the city. Kollek specifically stated that [...] "the Mormon church's presence in Jerusalem can <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of work in providing the bridge of understanding between the Arab and Jews...because its members look with sympathy and understanding at both sides." [...] The land on which the center was built was then still considered Arab land by many, and many officials saw that its lease would add an image of religious tolerance to their government and increase Israeli control of the land.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
