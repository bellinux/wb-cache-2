The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.
