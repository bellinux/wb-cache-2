50|$|Although smaller pits {{had existed}} beforehand, the town became a centre of {{industrial}} scale deep shaft coal mining from the 1950s, {{taking advantage of}} the geological faults that cause coal seams under Cannock Chase. The Lea Hall Colliery that opened in July 1960 was the first modern coal mine opened by the National Coal Board, which managed the United Kingdom's nationalized coal industry. Nearby the Central Electricity Generating Board built two power plants. With the construction of Rugeley A and B power stations Rugeley became a major centre for electricity generation. These developments led to the town growing very quickly in the 1960s. The Rugeley A power station was designed to take its fuel directly from Lea Hall by conveyor belt (although the coal was of poor quality not suitable for Rugeley B). This was the first such arrangement in Britain. The Rugeley B coal-fired power station continues to dominate the skyline where a flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>plant</b> has been constructed. This will allow it to continue to generate electricity and comply with environmental legislation.|$|E
5000|$|The Pembroke Power Station was {{completed}} in 1968 for CEGB and together with Marchwood, near Southampton, was the largest oil fired power station to be built. Its maximum output was 2,000 MW and it was joined to Burry Port in Carmarthenship by two 400KVA power lines on 170 foot high pylons. It could emit 600 tons of sulphur dioxide and 3 tons of nitrogen oxides from a 500-foot chimney. The Power Station never managed to reach this maximum output. Initially it was using crude oil from the adjacent refineries but in 1992 National Power proposed changing this to orimulsion, a mixture of water and bitumen, which came from Venezuela. This would have quadrupled the potential output of sulphur dioxide {{as well as the}} possible risk of an orimulsion spill in Milford Haven. There was a local outcry when it was realised that the power station may already be causing a higher level of asthma and that there were other health risks from orimulsion. The Pembrokeshire Branch of CPRW joined with other local groups in opposing the scheme and eventually National Power suggested an additional <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>plant.</b> However, the Secretary of State decided to hold an inquiry, but a few weeks before it started National Power withdrew the proposals. The Power Station was mothballed in 1996 and demolished between 2000 and 2003. It was replaced by the Pembroke B Power Station on the same site which opened in 2012, which has turbines which run on natural gas and has a heat recovery steam generator ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} {{development}} cooperation of RWE Power, BASF and Linde - aiming at an advanced optimised CO 2 -scrubbing technology for power plant application - the first post-combustion capture pilot plant in Germany was constructed and commissioned at the lignite-fired 1, 000  MW Niederaussem power station in 2009. The pre-assembly of the pilot plant started in October 2008 and commissioning took place in July 2009 as planned. 7. 2 t of CO 2 per day can be captured from a flue gas slipstream of the power plant downstream of the <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>plant</b> (FGD). The pilot plant comprises optimised components such as a flue gas pre-scrubbing direct contact cooler unit {{as well as a}} lean liquid cooler and an interstage cooler that both allow returning the solvent at different absorber heights. During a 6 -month campaign, all aspects of the optimised process configuration were tested using 30 %-weight MEA as benchmark solvent and the performance of a new advanced amine-based solvent developed by BASF was trialled. This paper summarises the operational experience gained and compares some of the results obtained for MEA with those of the new amine-based solvent...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the usefulness}} of process network dynamics simulation for decision-making in refinery hydrogen networks. A theoretical hydrogen network of three <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>plants</b> is modelled, and three case scenarios discussed: baseline, high demand, and low demand. Discussion focuses on how {{the information from the}} simulation is interpreted and its usefulness for debottlenecking, scheduling and what-if analysis. Stress is put on dynamics of the system and their consequences in process operation throughout the network. Hydrogen purity is highlighted as the most affected variable, and discussed its network wide effect. In addition, the responses of inflows, outflows and headers are analysed. Although the model used is a simplified representation of the actual processes, the simulation analysis showed potential as decision-making support not provided with steady state models. Further researches based on real case-studies should be conducted to better conclude on the efficient usage of simulation in aiding refinery hydrogen networks operational decisions...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the EU {{integrated}} project CASTOR a 1 t/h CO 2 absorption pilot plant has been erected at the 400 MW coal-fired Esbjerg power plant. The main purpose of the pilot plant is to demonstrate the post combustion capture technology in conjunction with a coal-fired power plant. Additionally, the pilot plant will be used to test the performance of new energy efficient solvents and to verify modelling work. The design of the pilot plant is based on a commercial CO 2 production plant using alkanolamine as the absorbent. The pilot plant operates on a slipstream of the flue gas taken after the deNOx and <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>plants.</b> During the pilot plant’s first year, two 1000 hours test campaigns using monoethanolamine were conducted. Among others, the campaigns included tests to verify plant functionality and performance as well as a more detailed parametric study. This paper summarises the initial operation experience and some of the first results obtained during these campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of {{pulverised fuel ash}} (PFA) are produced by coal-fired power stations, some of which is currently dumped into the sea. The planned fitting of flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> (FGD) <b>plant</b> in the UK would produce comparable {{quantities of}} gypsum. While a fraction of both these wastes may be used commercially, an alternative, environmentally acceptable, use for the surplus material, the construction of artificial reefs, is being investigated. Possible leaching of heavy metal ions from the reef material is being investigated by direct analysis of the blocks. Additionally there is monitoring of metal levels in reef epibiota and mobile species in comparison to concrete control and natural reef organisms...|$|R
5|$|All six {{units are}} served by an {{independent}} wet limestone-gypsum flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> (FGD) <b>plant,</b> which was installed between 1988 and 1996. This diverts gases from the boilers and passes them through a limestone slurry, which removes at least 90% of the sulphur dioxide (SO2). This is equivalent to removing over 250,000 tonnes of SO2 each year. The process requires 10,000 tonnes of limestone a week, sourced from Tunstead Quarry in Derbyshire. A byproduct of the process is gypsum, with 15,000 tonnes produced each week. This goes {{to be used in}} the manufacture of plasterboard. The gypsum is sold exclusively to British Gypsum, and it is transported by rail to their plants at Kirkby Thore (on the Settle-Carlisle Line), East Leake (on the former Great Central Main Line) and occasionally to Robertsbridge (on the Hastings Line). DB Cargo UK transport the gypsum.|$|R
40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the {{determination}} of the equilibrium partial pressure of sulphur dioxide above aqueous solutions of sodium sulphite / bisulphite typically found in the absorption section of a Wellman-Lord Flue Gas <b>Desulphurisation</b> (FGD) <b>plant.</b> Data used {{in the design of the}} absorption section was that developed by Johnstone in 1938. This study showed that although the general form of his equation describes a method of calculation of the partial pressure, his data was on average 13 % lower than that found in this study. Examination of his original data did reveal that a typographical error might have occurred in his paper. Using his new equation would result in an increase in the calculated partial pressure of 26 % above that determined from his original equation. Given that Johnstone covered a range of conditions that would not be found in the design of a commercial FGD plant, data developed in this study has been used for all future designs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper will}} present Doosan Power Systems’ Post Combustion Capture (PCC) development, testing and {{verification}} activities. Preliminary {{results from the}} Boundary Dam TKOTM process, RSTM solvent trial and {{the results from the}} ERTF test facility will be discussed. Doosan Power Systems is developing competitive PCC technologies to capture carbon dioxide (CO 2) from coal and natural gas fired power plants for commercialization by 2020. Doosan Power Systems has licensed solvent scrubbing technology from HTC Purenergy Inc., which is based in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. HTC have developed an optimised Post Combustion Capture (PCC) process known as the Thermal Kinetics OptimizationTM (TKO) process which is designed to substantially reduce the energy requirements of the PCC process for the capture of CO 2 from coal and natural gas fired power plants. Doosan Power Systems is currently undertaking FEED studies and preparing commercial bids for full-scale solvent scrubbing plants, comprising all equipment from flue gas <b>desulphurisation</b> (FGD) <b>plant</b> outlet to CO 2 compression plant inlet. Among these are the CCPILOT 100 + and Basin Electric PCC demonstration projects. The TKO process is currently under a formal technology verification programme at the upgraded Boundary Dam demonstration pilot plant capturing approximately 4  tonnes/day of CO 2. Long term performance of HTC’s proprietary RSTM solvent is currently being assessed for CO 2 removal effectiveness and the long term performance of the solvent. Solvents are also tested for degradation, heat stable salt formation and propensity for corrosion within the various system components. Doosan Power Systems has installed a PCC solvent scrubbing pilot plant on the 160  kWt Emissions Reduction Test Facility (ERTF), located at its R&D centre in Renfrew, Scotland, to capture approximately 1  tonne/day of CO 2 and to permit further development and optimization of the process. The ERTF is capable of firing a wide range of world traded coals and produces flue gases representative of full scale plant. The ERTF solvent scrubbing plant will be used to carry out performance testing on a range of solvents, packings and suitability of a range of materials. The testing and verification programmes at both Boundary Dam and the ERTF will be used to substantiate the scalability of HTC’s technology under real-world operating conditions. Of paramount importance during the verification programmes are the actual rate of solvent degradation under industrial conditions, solvent make-up requirements, steam consumption and other auxiliary power requirements which add to power plant parasitic losses, such as that for fans to overcome the pressure drop created by column internals and associated pipework...|$|R
