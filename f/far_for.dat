5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing it back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The 24th Infantry Division was then reassigned to IX Corps to replace the 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions, which {{had been placed in}} reserve due to heavy losses. The Chinese eventually advanced too <b>far</b> <b>for</b> their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{to return}} to {{official}} cricket when WSC ended, Chappell resumed as captain of SA in 1979–80, a decision he later regretted. It was a season too <b>far</b> <b>for</b> the increasingly irascible Chappell. Reported by an umpire for swearing in a match against Tasmania, he received a three-week suspension. In his first match after the ban, he was again reported for his conduct {{in a game against}} the touring English team. Given a suspended ban by the ACB, he was then selected for Australia's last three Tests of the season. His Test career finished with scores of 75 and 26 not out at the MCG against England in February 1980. In his final first-class match, SA needed to beat Victoria to win the Sheffield Shield. Although Chappell scored 112, SA lost the match and the shield. Ironically, the umpires voted him the competition's player of the season for a second time.|$|E

5|$|Now united, the nations, {{aided by}} Adventurers, {{successfully}} storm Castrum Novum {{and destroy the}} beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself into a second beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too <b>far</b> <b>for</b> it to return into orbit, so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: to summon the Twelve, Eorzea's deities, and return Dalamud into orbit. The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In {{the midst of the}} battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt to summon the Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Louisoix then proceeds to sacrifice himself to destroy Bahamut in a final cataclysmic battle, leaving behind a barren, scarred landscape.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November, China {{entered the}} war {{on the side of}} North Korea against the UN. Massed Chinese attacks were {{immediately}} launched against troops of the corps. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdraw to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force. In the wake of the retreat, the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re-formed. I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 27th British Brigade, taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place. On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops attacked the Eighth Army's line at the Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The Chinese eventually advanced too <b>far</b> <b>for</b> their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled.

5|$|Stevens {{was twice}} named the Horizon League Coach of the Year and won collegeinsider.com's Hugh Durham Award mid-season honors in January 2009. He also {{was both a}} Hugh Durham Award and Jim Phelan Award finalist all three years of his career. Stevens {{has been called a}} {{coaching}} prodigy and compared to John Wooden. He is married with two young children. In July 2013, he signed a six-year, 22-million-dollar contract to become the head coach of the Boston Celtics in the NBA. In April 2015, Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA Playoffs as the 7th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 40–42 record. In April 2016, Brad Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his tenure as the 5th seed in the 2016 NBA Playoffs finishing the season with a 48–34 record. On June 1, 2016, Stevens received a contract extension. In the 2016–17 season, Stevens' team finished with a laudable 53–29 record. It earned them the Atlantic Division title and placed them as the best overall team in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics then entered post-season play as the number one seed in their conference. Both the division title as well as the number one seeding are bests thus <b>far</b> <b>for</b> the Stevens' led Celtics' teams.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold {{recorded}} thus <b>far</b> <b>for</b> Aphilas is 90 percent. Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.) However, {{the weight of the}} coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 16 head coaches so <b>far</b> <b>for</b> the Islanders franchise. The team's first head coach was Phil Goyette, who coached {{the team for}} part of the 1972–73 season. Al Arbour is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (1,500) and the most regular-season game wins (740); he is also the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (198), and the most playoff-game wins (119). Goyette, Earl Ingarfield, Bill Stewart, Scott Gordon and Jack Capuano are the only coaches who spent their entire careers with the Islanders and have not been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Arbour is the only coach to have been {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is also the only coach to have won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's top coach. The franchise has participated in the Stanley Cup finals five times, coached by Arbour each time; they won Stanley Cup four of those times. Arbour, Terry Simpson, Peter Laviolette, Steve Stirling, Ted Nolan, and Jack Capuano are the only coaches to have coached the team into the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|After relegation, {{the club}} {{underwent}} off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline. Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted {{at the first}} attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in a play-off against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved {{to have been a}} step too <b>far</b> <b>for</b> the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 Division One championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a season in the process. The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road, and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a run of 13 years without a derby win. City also qualified for European competition {{for the first time in}} 25 years. In the 2003 close season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first manager from overseas when appointed in 2007. After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 2008. Eriksson was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later on 4 June 2008.|$|E
