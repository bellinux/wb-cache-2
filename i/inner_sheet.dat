However, electrons of energy greater than 100 keV are probably generated by acceleration processes beyond the AAR. Observational evidence for the source location of these energetic electrons {{are hard to come}} by. In our current work, we present simultaneous magnetically conjugate measurements of energetic electron spectra estimated at the ionosphere using the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and measured at the <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet</b> by the THEMIS spacecraft. The flux of precipitating electrons of energy greater than 100 keV demonstrate a striking spatio-temporal correlation with that of the <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet</b> electrons. This suggests that the source of the energetic electrons lie at or beyond the <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet,</b> and that the acceleration processes within the auroral acceleration zone don't contribute substantially to their energization.

5000|$|Nag Hammadi {{bindings}} {{were constructed}} with a textblock of papyrus sheets, assembled {{into a single}} section and trimmed along the fore edge after folding to prevent the <b>inner</b> <b>sheets</b> from extending outward beyond the outer <b>sheets.</b> Because the <b>inner</b> <b>sheets</b> were narrower than the outer sheets after trimming, the width of text varied through the textblock, {{and it is likely}} that the papyrus was not written on until after it was bound; this, in turn, would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript before it was written and bound. [...] Covers of Nag Hammadi bindings were limp leather, stiffened with waste sheets of papyrus. The textblocks were sewn with tackets, with leather stays along the inside fold as reinforcement. These tackets also secured the textblock to the covers; on some of the Nag Hammadi bindings, the tackets extended to the outside of the covering leather, while on others the tackets were attached to a strip of leather which served as a spine liner, and which was in turn pasted to the covers. [...] A flap, either triangular or rectangular, extended from the front cover of the book, and was wrapped around the fore edge of the book when closed.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of metal into the aeronautical industry made {{the wings and}} aerostructures stiff and rigid. High-lift devices and movable surfaces allow for discrete deflections to increase lift coefficient {{and control of the}} aircraft. Several researchers have proposed concepts for variable camber, allowing continuous deflections. This is achieved by shape memory alloys, piezoelectric actuators, fishbone structures and pressure adaptive actuation. The concept of variable stiffness is not applied in aviation nowadays. This thesis is focused on applying variable camber and variable stiffness to a Cessna Citation X inboard flap, for which a full scale actuator is produced and tested. The loads are estimated on the inboard flap with the morphing part in neutral, 15 degrees downwards and 15 degrees upwards position. The maximum loads and moments are found in the descent flight condition, which equal 209. 7 N and 15. 24 N¢m in neutral position. Deflection downwards increases the force and moment to 631. 6 Nand 37. 19 N¢m, whereas in upwards position the force and moment equal - 253. 4 Nand - 12. 68 N¢m. With the expected loads on the trailing edge of the flap, the actuator can be designed. The top bellows are designed 2. 62 times larger than the bottom bellows, because of the expected loading ratio. The wedge angles are approximately 30 degrees, which are the maximum angles for deflection in positive and negative direction. The bellows and trailing edge are made from polycarbonate, where the bellows and the <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> of the trailing edge have a thickness of 4 mil (0. 10 mm) and 6. 7 mil (0. 17 mm). The trailing edge is made from 30 mil (0. 762 mm) polycarbonate sheet. The stringers are replaced by aluminumspars for the test setup. The main issue found in the testing phase, was the air tightness. Even though the bellows were not completely airtight, the bellows could be inflated by applying 10 psi (0. 69 bar) air pressure. In the testing phase, the maximum deflections and deflection speeds have been measured. On average 13 degrees upwards deflection and 7 degrees downward deflection is reached. The actuation speed equals 150 deg/s and deflection rates range from 0. 88 Hz to 3. 33 Hz. The stiffness and damping have been determined as well. The stiffness increases with air pressure, for a 4 mil <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness the stiffness increases from 3. 46 N¢m/rad to 5. 38 N¢m/rad, the 6. 7 mil <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> increases more, from 3. 96 N¢ m/rad to 9. 03 N¢ m/rad. It is expected that the stiffness can be varied linearly between the neutral and inflated (10 psi) state. A thicker <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> gives a higher stiffness. The damping coefficients are only determined for the 4 mil <b>inner</b> <b>sheet.</b> The damping coefficients equal 0. 119 in deflated, 0. 143 in neutral and 0. 226 in inflated condition. The natural frequency could be determined from the damping test as well. The natural frequency was approximately 2. 99 Hz for the deflated and the neutral tests and 3. 71 Hz for the inflated tests. The equivalent torsional stiffness corresponding to this natural frequency equals 1. 21 N¢ m/rad, 1. 24 N¢ m/rad and 1. 88 N¢ m/rad for the deflated, neutral and inflated tests respectively. The stiffness and damping coefficients are used in a torsional spring damper differential equation, together with the mass moment of inertia for the trailing edge, which is calculated in CATIA™. The mass moment of inertia equals 0. 422 g ¢m 2 for the 4 mil and 0. 434 g ¢m 2 for the 6. 7 mil <b>inner</b> <b>sheet.</b> Another analytic model is created as well, determining the deflection from the final shape of the inflated bellows. Since the actuator is still in an early development phase, it is expected that the actuator and analytic models can be improved withmore research and better production techniques.

40|$|Low-energy plasma {{originates}} in the ionosphere and is accelerated and {{transported to the}} plasma sheet and ultimately to the ring current. Using observations and basic MHD concepts, {{it is argued that}} the acceleration results basically from entrainment in flows that are rapid compared with initial ion thermal speeds. Spatial or temporal variations of such flows launch impulsive waves of the appropriate variety (acoustic, shear Alfven, or magnetosonic) to effect readjustment to the imposed boundary conditions. The most violent transient events are the earthward inductive surges of plasma in the <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet,</b> which launch magnetosonic waves. A number of observations strongly suggest that the induction surge waves break as they reach the <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet</b> or outer plasmasphere, forming transient shock waves and dissipating their energy in turbulent flows, plasma heating, and acceleration of energetic particles, forming the substorm injection boundary.

40|$|AbstractHuman transthyretin (TTR) is an amyloidogenic protein. The pathway of TTR amyloid {{formation}} {{has been}} proposed based on lines of evidence: TTR tetramer first dissociates into native monomers, which is {{shown to be a}} rate-limiting step in the formation of fibrils. Subsequently, the monomeric species partially unfold to form the aggregation intermediates. Once such intermediates are formed, the following self-assembly process is a downhill polymerization. Hence, tertiary structural changes within the monomers after the dissociation are essential for the amyloid formation. These tertiary structural changes can be facilitated by partial denaturation. To probe the conformational changes under the partially denaturing conditions, five independent trajectories were collected for the wild-type (WT) and its pathogenic variants at 300 and 350 K, resulting in simulations that totaled 59 ns. Under these conditions, L 55 P variant is more labile than the wild-type and V 30 M variant. We have observed that the D strand of WT-TTR is trapped in two local minima: the native conformation and the amyloidogenic fold that resembles the surface loop of residues 54 – 55 of L 55 P variant. In the tetrameric state, the F strand is bent with large separations at the F-F′ interface. This strand becomes flatter in the monomeric state, which may facilitate the formation of new F-F′ interface with possible prolonged hydrogen bonds and/or shift in β-strand register in the fibril state. During the unfolding process, the anticorrelated motion between the strands H and G as well as the strands H and A pulls the H strand out of the <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> plane, leading to a more twisted <b>inner</b> <b>sheet.</b> Our simulation has provided important detailed structural information about the partially unfolded state of TTR that {{may be related to the}} amyloidogenic intermediates...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight tests have clearly {{demonstrated}} {{the potential of}} hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) to reduce 2 d-airfoil drag on a modern transport aircraft by about 50 % leading to a total drag reduction of about 10 % to 15 %. However, these tests also revealed that much of HLF technology's advantage might be obliterated {{by the weight of}} additional structures and systems. Consequently, one central objective of the EC funded programme ALTTA is the simplification of the suction system for an Airbus A 320 HLFC fin. The simplest internal structure for an HLF system would have only one suction chamber, the leading edge box itself. Unfortunately, the usage of combination with a constant-porosity suction surface results in a very ineffective suction speed distribution. From the aerodynamic point of view the porous surface has to be supported by stringers arranged in spanwise direction. Then the risk of inducing turbulent by nonporous parts of the surface is very small. Lift forces, meanwhile, have to be lead to the front spar by ribs. A very efficient structural solution is a second sheet between stringers and ribs. The outer porous surface, the supporting stringers and the <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> form a double sheet surface with a relatively high number of chambers. This structure also allows for a very efficient control the suction distribution. Assuming that the porosity of the suction surface is constant in chord and span direction, the local mass flow between two stringers can be adjusted by metering orifices in the <b>inner</b> <b>sheet,</b> making the whole leading edge box a single suction duct. Active computer control of the mass flow in the suction pipes through butterfly valves and corresponding sensor equipment have also contributed to the high complexity of suction systems in the past. In the present design such elements will not be used. The mass flow-controlling elements are the porous outer surface, the <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> with orifices and a suitable suction pump assumed to be located within the leading box. The system is designed to be fully self adapting for a certain range of Mach numbers, flight levels and yaw angles. The paper describes the assumptions and equations to calculate suction speed, mass flow, pressure and pressure losses of such a system. It is shown that this system allows very efficient suction distribution. Reversed turbulence inducing suction velocity (local outflow) can be avoided for a range of yaw angles of +/- 3 °. The transition location on the fin is determined by linear stability calculations. Based on general flight conditions, surface geometry, surface pressure distribution and the suction speed distribution the stability analysis of the laminar boundary layer is performed by means of the local stability code COAST 3. The transition location is determined using the stability results in combination with the so-called 2 -N-factor criterion. The calculation procedure described above is applied on a set of design and off-design flight conditions. It includes Mach numbers from 0. 76 to 0. 80, flight levels between 23000 and 39000 ft, yaw angles of +/- 4 °, ruder deflections of 2 ° and a variation of the suction surface porosity. With increasing Mach number the extent of laminar flow moves slightly downstream. The influence of the flight level is negligible. Varying yaw angle induced by the pressure distribution has a strong influence on the development of laminar flow. The essential result is that up to +/- 3 ° of yaw angle the boundary layer is kept laminar. At larger yaw angles local outflow causes transition of the laminar boundary layer. The extent of laminar flow varies between nearly 40 % on the outer half of the fin and about 30 % on the lower part. The simplified layout of the suction system fulfils the design objectives agreed by the ALTTA partners...|$|E

Influences due to a deviation of the seam loop position in the sensor can be excluded because of the good coupling. The red marked areas in coupling evaluation in the upper seam bond area b arises due to the larger active sensor area (6.5  mm) in contrast to the flange length of seam area b (6  mm). Consequently, the <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> is sounded in this area, whereby the echo resulting from the material transition is generated outside the gate for an OK coupling. A change in the orientation of the seam bond loop of the sample within the sensor can be excluded as a further factor influencing the result.

Consequently, it can be ensured that the ultrasound results are solely related to the adhesive distribution and not to the geometrical shape of the seam bond or the orientation of the seam loop. Further investigations must show the extent to which this can be ensured later in the series process.|$|E

The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method at the correlated MÃ¸ller-Plesset second order perturbation level of theory was used on a model of the crystalline cellulose IÎ± core with a total of 144 glucose units. These computations show that the intersheet chain interactions are stronger than the intrasheet chain interactions for the crystalline structure, while they are more similar to each other for a relaxed structure. An FMO chain pair interaction energy decomposition analysis for both the crystal and relaxed structures reveals an intricate interplay between electrostatic, dispersion, charge transfer, and exchange repulsion effects. The role of the primary alcohol groups in stabilizing the interchain hydrogen bond network in the <b>inner</b> <b>sheet</b> of the crystal and relaxed structures of cellulose IÎ±, where edge effects are absent, was analyzed. The maximum attractive intrasheet interaction is observed for the GT-TG residue pair with one intrasheet hydrogen bond, suggesting that the relative orientation of the residues is as important as the hydrogen bond network in strengthening the interaction between the residues...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study an {{instability}} of the plasma moving towards the Earth near the <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet</b> boundary. We include both the interchange instability of the plasma sheet and the magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction instability {{caused by an}} effect of field-aligned currents (connected with electron precipitation) on ionospheric conductivity. The instability leads to the separation of steady-state magnetospheric convection into parallel layers. This instability {{may be responsible for}} the appearance of quiet auroral arcs inside region 2 of field-aligned currents flowing out of the ionosphere. This instability allows us to explain also the existence of crossing auroral arcs...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} electromagnetic particle {{simulation model}} is constructed {{to study the}} excitation of whistler waves {{in the presence of}} a cold plasma cloud for conditions representative of those after the release of lithium in the <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet</b> during the Combined Release and Radiation Effect Satellite mission. The results indicate that a standing-wave pattern with discrete wave frequencies is formed within the cloud. The magnetic wave amplitude inside the cloud, which is limited by quasi-linear diffusion, is of the order of several nanoteslas. Assuming a magnetospheric loss cone of 5 deg, the observed pitch angle diffusion produced by the whistler waves is sufficient to put the electrons on strong diffusion...|$|R

The results related to such flows are reviewed, and information is presented on their relation to the average plasma sheet characteristics and substorms. The average ion density, temperature and flow variability in the quiet <b>inner</b> plasma <b>sheet</b> exhibit a spatial dependence which suggests a dependence on Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs). The energy and flux transport in the tail is discussed and it is stated that BBFs are responsible for such transport. The tailward progression of activity is considered...|$|R
