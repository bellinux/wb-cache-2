60|$|The second {{material}} of cement {{for their new}} republic is {{the superiority of the}} city of Paris: and this I admit is strongly connected with the other cementing principle of paper circulation and confiscation. It is {{in this part of the}} project we must look for the cause of the destruction of all the old bounds of provinces and jurisdictions, ecclesiastical and secular, and the dissolution of all ancient combinations of things, as well as the formation of so many small unconnected republics. The power of the city of Paris is evidently one great spring of all their politics. It is through the power of Paris, now become the centre and focus of jobbing, that the leaders of this faction direct, or rather command, the whole legislative and the whole executive government. Everything therefore must be done which can confirm the authority of that city over the other republics. Paris is compact; she has an enormous strength, wholly disproportioned to the force of any of the square republics; and this strength is collected and condensed within a narrow compass. Paris has a natural and easy connection of its parts, which will not be affected by any scheme of a geometrical constitution, nor does it much signify whether its proportion of representation be more or less, since it has the whole draft of fishes in its drag-net. The other divisions of the kingdom being <b>hackled</b> and torn to pieces, and separated from all their habitual means, and even principles of union, cannot, for some time at least, confederate against her. Nothing was to be left in all the subordinate members, but weakness, disconnection, and confusion. To confirm this part of the plan, the Assembly has lately come to a resolution, that no two of their republics shall have the same commander-in-chief.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst {{the white}} <b>hackle</b> of 2 SCOTS, red <b>hackle</b> of 3 SCOTS and blue <b>hackle</b> of 4 SCOTS have a known ancestry, {{the origin of}} 1 SCOTS black <b>hackle</b> and 5 SCOTS green <b>hackle</b> are not clear and have no {{apparent}} precedent. It {{may be that the}} black <b>hackle</b> of 1 SCOTS simulates the black-cock tail feathers originally worn in the 1904 pattern Kilmarnock Bonnet and latterly in the regimental Glengarry Cap by the Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers, who merged in August 2006 to form 1 SCOTS. Alternatively, it may be a sympathetic gesture to a former Lowland regiment, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), who went into 'suspended animation' in 1968 (and later disbanded), who wore a black <b>hackle</b> in their rifle green dress Balmoral. The adoption of the green <b>hackle</b> now being worn by the Argylls battalion (5 SCOTS) is no doubt a continuation of that regiment's association with the colour green, most prominent in the hue of their regimental kilts and stripes on their regimental association ties.

Book Series: IUTAM Bookseries. Editor: Borodich FM. Volume: 10, 37 - 47 Real-time {{control of}} the {{direction}} of a propagating crack is little explored area of management of structural integrity. We have examined it with experiments on quasi-static (slow) cracks in PMMA (Polymethyl-Methacrylate). We have observed that in PMMA when the mean crack speeds are low (between 0. 1 and 0. 4 mm/s) secondary thermal sources of relatively low power (of the order of 2 W) can be used to achieve a significant crack redirection. In this interval the micro-photographs of cracks present a fishbone structure, and we argue that the side lobes arc: micro-cracks which appear inside shear bands. The respective fracture surfaces look rippled (<b>hackled).</b> We have observed a clear reverse correlation between the crack speed and the angle of redirection. When the mean crack speed exceeds 0. 4 mm/s) and the fracture surface is mirror smooth no trajectory redirection is achieved. It appears the micro-cracks act as notches and alleviate crack redirection. Therefore, one of our conclusions is that {{it might be possible to}} use relatively weak sources to redirect fast cracks that propagate with a super-critical speed. This hypothesis is advanced because fast cracks are also known to possess a fishbone structure and <b>hackled</b> fracture surface. Non peer reviewe...|$|E
