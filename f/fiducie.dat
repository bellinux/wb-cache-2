25|$|The {{trust is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most innovative contribution of the English legal system. Today, trusts {{play a significant role in}} most common law systems, and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes. In Curaçao, for example, the trust was enacted into law on 1 January 2012; however, the Curaçao Civil Code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument. France has recently added a similar, Roman-law-based device to its own law with the <b>fiducie,</b> amended in 2009; the <b>fiducie,</b> unlike a trust, is a contractual relationship. Trusts are widely used internationally, especially in countries within the English law sphere of influence, and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems, they do recognise the concept under the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition (partly only the extent that they are parties thereto). The Hague Convention also regulates conflict of trusts.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the 1992 attempt to legislate for the introduction into the French civil code of a "trust-like" device, the <b>Fiducie.</b> Through a study of the 1992 Bill's <b>Fiducie,</b> it is hoped to contribute to a socio-theoretical understanding of the workings of French legal culture, in the specific context of this recent confrontation with the common law trust. On the basis of the works of Foucault, Lenoble and Ost, French legal culture will be theoretically constructed as an epistemic entity shaped by two types of discourses: the juridical discourse of sovereignty and the discourse of Governmentality. In the light of the works of Bourdieu and Dezalay, it will be argued that these discourses are connected to the conflictual dynamics of societal fields, identified as the juridical field and the field of Governmentality. As a result of the operation of the juridical discourse of sovereignty, the <b>Fiducie</b> cannot reproduce the dual ownership structure of the trust. This is due in particular to the symbolic potency of the principle of absolute ownership, a product of the juridical discourse of sovereignty. This discourse forms the basis of the French epistemic tradition and is rooted in struggles amongst lawyers for the symbolic authority of law. The second epistemic level relevant to our study is identified as Governmentality, a discourse concerned with the construction of the proper objects, means and ends of government, understood in the broad Foucauldian sense. The <b>Fiducie</b> 's limitations as regards tax planning result from the fiscal provisions of the Bill and the impossibility to fragment ownership rights. Such limitations illustrate the imperative of surveillance in French Governmentality. But the Bill also reflects a contradictory tension towards a more liberal understanding of the <b>Fiducie</b> as a flexible and almost unregulated contractual device destined to compete with the trust on the global market. The conflicting tensions apparent in the legislative formulation of the <b>Fiducie</b> echo struggles within the juridical field and in the governmental field. These struggles involve an emerging elite of international legal experts seeking a dominant position internationally and within their own national fields. On the basis of this analysis, {{it will be possible to}} formulate a number of concluding hypotheses as to the reasons for the 1992 Bill's failure and its possible future revival...|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} piece Raffenne {{looks at the}} institution of trust and discusses why it has not entered French law. As most comparatists writing in the English language look at {{the impact of the}} civilian tradition on common law, this is a valuable and insightful departure. The author says: '[t]he <b>Fiducie</b> confirms the fact that the trust's dual ownership structure cannot be transplanted into French law: the trust had to be processed, modified and cleansed of its fragmented proprietary essence. ' This study analyses this processing. To make the 'alien institution' legitimate, the trust had to be handled within the parameters of the French epistemic tradition and be regulated and transformed into <b>Fiducie.</b> The French drafter gave <b>Fiducie</b> a contractual structure to clearly distinguish it from the trust. The piece discusses the concept of <b>Fiducie,</b> the absolute ownership of the civilian tradition, the French epistemic tradition, the French mentalite and the dynamics of French legal culture. We are offered a comprehensive analysis of the failed 1992 Bill, a first attempt to introduce the institution of trust into French law, by initially looking into the genesis of the Bill. Ensuring the Frenchness of the new device and its uniformity with the traditions of the Napoleonic codification was foremost {{in the minds of the}} drafters. Yet in spite of this, and also the absence of real opposition to the Bill, it was dropped from the agenda of Parliament in late 1994, without ever having been discussed. Was the reason for the failure the attempt to fit the trust into the 'existing legal system'? However, Raffenne suggests that, despite the lack of a regulated status, a new conceptual element has been added to French law. A pragmatic recourse to fiduciary devices emerged and it has become a 'widely used conceptual tool', although <b>Fiducie</b> cannot be considered as a transposition of the trust into French law. Within the French epistemic tradition, is the peculiarity of 'absolute ownership' related to the logical structures and mythological images of the French 'epistemic imaginary'? Obviously, the enduring significance of the symbolism of, 'absolute ownership' obstructed the transfer of the trust into the French legal framework. This persistent significance is shown by Raffenne to be mainly epistemic and symbolic. The author claims that, nevertheless, this absolute right is subject to the contradictory ethos of state surveillance of ownership'. This is the revelation of 'governmentalitly', existing on another epistemic plane, 'deeply ingrained in French legal culture'. The trust also conflicted with the basic premises of French succession laws and challenged the concept of 'unitary patrimony', which, according to Raffenne, creates an 'examinable economic subject' in France. If the trust cannot be transplanted into French law, with which it is seen to be incompatible, why is there still such an interest in it? One explanation offered is that the epistemic resistance is now overcome. Raffenne suggests that this is due to changes within the legal profession linked to the rhetoric and reality of globalization. The emerging global legal elite in France, shaped by the Anglo-American model of lawyering, acts as broker of the rules. <b>Fiducie,</b> all early illustration of the impact of globalization, is seen as 'a microcosmic expression' of 'two-tiered competition' by these brokers. <b>Fiducie</b> was not a competitor to the trust, which might have gained more support from legal and financial experts. <b>Fiducie,</b> made a useless device by the Bill, may nevertheless develop through lawyers' international practice. The study shows that the epistemic tradition underlying French law is symbolically powerful, even though not anchored in economic power, and yet the restructuring of legal training and doctrinal research, especially as regards commercial law, helps to erode this mythology of the state. How jar does this example show the strength of epistemic structures in the process of transmigration of legal institutions? Does the transmigration of a commercial and business device depend oil the practice of local experts and stakes raised at national and global levels? One can look back to Foster and ahead to Carey-Miller...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, {{there are}} still today no {{exhaustive}} systematic rules on trusts. Aspects of this institute, as developed in common-law jurisdictions, give rise to considerable practical difficulties, since they conflict with some linchpin tenets of the civil law tradition, including the general principle of the liability of the debtor, the conception of property as an absolute right and {{the limited number of}} rights in rem, the prohibition of succession agreements. Despite all this, large efforts have been recently made to introduce, in the Italian legal system, institutes that would perform {{at least some of the}} peculiar functions of trusts. This is not an isolated phenomenon but a tendency characterizing a growing number of other systems, including Luxembourg, Quebec, Uruguay, China, Republic of San Marino and France. Such tendency is fostered by a number of reasons: EU Institutions have recently proved very pro-active towards trusts, inviting member states to introduce equivalent tools in their legislation. The growing competition among regulators for providing hospitable environments to investors has also pushed even the more conservative to innovate. A fit example of this can be found in the recent law on <b>fiducie</b> which has substantially transplanted in the French system a tool that closely resembles the trust. Following the introduction of this new, valuable instrument, large portions of the French system will be dramatically modified, including those areas of the law, as successions, that are not directly touched upon. A shift of perspective has thus occurred: from the idea, shared until today, that the fundamental principles of civil law could only be derogated in specific and exceptional circumstances, to the awareness of their actual reduction to the status of ordinary rules. Comparing the new regulation governing the <b>fiducie</b> with the Italian surrogates of the trust, it appears quite obvious that such important modernization process has yet to be conceived in Italy, where a similar shift of perspective is still far to come...|$|E
40|$|During the {{legislative}} {{works on a}} new Civil Code for the Czech Republic, it has been proposed {{that the concept of}} trust be introduced into Czech law, largely by transplanting the concept of <b>fiducie</b> contained in the Civil Code of Québec. The thesis, after introducing the principal concepts of trust as known around the world today, whether in common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions or mixed jurisdictions, describes the principal commercial uses of trust in trust jurisdictions and analyses the possibilities of current Czech law to replicate the trust function not using the trust. The thesis argues that the classical civilist objections to the possibility to implant true trust into civil law jurisdictions are largely unfounded in respect of the Czech legal system. The thesis further performs a comparative assessment of the Czech Civil Code proposal. It is argued that the legal construct at hand in the proposal is actually not trust, but a mere trust-like arrangement, as it lacks one of the trust's most salient features [...] transfer of the trust property by the settlor to the trustee. Apart from that, the thesis analyses specific provisions of the proposal and subjects them critique. Based on this analysis, it introduces a number of proposals for the enhancement of the proposed provisions...|$|E
40|$|Trusts {{with special}} {{regard to their}} {{foundation}} and administration Abstract The purpose of my thesis is to analyse foundation and administration of trusts in the Czech Civile Code {{with respect to the}} main theoretical issues such as essencialia, naturatia and accidentalia negotii of the primary foundation legal document with is called "statut". I also concentrate on the status of beneficiary, but mainly on the rights and duties of the administrator of the trust. The reason for my research is to develop a system concerning the elementary questions relating to the legal life of the trust, to tackle main theoretical problems and to distinguish between significant phases of its existence and its admninistration. The thesis is composed of three chapters, Chapter Two being most detailed. Chapter one which is subdivided into three parts is dealing with preliminary questions such as the concept of trust and its history and international variation of similar institutes such as <b>fiducie,</b> treuhand and common law trust. Chapter One is introductory and defines the concept of trust: it is quasi legal subject made of structure of rights and duties towards autonomous assets and of rights and duties concerning its administration in largo sensum. Chapter Two examines relevant Czech legislation involving trusts, primarily the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|According to EU Directive 2015 / 849, all Member States must {{establish}} a central register {{of data on}} ultimate beneficial owners of corporate legal entities and also of trusts and legal arrangements similar to trusts. First of all, this requires identification of the latter arrangements in the individual Member States, which {{is not an easy}} task: the definition related to being ‘similar to trusts’ is quite vague. The main aim with the article was to determine the arrangements in Estonian private law that should be considered in implementation of the UBO-register rules. Therefore, a brief overview is provided of trusts and two types of arrangements used in civil-law systems for the same purposes – the Treuhand and <b>fiducie.</b> The piece then highlights the similarities between these and the trust, with the conclusion being drawn that being ‘trust-like’ {{in the context of the}} directive boils down to situations wherein from the outside the property has one person as an owner but there also exists an internal relationship that obliges the title-holder to observe certain duties and that may grant another person the economic benefit from the property. Next, the article turns to the Estonian legal scene. Under consideration are family- and succession-law devices (e. g., executorship of a will), various forms of shared ownership and communities (in particular, silent partnership and contractual investment funds), mandate and commission contracts, intermediated holding of securities, and fiduciary ownership for security purposes. The conclusion is that there indeed are arrangements in the Estonian legal system that fall into the category of trust-like arrangements under the directive but that the registration of UBO data for all of them would not be without difficulties. Finally, some criteria for registration of the relevant arrangements are proposed...|$|E
