40|$|Abstractâ€”In turning <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> {{polycrystalline}} cubic {{boron nitride}} (cBN) compacts are widely used, {{due to their}} higher hardness and higher thermal conductivity. However, in milling <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> fracture of cBN cutting tools readily occurs because they have poor fracture toughness. Therefore, coated cemented carbide tools, which have good fracture toughness and wear resistance, are generally widely used. In this study, <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> (ASTM D 2, JIS SKD 11, 60 HRC) was milled with three physical vapor deposition (PVD) -coated cemented carbide end mill cutters {{in order to determine}} effective tool materials for cutting <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> at high cutting speeds. The coating films used were (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si) N and (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N coating films. (Ti,W,Si,Al) N is a new type of coating film. The inner layer of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si) N and (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N coating system is (Ti,W) N coating film, and the outer layer is (Ti,W,Si) N and (Ti,W,Si,Al) N coating films, respectively. Furthermore, commercial (Ti,Al) N-based coating film was also used. The following results were obtained: (1) In milling <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> at a cutting speed of 3. 33 m/s, the tool wear width of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated tool was smaller than that of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si) N-coated tool. And, compared with the commercial (Ti,Al) N, the tool wear width of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated tool was smaller than that of the (Ti,Al) N-coated tool. (2) The tool wear of the (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated tool increased with an increase in cutting speed. (3) The (Ti,W) N/(Ti,W,Si,Al) N-coated cemented carbide was an effective tool material for high-speed cutting below a cutting speed of 3. 33 m/s.

40|$|Abstract. As {{high-speed}} steel tap {{is incapable of}} small-hole tapping (M 3) in <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> vibration tapping is introduced in this paper to solve this problem. Theoretic analysis with fracture mechanics indicates that the impact effect of the tap on the workpiece results in extended micro cracks and a much lower tapping torque. And the torsional rigidity of the tap is enforced in vibration tapping as proved by dynamic analysis. The experimental results show that with well chosen amplitudes, tapping torque decreases as vibration frequency increases and increases {{with the increase of}} net cutting time ratio, with the latter being the more significant influencing factor.
