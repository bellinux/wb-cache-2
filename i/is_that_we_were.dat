500|$|On 20 February 1947, Attlee {{announced}} Mountbatten's appointment, {{and that}} Britain would transfer power in India {{not later than}} June 1948. Mountbatten took office as Viceroy on 24 March 1947, two days after his arrival in India. By then, the Congress had come around {{to the idea of}} partition. Nehru stated in 1960, [...] "the truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> tired men and we were getting on in years... The plan for partition offered a way out and we took it." [...] Leaders of the Congress decided that having loosely tied Muslim-majority provinces as part of a future India was not worth the loss of the powerful government at the centre which they desired. However, the Congress insisted that if Pakistan were to become independent, Bengal and Punjab would have to be divided.|$|E
500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring {{the hell out of the}} audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E
500|$|Writers Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa have {{admitted}} they were [...] "not computer literate", and felt {{this was a}} detriment to their writing. Gordon was disappointed in the episode, stating that it [...] "still qualifies {{as one of my}} biggest disappointments", ranking it as the worst episode of the first season. Glen Morgan felt that [...] "parts of the episode worked. What maybe fell a little flat <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> a little too afraid of doing HAL and, in a sense, I think that's what the building needed; to have a scary personality." [...] James Wong had mixed feelings, saying that the episode [...] "had some neat stuff at the end...although I think the ending was a little unsatisfying to me visually, as well as in terms of how Mulder comes to dismember the machine. Overall a fun episode." [...] Chris Carter was more supportive of the episode, stating that the script addressed the question of what made up an X-File, and that it doesn't always have to be paranormal. He also felt positive about the episode's action scenes.|$|E

2500|$|Cradle of Filth's {{particular}} genre {{has provoked}} {{a great deal}} of discussion, and their status as a black metal band or otherwise has been in debate since near the time that the group rose to fame. The band have openly cited first wave black metal acts such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said [...] "I use the term 'heavy metal', rather than 'black metal', because I think that's a bit of a fad now. Call it what you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...". Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that [...] "few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days." [...] In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer magazine, former guitarist Paul Allender said, [...] "We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out—you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff—we didn't sound anything like that. The way that I see it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and still are now, an extreme metal band." ...|$|E
2500|$|For the album, Jackson {{reunited with}} {{longtime}} collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis {{to work with}} her and Dupri. Conversations between the group began before December 2005, when they elaborated the first themes, and songwriting and recording began in earnest in February. The discussion turned to how Jackson was feeling during the recording of her third studio album Control in 1986. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on in}} her life then that I just thought her album should be called that", Dupri said. Jam agreed, saying it made sense as a concept because it meant a sense of rejuvenation for her. A sense of that excitement that people have when they are 20 years old, when their life are beginning. He finished saying Jackson had that same sense of hunger and excitement than she had when she was younger. Jackson wanted to create an R and dance album, but with an emphasis on dance. Rather than contribute to separate songs for the album, Dupri Jam and Lewis decided to collaborate. According to the group, the process caused ego and procedural conflicts, but they complimented each other. Jam said: [...] "The great thing about working with Jermaine, he came in with total respect for us, we had total respect for him. The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> fans of each other and for Janet". The singer stated, ...|$|E
