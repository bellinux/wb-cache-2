2500|$|When Morrison {{was about}} two, her family's {{landlord}} {{set fire to}} the house they lived in, while they were home, because her parents couldn't pay the rent. Her family responded to what she called this [...] "bizarre form of evil" [...] by laughing at the landlord rather than falling into despair. Morrison later said her family's response demonstrated <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> integrity and claim your own life in the face of acts of such [...] "monumental crudeness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You're wrong, sir, you are wrong; {{look at the}} {{difference}} between yourself and me. When you've lost all you have, and seven times more, you're still a gentleman. No man can take that from you. You may look the proudest duchess in the land in the face, and claim her as your equal; while I, sir,--I don't mean, though, to talk of myself--but suppose that you had loved a pious and a beautiful lady, and among all your worship of her, and your awe of her, had felt that you were worthy of her, that you could become her comforter, and her pride, and her joy, if it wasn't for that accursed gulf that men had put between you, that you were no gentleman; that you didn't know how to walk, and how to pronounce, and when to speak, and when to be silent, not even how to handle your own knife and fork without disgusting her, or <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> own body clean and sweet--Ah, sir, I see it now as I never did before, what a wall all these little defects build up round a poor man; how he longs and struggles to show himself as he is at heart, and cannot, till he feels sometimes {{as if he was}} enchanted, pent up, like folks in fairy tales, in the body of some dumb beast. But, sir,' he went on, with a concentrated bitterness which Lancelot had never seen in him before, 'just because this gulf which rank makes is such a deep one, therefore it looks to me all the more devilish; not that I want to pull down any man to my level; I despise my own level too much; I want to rise; I want those like me to rise with me. Let the rich be as rich as they will.--I, and those like me, covet not money, but manners. Why should not the workman be a gentleman, and a workman still? Why are they to be shut out from all that is beautiful, and delicate, and winning, and stately?' ...|$|E

500|$|Krasinski {{received}} a haircut due to production on another film, Leatherheads (2008), which he thought [...] "ended up working perfectly" [...] {{for the season}} finale. Co-creator Greg Daniels had wanted Jim to get a haircut for a while, as {{he thought it would}} [...] "change [...] up a little bit." [...] Krasinski thought it was [...] "really smart" [...] to make it seem like Karen's idea. Kwapis was careful with Jim's reaction shots in the episode, as {{he did not want to}} [...] "tip anything" [...] to the audience about Jim's choice of Karen or Pam. Kwapis explained, [...] "That to me was actually one of the big challenges of the episode is <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you on <b>your</b> toes in terms of not knowing where the story was going." [...] Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end.|$|R
