2500|$|Chapter 4 {{focuses on}} Keynes's economics, in {{particular}} {{in the evolution of}} his thinking and how he challenged mainstream thinking. There is emphasis on the high importance Keynes placed on the role of uncertainty; [...] his central insight that demand, not supply, is the key factor governing unemployment; and Keynes's principal policy recommendation that the rate of interest be kept permanently low so that a high proportion of savings will be channelled into <b>job-creating</b> <b>investment.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main {{resource}} of EU’s territorial cohesion policy is EU’s structural funds, {{considered to be}} delivered to the most deprived areas of EU. There are two structural funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF). The ERDF {{is intended to be}} used for the creation of infrastructure and productive <b>job-creating</b> <b>investment</b> and it is mainly for the businesses. The ESF is meant to contribute to the integration of the unemployed populations into the work life via training measurements.|$|E
5000|$|In this vein, Karel De Gucht, the EU {{commissioner}} {{in charge}} of negotiating International Investment Agreements declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall [...] "fully enshrine democratic prerogatives" [...] and [...] "explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions - {{on issues such as}} the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or [...] "the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine" [...] - cannot be over-ridden". He announced to [...] "crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments", to [...] "open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny - documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, {{will be able to make}} submissions". Also, he said, the EU [...] "will eliminate any conflicts of interest - the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion". However, insisting equally on the advantages of such investment protection agreements, he states along that they [...] "protect <b>job-creating</b> <b>investment</b> from discrimination and unfair treatment" [...] and that [...] "the task here is to find the right balance between preventing abuse and protecting investments".|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} examines {{job creation}} {{and the work}} of the IDB from two supporting policy perspectives: (i) policies and programs to improve the business climate and investment for private sector-driven growth; and, (ii) labor market policies and programs. For each of these two pillars, the publication examines overall policy frameworks and the links to job creation, and it reviews some of the IDB's contributions. The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean are now taking steps to expand <b>job-creating</b> <b>investments</b> and enact more effective public policies to support employment growth. This report is intended as a resource for policymakers, the private sector, workers and their representatives alike. It is our hope that it will inform the efforts of these stakeholders as they prepare for new commitments and initiatives {{in the context of the}} Summit process. ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{formative}} years, the NRNA focused on getting a NRN bill {{passed by the}} Government of Nepal, getting a simplified visa regime for the foreign citizens of Nepali origin while visiting Nepal, and getting business-friendly policies to support the investment of expatriate Nepalis in Nepal. Eventually, realizing the dream of getting a dual citizenship in Nepal has remained a cherished goal of the NRNA. Equally important objective of the association is to support in the economic development of Nepal by charitable projects, through <b>job-creating</b> <b>investments,</b> and by lobbying in international capitals on behalf of Nepal. The Open University of Nepal Initiative, the Nepal Library Foundation, the Senior Living Quarters in Chitawan and several other projects are some examples {{of this kind of}} programs. For the professional and academic groups in North American, Europe, and Oceania particularly, offering knowledge and technical expertise through NRNA has remained an important goal. Further, the NRNA as a whole has always remained sensitive to the need of the Nepali workers abroad and has vocally called for making the lives better.|$|R
30|$|The Structural Funds {{represent}} {{financial instruments}} of the EU regional policy, intended {{to pursue the}} goal of economic, social and territorial cohesion by narrowing the development disparities among regions and member states. For the period 2007 – 2013, the budget allocated to the Structural Funds amounts to around € 278 billion, which represents 28 % of the Community budget. There are two Structural Funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), set up in 1975, providing support {{for the creation of}} infrastructures and productive <b>job-creating</b> <b>investment,</b> mainly for businesses; the European Social Fund (ESF), set up in 1958, contributes to the integration into working life of the unemployed and disadvantaged sections of the population, mainly by funding training measures. The bulk of Structural Funds expenditure flows to Objective “Convergence” (former Objective 1) areas, which are EU regions with GDP per capita less than 75 % of the EU average. Structural Funds always involve co-financing from national sources.|$|E
40|$|Justice, Jonathan B. The EB- 5 Immigrant Investor Program was {{established}} by Congress in 1990 to spur economic growth through entrepreneurship, immigration, and foreign direct investment. By most accounts this program has not achieved its full potential to create jobs or attract capital to the United States. The EB- 5 Immigrant Investor Program reserves 10, 000 visas for immigrant investors who make a minimum $ 500, 000 or $ 1 million <b>job-creating</b> <b>investment</b> in the United States. Immigrants who invest in targeted employment areas, defined as areas with an unemployment rate 150 % of the national average, are eligible to make investments at the $ 500, 000 amount. Given the reduced investment amount, {{the vast majority of}} EB- 5 Immigrant Investors finance projects in targeted employment areas. In 1993 Congress established the Regional Center Pilot Program. This pilot program allows EB- 5 Immigrant Investors to use economic forecasts to estimate the number of jobs created {{as a result of their}} investment, therefore creating an alternative avenue for investors to achieve the minimum 10 jobs required to obtain citizenship in the United States. During the federal fiscal years of 2010 and 2011 approximately 90 % of EB- 5 Immigrant Investors made investments through Regional Centers. Though the EB- 5 Immigrant Investor Program has attracted at least $ 6. 8 billion of investment to the United States since its inception, some states have benefitted from the program more than others. For example, during the federal fiscal years of 2010 and 2011, EB- 5 Immigrant Investors financed Regional Center projects in only 24 states. Using logistic regression, this dissertation explored the relationship between state-level EB- 5 Investment during the federal fiscal years of 2010 and 2011 and the independent variables of market size, wage, unions, taxes, immigration, innovation, unemployment, and rural area. The regression determined that immigration was a statistically significant determinant of EB- 5 Investment during the federal fiscal years of 2010 and 2011. A recommendation of this dissertation is that policymakers seeking to attract EB- 5 Investment should support policies that encourage immigrants to settle within their states, as immigration has been shown to spur economic growth through entrepreneurship, job creation, and international trade. This dissertation also encourages the release of disaggregated data on the EB- 5 Immigrant Investor Program by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as more detailed information on the program can lead to the identification of additional determinants of EB- 5 Investment and inspire targeted policy solutions that can help states attract investment and jobs through the EB- 5 Immigrant Investor Program.

50|$|Deferral is {{beneficial}} for U.S. companies {{to raise the}} cost of capital relatively to their foreign-based competitors. Their foreign subsidiaries can reinvest their earnings without incurring additional tax {{that allows them to}} grow faster. It is also valuable to U.S. corporations with global operations, especially for corporations with income in low-tax countries. Some {{of the largest and most}} profitable U.S. corporations pay exceedingly low tax rates through their use of subsidiaries in so-called tax haven countries. Eighty-three of the United States’s 100 biggest public companies have subsidiaries in countries that are listed as tax havens or financial privacy jurisdictions, according to the Government Accountability Office.However, tax deferral encourages U.S. companies to make <b>job-creating</b> <b>investments</b> offshore even if similar investments in the United States can be more profitable, absent tax considerations. Furthermore, companies try to use accounting techniques to record profits offshore by any way, even if they keep actual investment and jobs in the United States. This explains why U.S. corporations report their largest profits in low-tax countries like the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Bermuda, though clearly that is not where most real economic activity occurs.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} {{influence of}} Chinese in New York City is growing as well. The majority of cash purchases of New York City {{real estate in}} the first half of 2015 were transacted by Chinese as a combination of overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans. The top three surnames of cash purchasers of Manhattan real estate during that time period were Chen, Liu, and Wong. Chinese have also invested billion of dollars into New York commercial real estate since 2013. According to China Daily, the ferris wheel under construction on Staten Island, slated to be among the world's tallest and most expensive with an estimated cost of US$500 million, has received US$170 million in funding from approximately 300 Chinese investors through the U.S. EB-5 immigrant investor program, which grants permanent residency to foreign investors in exchange for <b>job-creating</b> <b>investments</b> in the United States, with Chinese immigrating to New York City dominating this list. Chinese billionaires have been buying New York property to be used as pied-à-terres, often priced in the tens of millions of U.S. dollars each, and as of 2016, middle-class Chinese investors were purchasing real estate in New York. Chinese companies have also been raising billions of dollars on stock exchanges in New York via initial public offerings.|$|R
30|$|Most {{migration}} policy today is coined as restrictive {{or at least}} selective (Shachar, 2016) and not often as welcoming. In the battle for talent, a ‘welcoming’ policy {{can be an important}} asset. Referring to the fact that migrants founded 52 % of start-ups created in Silicon Valley between 1995 and 2005 the European Commission’s EU Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan (European Commission, 2012) called for the EU member states to remove legal obstacles to the establishment of businesses by legally resident migrants and to facilitate access to information and networking prospective immigrant entrepreneurs. A not so ambitious call if you consider that {{migration policy}} is an important barrier for entrepreneurs who want to expand (Startup Genome, 2017). There is a lively battle for multinational headquarters and foreign investment going on in most western EU countries. In 2017 France ‘attracted a total of 1, 298 new <b>job-creating</b> foreign <b>investments</b> […] that created or maintained 33, 489 jobs.’ (Business France, 2017). 1 The Netherlands attracted 357 foreign businesses such as Netflix, which created 12, 686 jobs (NFIA, 2018). Less advertised are the numbers and the results of smaller businesses, run by individual TCNs, self-employed or small enterprises. They may not be welcomed by a foreign investment recruitment team, rolling out an ‘orange carpet’ as the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency does. 2 They are welcomed by immigration policies.|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} major U. S. {{companies}} are announcing job layoffs almost daily, the renewable energy industry is hiring new workers every day to build wind farms, install rooftop solar arrays, and build solar thermal and geothermal power plants. The output of industrial firms that manufacture the equipment for these energy facilities is expanding by well over 30 percent a year. These investments both create jobs and help prevent climate change from spiraling out of control. Among the several sources of renewable energy, wind looms large. The United States has 24, 000 megawatts of wind generating capacity already online (think 24 coal-fired power plants), and 83 wind farms with some 8, 000 megawatts of capacity are under construction. Beyond this, a staggering 225, 000 megawatts of planned wind farms are waiting for access to transmission lines. Currently, the United States has 40 plants manufacturing wind power components. Eight of these plants are assembling wind turbines, 20 are fabricating wind towers, and 12 are making blades. In addition, many more manufacturing facilities are under construction, recently announced, and in planning. Every billion dollars invested in wind farms creates some 3, 350 jobs [...] nearly four times the 870 jobs created with a similar investment in coal-fired power plants. With solar cells (photovoltaics), the U. S. growth potential {{can be seen in}} the recent expansion from small rooftop installations to commercial generating facilities covering several square miles. In 2007, the United States installed roughly 200 megawatts of solar cell generating capacity, most of it on rooftops. In 2008, Pacific Gas & Electric [...] a leading California utility [...] contracted with two firms to build 800 megawatts of solar photovoltaic generating capacity; their output at peak power will equal that of a nuclear reactor. A billion dollars invested in solar cell installations generates 1, 480 jobs. A similar growth situation exists with solar thermal power plants [...] facilities that use mirrors to concentrate sunlight and generate steam to power turbines. Until recently there was just one of these facilities in the United States: the 350 -megawatt SEGS complex in California. Now there are 18 commercial-scale power plants under development (15 in California, 2 in Florida, and 1 in Arizona) with a collective generating capacity of 4, 160 megawatts [...] nearly a twelvefold increase. This is an example of yet another labor-intensive energy technology (2, 270 jobs per billion dollars invested) with a sharply falling cost curve that is fast becoming a major player in the U. S. energy economy. Next consider geothermal energy. For 20 years, the United States had only one commercial-scale geothermal generating facility, in California. Now suddenly, almost overnight, there are some 96 projects [...] most of them with a generating capacity ranging from 10 to 350 megawatts [...] in western states. We are witnessing the emergence of a major new source of electricity. Two new technologies [...] plug-in hybrid cars and advanced design wind turbines [...] have set the stage for building an entirely new automotive fuel economy. While four manufacturers are coming to market with plug-in hybrids in 2010 or 2011, the early estimates of how many they will produce appear to be small. What is needed is a crash program, almost a World War II [...] type mobilization, to produce tens of millions of cars powered largely with electricity, mostly from wind farms, at the gasoline equivalent cost of less than $ 1 per gallon. The good news is that plug-in hybrids do not need a new infrastructure. The U. S. goal for Detroit should be not merely to save it but to make it the world leader in producing high-efficiency plug-in hybrid cars. Replacing one gas-guzzling SUV with a plug-in hybrid will, over the car's lifetime, reduce oil imports by 200 barrels, saving $ 20, 000 of oil imports. Such an initiative multiplied across the fleet would keep hundreds of billions of dollars at home for <b>job-creating</b> U. S. <b>investments.</b> Another <b>job-creating</b> way to save energy is to invest in urban transit, both light rail and buses. When combined with making streets bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly, this also increases mobility and reduces oil imports. In terms of job creation, investment in retrofitting buildings creates more than seven times as many jobs as a similar investment in coal-fired power plants. One of the early leaders is Houston, which plans to retrofit each of its 271 government buildings, thus simultaneously reducing energy use and operational costs. As Houston Mayor Bill White says, "It makes good business sense. " In California, Adobe Systems, a software firm, retrofitted its expansive corporate headquarters at a cost of $ 1. 4 million, dropping its electricity use 35 percent and its natural gas use 41 percent. The energy savings paid back the $ 1. 4 million retrofit investment in just 14 months. (More typically, the payback time on retrofitting buildings is closer to 5 years.) And these jobs cannot be outsourced. Building the new energy economy creates jobs in the construction of wind farms or the retrofitting of buildings, and also indirectly in the supply lines that provide, for example, the parts for wind turbines or the thermally efficient windows for retrofitting. These investments also generate jobs outside the energy sector. For example, the construction of a wind farm in a Great Plains community generates jobs in local businesses such as restaurants and home improvement outlets. The government's role in this vast job creation initiative is to use public funds as incentives to leverage far greater investments of private capital. We estimate that $ 100 billion of federal funds used strategically over the next 12 years would leverage $ 400 billion of private capital investment. If this $ 500 billion is allocated evenly between renewable energy development (wind, solar, and geothermal) and retrofitting, and if every two jobs created in the energy sector creates one job elsewhere, this would quickly generate 600, 000 new jobs that would last through 2020. In addition to the short-term need to create jobs, there is the all-encompassing need to avoid runaway climate change and the threat it poses to global civilization. If the world is to have a decent chance of saving the Greenland ice sheet and at least the larger glaciers in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan Plateau, the glaciers whose ice melt sustains the major rivers and irrigation systems of Asia during the dry season, then global carbon emissions need to be cut 80 percent by 2020. For the United States, this might require up to $ 500 billion of federal funds to mobilize $ 2 trillion of private capital [...] for a total $ 2. 5 -trillion investment in renewables and efficiency by 2020. Investment at this level would create 3 million new jobs that would last through 2020. A complementary measure to accelerate carbon reduction would be to incorporate the cost of climate change in fossil fuel prices either through a cap-and-trade system or by restructuring taxes. The latter would mean simply raising the tax on carbon and offsetting it with a reduction in income taxes. Both these measures shift investments from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables. One of the glaring gaps in current U. S. policy is the failure to extend the wind production tax credit beyond one year. The time has come to extend it to 2015, giving investors the needed confidence to make longer-term investments in both wind generation and transmission lines. Beyond this, a strong national electricity grid is needed. Such a grid would both permit more-efficient management of the country's electrical generating capacity and link regions rich in wind, solar, and geothermal energy with population centers. Historically, it is rare for so many emerging threats to have a common solution. The measures described here would simultaneously reduce carbon emissions, lower oil imports, and create millions of new jobs. This is a win-win-win opportunity that we cannot pass by...|$|R
