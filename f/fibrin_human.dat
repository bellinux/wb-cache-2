40|$|AIM: To examine {{in vitro}} whether phosphorylcholine coating of poly(methylmethacrylate) {{can reduce the}} {{adhesion}} of fibrinogen, <b>fibrin,</b> <b>human</b> scleral fibroblast and macrophage compared with current biomaterials used {{in the construction of}} glaucoma drainage devices. METHODS: Sample discs (n= 6) of poly(methylmethacrylate), silicone, polypropylene, PTFE, and phosphorylcholine coated poly(methylmethacrylate) were seeded with fibrinogen, fibrin, fibroblast, and macrophages and incubated for variable lengths of time. The quantification was performed using radioactivity, spectrophotometry, ATP dependent luminometry, and immunohistochemistry respectively. RESULTS: Fibrinogen and fibrin adhesion to phosphorylcholine coated poly(methylmethacrylate) were significantly lower than PMMA (p= 0. 004). Phosphorylcholine coating of poly(methylmethacrylate) also significantly reduced the adhesion of human scleral fibroblast (p= 0. 002) and macrophage (p= 0. 01) compared with PMMA. All the other biomaterials showed either similar or insignificantly different levels of adhesion to all the proteins and cells tested compared with PMMA.

40|$|During wound {{repair a}} 3 -day lag occurs between injury and {{granulation}} tissue development. When full-thickness, 8 -mm-round, excisional wounds {{were made in}} the paravertebral skin of outbred Yorkshire pigs and harvested at various times, no granulation tissue was observed before day 4. Day 4 wounds were 3 % filled with granulation tissue, day 5 wounds 48 % filled, and day 7 wounds 88 % filled. The prerequisites for granulation tissue induction are not known but hypothetically include fibrin matrix maturation or cell activation. To examine whether matrix maturation was necessary, wounds were allowed to heal for 5 or 7 days and then aggressively curetted, resulting in the formation of fresh fibrin clots in the newly formed wound spaces. In contrast to original wounds, no lag phase was observed; wounds curetted on day 5 were 23 % filled with granulation tissue 1 day later and 99 % filled 3 days later, whereas wounds curetted on day 7 were 47 % filled 1 day later and completely filled within 2 days. Thus, granulation tissue formation resumed promptly and independently of fibrin clot matrix maturation. This observation suggested that mesenchymal cell activation might be the rate-limiting step in granulation tissue formation. To address this hypothesis more directly, cultured porcine or human fibroblasts, grown to 80 % confluence in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium plus 10 % fetal calf serum, were added to new wounds. These wounds were sealed with a freshly made exogenous fibrin clot. In some wounds, platelet releasate was added to the fibrin clot. Granulation tissue did not form in day 3 wounds, which had received either fibrin alone, fibrin and platelet releasate, or fibrin and fibroblasts. In contrast, granulation tissue was observed in wounds receiving <b>fibrin,</b> <b>human</b> fibroblasts, and platelet releasate. By day 4, wounds receiving cultured human fibroblasts, fibrin, and platelet releasate were 14 % filled with granulation tissue compared with less than 4 % granulation tissue in control wounds. Thus, fibroblast activation is a limiting step of granulation tissue formation, and continued cell stimulation is required for accelerated development...|$|E

Autologous conditions already have been improved by using human cell sources. However, culture conditions and scaffolds {{still have to be}} optimized. This study is based on the successful use of the scaffold system of PGA/P 4 HB combined with bovine fibrin as a cell carrier. However, to create a fully autolo-gous approach the use of animal-derived fibrin has to be avoided and transferred to <b>human</b> <b>fibrin.</b> Methods and Results—Human fibrin characteristics which are important for tissue engi-neering applications such as gelation time and cell distribution, were optimized by varying thrombin and fibrinogen concentration in a fibrin disk model system. Thrombin concentration was shown to influence gelation time, and thrombin and fibrinogen concentration both influ-enced cell density and distribution. The optimized <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gels were further tested by analyzing their suitability as a cell carrier in a well-known tissue engineering system. <b>Human</b> <b>fibrin</b> seeded constructs showed similar quantitative and qualitative tissue formation and me-chanical properties as bovine fibrin seeded constructs. Finally, <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> was successfully used as a cell carrier to tissue engineer a trileaflet heart valve. Conclusion—This study demonstrated the feasibility of <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> as a cell carrier in com-bination with a PGA/P 4 HB scaffold for heart valve tissue engineering, bringing a completely autologous tissue engineering approach one step closer to reality. ...|$|R
40|$|Background / Aims: The present {{research}} {{project has been}} made mainly {{with the idea of}} comparing the tensile strength values and histological answers of three types of colon anastomosis: sutured with silk 5 / 0; polyglycolic acid 5 / 0; sutureless anastomosis with <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gum. Methodology: One hundred and five (105) Wistar breath rata allocated into 3 groups of 35 animals were used to implement this experimental research project: silk, polyglycolic acid and <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gum. Furthermore, each group was subdivided in 5 series respectively to carry out an experimental study on the tensile strength parameter and anatomic-pathological determinations on the 10 th, 20 th, 30 th, 40 th and 50 th day after the gurgical intevention. The following surgical interventions were practiced on them: A cross section of the colon, followed by: group 1 : an end-to-end discontinuous suture anastomosis with Silk; group 2 : an end-to-end discontinuous suture anastomosis with polyglycolic acid; group 3 : sutureless anastomosis with <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gumu. On the 10 th, 20 th, 30 th, 40 th and 50 th days we proceeded to measure the anastomosis' tensile strength value for each series. We used a tensile strength apparatus and waited until the break down of the suture sample took place and wrote down the value, in g/cm, given by the voltmeter at that momento. Reslts: The results obtained indicate that anastomosis made in group 1 (silk) lasted longer to the tensile strength apparatus; followed by those practiced in group 2 (polyglycolic acid); and finally anastomosis carried out in group 3 (<b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gum). However in the anastomotic carried out with the <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gum the healing started from the 10 th day. In the same period of time we carried out the following anatomic-pathological determinations: a) Sharp inflammation; b) edema; c) non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrate; d) granulomatous inflarnmatory infiltrate to foreign bodies; e) fibrosis. Conclusions: The results show a better answer for anastomosis made with <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gum than those carried out with the two other suture materials. This conclusion is based on the facts that the <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gum used to carry out sutureless anastomosis during this research project generated a Iower sharp inflammation and speediness in its absorption;absence of granular reaction to a foreign body; a minor or non-existent edema at all; as well a good fibrous healing speediness process. Therefore, all these experimental results lead us to conclude that the <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> gum used to carry out sutureless anastomosis may be an alternative to the handmade conventional anastomosis. Moreover they are easy to be implemented...|$|R

40|$|The {{utility of}} {{promising}} biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering and cell-based gene therapy, is currently limited by inadequate transport from the microvasculature. Success of these applications depends, in part, upon improved understanding of incorporation of implanted endothelial cells (ECs). Towards this understanding, the work {{presented in this}} thesis focuses on evaluating {{the effects of the}} presence of non-endothelial supporting cells, endothelial cell origin, extracellular matrix (ECM) support, the mechanical environment, and implant location on microvascular network (MVN) formation and EC incorporation into vessels. ^ Supporting cells. When mixed with fibroblasts within Matrigel, BAEC show improved MVN formation in vitro, increased survival in vitro and in vivo, prolonged hGH delivery, and increased vascular incorporation, as compared to BAEC alone, which remain round and show rapidly decreasing hGH levels. ^ Cell source. Adult human bone marrow-derived endothelial cells (BOEC) show superior MVN and lumen formation relative to three vessel-derived endothelial cell lines. Although hypothesized to have a survival advantage because of their large proliferative capacity, BOEC did not show a survival advantage. ^ Mechanical environment. ECs in a stiff ECM environment (mechanically constrained or high collagen concentration) form large, thin-walled lumen structures, elongate as single cells, and show actin stress fibers. ECs in a more malleable environment (floating gels or low collagen concentration) form in vivo-like, elongated, multi-cellular structures with smaller, thicker-walled lumens and punctate actin staining. These behaviors can be modulated by use of cells that exert larger (BOEC) or smaller (HUVEC) tractional forces, implying that the balance between cellular force generation and matrix stiffness modulates capillary morphogenesis. ^ ECM support. Salmon fibrin was evaluated as an alternative ECM support by evaluating sprouting of human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC) on dextran beads suspended in either salmon or <b>human</b> <b>fibrin.</b> Salmon fibrin shows {{an increase in the number}} of sprouts per bead relative to <b>human</b> <b>fibrin,</b> while average sprout lengths is similar.

By the use of these electrophoretic methods, it has also been possible to develop a highly sensitive method for measuring the content of fibrin-stabilizing factor in plasma.

Animal fibrins (from rabbit, mouse, steer, and guinea pig) were also used to see the lytic action of the bloods. The following are {{the results of the present}} experiments. 1. The identification of menstrual blood by means of paper electrophoresis is a simple method in legal medicine and its electrophorogram is an excellent method to offer an evidence of proof for mentrual blood. 2. By this method it is possible to identify the menstrual bloodstain even after the lapse of time as much as 6 months. 3. It is possible to identify even putrefied menstrual bloodstain. 4. In the case where the material stained with menstrual blood is found in water, it is not possible to identify the menstrual blood by this method. 5. When the menstrual blood is heated at 60 °C over 30 minutes, it becomes impossible to identify it by this method. 6. In the case of venous blood during menstruation fibrinolytic product can be detected only on the first day of menstruation, but since it appears only in trace, it is easy to differentiate it from menstrual blood. 7. As for lochial blood the fibrinolytic product can be detected only in the blood obtained on the first and second days of puerperium, but the amount being so slight that it can readily be distinguished from menstrual blood. 8. In the case of the blood obtained at artificial abortion fibrinolytic product appears just as much as in the case of menstrual blood, and thus it is impossible to differentiate it from mentrual blood by this method. 9. As for the use of <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> it is best to employ it while it isdresh, but the <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> up to 6 days old can be used.

The addition of plasmin split products of fibrinogen to normal plasma did not increase the incorporation of GEE- 14 C unless these products were also exposed to thrombin. The addition of plasmin split products of a fibrin clot resulted in only minimal increase in the incorporation of GEE- 14 C (57 dpm/mg fibrinogen) at 37. 5 % concentration.

This is in contrast with previous reports that HMW-UK is inhibited more rapidly in human plasma than LMW-UK.

The clinical trials available at present used doses of urokinase which were in excess of those required to obtain a maximal fibrinolytic effect. This might explain why in these trials no difference was observed between the thrombolytic effect of LMW-UK and HMW-UK, while in vitro HMW-UK appeared to be more effective.

Results: The overall morbidity rate was 38. 98 % in the suture group, 9. 62 % in the fibrin glue group and 10. 71 % in the N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate group (suture v. fibrin glue, p < 0. 001; suture v. N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate, p < 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} morbidity between the fibrin glue and N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate groups. Overall, short-term morbidity was significantly higher in the suture group (27. 12 %) than in the fibrin glue (9. 62 %, p = 0. 01) or N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate (8. 93 %, p = 0. 004) groups, but there was no significant difference between the fibrin glue and N-butyl- 2 cyanoacrylate groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of mean postoperative stay (32. 6 h in the suture group v. 30. 8 h in the fibrin glue group v. 32. 0 h in the N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate group) or mean time to return to work (20. 4 d in the suture group v. 20. 3 d in the fibrin glue group v. 19. 8 d in the N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate group). Overall, long-term morbidity was significantly higher in the suture group (11. 86 %) than in the fibrin glue (0 %, p = 0. 001) or N-butyl- 2 cyanoacrylate (1. 78 %, p = 0. 03) groups. There was no recurrence in any of the groups. Two cases (3. 39 %) of chronic groin pain were reported in patients in the suture group. A sensation of extraneous body was reported in 5 (8. 47 %) patients who received sutures and in 1 (1. 78 %) patient in the N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate group; there were no reported cases in the fibrin glue group (suture v. fibrin glue, p = 0. 01; suture v. N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate, p = 0. 03; fibrin glue v. N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate, p = 0. 30). Conclusion: The use of <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> glue or N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate is better tolerated than sutures in tension-free inguinal open repair using the plug and mesh technique in terms of overall immediate results, and there is a better trend in the long-term data...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} {{in patients with}} heavy coagulation disorders needs measures that minimize immediate and post-surgical hemorrhagic risk. Besides the subjects afflicted with constitutional coagulation pathologies such as haemophilia A, B, C, AB, Von Willebrand disease, platelet disorders and others, too many are the patients that need pharmacological therapy to impede the creation of intra-vascular coagula. Today, surgical treatment of these patients is possible {{with the use of}} <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> glue (Tissucol) that permits excellent surgical and post-surgical hemostasis without therapy suspension, independently of coagulation disorder. The {{purpose of this study is}} a clinical evaluation of a surgical procedure based on the use of <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> glue in association or not with suture, hemostatic sponge and lyophilized dura mater in patients with coagulation disorders. In a group of 309 patients in oral anticoagulant therapy have been done a total of 822 operations such as root fragments extraction with mucoperiosteal flap elevation, teeth or roots simple extractions, third molar extractions, cyst removal, apicoectomies. Only patients with PA over 20 % have been treated. All the operations have been leaded with minimal trauma; after the extractions, alveolar margins have been regularized to improve flaps adaptation. Hemostatic sponge or dura mater have been used like basis for the flaps and the fibrin glue, that was injected in the residual cavity after surgical suture. In a few cases, for example with little extraction wounds, only fibrin flue without suture or sponge has been used. In all cases and after all operations, the presence or absence of bleeding has been evaluated after 2 hours, 24 hours, 7 days after surgery. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Fibrin {{represents}} a suitable target for addressing delivery systems loaded by fibrinolytic drugs. Selective ligands capable to recognize fibrin {{could be used}} as targeting moieties for such systems. In this study the interactions between the gamma(312 - 324) epitope of <b>human</b> <b>fibrin</b> and peptidic ligands were analyzed by using experimental and computational methods. Binding free energies were calculated through the molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area approach. Good qualitative agreements between the experimental and calculated data were obtained. The binding affinity seems to be well correlated (R(2) = 0. 69) with the changes of the nonpolar solvation energy term computed from solvent-accessible surface area calculation. These results indicate that current methods of estimating binding free energies are efficient for achieving information on protein-ligand interactions...|$|R
40|$|Circulating soluble fibrin, {{observed}} {{in the blood of}} patients with ongoing intravascular coagulation, is generated from the plasma protein fibrinogen by the limited proteolytic action of thrombin. We report the production of a monoclonal antibody that discriminates between fibrin and fibrinogen in blood. The synthetic hexapeptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Val-Val-Glu, representing the amino terminus of the alpha chain of <b>human</b> <b>fibrin,</b> was used as immunogen. This hexapeptide is located within the A alpha chain of fibrinogen but becomes the amino terminus of the fibrin alpha chain, after fibrinopeptide A is removed by the action of thrombin, and thus becomes accessible for antibody binding. The monoclonal antibody we have prepared can discriminate between fibrin and fibrinogen and thus can be used in assay systems to quantitate soluble fibrin or, potentially, to image fibrin-rich thrombi...|$|R
