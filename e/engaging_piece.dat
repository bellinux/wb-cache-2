The timing in the Clooney-Farmiga scenes is like splendid tennis." [...] The New York Times Manohla Dargis especially appreciated the film's strong female roles, noting that [...] "the ferocious Ms. Kendrick, her ponytail swinging like an ax, grabs every scene she's in," [...] but wrote that the film [...] "is an assertively, and unapologetically, tidy package, from its use of romance to instill some drama... and the mope rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses." ...|$|E

5000|$|Corridor of Mirrors is a 1948 British drama film {{directed}} by Terence Young and starring Eric Portman, Edana Romney and Barbara Mullen. It {{was based on}} a novel by Christopher Massie. It is notable as being both Terence Young's and Christopher Lee's first film. Visually one of the most <b>engaging</b> <b>pieces</b> of cinema made in Britain in 1948, Corridor of Mirrors extends the French post-war aesthetic typical of Jean Cocteau's 1950 film Orphée (Orpheus) and Jean Gremillion's noirish Pattes Blanches (White Paws, 1949), another neo-realist fairy story.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Hayward of Drowned in Sound {{gave the}} album an 8 out of 10 {{and called it}} [...] "one of the most <b>engaging</b> <b>pieces</b> of music to drop in 2003." [...] Ed Howard of Stylus Magazine gave the album a grade of B−, saying, [...] "Fun, diverse, and complex, this record is yet another great {{addition}} to the increasingly varied Anticon aesthetic." [...] He said, [...] "Encompassing personal introspection, socio-political commentary, naked explorations of relationships, and obtuse poetry, Selling Live Water also represents a massive step forward in Sole's lyrical evolution." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Washington Post {{believed}} that her initial demeanour and homely appearance caused the judges and audience to be [...] "waiting {{for her to}} squawk like a duck". New York's Daily News said that an underdog being ridiculed or humiliated but then enjoying an unexpected triumph is a common trope in literature, and the stark contrast between the audience's low expectations {{and the quality of}} her singing made Boyle's performance such an <b>engaging</b> <b>piece</b> of television.|$|E

The Canadian-Hungarian show is a co-production with Stillking Films and is set to debut in early 2015. Schneeberg and Fortier have claimed {{that it will be}} [...] "an exciting and compelling show, filled with spies, sabotage, action, tragedy and triumph, grounded in an incredibly rich and <b>engaging</b> <b>piece</b> of history (of which little has been told)." ...|$|E

50|$|Certain {{areas of}} the mural have {{deteriorated}} over time, particularly a section {{at the top of}} the mural that has been severely abraded, possibly when an electrical cable was installed in front of the mural.

40|$|Book synopsis: A {{wide range}} of {{academics}} present essays that build upon Stuart Hall’s contributions to scholarship. Stuart Hall’s retirement from the Open University in 1997 provided {{a unique opportunity to}} reflect on an academic career which has had the most profound impact on scholarship and teaching {{in many parts of the}} world. From his early work on the media, through his influential re-working of Gramsci for the analysis of Britain in the late 1970 s, through his considered debates on Thatcherism and more recently on “race” and new ethnicities, Hall has been an inspirational figure for generations of academics. He has helped to make universities places where ideas and social commitment can exist alongside each other. This collection invites a {{wide range of}} academics who have been influenced by Stuart Hall’s writing to contribute not a memoir or a eulogy but an <b>engaged</b> <b>piece</b> of social, cultural or historical analysis which continues and develops the field of thinking opened up by Hall. The topics covered include identity and hybridity, history and post-colonialism, pedagogy and cultural politics, space and place, globalization and economy, modernity and difference...|$|R

[...] This article reviewed the series from several angles, including overall success, religious implications, characters, writing, acting, and direction. She compares it to other web series, noting that it is [...] "a big leap forward in terms of university-sponsored transmedia content, and yet, the online collaboration between fans is so fervent that you don’t have to be anywhere near the campus to be part of the action."

5000|$|The Glory and the Grandeur, concerto {{for three}} percussionists and orchestra. Incorporating an opening {{paraphrase}} of the composer's percussion piece Lift-Off, The Glory and the Grandeur is a visually <b>engaging</b> <b>piece.</b> The percussionists perform {{in front of}} the orchestra on an array of varied instruments. At the opening they play rhythmic antiphony from widely separated drum stations, then gather at the metal instruments of vibraphone, bells, and Chinese cymbals and gongs. At one point in the composition, all three perform together on one marimba. The finale section builds in a rapid pace of color changes as the players hasten among different instruments, and concludes with the orchestra supporting a return to the antiphonal drum idea of the opening. Duration: 12', (1988).|$|E

The film was not released as widely as previous Ghibli movies, playing to 23 venues across the nation and making an unremarkable £23,300. Reviews were generally positive, but received mixed reviews when it was compared to the past Ghibli films. Radio Times suggested that it [...] "lacks the technical sheen and warm sentimentality of some of Ghibli's earlier films", while the Daily Mirror called it [...] "ploddy, excruciatingly slow" [...] {{and not in the}} same league as the work of Hayao Miyazaki. However, Empire magazine said it was [...] "well worth watching" [...] while The Guardian called it [...] "An <b>engaging</b> <b>piece</b> of work".|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "Although it lacks a catchy title, the one-movement score generates a similar sort of musical imagery, even if the basic idea is rather more abstract: a half-hour trip through a large landscape in which constantly changing musical shapes and gestures suggest a time span spent traversing great spaces and long distances." [...] David Gutman of Gramophone gave the concerto a more mixed review, however, remarking, [...] "There are deliberate echoes of Bartok, Stravinsky and even Bernard Herrmann in the Concerto for Orchestra, {{as well as a}} welcome emphasis on rhythm and movement, but the work lacks the kind of distinctive material that would lift it onto another plane." ...|$|E

But get going it does, the strings sometimes voicing the kind of melancholy layers found in Samuel Barber's harmonies. The work eventually becomes a driving foxtrot reminiscent of John Adams (another Bay Area product). Hubbard added, [...] "The work demonstrated Bates to be a composer with a vivid imagination.
