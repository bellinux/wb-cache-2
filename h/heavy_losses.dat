With negligible casualties of their own, the Romans drove the Alamanni beyond the river Rhine, inflicting <b>heavy</b> <b>losses.</b> Julian's force, the imperial escort army of Gaul, was small but of high quality. The battle was {{won by the}} skill of the Roman infantry, with the cavalry initially performing poorly.|$|E

5|$|Hoepner now {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} French. Being impatient, {{he did not}} wait for his infantry divisions to catch up. Instead, he hoped to continue pushing the French back and not give them time to construct a coherent defence line. German formations pursued the enemy to Gembloux. The Panzer Corps ran into retreating French columns and inflicted <b>heavy</b> <b>losses</b> on them. The pursuit created severe problems for the French artillery. The combat was so closely fought that the danger of friendly fire incidents were very real. Nevertheless, the French, setting up new anti-tank screens and Hoepner, lacking infantry support, caused the Germans to attack positions head-on. During the following Battle of Gembloux the two Panzer Divisions reported <b>heavy</b> <b>losses</b> during 14 May and were forced to slow their pursuit. The German attempts to capture Gembloux were repulsed.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to repeat}} {{the success of the}} earlier First Phase Campaign, the Chinese 13th Army first {{launched}} a series of surprise attacks along the Ch'ongch'on River Valley on the night of November 25, 1950, effectively destroying the Eighth United States Army's right flank while allowing Chinese forces to move rapidly into UN rear areas. In the subsequent battles and withdrawals during the period of November 26 to December 2, 1950, although the US Eighth Army managed to avoid being surrounded by Chinese forces, the Chinese 13th Army were still able to inflict <b>heavy</b> <b>losses</b> onto the retreating UN forces which had lost all cohesion. In the aftermath of the battle, the US Eighth Army's <b>heavy</b> <b>losses</b> forced all UN forces to evacuate North Korea and to withdraw to the 38th parallel.|$|E

The Navy ordered ironclad warships from shipyards in Britain and France, though the program was limited by the Ottoman Empire's limited finances. The Osmaniye class were the first ironclads to be ordered {{as part of the}} program.|$|E

Lee made repeated attempts to dislodge Warren's corps, but without success, and with <b>heavy</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
