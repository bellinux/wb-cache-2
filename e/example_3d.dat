Curiously, {{only a few of}} the fixed-point groups are found to be compatible with discrete translations. In fact, lattice compatibility imposes such a severe restriction that, up to isomorphism, we have only 7 distinct frieze groups and 17 distinct wallpaper groups. For example, the pentagon symmetries, D5, are incompatible with a discrete lattice of translations. (Each higher dimension also has only a finite number of such crystallographic groups, but the number grows rapidly; for <b>example,</b> <b>3D</b> has 320 groups and 4D has 4783.) ...|$|E

50|$|Subsequent {{releases}} {{of the software}} have enhanced its visualization capabilities (for <b>example,</b> <b>3d</b> real-time flythroughs using OpenGL) {{and the range of}} file formats it can import and export. With the addition of Vector handling (1998), attribute tables (2003) and raster and Vector overlay (2004), LandSerf can be regarded {{as an example of a}} Geographic Information System (GIS).|$|E
40|$|New {{types of}} laws {{of large numbers}} are derived by using {{connections}} between estimation and stochastic optimization problems. They enable one to "track" time-and-path dependent functionals by using, in general, nonlinear estimators. Proofs {{are based on the}} new stochastic version of the second Lyapunov's method. Applications to adaptive Monte-Carlo optimization, stochastic branch and bounds method and minimization of risk functions are discussed.

50|$|Some {{forms of}} paper {{watermarking}} and digital watermarking {{can be regarded}} as copy-evidence, although detecting that a document or file has been copied typically requires special inspection, tools or software. For <b>example,</b> <b>3D</b> printed objects can be equipped with marks of genuinity that can be identified using a measurement device but are hard to deduce from sample objects; copies will lack these marks.|$|E
50|$|As an industry-oriented {{alternative}} to a broader based high school education, NAFA graduates in Singapore are sought after for work or many continue to complete university degrees. In contrast to polytechnics in the USA and UK, NAFA in Singapore admit majority of its students after middle school which is after 10 years of formal education. Diplomas in a specialized area of study, for <b>example</b> <b>3D</b> Design, is awarded after completing 3 years of studies.|$|E
50|$|An {{evaluation}} of mice {{currently on the}} market reveals a discrepancy between mouse capabilities and computer applications. In order to control these programs, often computer mice are augmented by other input devices, for <b>example</b> <b>3D</b> motion controllers, such as 3Dconnexion, or alternatively, users combine a traditional mouse with keyboard mapping. The Orbita Mouse seeks to overcome these shortcomings by enhancing {{the capabilities of the}} mouse to fulfill all the demands of applications.|$|E

50|$|These {{effects were}} typical in the 1980s {{and the early}} 1990s and were first {{implemented}} on either the Commodore 64, Atari ST or the Amiga. They often relied on the systems custom hardware or were considered difficult because of it. For <b>example,</b> <b>3D</b> objects rendered in dots are somewhat tricky on systems without byte-per-pixel displays or limited video memory bandwidth, or systems with slow and/or limited (e.g. 8 bit, no FPU) CPUs.|$|E
50|$|Many virtual {{heritage}} projects {{focus on}} the tangible aspects of cultural heritage, for <b>example</b> <b>3D</b> modelling, graphics and animation. In doing so they often overlook the intangible aspects of cultural heritage associated with objects and sites, such as stories, performances and dances. The tangible aspects of cultural heritage are not inseparable from the intangible and one method for combining them {{is the use of}} virtual heritage serious games, such as the 'Digital Songlines' and 'Virtual Songlines' which applies virtual reality to preserve, protect and present the cultural heritage of Australian Aborigines.|$|E

50|$|Press-to-Test is {{a feature}} that restricts access to the user's {{documents}} and certain features of the calculator for a limited time. Its intended purpose is to prevent cheating on tests and exams. Press-to-Test is enabled by pressing a certain button combination when turning on the calculator. The features that are blocked (for <b>example</b> <b>3D</b> graphs and drag & drop for graphs) can be selectively enabled, but access to existing documents is always prohibited. When the handheld is running in Press-to-Test mode, a LED {{on top of it}} blinks to indicate that Press-to-Test hasn't been disabled. Press-to-Test can only be disabled by connecting to another calculator or a computer with TI-Nspire compatible software installed. Removing the batteries or pressing the reset button will not disable it.|$|E
50|$|Each episode {{consists}} of two families of three competing {{over a number of}} challenges in order to win their place in the final round to be in with a chance to win up to £20,000. Although most of the games are completed within mere seconds from the starting trigger, viewers watch them almost exclusively in slow motion. The real-time attempts are shown mostly as replays after the heat has finished, which is the reverse of the typical game show practices. All games require from contestants excellent hand-eye coordination, composure and, above all, the titular reflex. The show makes extensive use of both 2D and 3D computer-generated imagery, using for <b>example</b> <b>3D</b> motion tracking to attach statistics graphics to contestants, or 3D wireframe animations to present the rules of a game.|$|E
