5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E

5|$|By mid-2012 Iceland was {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.|$|E
5|$|Japan Airlines {{has been}} the focus of several {{television}} programs in Japan over the years, most being dramas revolving around cabin attendants. Attention Please was a drama in 1970 that followed the story of a young girl who joins JAL to be a cabin attendant while overcoming many difficulties. This show was remade in 2006 again as Attention Please starring Aya Ueto who joins a class of cabin attendant nominees and later graduates. Most of the action of the story of the 2006 series takes place at JAL's Haneda flight operations headquarters. The series <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> specials since the original, marking the main character's transition into JAL's international operations.|$|E

Since then, the system <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> major expansions. The first expansion, known as the St. Clair County Extension, was completed on May 5, 2001, with the extension of the Red Line to Belleville, Illinois and two years later to Scott Air Force Base.

5|$|The {{club has}} seen its share of struggles, {{both on and off}} the ice. The team <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and making it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{continue}} to be harvested. However, only three nations take whales: Iceland, Norway, and Japan. All these nations {{are part of the}} IWC, with Norway and Iceland rejecting the moratorium and continuing commercial whaling. Japan, being part of the IWC, whales under the Scientific Permit stated in Article VIII in the Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which allows the taking of whales for scientific research. Japan <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> main research programs: the Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA) and the Japanese Research Program in the North (JARPN). JARPN is focused in the North Pacific and JARPA around the Antarctic. JARPA mainly caught Antarctic minke whales, catching nearly 7,000; to a far lesser extent, they also caught fin whales. Animal-rights activist groups, such as the Greenpeace, object to Japan's scientific whaling, with some calling it a substitute for commercial whaling. In 2014, the International Court of Justice (the UN judicial branch) banned the taking of whales for any purpose in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary; however, Japan refuses to stop whaling and has only promised to cut their annual catches by a third (around 300 whales per year).|$|E
5|$|In 2000 Belarus and Russia {{signed a}} treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a Union State. Over 70% of Belarus's {{population}} of 9.49million resides in urban areas.

Since a referendum in 1995, the country <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> official languages: Belarusian and Russian. The Constitution of Belarus does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The second-most widespread religion, Roman Catholicism, has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as national holidays. Belarus is the only European country to retain capital punishment in both law and practice. Belarus {{is a member of the}} United Nations since its founding, the Commonwealth of Independent States, CSTO, EEU, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the European Union but nevertheless maintains a bilateral relationship with the organisation, and likewise participates in two EU projects: the Central European Initiative and the Baku Initiative.|$|E
