40|$|Based on a 19 th century {{scientific}} report, {{a recent}} geological survey has highlighted {{the presence of}} a complex, mostly aeolian deposit along the coast of Liguria (Laigueglia, Savona Province, NW Italy). This finding was recognized to be a relevant palaeoclimatic marker, being the northernmost aeolianite outcrop ever reported from the Mediterranean Basin. The investigated deposit is spread along a steep sea-facing slope from 2 - 3 m up to almost 60 m a. s. l.; it is strongly reworked due to recent urbanization of the area. Its stratigraphic features were recognized thanks to its exposure in different sections and analysed in order to obtain reliable indications on the sedimentary environments. Facies analysis suggests that the sedimentary body is a relict cliff-top dune evolved on top of a <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposit</b> in temperate-cold and moist climate conditions. Two samples from the upper, strictly aeolian part of the sequence were subjected to OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) dating and yielded an age consistent with its deposition during the Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 5. 2 and 5. 1 substages (88 - 83 and 83 - 71 ka). This paper contributes to the increase of the number of Upper Plei - stocene coastal aeolianites accounted for in literature. Being located at the northern border of the occurrence of aeolianites in the northern Mediterranean, it helps to outline climatic and environmental boundary conditions for the formation of this type of deposit...|$|E
40|$|Shorelines of {{the upper}} Great Lakes include many embayments that contain strandplains of beach ridges. These former {{shoreline}} positions of the lakes {{can be used to}} determine changes in the elevation of the lakes through time, and they also provide information on the warping of the ground surface that is occurring in the Great Lakes after the weight of glacial ice was removed. Relative lake-level hydrographs can be created by coring the beach ridges to determine the elevation of basal <b>foreshore</b> (swash zone) <b>deposits</b> in each ridge and by obtaining radiocarbon dates of basal wetland sediments between ridges to generate an age model for the ridges. Because the relative-level hydrographs are the combination of lake-level change and vertical ground movement (isostatic rebound), the rebound must be removed to produce a graph that shows only the physical limits and timing of past lake-level fluctuations referenced to a common outlet. More than 500 vibracores of beach-ridge sediments were collected at five sites along Lake Michigan and four sites along Lake Superior. The cores showed a sequence of dune <b>deposits</b> overlying <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits</b> that, in turn, overlie upper shoreface deposits. The base of the <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits</b> is coarser and more poorly sorted than an overlying and underlying sediment and represents the plunge-point sediments {{at the base of the}} swash zone. The plunge-point deposits are a close approximation of the elevation of the lake when the beach ridge formed. More than 150 radiocarbon ages of basal wetland sediments were collected to produce age models for the sites. Currently, age models exis...|$|R
40|$|Calcareous oolites {{occur in}} beach and {{continental}} shelf sediments from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to {{as far south}} as Palm Beach. The abundance of oolites in both shelf and beach sediments is highly irregular. In beach sediments the oolites tend to be significantly more abundant in backshore <b>deposits</b> than in <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits.</b> This abundance is believed to be due to selective sorting with the oolites responding to flow as heavier particles because of their shape and surface smoothness. The source of the oolites in the beach deposits appears to be the inner continental shelf. Because of their highly irregular distribution and sensitivity to selective sorting processes, it is concluded that quantitative estimates of the total amount of sediment transported ashore with the oolites cannot be made.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{current study}} reveals the transgressive-regressive {{sequences}} and depositional environments of Paleogene Frysjaodden and Hollendardalen formations {{recorded in the}} Central Tertiary Basin of Spitsbergen. In addition, the most rapid and significant climatic perturbation of the Cenozoic era, known as PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) is discussed using mineralogical data. The paleoenvironment has been reconstructed {{using a combination of}} sedimentary field data, XRD, micropaleontology and detailed analyses of clay minerals. The results display a shallowing upward succession developing from offshore shales into a distinct offshore-transition zone with storm-generated sand beds including hummocky cross stratification and fragments of fossil wood. The succeeding sediments reveal shoreface and <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits</b> characterized by low angle cross stratified sandstones. The upper most part of the section is interpreted as beach-ridge strandplains with coal seams and roots structures in an inferred lagoonal or marsh setting.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Upper Cambrian Mt. Simon Formation (0 - 65 m thick) is a basal quartz arenite xposed in west-central Wisconsin. A {{detailed}} field {{investigation of}} the physical and biogenic sedimentary structures of the Mt. Simon {{has led to the}} recognition of three distinct lithofacies. The lower one unconformably overlies Precambrian basement rocks. It consists of medium, to very large-scale sets of tabular and trough cross-bedded, medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone and pebbly sandstone with minor intercalated horizontal beds of very fine- to me-dium-grained sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Sparse xamples of Skotithos and Arenicolites are present. This facies consists of a very thin sequence of possible braided-fluvial nd marine <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits,</b> overlain by probable marine shoreface and tidal channel deposits. Much of the facies seems to represent shallow subtida] deposition in a relatively high-energy regime. The middle lithofacies consists of two distinctly different subfacies, which probably were deposited in a low tidal fiat setting. The higher-energy subfacies consists of small- to medium-scale s ts of tabular and trough cross-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstones containing distinct zones dominated by Slkolithos and Arenicolites.

40|$|Tyrrhenian (Upper Pleistocene) coastal {{deposits}} in Sardinia {{have been studied}} since the last century, but have never been interpreted in terms of detailed sedimentology and sequential pattern. The present paper deals with an outcrop close to San Giovanni di Sinis on the western coast of Sardinia, where three depositional sequences can be identified. The lowermost sequence overlies an erosion surface which cuts into Messinian marls. A basal conglomerate including coralline algae, and sandstones displaying current ripples and beach lamination point to a coastal-marine depositional environment. The bulk of the sequence, however, {{is made up of}} eolian dunes with interstratified paleosols, and of colluvial deposits. An erosional surface terminates this sequence. The basal conglomerate of the second sequence contains pebbles with pedogenetic features, and is overlain by beach-laminated sands. Superimposed bioturbation and an important bed of in-situ Mytilus shells suggest that the coastal-marine environment passed into a lagoonal one. Ostracods, charophytes and pedogenesis indicate fresh-water influence and local emersion {{at the top of this}} sequence. Again, an erosional surface truncates the deposits. The third sequence starts with shoreface and <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits</b> rich in coralline algae and ends with eolian facies. Locally, the eolian dunes prograde directly over shoreface and tidal-channel deposits. The major erosion surfaces probably formed during important drops of sea•level and correspond to sequence boundaries. The conglomerates are interpreted as transgressive deposits, whereas the shallowing-upward facies successions represent regressive highstand deposits. The three sequences of San Giovanni di Sinis may thus have formed during three successive sea-level fluctuations, which can tentatively be correlated with the three climatic cycles during the last interglacial, i. e. between 130, 000 and 70, 000 years B.

40|$|This paper investigates {{a series}} of small-scale, {{short-lived}} fluctuations of sea level registered in a prograding barrier spit that grew during theMIS 5 e. This interglacial includes three highstands (Zazo et al., 2003) and {{we focus on the}} second highstand, of assumed duration ∼ 10 2 ka, given that UeTh ages do not provide more accurate data. Geometry and 3 D architecture of beach facies, and thin-section petrography were used to investigate eight exposed offlapping subunits separated by seven conspicuous erosion surfaces, all interpreted as the result of repeated small-scale fluctuations of sea level. Each subunit records a relatively rapid rise of sea level that generated a gravelly shoreface with algal bioherms and a sandy uppermost shoreface and foreshore where most sand accumulated. A second range of still smaller-scaled oscillations of sea level has been deduced in this phase of sea-level fluctuation from lateral and vertical shifts of the foreshore-plunge-step-uppermost shoreface facies. Eventually, progradation with gently falling sea level took place and <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits</b> underwent successive vadose cementation and subaerial dissolution, owing to relatively prolonged exposure. Later recovery of sea level re-established the highstand with sea level at approximately the same elevation, and there began deposition of a new subunit. The minimum sea-level variation (fall and subsequent rise) required to generate the observed features is 4 m. The time span available for the whole succession of events, and comparison with the Holocene prograding beach ridge complex in the nearby Roquetas (Almería) were used to calculate the periodicity of events. A millennial-suborbital time scale is suggested for fluctuations separating subunits and a decadal scale for the minor oscillations inside each subunit...|$|R
40|$|ABStRACt: Many of the straighter, less rocky {{parts of}} the {{southern}} Oregon coast are characterized by nearshore bars that extend obliquely out from shore and migrate alongshore. A typical oblique bar {{is attached to the}} foreshore at its upcurrent end, nearly parallel to shore through most of its length, and bowed seaward into a tip-channel-mouth bar at its downcurrent end. The main part of an obhque bar is separated from the foreshore by a longshore trough that curves seaward into a rip channel. The net wave-induced currents flow obliquely shoreward over the bar, parallel to shore through the longshore trough, and seaward through the tip channel and over the tip-channel-mouth bar. Medium-scale crossbedding formed by the migration of megaripples in the direction of net water flow is the dominant internal structure in most of the nearshore. Small-scale crossbedding formed by wave-tipple migration is dominant in the inner offshore, and planar bedding is dominant on the foreshore. Most or all of the bar deposits would be destroyed if the coast prograded slowly but continuously. The vertical sequence produced during progradation should be characterized, in ascending order, by inner offshore deposits, possibly deposits of the lower seaward slope of the bar, a subhotizontal erosion surface corresponding to the deepest part of the rip channel, rip channel deposits, longshore trough deposits, deposits of the foreshore-trough transition, and <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits.</b> Subhotizontal erosion surfaces probably occur in deposits formed by the slow progradation of most kinds of barred nearshore systems, but they should not occur in deposits formed by the progradation of a non-barred nearshore system. The nature of the deposits produced by the progradation of a barred nearshore system should vary with orientation of the bars relative to the shoreline, number of bars, wave energy, and available grain sizes...|$|R
40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{is widely}} used {{as a tool for}} imaging {{sedimentary}} structures and reconstructing depositional history in a range of settings. Most GPR systems use a pair of dipole antennas to transmit and receive electromagnetic energy, typically in the frequency range of 0. 025 - 1 GHz. Radar reflections result from contrasts in dielectric properties, which can be induced by small textural variations between layers. To generate cross sections of the subsurface, the common-offset antenna pair is moved along surface transects. The GPR method benefits from its relative ease of use and relatively limited basic processing that is required for interpretation of field data. Drawbacks include the high signal attenuation in electrically conductive material such as clay and the trade-off between penetration depth and resolution for different antenna frequencies. In recent years, various equipment advances and novel field practices and processing strategies have improved the ability of GPR to provide high-resolution data in a wider range of settings and scenarios. Advances include multi-channel systems for more efficient data collection, multi-offset data collection and processing for improved signal-to-noise ratios, full-resolution and multi-component imaging, and full-waveform inversion. In this presentation, we will discuss some of these methodological advances and present full-resolution field data from a highly heterogeneous fluvial site in Mississippi, USA. We will also present GPR data from a project focused on reconstructing depositional history of the Usumacinta-Grijalva delta in Tabasco, México, which is the world's largest beach ridge plain. Here we used common-offset GPR antenna pairs at two frequencies to assess the varying thickness of the eolian cover of individual beach ridges.

This system concurs moreover to monitoring amount and quality of drained sea water and to use as a reservoir for the littoral environment.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the paleogeographical and geological setting of the northern Dutch offshore in Devonian and Carboniferous times (including the A, the western B and northern E blocks). High-quality 3 D seismic surveys reported on in this study made available a wealth of data. In addition, detailed core analysis and well log panels were used. The result of the project is a first geological overview and paleogeographic setting of the Devonian and Early Carboniferous in the northern Dutch offshore. Using seismic data, well logs and cores, a better understanding of the Devonian and Carboniferous geology was achieved. The granite of the ESH has been mapped in detail. Late Middle Devonian Kyle Limestone Group has strong reflectors which show onlap against the ESH. Using well logs and seismic data late Viséan tectonic tilting was interpreted on the ESH by late Viséan and early Namurian onlap against older sediments. Well logs show that the thickness of early Namurian sediments is thinner on top of the ESH in comparison to the well logs off the ESH and at the boundary of the ESH. This means late Viséan and Namurian is a period with tectonic activity. Paleogeographic maps in early Viséan, late Viséan and Namurian were made based on detailed core analysis and well log panels. Early Viséan is characterized by shoreline facies and fluvial facies in the north(west). These are lagoons and distributary channels with dominantly clastic sediment input. The shoreline was situated just south of the northern Dutch offshore. The ESH did not play a significant role. Late Viséan is characterized by carbonate deposits with flooding surfaces (clay) in between which point to a gradual increase in sea level. During Lower Carboniferous the sediment supply came from the northern highs. Tectonic tilting of the ESH started in late Viséan. However the ESH did not play a significant role in late Viséan. In early Namurian times active extension is said to cease and uniform regional subsidence took place; however the ESH shows tectonic activity. Tectonic tilting of the ESH started in late Viséan and caused the ESH to be a ‘high’ area in early Namurian. Shallow marine conditions dominated north of the ESH with more fluvial and <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits</b> south of the ESH and on the ESH with abundant marine incursions.

Three members and one transitional zone were recognized in the formation. The lower member and lower three-fourths of the upper member represent sandy braided-river deposits. Braided-bar deposits consist of parallel, low-angle, and trough cross bedded, medium to coarse lithic arkose and cross-bedded pebble conglomerate. Structureless and graded lithic arkose and structureless, silty claystone represent overbank-sheetflood and braided-river floodplain deposits. Migrating, primary channel-fill deposits consist of intraclast-bearing sandstone and clast supported, pebble-cobble conglomerate. Anabranch channellag deposits are represented by discontinuous, stratified pebble-cobble conglomerate beds. Climbing-ripple laminated, carbonaceous, mudstone indicates braided-river swamp (pond) deposits. The middle member consists predominantly of cyclical sandstone and claystone with lesser amounts of conglomerate and represents meandering-river floodbasin deposits. Structureless and graded, medium to coarse lithic arkose and mottled, structureless, claystone represent overbank-sheetflood and suspension deposits. Crevasse-splay deposits consist of cross-bedded, intraclast-bearing, medium to coarse lithic arkose and lenticular sandy claystone beds. Rare matrix-supported pebble-cobble conglomerate represents meandering channel-fill deposits. The upper one-fourth of the upper member (Sespe/Vaqueros transition) represents lower-delta-plain deposits that are gradational with overlying wave-dominated delta-front deposits of the Vaqueros Formation. Parallel-bedded, medium to coarse, intraclast-bearing lithic arkose represents distributary channel-fill deposits. Laminated well-sorted fine arkose occurs {{near the top of}} the formation and represents <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits.</b> Mottled, rhizomorph-bearing claystone occurs {{near the top of the}} formation and represents salt-marsh deposits. The provenance appears to be primarily from reworked Paleogene formations which crop out in the Simi Hills area. Less dominant and more distant mafic and high-rank metamorphic source areas may have originated from the southern San Gabriel Mountains. In addition, the rare occurrence of anorthosite clasts in the upper member may indicate a northern San Gabriel Mountains source. The Sespe Formation north of Simi Valley represents a southeastward- transgressive fluvial to deltaic sequence, which is indicated by four depositional phases. The lower phase represents a braided-river floodplain which onlapped onto a pre-Sespe erosion surface in the Simi Valley area. The middle phase consists of meandering-river floodbasin deposits resulting from infilling of a stable depositional basin. The upper phase consists of northwesterly-flowing braided-river deposits which, based on stratigraphic position, were deposited in a upper-delta plain environment. The Sespe/Vaqueros transition phase represents lower-delta plain deposits which moved into the area by continued southeastward transgression of the "Vaqueros shoreline"...|$|R

The Palaeogene succession referred to here has been deposited during {{the formation of a}} foreland basin in connection to the West Spitsbergen Orogeny. Identified lithofacies include shelf deposits of Marstranderbreen Member, followed by the progradational Hollendardalen Formation consisting of offshore transition to shoreface, <b>foreshore,</b> coastal marsh <b>deposits,</b> and transgressive sands as well as shelf deposits of the basal Gilsonryggen Member. Distal and proximal prodelta settings in Marstranderbreen shales, lagoonal deposits in upper Hollendardalen Formation and prodelta shelf deposits in basal Gilsonryggen Member could be distinguished based on biofacies analysis. The foraminiferal assemblages are entirely agglutinated and show low diversities. Their divergence from normal marine assemblages are explained partly by the regional effects of the Boreal realm, and partly by local effects of delta influence. The lowermost part of the succession consists of retrogradational parasequences, and maximum flooding occurs in the upper third of Marstranderbreen Member. The subsequent regressive development of Hollendardalen Formation is accompanied by a short parasequential episode. The coal bearing coastal marsh deposits are interpreted as the maximum regressive surfaces, while overlying transgressive sands indicate another parasequence during general relative sea level rise. Furthermore, this study locates the interval of maximum flooding in the basal Gilsonryggen Member shales. Keywords:Palaeogene, Svalbard, lithofacies, biofacies, benthic foraminifer...|$|R
40|$|The {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating {{method was}} used to determine the geochronology of seven relict beach ridges that sit immediately behind the modern beach at Beachmere, a low-energy sandy coast within Moreton Bay, Queensland. Between 2600 +/- 400 and 1700 +/- 130 years ago, the shoreline eroded and <b>foreshore</b> sediment was <b>deposited</b> over the older beach deposit. Subsequently, there was a 1500 -year period of shoreline progradation: the shoreline advanced 0. 16 m/y between 1700 +/- 130 and 1140 +/- 80 years ago; and 0. 41 m/y between 1140 +/- 80 and around 200 years ago. Shortly after 690 +/- 60 years ago, a series of well-developed regularly spaced beach ridges gave way to an intertidal flat and then deposition of a set of lower amplitude, closely spaced beach ridges. The younger ridges were deposited between 230 +/- 40 and 140 +/- 50 years ago, at a rate of around 1. 06 m/y. During the last several decades, much of the Beachmere shoreline has eroded into these younger relict ridges. Drivers of these changes in shoreline sedimentary regime are yet to be accurately determined; however, it seems likely they are related to switches that occur in the nearshore sand transport pathway. Our results demonstrate the utility of the OSL method for providing insights into coastal change that occurred in the historical and recent geological period. Better understanding the tempo of shoreline change in the recent past is particularly relevant for assessments of vulnerability to erosion of rapidly developing, low-lying sandy coasts such as northern Moreton Bay.

The stratigraphic {{framework of}} Early Permian sedimentation was constructed from the analyses of drillholes with drillcore recovery and geophysical profile. Five stratigraphic sections {{were developed in}} order to reach the whole study area, using as datum a radioactive peak existing in the interior of the Upper Iru?? coal layer, and, when it is absent, in the pelitic lithologies laterally correlated. Maps of facies association were also built in order to represent, from top, the depositional pattern of the main stratigraphic level. In the sections, the sedimentary facies were spatially correlated and the main stratigraphic surfaces that boundary the sequences and/or the system tracts were identified. The Early Permian sequence corresponds to a great second order transgressive event, named as Central Iru?? Depositional Sequence, subdivided in two third order depositional sequences separated by a subaerial unconformity. When analyzed in more detail, in fourth order, the sequence 1 is made up by three sequences, while sequence 2 is represented by two sequences. The evolution of the plain deposits behind the barrier is related to the development of strandplain, built by the longshore current, that capture the bay areas, generating lagoon systems behind the barrier. In the barrier itself, the sediments are reworked by waves and directed by the longshore current, that deposits the materials along the shore. Lens-shaped sand bodies generated by tide currents are intercalated to strandplain, generating features that are named here as estuarine embayment. The embayments show little area extension and are distributed parallel to the paleo-shore lines. In general, the <b>foreshore</b> and shoreface <b>deposits</b> show the Ichnofacies Skolithos and the transition to offshore deposits, the Ichnofacies Cruziana.

40|$|The most {{extensive}} Paleogene succession on Svalbard, in the Arctic north of Norway, {{is found in}} the Central Tertiary Basin of Spitsbergen. It consists of a clastic basin fill of mudstone, sandstone, coal and rare conglomerate beds. A coastal plain to shallow marine setting is suggested for the Late Paleocene Firkanten Formation, the lowermost unit of the Paleogene succession. This is the first comprehensive facies model, sequence stratigraphic analysis, and paleogeographic reconstruction of the Firkanten Formation, based on new borehole cores and field data. The facies analysis reveals that sedimentation occurred in a flat relief coastal plain environment with tidal, wave, and storm influence but only minor fluvial sediment input. Previous interpretations have described the Todalen Member, {{the lower part of the}} Firkanten Formation as delta plain deposits. The detailed sequence stratigraphic analysis and paleogeographic reconstruction show that the Firkanten Formation consists of parasequences combined into parasequence sets bounded by major flooding surfaces. The succession is dominated by aggradation in a step-wise transgressive setting. The general tectonic subsidence was at all times greater than any eustatic sea level fall since there are no relative sea level falls detected in the succession. The basin was formed as a depression in front of the West Spitsbergen Fold and Thrust Belt. Thick sections of coastal plain deposits of coal, carbonaceous shale, and other fine grained clastic sediments were deposited on the coastal plain, in mires and swamps that graded into tidally influenced lagoons. The coastal plain was protected from wave reworking by sandy barrier bars but was flooded during periods of increased relative sea level rise probably from eustatic sea level rise. The <b>foreshore</b> and shoreface <b>deposits</b> are characterised by fine grained sandstone and a few pebbly beds, making up the Endalen Member, the upper part of the Firkanten Formation. The foreshore was characterised by sandy barrier bars of long shore transported fine grained sandstone. The foreshore and shoreface show a high degree of wave and storm influence. Alluvial fan deltas built out from the thrust front, transporting coarse grained material to the basin. The base of the Paleocene succession is made up by the unconformity to the Lower Cretaceous Carolinefjellet Formation, representing the lower sequence boundary characterised by poorly sorted sediment of re-deposited weathered material and vegetation. Large, newly discovered footprints of the Pantodont ‘Titanoides’ from the Todalen Member coal layers are the earliest evidence of a large mammal on Svalbard and the northernmost discovery from the Paleocene. The traces are named Thulitheripus svalbardii Ign nov. isp. nov. Large Paleocene Pantodonts are previously only known from North America and their presence on Svalbard, confirms the postulated DeGeer route for migration of mammals in the Late Paleocene to Eocene. The Central Tertiary Basin is interpreted as being of flexural origin, formed as a result of crustal shortening in West Spitsbergen due to convergence with Greenland related to the opening of the Northern Atlantic in the early Paleogene. The Late Paleozoic clasts in conglomerate beds provide evidence that there was uplift and erosion of at least 2000 m of rocks in the West Spitsbergen Fold and Thrust Belt, directly adjacent to the western margin of the basin. The sand came from Mesozoic strata uplifted to the north and northwest of the basin. The deformation zone is relatively narrow and the strata are folded to vertical on the western side of the basin. The Central Tertiary Basin shows very little deformation. It is suggested that the most important factor creating the Central Tertiary Basin was compressional folding and not extension or foreland basin flexural loading as has been postulated previously, in accordance with initial continental and shallow marine basin deposits. The compressional folding model suggests that the orogeny did not necessarily create an extensively elevated mountain belt. The footprints suggest that there was no obstruction for migrating Pantodonts such as a seaway or mountain range between Svalbard and Greenland/Ellesmere Island in the Late Paleocene...|$|R
40|$|The Dresbachian Mt. Simon Sandstone, Eau Claire Formation, and Galesville Sandstone of the Hollandale embayment of {{southern}} Minnesota are divisible into eleven major lithofacies and several subfacies. Because the formations are {{almost exclusively in}} the subsurface in Minnesota, lithofacies descriptions are based on cores, well cuttings, and geophysical logs. Along {{the eastern side of}} the Hollandale embayment, the lower Mt. Simon Sandstone consists of a thin basal conglomerate lithofacies overlain by medium- and large-scale, crossstratified and planar-stratified sandstone. Middle Mt. Simon is principally interbedded, coarsely interlayered sandstone, siltstone, and shale; and thin- to medium-bedded, structureless or crossstratified sandstone. The upper Mt. Simon is structureless sandstone with Skolithos and shelly (coquinoid) sandstone. These lithofacies resemble those from outcrops in western Wisconsin described by Driese and others (1981). Toward the west and south in south-central Minnesota, at the embayment center, mediumand large-scale, cross-stratified sandstone dominates in the Mt. Simon. Along the western side of the embayment, structureless sandstone dominates. There are fewer thin shale and siltstone beds in the Mt. Simon near the embayment center than along {{the eastern side of the}} embayment. Near the embayment center, the uppermost Mt. Simon Sandstone and basal Eau Claire Formation contain ferroan oolites and coated grains that are scattered in some beds and are the principal sand-sized particles in others. Ferroan oolites and coated grains are not observed in outcrop. Along the eastern side of the Hollandale embayment, the Eau Claire is composed principally of mixed sandstone and shale lithofacies and greensand lithofacies resembling Eau Claire lithofacies that crop out in western Wisconsin (Huber, 1975), especially in cores along structural strike with the Wisconsin outcrops. Red sandstone and shale lithofacies and dolostone lithofacies are at the base of the Eau Claire in south-central Minnesota. These are overlain by a ripple-cross-stratified or troughcross- stratified subfacies of the greensand lithofacies that is much thicker than laterally equivalent beds of greensand lithofacies to the north and east. The Galesville Sandstone, mostly structureless, planar-stratified, or trough-cross-stratified sandstone, appears to be conformable and interbedded with the Eau Claire Formation. The upper part of the Eau Claire and Galesville appear to be part of an upward coarsening sequence. There is evidence of slight disconformity between the Galesville and overlying Ironton Sandstone. The basal conglomerate of the Mt. Simon is interpreted as a braided fluvial deposit. Medium- to coarse-grained sandstone lithofacies of the lower Mt. Simon are interpreted as braid plain, braid delta, and littoral deposits. Fine- to medium-grained sandstone beds and shale beds in the middle Mt. Simon are interpreted as distal braid delta deposits. Sandstone beds in the upper Mt Simon are interpreted as sand shoals and tidal flat deposits. Beds of interbedded, finegrained sandstone and shale in the basal Eau Claire that are tidal flat deposits culminate this initial prograding sequence. Toward the end of the sequence deposition, ferroan oolites formed nearshore, where some were reworked by shifting tidal channels. Red sedimentary rocks were deposited in high tidal flat, channel, and deltaic environments. Carbonate rock was deposited in the southwestern Hollandale embayment as detrital sedimentation ended. The greensand lithofacies of the medial Eau Claire Formation, which records marine transgression at the base of the next prograding sediment sequence, is succeeded by shaly lagoonal deposits, sandy or shaly tidal flat deposits (upper Eau Claire Formation), and sandy <b>foreshore</b> or shoreface <b>deposits</b> (Galesville Sandstone). Variation of sandstone composition reflects selective mechanical reduction of contained potassium feldspar grains as observed by Odom (1975). Medium- to coarse-grained sandstone is quartzose, and very fine to fine-grained sandstone is highly feldspathic. This variation, reflected on gamma logs, helps to distinguish lithofacies.. Sandstone in core from southwestern Minnesota contains accessory minerals, including diaspore, that indicate the contribution of sediment from the Proterozoic Sioux Quartzite to the Mt. Simon Sandstone...|$|R
40|$| ‘Arco Mirelli’ digs. During the First Imperial Age (1 st century AD), <b>foreshore</b> <b>deposits</b> {{alternate}} with submerged {{marine environment}} ones, constituting a bar - troughs system. Like Pre-protohistoric Age, torrential contributions interrupt the fine sand sedimentation typical of submerged environment and produce erosion and strong {{reduction of the}} deposits thickness. During the late 1 st century AD and throughout the Middle Late Empire, the marine deposition and the upstream contributions determines the progressive progradation of the shoreline {{and the growth of}} a narrow beach strip {{at the foot of the}} Pre-Protohistoric paleofalesia. Municipio sector During the Greek -Roman Age (late 4 th century BC- 4 th century AD) it shows better the bay of the Pre-protohistoric Age. The area became the site of an harbour basin, as documented by the discovery of an Augustan Age quay built in mortar and tuff (“pds Line 6 ” and “Mezzanino San Giacomo” excavation areas in “Municipio dig”), and piers and jetties with orientation perpendicular to the quay (Fig. 5). To the north of the quay (1 st century AD), merchant shipwreck are also found (“pds Line 1 ” in “Municipio dig”). During this time, the ancient harbour basin is characterized by a partially submerged beach, partially sheltered only in its oriental portions, due to the presence of a very pronounced promontory consisting of Neapolitan Yellow Tuff. Field investigations conducted in the “pds Line 6 - Municipio dig”, showed traces of anthropogenic origin on the surface of tuffaceous substrate of the ancient harbour, located under the Augustan quay. The seafloor sediments of Greek-Roman harbour basin, covers a time interval between the 4 th century BC (Hellenistic period) and the end of the 4 th century AD. These sediments consist of medium-coarse sand in the inner zones of the basin that become more silty sediments moving towards the open sea. The functionality of the ancient harbour basin is provided by dredging of the seafloor sediments occurred several times between the 4 th century BC and the 1 st century AD The significant presence of ceramics, glass, building blocks, pebbles ballast is a further confirmation that the bay in this area is used as trading port. The entire period of functionality of the harbor basin, is also characterized by the presence of infratidal marine species in the sediments, connected with the open sea. Therefore, the faunal information confirm the idea that the Greek-Roman Harbour in Neapolis was not an artificial closed area but, on the contrary, a structure westward protected by a natural promontory and inserted into the open sea dynamics towards NE. During the period between the 2 nd century AD and the 4 th century AD, there is an increase of the macro-faunal species. Probably, marine species find physico-chemical conditions more favorable than those of the 1 st century AD, at the end of both dredging activity and the reshuffle of the volcanic deposits of the 79 AD Vesuvius eruption. From Late Antiquity to the Modern Age (Figg. 6, 7) Bay of Chiaia: The coastal landscape during Late Antiquity consists of a narrow emerged beach characterized by alluvial deposits that cause the gradual burial of paleofalesia and the progradation of the shoreline. In the digs of “Arco Mirelli” and “San Pasquale”, torrential and alluvial deposits of the 4 th century AD, deposited in alluvial fans locally cut the beach shore Roman Age units. Probably they are related both to climatic factors and to poor maintenance of the slopes in association with periods of global economic and social crisis. The succession of Late Antiquity closes with an anthropogenic deposit origin at about - 1 m slm. The absence of selection and the chaotic distribution of materials lead to interpret this deposit as the result of one or more subsequent stages of discharges and the use of the beach below as a special area of the wast dump. The long hiatus (High Medieval Age) in the stratigraphic sequence at the top of the succession of Late Antiquity, which observed in both digs, shows a period of stability of environment emerged along the coast. Furthermore, it appears to indicate the existence of a significant stasis in the processes of erosion of the slopes behind the bay. With regard to the Modern Age, the profile of the studied coast appears shaped by the developed urban context. Municipio sector: During the first half of the 5 th century AD, important paleoecological and paleoenvironmental changes are observed. The significant increase in lagoon and muddy sand species accompanied by a decrease of the infralittoral environment species, is interpretable as an enclosure of the harbor basin and the formation of a lagoon. The latter is favored by the growth of parallel beach ridges at the entrance of the bay. Also, the textural composition of the sediments of the seafloor (characterized by a decrease in grain size), is probably associated to sedimentation processes typical of an environment more sheltered than the previous phases. During the second half of the 5 th century AD and the beginning of the 6 th century AD occurs the progressive burial and abandonment of harbour basin. The sediments that close the stratigraphic succession of Late Antiquity (second half of the 5 th century AD- 6 th century AD) are very coarse and not selected. Torrential arrivals in the lagoon fill it completely. The evidence of a change in the intended use of the area is evidenced by the widespread presence of paleosoils of the 6 th century AD on which they were found accommodations farm. The modest shoreline progradational trend during Late Antiquity will continue until the Modern Age. In the late Medieval poor drainage condition typical of a marshy environment occurs. With regard to the Modern Age, the profile of the studied coast appears shaped by both the developed urban context and the construction of two port basins identified as “Molo Grande” e “Molo Piccolo...|$|R
