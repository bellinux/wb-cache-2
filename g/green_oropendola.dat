5000|$|The <b>green</b> <b>oropendola</b> (Psarocolius viridis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Icteridae. It is found in wooded {{habitats}} in the Amazon basin and Guianas of South America, and is generally common. Uniquely among the oropendolas, the <b>green</b> <b>oropendola</b> has a pale bill with an orange tip. Male oropendola weigh around 400 grams, while females are in the 200 gram range. This is a common species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|The plumage is {{typically}} chestnut, dark brown or black, although the <b>Green</b> <b>oropendola</b> and olive oropendola have, as their names imply, an olive coloration to the head, breast and upper back. The legs are dark, but {{the bill is}} usually a strikingly contrasting feature, either pale yellow, or red-tipped with a green or black base. In several species {{there is also a}} blue or pink bare cheek patch.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>green</b> <b>oropendola</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 43 cm and the female about 37 cm. The head, breast and back are pale olive green, the wings are greyish-green, and the rump and underparts are chestnut. The central {{feathers}} of the tail are black and the outer ones yellow. The beak has an orange tip, and its base and the adjoining areas of skin are yellowish. The irises are pale blue {{and there is an}} inconspicuous crest {{on the back of the}} head.|$|E
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>oropendolas</b> are gregarious, colonial {{birds and}} build long, bag-shaped nests that dangle from the {{branches}} of a tree. The birds are polygamous. The nests of <b>green</b> <b>oropendolas</b> are sometimes parasitised by the giant cowbird (Molothrus oryzivorus) which lays its eggs in their nests.|$|R
5000|$|The sexes of this icterid {{are very}} {{different}} in size: the male is 52 cm (21 in) long and weighs 550 g (1.2 lbs); the smaller female is 41 cm (16 in) long and weighs 260 g (9.2 oz). Confusingly, the name [...] "olive oropendola" [...] is usually used for this combined species, {{despite the fact that}} the nominate subspecies has no olive to its plumage, as its head and chest are black (these are olive in P. b. yuracares). The back, wings and belly of this large oropendola are brown, the outer rectrices are yellow (i.e. tail appears all yellow from below), the bare facial skin is pink, the eyes are brown, and the bill is black with an orange tip. The superficially similar <b>green</b> <b>oropendola</b> has an olive back and wing-coverts, lacks extensive bare facial-skin, has a pale bill with an orange tip, and blue eyes.|$|E
