In the past decade, Nigeria has become the single largest recipient of <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa, receiving between 30 to 60 percent of flows into the region. However, because of the conventional view that the bulk of household income from <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> is used particularly for consumption purposes, their deliberate investment by some recipients in the rural nonfarm economy (RNFE) has not yet undergone rigorous econometric analyzes. The thrust {{of this paper is to}} estimate the impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> on the RNFE of the Igbos of Southeast Nigeria, using sample data from foreign remittance-receiving households engaged in rural nonfarm income-yielding investments. Key findings from the regression analysis show that households’ ratio of <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> invested in rural nonfarm activities (RNFA) to the total amount of <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> received by them tend to decrease with the increase in remittances received. There is, however, a positive correlation between remittances and expenditure on the rural nonfarm sector.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> on {{economic}} growth of Pakistan. We use secondary time series data {{for the period of}} 1978 to 2011. The multiple regression analysis is used to identify the relationship among the variables. GDP is taken as dependent variable while <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances,</b> FDI, inflation and exchange rate as independent variables. Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is used to check the stationary of variables and all variables found stationary at level. Ordinary Least Squares technique is applied to check the relation among these variables. Results indicate that <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> have positive and significant relation with GDP of Pakistan while inflation and exchange rate has negative effect on economic growth. Foreign direct investment has positive but insignificant relation with GDP of Pakistan. One percent increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> will raise GDP by 0. 25 percent. Our model is free from hetroskedasticity and autocorrelation with satisfactory functional form that suggests the stability of our model.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of real {{devaluation}} on economic growth. In the empirical model we also include other theoretically justified variables {{in the case of}} Pakistan, such as <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances,</b> money supply, and government spending.

The findings affirm cointegration among the series. Real devaluation exerts contractionary effect on economic growth. The results from variance decomposition and impulse response-function show unidirectional causality from <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances</b> to economic growth; and bidirectional causality between money supply and <b>foreign</b> <b>remittances.</b> Furthermore, money supply Granger causes government spending; while devaluation Granger causes economic growth, albeit, weakly.
