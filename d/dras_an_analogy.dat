Participants were prescreened and separated randomly into different conditions {{so that they would}} receive either, <b>a</b> culturally relevant <b>analogy</b> (RA), <b>a</b> culturally inelevant <b>analogy</b> (IA), <b>a</b> culturally relevant story that was not <b>an</b> <b>analogy</b> (RC), or <b>a</b> culturally inelevant story that was not <b>an</b> <b>analogy</b> (IC). Results {{of this study suggest that}} use of <b>an</b> <b>analogy</b> will result in better perfmmance on a target problem. Results also show that cultmally relevant infmmation will enhance the effectiveness of <b>an</b> <b>analogy</b> thereby increasing the probability of answering a target problem conectly. Fmther research is recommended to further refine the use of analogies in the classroom for a learner centered environment...|$|R

Of course, principles suggested by such analogies need to be confirmed by relevant evidence. Even where analogies are fruitful, they are only partial.
