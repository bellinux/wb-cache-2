40|$|Using {{structural}} similarity clustering {{of protein}} domains: protein domain universe graph (PDUG), and a hierarchical functional annotation: gene ontology (GO) as two evolutionary lenses, {{we find that}} each structural cluster (domain fold) exhibits a distribution of functions that is unique to it. These <b>functional</b> <b>distributions</b> are <b>functional</b> fingerprints that are specific to characteristic structural clusters and vary from cluster to cluster. Furthermore, as structural similarity threshold for domain clustering in the PDUG is relaxed we observe an influx of earlier-diverged domains into clusters. These domains join clusters without destroying the functional fingerprint. These results can be understood in light of a divergent evolution scenario that posits correlated divergence of structural and functional traits in protein domains from one or few progenitors...|$|R
50|$|The Lewis turning point, {{named after}} {{economist}} W. Arthur Lewis, {{is a term}} used in economic development to describe {{a point at which}} surplus rural labor reaches a financial zero. This in turn typically causes urban wages to rise dramatically. Upon reaching the Lewis turning point, a country or state usually experiences a labor shortage which leads to a rise in agricultural and unskilled industrial real wage. This usually continues until a labor surplus can be reached once again. Typically, reaching the Lewis turning point also causes an improvement in the wage bill and the <b>functional</b> <b>distribution</b> favoring labor. However, in some historical cases such as in Japan between 1870 and 1920, agricultural labor productivity increased significantly to produce a labor surplus while real wages only rose gently.|$|E

In contrast to the language-centric notion of classical diglossia, the revised notion contends that diglossia is primarily a socio-cultural, economic and political phenomenon not necessarily accepted as a natural state of affairs by all the minority groups, the speakers of Low languages/varieties. Critical diglossia not only describes how language varieties and languages in a particular linguistic market are functionally distributed in formal and informal domains and their linguistic and language capitals are valued as High and Low, but also studies {{the reasons why the}} asymmetrical relationship between the language varieties and languages develops, as well as the role that historical and current political, economic and socio-cultural processes play in its construction.|$|E
5000|$|Diglossia: {{if there}} is a {{structural}} <b>functional</b> <b>distribution</b> of the languages involved, the society is termed 'diglossic'. Typical diglossic areas are those areas in Europe where a regional language is used in informal, usually oral, contexts, while the state language is used in more formal situations. Frisia (with Frisian and German or Dutch) and Lusatia (with Sorbian and German) are well-known examples. Some writers limit diglossia to situations where the languages are closely related, and could be considered dialects of each other. This can also be observed in Scotland where, in formal situations, English is used. However, in informal situations in many areas, Scots is the preferred language of choice. A similar phenomenon is also observed in Arabic-speaking regions. The effects of diglossia could be seen {{if you look at the}} difference between Written Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic) and Colloquial Arabic. However, as time goes, the Arabic language somewhere between the two have been created which we would like to call Middle Arabic or Common Arabic. Because of this diversification of the language, the concept of spectroglossia has been suggested.|$|E

5000|$|Ambilingualism: {{a region}} is called ambilingual if this <b>functional</b> <b>distribution</b> is not observed. In a typical ambilingual area {{it is nearly}} {{impossible}} to predict which language will be used in a given setting. True ambilingualism is rare. Ambilingual tendencies can be found in small states with multiple heritages like Luxembourg, which has a combined Franco-Germanic heritage, or Malaysia and Singapore, which fuses the cultures of Malays, China, and India or communities with high rates of deafness like Martha's Vineyard where historically most inhabitants spoke both MVSL and English or in southern Israel where locals speak both ABSL and either Arabic or Hebrew. Ambilingualism also can manifest in specific regions of larger states that have both a clearly dominant state language (be it de jure or de facto) and a protected minority language that is limited in terms of distribution of speakers within the country. This tendency is especially pronounced when, even though the local language is widely spoken, there is a reasonable assumption that all citizens speak the predominant state tongue (e.g., English in Quebec vs. Canada; Spanish in Catalonia vs. Spain). This phenomenon can also occur in border regions with many cross-border contacts.|$|E
