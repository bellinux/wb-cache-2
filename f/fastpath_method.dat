50|$|Job Control Language (JCL) is z/VSE's batch {{processing}} interface. There is also another, special interface for system console operators. z/VSE, like z/OS systems, had traditionally supported 3270 terminal user interfaces. However, most z/VSE installations {{have at least}} begun to add Web browser access to z/VSE applications. z/VSE's TCP/IP is a separately priced option for historic reasons, and is available in two different versions from two vendors. Both vendors provide a full function TCP/IP stack with applications, such as telnet and FTP. One TCP/IP stack provides IPv4 communication only, the other IPv4 and IPv6 communication. In addition to the commercially available TCP/IP stacks for z/VSE, IBM also provides the Linux <b>Fastpath</b> <b>method</b> which uses IUCV socket connections to communicate with a Linux guest, also running on the mainframe. Using this method the z/VSE system is able to fully exploit the native Linux TCP/IP stack.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fastpaths</b> are a <b>method</b> of {{optimization}} which {{relies on}} treating {{the most commonly}} executed cases of certain functions in a privileged manner, such that behaviour is not modified, but execution time is reduced. Fastpaths {{play an important role}} on improving paravirtualization performance offered by an L 4 microkernel. In this article we redesign two existing fastpaths in an L 4 microkernel for the purpose of adding SMP support. We then put these fastpaths through a series of regression and performance tests to determine if the design is correct and what performance benefits we can expect by using them on a multiprocessor system...|$|R
