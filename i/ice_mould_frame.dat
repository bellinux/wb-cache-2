40|$|A novel shaping {{technique}} for advanced ceramic components is presented which allows manufacturing of complex ceramic components with enclosed cavities by using <b>ice</b> <b>moulds</b> or <b>ice</b> cores. Different suspensions of alumina and zirconia powders {{have been developed}} for this special freeze casting technique. The suspensions must meet following requirements: high solid content, the capability of flow, a freezing point between - 10 and - 2 °C, and a casting temperature below 0 °C. After the casting process the moulds and cores could be easily removed by sublimation. The suspension liquid was removed in the frozen state simultaneously. In this way very complicated hollow or filled structures such as metallic or ceramic components encapsulated in ceramic shells could be produced. No de-moulding was necessary, no solid core must be removed, and no liquid phase appeared as known from other lost-mould techniques. <b>Ice</b> <b>mould</b> casting is a very environmental-friendly shaping technique. Furthermore, the influence of dispersing agents, anti-freeze agents and of the freezing speed on the pore structure of the ceramic components has been investigated...|$|R

The baptistery beyond an arch at the southern end of the building is lit by modern stained glass windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{centre bay}} to Derby Street is {{narrower}} than the centre bay to East Street, however both are detailed {{in a similar}} manner, with gablets to the cornice framing the ground floor entrance, a vertical moulding separating the sash windows to the first floor, and an arch <b>moulding</b> <b>framing</b> low sash windows to the second floor. The ground floor is the tallest, and the second floor the shortest of the three floors.|$|R
50|$|Palazzo Falson {{was built}} during Malta’s medieval {{period in the}} 13th century, over {{the remains of a}} {{defensive}} structure called La Rocca. Changes to the façade, including a shift in the orientation of the building as well as the addition of a double serrated string course separating the two storeys and the hood <b>mould</b> <b>framing</b> the main doorway, were also completed in the 15th century. These features are typical of the Siculo-Norman style, prevalent in the period.|$|R
50|$|It was Levi {{who first}} reconstructed the machine needed to {{recreate}} the black ripple <b>moulding</b> <b>frames</b> for reframing of Dutch 17th-century paintings. One of Levi's greatest successes after his retirement, and in collaboration with William Adair, was {{the identification of the}} 11 paintings needed to reassemble Filippo Mazzola’s polyptych that formed the altarpiece in the church of S Maria delle Grazie at Cortemaggiore. Levi had purchased the frame in 1967 and his role in and generosity in donating it were recognised in 2003 when he was awarded the rank of Cavaliere.|$|R

50|$|The boat-builder's shed {{would be}} a modest affair - nothing like a modern workshop. Nevertheless, the boats were made with care and became handy craft which could last up to twenty years if {{maintained}} well. The construction techniques were simple and effective, the tools used minimal {{and a great deal}} of 'eye' was used to fair the lines. Each boat was therefore unique with parts shaped to fit the minor variations caused by the quality of wood available and whether the builder used any <b>moulds,</b> <b>frames</b> or templates (many did not).Gandelows are being built again in Limerick. Four were built at the Ilen School and Network for Wooden Boat Building in 2014. The build process was carefully documented and a book produced which serves as a record for future generations.|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the {{building}} has a number of bays ending in the chapel wing to the north, which includes tall lancet arch windows as well as an ogee-headed <b>moulded</b> stone door <b>frame.</b> The main entrance to the house is in one of the bays, with a studded door, in a similar ogee-headed <b>moulded</b> stone door <b>frame.</b> On {{the south side of the}} house there is a garderobe, also two storeys high, with a turret to the rear.|$|R
40|$|Porous, hollow ceramic {{components}} were produced by freeze casting technique. For this purpose aqueous slurries with high solid contents were prepared which were stable against freezing down {{to at least}} - 5 deg C. Ice cores were made by coating steel components with freezing water which were subsequently dip-coated with the ceramic suspensions. After freeze drying which removes both, the ice core and the frozen suspension liquid, and sintering, ceramic components with a high amount of open porosity including steel parts could be achieved. As an example hydroxyapatite was used for showing the opportunities of the freeze casting technology among others for applications {{in the field of}} bone replacement. The influence of the solid content of the hydroxyapatite slurries on the ice crystal growth has been investigated by means of compact hydroxyapatite bodies which were prepared by freeze casting using <b>ice</b> <b>moulds</b> with cylindrical cavities.

50|$|He {{inherited}} the manor of Whaddon {{from his father}} in 1672, and three years later Rodmarton, his brother Robert's inheritance from their father (formerly owned by Robert Cox, father of Mary). In 1660 Walter's father had built a large addition to Whaddon House, which was surrounded by parkland. This manor house was destroyed by fire in the 19th century. Whaddon Grove Farm now stands {{on the site of}} the House, there remains a 17th-century back door in a <b>moulded</b> <b>frame,</b> and there are two stone former dairies. These two properties, together with most of the rest of his estates, descended to his nephew Calthorpe Parker Long (son of Sir Philip Parker, 1st Baronet). In 1706 Long purchased an estate in Sutton Veny, Wiltshire, which included Polebridge Farm. This eventually passed to Walter Long (of South Wraxall).|$|R

2500|$|The window hood moulds {{are similar}} to the south chapel but run into a further cill band around the north and east wall. Within the central bay of the north wall is a chapel doorway opening that breaks through the plinth. The opening is a twin-mould recess, with arch above {{surrounded}} by a hood mould. The door planking is set behind raised and studded rails and stiles with inset moulded blind lights. The chancel east wall between the chapels is plain except for a simple cill band above the roof line, and a shallow coped gable with a central cross above. The chancel east window is of three lights with cinquefoil heads set in a <b>moulded</b> <b>frame.</b> Pevsner states that the window [...] "makes an odd east view with the chancel east window, smaller, recent, and straight-headed, between." [...] Two spouts, dressed with gargoyle heads, drain the roof between the chancel and the chapels.|$|R
50|$|A cornice-like stringcourse, {{running the}} full width between the {{outermost}} pilasters, creates a strong horizontal {{line on the}} facade to Quay Street. Beneath this is further render modelling and then a line of upper storey windows {{on either side of}} a central door. This French door opens onto a small, cantilevered balcony edged with cast iron balustrading. A simple label <b>mould</b> <b>frames</b> the semicircular fanlight atop this door, its ends resting on the tops of pilasters that extend to street level. The arched heads of the two double-hung sash windows {{on either side of the}} door are similarly framed. A suspended footpath canopy separates the upper and lower sections of the front facade. In the lower section, the four pilasters sit on an expressed plinth. Beneath the balcony is a set of French doors topped with a basket arch-shaped fanlight. On either side of this door are three double-hung sash windows, the heads of which meet the underside of the footpath canopy.|$|R
50|$|The Police Station (former Court House) is a {{classical}} revival building of rendered brick scribed to resemble stonework and is set well {{back from the}} street. The majority of the building rises to 2 storeys and the roof is clad with corrugated fibrous cement sheeting. The street entrance features an arcaded Tuscan order portico with 3 bays separated by square pilasters rising through 2 stories to the triangular pediment, which has a circular louvred vent in its centre. Three square windows {{are located in the}} spandrel over the arches, each with a <b>moulded</b> <b>frame</b> all around. This entrance is flanked by single storey wings which continue the arcaded effect with arched windows, now filled with glass louvres. The windows in the upper storey and the side windows and porches on the lower storeys are shaded by sun hoods on cast iron brackets. Windows were double hung and timber framed: some of these have been replaced.|$|R

50|$|The {{northwest}} tenancy (the former Commercial Banking Company of Sydney), {{currently a}} bar/live music venue, has a non-original awning to Brunswick Street. The awning {{is supported by}} metal tie rods fixed to {{the face of the}} building at the first floor window sill height, and comprises a deep metal fascia and pressed metal ceiling. The ground floor comprises a non-original timber framed shopfront with central paired timber framed glass doors, with a recessed original doorway at the northwest end. This doorway retains original fanlight and architrave detailing, and originally accessed a corridor leading to the rear internal stair and rear offices. The doorway is currently not used, and the internal planning has changed. The first floor elevation is composed of a central recessed section which continues to the parapet, with an arch with expressed extrados and keystone flanked by wall sections which appear as oversized pilasters each with a central window. The arch opens to a recessed loggia with projecting curved balcony with a wrought steel balustrade, and each window has non-original glass louvres. Expressed drip <b>moulds</b> <b>frame</b> the arch and window openings. An oversized keystone and arched drip <b>moulding,</b> which originally <b>framed</b> the arched entry to the banking premises, is extant below the balcony and above the non-original awning, however much of the original detailing of the ground floor elevation has been removed. The parapet comprises a broken apex curved pediment, and the entablature has oversized dentils.|$|R

5000|$|The simple layout was {{gradually}} added to over the centuries. The east {{window in the}} chancel, in the Decorated Gothic style, dates from the early 14th century. [...] Buttresses were added at the northwest and southwest corners of the tower a century later; and in the 16th century, two square-headed windows {{were added to the}} north wall of the nave, flanking the blocked Norman doorway. [...] A major change came in 1613: William Covert, {{a member of the family}} who had held the manor of Slaugham since the late 15th century, built a private chapel (the Covert Chapel) on the south side next to the chancel. [...] Its main feature is a memorial of [...] "exceptional quality", considered one of the best in Sussex: it depicts Richard Covert (who died in 1579) kneeling with seventeen other figures representing his wives, sons and daughters. The first letter of each person's name is shown above their head. The intricately carved stone wall-tomb has Corinthian columns, pilasters and a <b>moulded</b> <b>frame,</b> and a straight balustraded top section consisting of an entablature and frieze with carved flowers. [...] Richard Covert himself wears a suit of armour, while his three adult sons have military dress. Both wives are reading prayer books on lecterns. At the top are three funeral helms, two of which bear versions of the Covert coat of arms.|$|R
5000|$|An [...] "ogee clock" [...] is {{a common}} kind of weight-driven 19th-century {{pendulum}} clock in a simplified Gothic taste, made in the United States for a mantelpiece or to sit upon a wall bracket. It is rectangular, with ogee-profile <b>moulding</b> that <b>frames</b> a central glass door that protects the clock face and the pendulum. The weights fall inside the ogee moulding supported by pulleys and hidden from view. The door usually carries a painted scene in the area beneath the face. Ogee clocks {{are one of the}} most commonly encountered varieties of American antique clocks. The design is usually attributed to Chauncey Jerome.|$|R
5000|$|The ogee and Roman ogee {{profiles}} {{are used}} in decorative <b>moulding,</b> often <b>framed</b> between mouldings with a square section.

25|$|The {{religious}} and secular buildings of Mamluk Tripoli comprise {{a fine example of}} the architecture of that time. The oldest among them were built with stones taken from 12th and 13th-century churches; the characteristics of the architecture of the period are best seen in the mosques and madrassas, the Islamic schools. It is the madrassas which most attract attention, for they include highly original structures as well as decoration: here a honeycombed ceiling, there a curiously shaped corniche, doorway or <b>moulded</b> window <b>frame.</b> Among the finest is the madrassa al-Burtasiyah, with an elegant façade picked out in black and white stones and a highly decorated lintel over the main door.|$|R
50|$|The gable is a {{projecting}} one extending further east {{than the}} wall below and the finish {{is also one}} of tile-hanging (matching that of the adjacent cottage).
