40|$|Particulate fume {{generation}} {{rates and}} fume composition have been measured {{for a range}} of continuous wire arc welding consumables as a function of power supply type. Welding wires considered included gas-shielded cored wires of the rutile-flux, basic-flux and metal core types, for joining structural steels; gas-shielded solid and <b>flux-cored</b> <b>wires</b> for stainless steel; and an open-arc surfacing wire. The range of power supply types used included conventional (transformer-rectifier) DC units, conventional (transistor switched) pulsed supplies as well as both low frequency and high frequency inverter-based power supplies. The inverter type power supplies were used in both the DC and pulsed modes. In all cases fume measurements were made at average welding currents at the low and high ends of the normal operating ranges. Significant decreases in fume formation rate, compared to that from conventional DC power supplies, were found for several combinations of power source and consumable type. The magnitude of these reductions depended on the particular power source/wire combination. For the cored joining wires for structural steels the reductions in fume formation rates were generally in the range 20 to 50 % with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed and pulsed high frequency inverter supplies. Both the solid and cored wires for stainless steel also showed considerable reductions in fume generation rate with certain power supplies. Reductions of about 60 % compared to those from conventional DC power supplies were found from both stainless steel wire types with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed power supply. Fume generation rates from the open-arc surfacing wire were found to be reduced by 30 to 50 % in some instances and again the most consistent reduction was with the conventional-pulsed supply. Chemical analyses of the collected fume indicated that in most instances power source type did not have a major influence on the chemical composition.

Three <b>flux-cored</b> <b>wires</b> with different chemical compositions, marked by DM-I, DM-II and DM-III were used in welding a martensitic steel for the comparison of the microstructures and mechanical properties of the welding metals and HAZ. The results show that DM-I weld metal contains martensite plus other reinforced phases, while both DM-II and DM-III alloys lead to mainly martensitic microstructures with little precipitates. Among all of the tested materials the DM-I alloy has the highest hardness and wear resistance but the lowest impact toughness among the experimental weld metals. Meanwhile, the hardness, impact toughness and wear resistance of the DM-II and DM-III alloys are close {{to those of the}} base metal but the DM-III is not as strong as DM-II.

The {{results show that the}} microstructures of the hardfacing alloys consisted of ferrite, martensite, retained austenite, independent austenite and NbC particles. Firstly, as graphite additions increased, the carbon contents gradually increased and the microstructures of the hardfacing alloys changed from ferrite plus NbC particles to martensite with retained austenite and larger NbC particles, which was accompanied by hardness increasing and better abrasive resistance. And then the hardfacing layer alloy best performance was obtained as graphite addition was 60 g. The highest hardness was 61. 8 HRC and the wear resistance was nearly four times as high as that of the base metal.

40|$|The {{present state}} of {{technology}} {{is the use of}} haptic, inductive and laser sensors as well as the use of voltaic arc sensors. The sensors mentioned first have the disadvantage, that they are sensoring with a local displacement from the actual welding spot and that they use a geometrically interfering measuring pick-up. The voltaic arc sensors known require for the welding pulsed power sources although it is not required for the welding process itself. Furthermore a number of disadvantages are known for LB-sensors due to lateral swing of the pendulum. On the one hand there is increased wear-down of the torch axises, on the other hand notches appear on fillet weld edge at raised output and welding speed. The aim was to develop a voltaic arc sensor system where the disadvantages of the LG-sensors with lateral swing of the pendulum are avoided. A further aim was to establish air gaps during welding and to fill them appropriately for welding proper thicknesses of fillet welds. With a LB-sensor system that lets rotate the wire tip with minor diameter (1, 5 mm), the a. m. disadvantages can be avoided and multitude information regarding the welding process can be generated. The result is a voltaic arc sensor system with rotation wire electrode that has been tested intensive in welding laboratory and was implemented and tested in a welding robot for shipbuilding at HDW. The welds performed on active components over a period of 12 weeks proof the fully functioning of the system regarding sensoring as well as the compensation of the air gaps, i. e. for the first time fillet welds without excess can be welded. This sensor system can be applied for all semi- or fully automatic working MAG-welding machines (solid wire, welding position PB) including weld robots requiring an exact torch guidance.
