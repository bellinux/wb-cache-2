5|$|Government school {{construction}} <b>initiatives</b> <b>have</b> ensured {{at least one}} primary school per fokontany and one lower secondary school within each commune. At least one upper secondary school is located {{in each of the}} larger urban centers. The three branches of the national public university are located at Antananarivo (founded in 1961), Mahajanga (1977) and Fianarantsoa (1988). These are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges.|$|E
5|$|London's recent urban {{regeneration}} efforts and civic <b>initiatives</b> <b>have</b> allowed {{the city to}} rank high in Canadian livability lists. In 2016, MoneySense magazine ranked London as the fourth best large Canadian city to live in. It also ranked fourth (fifteenth overall) in 2013, and fifth in 2015. In 2015, London was ranked as the sixth happiest city in Canada by Jetpac City Guides. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ranked London as the sixth best place {{to be a woman}} in 2015 and third in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Many more gene {{sequences}} {{are known}} than protein structures. Further, {{the set of}} solved structures is biased toward proteins {{that can be easily}} subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics <b>initiatives</b> <b>have</b> attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.|$|E
5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few <b>initiatives</b> <b>have</b> sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union <b>initiatives</b> <b>have</b> encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E

50|$|Fraudulently misrepresenting other {{initiatives}} as I-1068, the Marijuana Reform Act <b>Initiative,</b> <b>has</b> been documented. Philip Dawdy, {{a campaign}} manager for I-1068, has stated his intention to file {{a complaint with the}} Washington State Attorney General's Office. Concerns have been expressed by I-1068 supporters that the <b>initiative</b> <b>has</b> not been signed by people who mistakenly believe they have already signed the Marijuana Reform initiative.|$|R
