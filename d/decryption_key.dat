5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 2011, {{it became}} public that an {{encrypted}} version of WikiLeaks' huge archive of unredacted U.S. State Department cables had been available via BitTorrent {{for months and}} that the <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> (similar to a password) was available to those who knew where to find it. Guardian newspaper editor David Leigh had just published the <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> in his book, so the files were now publicly available to anyone. Rather than let malicious actors publish selected data, WikiLeaks decided to publish the entire, unredacted archive in searchable form on its website.|$|E
5000|$|The {{approach}} of AACS provisions each individual player {{with a unique}} set of <b>decryption</b> <b>keys</b> which are used in a broadcast encryption scheme. This approach allows licensors to [...] "revoke" [...] individual players, or more specifically, the <b>decryption</b> <b>keys</b> associated with the player. Thus, if a given player's keys are compromised and published, the AACS LA can simply revoke those keys in future content, making the keys/player useless for decrypting new titles.|$|R

25|$|Many {{software}} {{programs have been}} developed that intercept the data stream as it is decrypted out of the DRM-restricted file, and then use this data to construct a DRM-free file. These programs require a <b>decryption</b> <b>key.</b> Programs that do this for Blu-ray Discs, DVDs, and HD DVDs include universal decryption keys in the software itself. Programs that do this for iTunes audio, PlaysForSure songs, and TiVo ToGo recordings, however, rely on the user's own key – that is, they can only process content the user has legally acquired under {{his or her own}} account.|$|E
25|$|Because DVD-Video's content-scrambling system (CSS) {{was quickly}} broken, DVD-Audio's {{developers}} sought a better method of blocking unauthorized duplications. They developed CPPM, {{which uses a}} media key block (MKB) to authenticate DVD-Audio players. In order to decrypt the audio, players must obtain a media key from the MKB, which also is encrypted. The player must use its own unique key to decrypt the MKB. If a DVD-Audio player's <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> is compromised, that key can be rendered useless for decrypting future DVD-Audio discs. DVD-Audio discs can also utilize digital watermarking technology developed by the Verance Corporation, typically embedded into the audio once every thirty seconds. If a DVD-Audio player encounters a watermark on a disc without a valid MKB, it will halt playback. The 4C Entity also developed a similar specification, Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), which is used on Secure Digital cards.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion of}} using public key {{cryptography}} for data kidnapping attacks was introduced in 1996 by Adam L. Young and Moti Yung. Young and Yung critiqued the failed AIDS Information Trojan that relied on symmetric cryptography alone, the fatal flaw being that the <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> could be extracted from the Trojan, and implemented an experimental proof-of-concept cryptovirus on a Macintosh SE/30 that used RSA and the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) to hybrid encrypt the victim's data. Since public key crypto is used, the cryptovirus only contains the encryption key. The attacker keeps the corresponding private <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> private. Young and Yung's original experimental cryptovirus had the victim send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who deciphers it and returns the symmetric <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> it contains to the victim for a fee. Long before electronic money existed Young and Yung proposed that electronic money could be extorted through encryption as well, stating that [...] "the virus writer can effectively hold {{all of the money}} ransom until half of it is given to him. Even if the e-money was previously encrypted by the user, it is of no use to the user if it gets encrypted by a cryptovirus". They referred to these attacks as being [...] "cryptoviral extortion", an overt attack that {{is part of a larger}} class of attacks in a field called cryptovirology, which encompasses both overt and covert attacks. The cryptoviral extortion protocol was inspired by the forced-symbiotic relationship between H. R. Giger's facehugger and its host in the movie Alien.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem of}} rogue users sharing their <b>decryption</b> <b>keys</b> or the decrypted content with {{unqualified}} users is mathematically insoluble. Traitor tracing algorithms aim {{to minimize the}} damage by retroactively identifying the user or users who leaked their keys, so that punitive measures, legal or otherwise, may be undertaken. In practice, pay TV systems often employ set-top boxes with tamper-resistant smart cards that impose physical restraints on a user learning their own <b>decryption</b> <b>keys.</b> Some broadcast encryption schemes, such as AACS, also provide tracing capabilities.|$|R
40|$|Lightweight devices, such as radio {{frequency}} identi- fication tags, {{have a limited}} storage capacity, {{which has become a}} bottleneck for many applications, especially for security applica- tions. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising cryptographic tool, where the encryptor can decide the access structure that will be used to protect the sensitive data. However, current CP-ABE schemes suffer from the issue of having long <b>decryption</b> <b>keys,</b> in which the size is linear to and dependent on the number of attributes. This drawback prevents the use of lightweight devices in practice as a storage of the <b>decryption</b> <b>keys</b> of the CP-ABE for users. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to the above long standing issue, which will make the CP-ABE very practical. We propose a novel CP-ABE scheme with constant-size <b>decryption</b> <b>keys</b> independent of the number of attributes. We found that the size can be as small as 672 bits. In comparison with other schemes in the literature, the proposed scheme is the only CP-ABE with expressive access structures, which is suitable for CP-ABE key storage in lightweight devices...|$|R
500|$|The {{first known}} malware {{extortion}} attack, the [...] "AIDS Trojan" [...] written by Joseph Popp in 1989, had a design failure so severe {{it was not}} necessary to pay the extortionist at all. Its payload hid the files on the hard drive and encrypted only their names, and displayed a message claiming that the user's license to use a certain piece of software had expired. The user was asked to pay US$189 to [...] "PC Cyborg Corporation" [...] in order to obtain a repair tool even though the <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> could be extracted from the code of the Trojan. The Trojan was also known as [...] "PC Cyborg". Popp was declared mentally unfit to stand trial for his actions, but he promised to donate the profits from the malware to fund AIDS research.|$|E
500|$|... {{proposed}} using multidimensional reversible cellular automata as an encryption system. In Kari's proposal, {{the cellular}} automaton rule {{would be the}} encryption key. Encryption would be performed by running the rule forward one step, and decryption would be performed by running it backward one step. Kari suggests that a system such as this {{may be used as}} a public-key cryptosystem. In principle, an attacker could not algorithmically determine the <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> (the reverse rule) from a given encryption key (forward rule) because of the undecidability of testing reversibility, so the forward rule could be made public without compromising the security of the system. However, Kari did not specify which types of reversible cellular automaton should be used for such a system, or show how a cryptosystem using this approach would be able to generate encryption/decryption key pairs.|$|E

Gerry Feltus (2010) claimed he was given permission by Thomson's family to disclose her names and that of her husband, Prosper Thomson. Nevertheless, the names Feltus used in his book were pseudonyms.

Since the publication of the <b>decryption</b> <b>key</b> to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with cryptography and steganography.

The preface to the Polygraphia equally establishes, the everyday practicability of cryptography was conceived by Trithemius as a [...] "secular consequent of the ability of a soul specially empowered by God to reach, by magical means, from earth to Heaven". Robert Hooke suggested in the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography, to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
