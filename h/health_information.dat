Little other dental <b>health</b> <b>information</b> is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford <b>Health</b> <b>Information</b> Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E

40|$|Recognition of the {{improvements}} in patient safety, quality of patient care, and efficiency that <b>health</b> care <b>information</b> systems {{have the potential}} to bring has led to significant investment. Globally the sale of <b>health</b> care <b>information</b> systems now represents a multibillion dollar industry. As policy makers, health care professionals, and patients, {{we have a responsibility to}} maximize the return on this investment. To this end we analyze alternative licensing and software development models, as well as the role of standards. We describe how licensing affects development. We argue for the superiority of open source licensing to promote safer, more effective <b>health</b> care <b>information</b> systems. We claim that open source licensing in <b>health</b> care <b>information</b> systems is essential to rational procurement strategy...|$|R

25|$|Medical {{underwriting}} is {{a health}} insurance term {{referring to the}} use of medical or <b>health</b> <b>information</b> in the evaluation of an applicant for coverage, typically for life or health insurance. As part of the underwriting process, an individual's <b>health</b> <b>information</b> may be used in making two decisions: whether to offer or deny coverage and what premium rate to set for the policy. The two most common methods of medical underwriting are known as moratorium underwriting, a relatively simple process, and full medical underwriting, a more indepth analysis of a client's <b>health</b> <b>information.</b> The use of medical underwriting may be restricted by law in certain insurance markets. If allowed, the criteria used should be objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance system.|$|E
