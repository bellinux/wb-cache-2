25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase <b>in</b> <b>load</b> on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or cyclic loading (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change <b>in</b> <b>load</b> are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{sizes of}} the {{cavities}} determine the resonant frequency, {{and thereby the}} frequency of the emitted microwaves. However, the frequency is not precisely controllable. The operating frequency varies with changes <b>in</b> <b>load</b> impedance, with changes in the supply current, and with the temperature of the tube. This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the klystron are used.|$|E

Four shoes (R 1, R 2, T 1 and T 2) were used for 500 km except for T 1 which was used for 1000 km. At every 100 km, Ground Reaction Force (GRF) and plantar pressure measurements were collected. In T 2, there was a slight trend of increase <b>in</b> <b>Loading</b> Rate of the first peak of GRF with increasing distance. R 1, R 2 and T 1 showed no trend of increase <b>in</b> <b>Loading</b> Rate values. Shoe T 1 showed a slight tendency of increase <b>in</b> <b>Loading</b> Rate values when the distance was considered up to 1000 km. All running shoes showed a high variability in peak pressure values, but no trend of increase was observed. On the contrary, T 1, T 2 and R 2 showed a trend of decrease in peak pressure values with increasing use. Therefore, there is no consistent evidence or trend of increase <b>in</b> <b>Loading</b> Rate and Peak Pressure values that would suggest worsening <b>in</b> external <b>load</b> attenuation...|$|R

[...] is the fundamental component of the current and [...] {{is the total}} current – both are root mean square-values (distortion power factor {{can also be used}} to describe individual order harmonics, using the corresponding current in place of total current). This definition with respect to total harmonic distortion assumes that the voltage stays undistorted (sinusoidal, without harmonics). This simplification is often a good approximation for stiff voltage sources (not being affected by changes <b>in</b> <b>load</b> downstream in the distribution network). Total harmonic distortion of typical generators from current distortion in the network is on the order of 1–2%, which can have larger scale implications but can be ignored in common practice.|$|E
2500|$|Voltage {{regulators}} or stabilizers {{are used}} to compensate for voltage fluctuations in mains power. Large regulators may be permanently installed on distribution lines. [...] Small portable regulators may be plugged in between sensitive equipment and a wall outlet. Automatic voltage regulators are used on generator sets on ships, in emergency power supplies, on oil rigs, etc. to stabilize fluctuations in power demand. For example, when a large machine is turned on, the demand for power is suddenly a lot higher. The voltage regulator compensates for the change <b>in</b> <b>load.</b> Commercial voltage regulators normally operate {{on a range of}} voltages, for example 150–240V or 90–280V. Servo stabilizers are also manufactured and used widely {{in spite of the fact}} that they are obsolete and use out-dated technology.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1919 Latécoère {{had built}} a new and {{original}} design, which appeared at the Paris Aéro Salon in December of that year. Like the Salmson 2, it was a two bay biplane with unstaggered, equal span, constant chord, fabric covered wings fitted with ailerons on both planes and powered by a water cooled Salmson (Canton-Unné) Z9 nine-cylinder radial engine. However, unlike the Salmson 2 the Latécoère had an entirely metal structure, as well as completely redesigned wings of [...] greater (9%) span and with a 24% increase in wing area. The greater area gave an increase <b>in</b> <b>load</b> from [...] to [...] and an improved commercial load of the low useful load of the Salmson 2 had been an important limitation. The Latécoère 3's vertical tail was angular, unlike that of the Salmson though similar to the Limousine Salmson-Latécoère. The intention was to provide the Latécoère 3 with a similar limousine type, two or three seat passenger cabin with space for post to be carried at the rear, though this was never built; the Salon machine had two open cockpits with the pilot in front, as on the unmodified Salsmon.|$|E

Although it was judged superior in climb and speed to the latest and best fighters from all AAF manufacturers, the War Production Board refused to authorize P-38K production due to the two-to-three-week interruption in production necessary to implement cowling modifications for the revised spinners and higher thrust line. Some have also doubted Allison's ability to deliver the F15 engine in quantity. As promising as it had looked, the P-38K project came to a halt.|$|E
2500|$|When the Liberals {{realized}} that the new Captain-General was not an ally, the Azoreans began a movement to proclaim, by revolution, a constitutional model in the archipelago. [...] Capitalizing on the discontent with the governance of the Captains-General, on 1 March 1821, a military revolt in Ponta Delgada erupted, cheffed by Noronha and lieutenant João Soares de Albergaria, inspired by civil elements angry with the dominance of Terceira [...] (militarily and economically). A constitutional regime was installed in São Miguel, proclaiming {{the independence of the}} island from the dominion of the government in Angra. This bloodless revolution was supported by members of the nobility, clerics, magistrates and councillors. On the following day many of the municipal authorities supported to revolt. The interim government did not lose time and revoked many of the laws the subordinated the island of São Miguel to Terceira, abolishing taxes and annulling orders of Stockler. Meanwhile the continental government decided to accept the Interim government administration in São Miguel and Santa Maria, and placing Stockler in charge of the remaining islands. Stockler tried to resist, but on 2 April 1821, a revolution broke out in Angra, inspired by those deported from the Amazon and those loyal to Brigadier Francisco António de Araújo, forcing him to take refuge in Praia. The municipal council proclaimed the Interim government under Araújo Azevedo, but the Liberal cause was not as popular as the rebels assumed, he was shot during a counter-revolution and impaled by baionnettes, his body taken <b>in</b> <b>load</b> procession through the streets of Angra.|$|E
