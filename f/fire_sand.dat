5|$|Although the {{destructive}} effects of gunpowder were {{described in the}} earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest-known existent written formulas for gunpowder come from the Wujing Zongyao text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults. The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring hollowed bamboo poles as tubes to <b>fire</b> <b>sand</b> particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong'). This ancestor to the gun was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls. In 1132, at the Siege of De'an, Song Chinese forces used fire lances against the rival Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, initial post-fire {{responses}} of oaks were slower than palmettos. This {{is consistent with}} the visual appearance of scrubby flatwoods, which appears palmetto dominated for several months, but oak dominated after a year or so. Oaks are more persistent than palmettos in long unburned sites (Menges et al. 1993). Scrub oaks are known to double in number of shoots after fire, and then thin out as shoot size increases (Abrahamson 1984 b, Johnson and Abrahamson 2002). Our results show that all three oaks more than double in the number of shoots shortly after <b>fire.</b> <b>Sand</b> live oak had a slightly higher proportion of post-fire stems to pre-fire stems than Archbold oak, which is consistent with previous findings of an increased abundance of sand live oak after fire (Abrahamson 1984 b). These initial responses could have an impact on relative abundance of stems over time despite thinning.|$|E

40|$|Contamination on the {{railhead}} such as crushed leaves, {{oxide formation}} or even changes in atmospheric conditions can cause adhesion loss between {{the wheel and}} the rail. In these situations, trains can lose {{some or all of}} their braking capacity leading to vehicles coming within dangerously close proximity to one another. Low adhesion situations are traditionally combatted by <b>firing</b> <b>sand</b> directly into the wheel/rail contact from on-board the train. Previous testing has been carried out to investigate the optimum sanding system set-up which delivers the most amount of sand to the wheel/rail interface. Testing presented in this paper is a continuation of the previous set-up tests [1] and focuses on adhesion differences when sand enters the contact under low adhesion conditions. A full-scale test facility was used for these tests. Firstly, tests were undertaken which investigated sand density on the rail head and how this affects adhesion restoration. A second set of tests looked at how adhesion was restored when <b>sand</b> was <b>fired</b> into the contact using the ideal sanding system set-up found in previous testin...|$|R

Moreover, keeping the traditional method of combustion, mechanical and physical properties may be optimized by adding a controlled amount of raw ash (about 5 %) in the galeb bricks composition...|$|R
