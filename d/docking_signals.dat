40|$|Establishment of precise {{neuronal}} connections {{requires the}} proper guidance and targeting of growing axons during embryogenesis. The growth cone, a sensori motor structure at {{the leading edge}} of the axon, expresses cell surface receptors for recognizing guidance and targeting signals. It also possesses the intracellular signal transduction machinery to convert the extracellular signals into the reorganization of cytoskeletal structures in inducing directed movement (guidance) or the cessation of movement (targeting). Accumulated evidence points to the importance of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in growth cone signaling. The signaling cascade linking tyrosine phosphorylation into the changes in growth cone motility, however, remains largely undefined. Previous studies suggest that the Dock/Nck adapter protein play a role in transducing tyrosine phosphorylation signals to the actin-based cytoskeleton to regulate growth cone motility. To gain insight into the <b>Dock</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway, we have sought to identify the downstream effector of Dock in photoreceptor (R-cell) growth cones in the Drosophila visual system. Our recent results indicate that Misshapen (Msn), a Ste 20 -like Ser/Thr kinase, functions downstream of Dock to terminate R-cell growth cones in the target region. First, like loss of dock, mutations in msn cause R-cell growth cone targeting defects. Second, Msn is expressed in R-cells and predominantly localized in R-cell growth cones. Third, overexpression of Msn induces the early growth cone termination, a phenotype that is opposite to the msn loss-of-function phenotype. Finally, Msn interacts with Dock physically and genetically. We propose that Dock-linked target-derived signals activate Msn, which in turn modulates cytoskeletal-related proteins within the growth cones in decelerating their motility when the axons reach their targets.

Results Using an AKAR 2 -AKAP 5 fusion “biosensor”, we investigated the spatial-temporal activation of AKAP 5 undergoing phosphorylation by PKA in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. The pattern of PKA activation reported by AKAR 2 -AKAP 5 is a more rapid and spatially distinct from those “sensed” by AKAR 2 -AKAP 12. Spatial-temporal restriction of activated PKA by AKAP 5 was found to “shape” the signaling response. Phosphatase PDE 4 D tethered to AKAP 5 also later reverses within 60 [*]s elevated intracellular cyclic AMP levels stimulated by β-adrenergic agonist. AKAP 12, however, fails to attenuate the rise in cyclic AMP over this time. Fusion of the AKAP 5 PDE 4 D-binding-domain to AKAP 12 was found to accelerate a reversal of accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP.

40|$|Covalent and {{reversible}} post-translational {{modifications of}} proteins {{are a common}} theme in signaling. Ubiquitin conjugation was originally described to target proteins to proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin polymerization involving lysine (K) 48 residues. Differently linked polymers of polyubiquitin have been found that modify proteins without targeting to proteasomal degradation. Instead this pathway creates <b>docking</b> sites for <b>signaling</b> scaffolds that are key to control the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. Indeed TRAF- 2, TRAF- 6, and TRAF- 3 are E 3 ubiquitin ligases that form K 63 -linked ubiquitin polymers. Therefore signaling via TNF family receptors, IL 1 R, IL- 18 R, T-cell receptor (TCR), and Toll-like receptors (TLR) use this type of post-translational modification. Specific enzymes exist (DUBs) that deactivate this system, degrading K 63 polyubiquitin chains. Interestingly, mice deficient in these deubiquitinases develop autoimmunity and inflammation.

40|$|Plasmacytoid {{dendritic}} cells (pDCs) play a {{key role}} in antiviral immunity, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases, by producing large amounts of type I IFNs. Although activation of pDCs is triggered by engagement of nucleotide-sensing toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 9, type I IFN induction additionally requires IκB kinase (IKK) α–dependent activation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7. However, the signaling pathway mediating IKK-α activation is poorly defined. We show that DOCK 2, an atypical Rac activator, is essential for TLR 7 - and TLR 9 -mediated IFN-α induction in pDCs. We found that the exposure of pDCs to nucleic acid ligands induces Rac activation through a TLR-independent and DOCK 2 -dependent mechanism. Although this Rac activation was dispensable for induction of inflammatory cytokines, phosphorylation of IKK-α and nuclear translocation of IRF- 7 were impaired in Dock 2 -deficient pDCs, resulting in selective loss of IFN-α induction. Similar results were obtained when a dominant-negative Rac mutant was expressed in wild-type pDCs. Thus, the <b>DOCK</b> 2 –Rac <b>signaling</b> pathway acts in parallel with TLR engagement to control IKK-α activation for type I IFN induction.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{activities}} of cells {{are controlled by}} cell-surface receptors, which in response to ligands, trigger intracellular signaling reactions that elicit cellular re-sponses. A hallmark of these signaling reactions is the reversible nucleation of multicomponent complexes, which typically begin to assemble when ligand-receptor binding allows an enzyme, often a kinase, to create <b>docking</b> sites for <b>signaling</b> molecules through chemical modifications, such as tyrosine phosphorylation. One function of such docking sites is the co-localization of enzymeswith their substrates, which can enhance both enzyme activity and specificity. The directed assembly of complexes can also influence the sensitivity of cellular responses to ligand-receptor binding kinetics and determine whether a cellular response is up- or downregulated {{in response to a}} ligand stimulus. The full functional implications of ligand-stimulated complex for-mation are difficult to discern intuitively.

Therefore, we compared the biomechanical properties and the response to mechanical stress of murine plectin-deficient myoblasts and keratinocytes with wild-type cells. Using a cell stretching device, plectin-deficient myoblasts exhibited lower mechanical vulnerability upon external stress compared to wild-type cells, which we attributed to lower cellular pre-stress. Contrary to myoblasts, wild-type and plectin-deficient keratinocytes showed no significant differences. In magnetic tweezer measurements using fibronectin-coated paramagnetic beads, the stiffness of keratinocytes was higher than of myoblasts. Interestingly, cell stiffness, adhesion strength, and cytoskeletal dynamics were strikingly altered in plectin-deficient compared to wild-type myoblasts, whereas smaller differences were observed between plectin-deficient and wild-type keratinocytes, indicating that plectin might be more important for stabilizing cytoskeletal structures in myoblasts than in keratinocytes. Traction forces strongly correlated with the stiffness of plectin-deficient and wild-type myoblasts and keratinocytes. Contrary to that cell motility was comparable in plectin-deficient and wild-type myoblasts, but was significantly increased in plectin-deficient compared to wild-type keratinocytes. Thus, we postulate {{that the lack of}} plectin has divergent implications on biomechanical properties depending on the respective cell type...|$|R
40|$|This review summarises {{some of the}} {{knowledge}} we have about Crk and Grb 2 family adaptor protein signalling in health and disease and outlines the current status and the challenges still remaining {{in the development of}} efficient and selective inhibitors of their protein - protein interactions. It also highlights briefly some recent successes and problems of inhibitors for proteins that functionally interact with Crk and Grb 2 family adaptors, as well as opportunities, which may arise from combination therapies. Grb 2 and Crk family adaptors regulate signalling pathways linked to human diseases. They are mainly composed of Src homology 2 (SH 2) and Src homology 3 (SH 3) domains, which serve as <b>docking</b> sites for <b>signalling</b> proteins, including various receptors, cytoplasmic kinases and GTPase regulators. Considerable insight into the biological functions and mechanisms of action of small SH 2 /SH 3 domain adaptors has been gained in the last years from experimental approaches as diverse as targeted gene disruption and structural studies at the atomic level. This has already indicated several strategies to utilise SH 2 and SH 3 domain interaction inhibitors in human disease therapy. Additional molecular targets for Crk and Grb 2 domain interaction blockers are expected to surface as further protein-protein interactions are discovered. Examples include newly found DOCK family proteins (DOCK 3, DOCK 4, and DOCK 5) which are known or suspected effectors of Crk proteins and the interaction of Grb 2 with the cell cycle regulator p 27 Kip 1...|$|R
