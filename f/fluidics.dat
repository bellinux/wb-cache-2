40|$|Abstract. Supercritical CO 2 is nontoxic, nonflammable, noncorrosive, inexpensive, {{and does}} not {{generate}} any additional toxic or hazardous wastes. In this article, the <b>fluidic</b> parameters of supercritical CO 2 and water <b>fluidic</b> are calculated by related equations. The {{results show that the}} <b>fluidic</b> impact force of supercritical CO 2 <b>fluidic</b> is higher than water <b>fluidic,</b> which indicates that using supercritical CO 2 <b>fluidic</b> to dispose the obsolete propellant is possible. Instruction Every country in the world has a backlog of excess, obsolete and unserviceable propellant for disposal. These waste energetic materials (EM) are mainly resulted from decommissioning of weapons stockpiles, off-specification production and upgrading of weapons systems [1 - 2]. In the past, large quantities of waste energetic materials were disposed of in a process known as open burn or open detonation (OB/OD), which not only wastes their energy content, but also releases large quantities of hazardous gas into the environment. Because of public and regulatory concerns, OB/OD of these materials is becoming increasingly unacceptable, and extensive research has been conducted in the past for new disposing technique [3 - 6]. So, it is very necessary to design a new method disposing this propellant. In this article, we focus on the feasibility of using supercritical CO 2 dispose the obsolete propellant. The basic parameters of CO 2 <b>fluidic</b> There are many parameters to describe the property of CO 2 <b>fluidic,</b> such as pressure, <b>fluidic</b> flux, flow rate, power and recoil force.

40|$|Adaptive optic {{technology}} has revolutionized real time correction of wavefront aberrations. Optofluidic based applied optic devices have offered {{an opportunity to}} produce flexible refractive lenses in the correction of wavefronts. <b>Fluidic</b> lenses have superiority relative to their solid lens counterparts in their capabilities of producing tunable optical systems, that when synchronized, can produce real time variable systems with no moving parts. We have developed optofluidic <b>fluidic</b> lenses for applications of applied optical devices, as well as ophthalmic optic devices. The {{first half of this}} dissertation discusses the production of <b>fluidic</b> lenses as optical devices. In addition, the design and testing of various <b>fluidic</b> systems made with these components are evaluated. We begin with the creation of spherical or defocus singlet <b>fluidic</b> lenses. We then produced zoom optical systems with no moving parts by synchronizing combinations of these <b>fluidic</b> spherical lenses. The variable power zoom system incorporates two singlet <b>fluidic</b> lenses that are synchronized. The coupled device has no moving parts and has produced a magnification range of 0. 1 x to 10 x or a 20 x magnification range. The chapter after <b>fluidic</b> zoom technology focuses on producing achromatic lens designs. We offer an analysis of a hybrid diffractive and refractive achromat that offers discrete achromatized variable focal lengths. In addition, we offer a design of a fully optofluidic based achromatic lens. By synchronizing the two membrane surfaces of the <b>fluidic</b> achromat we develop a design for a <b>fluidic</b> achromatic lens. The second half of this dissertation discusses the production of optofluidic technology in ophthalmic applications. We begin with an introduction to an optofluidic phoropter system. A <b>fluidic</b> phoropter is designed through the combination of a defocus lens with two cylindrical <b>fluidic</b> lenses that are orientated 45 ° relative to each other. Here we discuss the designs of the <b>fluidic</b> cylindrical lens coupled with a previously discussed defocus singlet lens. We then couple this optofluidic phoropter with relay optics and Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing technology to produce an auto-phoropter device. The auto-phoropter system combines a refractometer designed Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with the compact refractive <b>fluidic</b> lens phoropter. This combination allows for the identification and control of ophthalmic cylinder, cylinder axis, as well as refractive error. The closed loop system of the <b>fluidic</b> phoropter with refractometer enables for the creation of our see-through auto-phoropter system. The design and testing of several generations of transmissive see-through auto-phoropter devices are presented in this section...|$|R

The closed loop <b>fluidic</b> auto-phoropter has been designed, modeled, fabricated and tested for the automatic measurement and correction of a patient's prescriptions. The adaptive phoropter is designed through {{the combination of a}} spherical-powered <b>fluidic</b> lens and two cylindrical <b>fluidic</b> lenses that are orientated 45 ° relative to each other. In addition, the system incorporates Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing technology to identify the eye's wavefront error and corresponding prescription. Using the wavefront error information, the <b>fluidic</b> auto-phoropter nulls the eye's lower order wavefront error by applying the appropriate volumes to the <b>fluidic</b> lenses. The combination of the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor the <b>fluidic</b> auto-phoropter allows for the identification and control of spherical refractive error, as well as cylinder error and axis; thus, creating a truly automated refractometer and corrective system. The <b>fluidic</b> auto-phoropter is capable of correcting defocus error ranging from − 20 D to 20 D and astigmatism from − 10 D to 10 D. The transmissive see-through design allows for the observation of natural scenes through the system at varying object planes with no additional imaging optics in the patient's line of sight. In this research, two generations of the <b>fluidic</b> auto-phoropter are designed and tested; the first generation uses traditional glass optics for the measurement channel. The second generation of the <b>fluidic</b> auto-phoropter takes advantage of the progress in the development of holographic optical elements (HOEs) to replace all the traditional glass optics. The addition of the HOEs has enabled the development of a more compact, inexpensive and easily reproducible system without compromising its performance. Additionally, the <b>fluidic</b> lenses were tested during a National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) parabolic flight campaign, to determine the effect of varying gravitational acceleration on the performance and image quality of the <b>fluidic</b> lenses. Wavefront analysis has indicated that flight turbulence and the varying levels of gravitational acceleration ranging from zero-G (microgravity) to 2 G (hypergravity) had minimal effect on the performance of the <b>fluidic</b> lenses, except for small changes in defocus; making them suitable for potential use in a portable space-based <b>fluidic</b> auto-phoropter...|$|R
