5|$|Edmund's cult re-emerged in the 10th {{century and}} the site of his burial grew wealthy {{as a result of}} {{receiving}} grants of land from royally connected benefactors. In about 986, the monks of Ramsey Abbey commissioned Abbo of Fleury to write an account of the saint's life and early cult. In his preface or dedicatory epistle Abbo addresses the work to St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury 960-988. Dunstan himself {{is the source of the}} story of the martyrdom, which he had heard told long before, in the presence of King Æthelstan, by an old man who swore an oath that he had been Edmund's own sword-bearer (armiger) on the fatal day. Abbo therefore clearly makes Dunstan, then still living and the recipient of his work, the authority for what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping up and down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is related {{to a lot of the}} shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

2500|$|While an {{accidental}} collision with a sperm whale at night accounted for {{sinking of the}} Union in 1807, {{it was not until}} August 1851 that the whaler Ann Alexander, while hunting in the Pacific off the Galápagos Islands, became the second vessel since the Essex to be attacked, holed, and sunk by a whale. Melville remarked, [...] "Ye Gods! What a commentator is this Ann Alexander whale. What <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is short & pithy & very much to the point.

2500|$|As {{everyone}} {{is leaving the}} room, Violetta has asked Alfredo to see her. Fearing that the Baron's anger will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel, she gently asks Alfredo to leave. Alfredo misunderstands her apprehension and demands that she admit that she loves the Baron. In grief, she makes that admission and, furiously, Alfredo calls the guests to witness what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> (Questa donna conoscete? – [...] "You know this woman?"). He humiliates and denounces Violetta {{in front of the}} guests and then throws his winnings at her feet in payment for her services. She faints onto the floor. The guests reprimand Alfredo: Di donne ignobile insultatore, di qua allontanati, ne desti orror! ("Ignoble insulter of women, go away from here, you fill us with horror!").|$|E
2500|$|Sammael {{refuses to}} fight Gabriel, instead {{asking him to}} listen to what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He {{explains}} how he despises being an angel, a being created entirely to serve others. He sees purgatory as a chance to take control of his own destiny and lets Gabriel know that it was him all along keeping Gabriel protected and alive in a city amongst all the Fallen, and asks Gabriel to join him. Refusing his offer, Gabriel unwittingly realizes that [...] "Sammael" [...] is actually the Archangel Michael, his closest friend (who had actually killed the real Sammael and assumed his identity). The two Archangels fight, but because Gabriel has used up so much of his strength helping the other Archangels, Michael has the advantage. Michael ultimately impales Gabriel’s chest with a metal pipe. Gabriel admits that during his time as a human he has felt rage and anger, but he has also experienced things that Michael hasn’t. An impaled Gabriel embraces Michael, which drives the metal pipe through Michael’s chest also, and tells Michael that he forgives him. Both Archangels collapse. Michael uses the last of his strength to heal Gabriel’s wound, then dies. Light returns to purgatory.|$|E
