5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will <b>just</b> <b>lie</b> on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not <b>just</b> <b>lie</b> along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|While {{appearing}} in Don't <b>Just</b> <b>Lie</b> There, Say Something! at the Metro Theatre, Sydney in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient's left hand was shaking slightly; the doctor suggested a visit, {{upon his return}} to the UK, to a specialist, who diagnosed the actor with Parkinson's disease. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, he did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors, a shuffling gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known—partly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness.|$|E

500|$|Only a {{few days}} after Ballard's {{discovery}} of the wreck, Jack Grimm – the author of the unsuccessful early 1980s attempts to find Titanic – claimed ownership of it on the grounds that he had allegedly been the first to find it. He announced that he intended to begin salvaging the wreck. He said that he [...] " [...] see them <b>just</b> <b>lie</b> there and be absorbed by the ocean floor.

500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would <b>just</b> <b>lie</b> there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Keith Harris of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Janet Jackson has {{abandoned}} the plastic R of 2006's 20 Y.O. for a sexier brand of digitized megapop [...] you can dismiss any {{images of the}} abusive Jackson clan that flit into your mind. <b>Just</b> <b>lie</b> back and enjoy the sensations as pure aural autoeroticism." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were [...] "as innocent, universal, and inviting as anything else in Janet's past", and called the songs [...] "Rock with U" [...] and [...] "2Nite" [...] "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's [...] "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying [...] "Still, if not perfect, there's plenty to like on Discipline, and while {{none of it is}} exactly vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list for a little while longer." ...|$|E

It's the diversity dream come true. Or is it? [...] Think Busytown by way of Chinatown. It's almost certain {{to be the most}} existentially probing talking animal cartoon of the year." [...] Collin added, [...] "Like Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs., albeit considerably cuter, Judy and Nick make a hilariously strained but effective double act – not least thanks to Goodwin and Bateman's tremendous vocal work, which trips along with the effortless swing and snap of great bebop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{has stated}} that Harry's {{character}} flaws include anger and impulsiveness; however, Harry is also innately honourable. [...] "He's not a cruel boy. He's competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't <b>just</b> <b>lie</b> down and take abuse. But he does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire." [...] For the most part, Harry shows humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, these very same accomplishments are later employed {{to explain why he}} should lead Dumbledore's Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.|$|E
