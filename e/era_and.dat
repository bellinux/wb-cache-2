40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a {{molecular beam epitaxy}} growth technique to create intentionally textured interfaces between semimetallic <b>ErAs</b> <b>and</b> GaAs that result in interface orientations that {{are different from the}} substrate. To grow the textured interfaces, ErAs is deposited on (100) GaAs and islands form in an island growth mode. Enough GaAs is then deposited to fill the space between islands with semiconductor. More ErAs is deposited on the ErAs/GaAs surface <b>and</b> the new <b>ErAs</b> islands are thought to nucleate on the exposed top surface of the partially covered islands. The process is repeated to "stack" the islands. By quadratically increasing the amount of ErAs deposited in each repetition, the islands form into cones/pyramids that coalesce into a complete film with an intentionally roughened interface. Compared to a smooth interface between <b>ErAs</b> <b>and</b> GaAs, the Schottky barrier height between textured <b>ErAs</b> <b>and</b> n-GaAs can be reduced from similar to 0. 81 to similar to 0. 52 eV, and the Schottky barrier height between <b>ErAs</b> <b>and</b> p-GaAs can be increased from similar to 0. 38 to similar to 0. 63 eV.
