It inhibits gastrointestinal motility and reduces gastric secretions, and despite older selective CCKA antagonists such as lorglumide and devazepide having had only limited success in trials and ultimately never making it into clinical use, <b>dexloxiglumide</b> is being investigated as a potential treatment {{for a variety of}} gastrointestinal problems including irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, constipation and pancreatitis, and has had moderate success so far although trials are still ongoing.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the role of fat and cholecystokinin (CCK) in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD) by investigating symptoms and plasma CCK levels following increasing doses of duodenal lipid during gastric distension, {{and the effect of}} CCK-A receptor blockade.  SUBJECTS/METHODS—In study A, six FD patients were studied on three occasions during duodenal infusion of saline or lipid (1. 1  (L- 1) or 2  kcal/min (L- 2)) and proximal gastric distensions. Six healthy subjects were also studied as controls during L- 2 only. In study B, the effect of the CCK-A antagonist <b>dexloxiglumide</b> (5  mg/kg/h) on L- 2 induced symptoms was studied in 12  FD patients. Changes in gastric volume at minimal distending pressure and plasma CCK (study A) were assessed, gastric distensions were performed using a barostat, and dyspeptic symptoms were monitored.  RESULTS—Lipid increased gastric volume compared with saline (ΔV (ml) : saline 15  (20), L- 1 122  (42), L- 2 114  (28)) in patients and even more so in controls (221  (37); p 0. 05). <b>Dexloxiglumide</b> abolished the increase in gastric volume (ΔV (ml) : <b>dexloxiglumide</b> 17  (9), placebo 186  (49)) and dyspeptic symptoms (sum of scores: <b>dexloxiglumide</b> 24  (7), placebo 44  (19)) during duodenal lipid infusion. <b>Dexloxiglumide</b> also reduced gastric compliance (ml/mm Hg: <b>dexloxiglumide</b> 51  (7), placebo 72  (11)) and symptoms (sum of scores: <b>dexloxiglumide</b> 101  (17), placebo 154  (21)) during gastric distension.  CONCLUSION—CCK-A receptors are involved in the generation of dyspeptic symptoms by duodenal lipid during gastric distension.    Keywords: functional dyspepsia; duodenal lipid; cholecystokinin; dyspeptic symptom...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dexloxiglumide,</b> the dextro {{isomeric}} form ofloxiglumide, is {{a potent}} and selective cholecystokinin subtype- 1 (CCK 1) receptor-blocking agent being studied {{for the treatment of}} functional gas-trointestinal disorders (FGIDs) such as constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, nonulcer dys-pepsia, and gastric-emptying disorders. 1 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that <b>dexloxiglumide</b> effec-tively blocks the actions of both exogenous and endog-enous cholecystokinin. 1 Cholecystokinin (CCK), a pep-tide hormone widely distributed in the small intestine (duodenal I cells and enteric nerves), is secreted in re-sponse to meals 2 and plays a role in regulating gallblad-der contraction 3 and pancreatic enzyme secretion. 4, 5 The peptide also delays the gastric emptying rate, mod-ulates small bowel transit time, increases colonic tran-sit time, and causes lower esophageal sphincter relax-ation in both humans and animals. 6, 7 The biological action of CCK on the exocrine pancreas, 8 gallbladder, 9 and gastrointestinal smooth muscle 9 is mediated by CCK 1 (formerly referred to as CCKA) receptors. These receptors are located on the target organs, in neurons in the myenteric plexus, and in vagal afferents from the gastrointestinal tract. 10 The ability of <b>dexloxiglumide</b> to block CCK from binding to these receptors is ex-pected to be a key mechanism for its efficacy in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. The oral bioavailability of <b>dexloxiglumide</b> in humans is about 48 %. 11 It is rapidly absorbed and eliminated...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that cholecystokinin (CCK) {{has a major}} physiological role in the regulation of pancreatic secretion and gastro-intestinal (GI) motility. Both these actions are mediated by stimulation of CCKA-receptors located on pancreatic acini and GI smooth muscle cells. While chronic administration of CCK-like peptides invariably causes pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, their action on gastric growth remains controversial. In the present investigation the action of exogenous and endogenous CCK on both pancreatic and gastric growth was studied in the same animal. In addition, the ability of <b>dexloxiglumide,</b> a new potent and selective CCKA-receptor antagonist, to counteract CCK-mediated effects was evaluated. The amphibian peptide caerulein (1 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 intraperitoneally three times daily) {{was used as a}} CCK agonist, while camostate (200 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 intragastrically once daily), a synthetic protease inhibitor, was used to release endogenous CCK. They were administered to rats for seven days with or without <b>dexloxiglumide</b> (25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 subcutaneously 15 [*]min before the stimulus). On the eighth day, animals were killed, the pancreas and stomach excised, weighed, homogenized and their protein and DNA content measured. Both exogenous and endogenous CCK increased the weight of the pancreas as well as the total pancreatic protein and DNA content. <b>Dexloxiglumide,</b> which alone did not affect pancreatic size and composition, was able to counteract both caerulein- and camostate-induced pancreatic changes. Neither stimuli affected gastric growth in respect of weight and composition of the oxyntic gland area and the antrum. These results show different effects of CCK on pancreatic and gastric growth. The CCK-induced pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia are blocked by the potent and specific CCKA-receptor antagonist, <b>dexloxiglumide.</b> This compound therefore represents a useful tool to investigate CCK-receptor interactions in peripheral organs...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin are stimulated during meal intake by the {{presence}} of fat in the small intestine. The sequence of events suggests that fat hydrolysis is crucial for triggering the release. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether CCK mediated the effect of intraduodenal (ID) fat on neurotensin secretion via CCK- 1 receptors. SETTING: This was a single center study; 34 male volunteers were studied in consecutive, randomized, double-blind, cross-over studies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: CCK and neurotensin release were quantified in: 1) 12 subjects receiving an ID fat infusion with or without 60 mg orlistat, an irreversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, in comparison to vehicle; 2) 12 subjects receiving ID long chain fatty acids (C 18 s), ID medium chain fatty acids, or ID vehicle; and 3) 10 subjects receiving ID C 18 with and without the CCK- 1 receptor antagonist <b>dexloxiglumide</b> or ID vehicle plus iv saline (placebo). Hormone concentrations were measured by specific RIA systems. RESULTS: ID fat induced a significant increase in CCK and neurotensin concentrations (P > 0. 001 - 0. 002). Inhibition of fat hydrolysis by orlistat abolished both effects. C 18 stimulated CCK and neurotensin release (P > 0. 001, respectively), whereas medium chain fatty acid was ineffective. <b>Dexloxiglumide</b> administration partially blocked the effect of C 18 on neurotensin; the effect was only present in the first phase of neurotensin secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Generation of C 18 through hydrolysis of fat is a critical step for fat-induced stimulation of neurotensin in humans; the signal is in part mediated via CCK release and CCK- 1 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Context: Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) is {{produced}} by specialized cells in the gut and secreted in response to carbohydrates and lipids. The mechanisms regulating fat-stimulated GLP- 1 release have, however, not been clarified in detail. Aim: We aimed to investigate the effect of intraduodenal (ID) fat hydrolysis on GLP- 1 release and test whether the signal is mediated through cholecystokinin (CCK) - 1 receptors. Design and Setting: Thirty-four healthy, male ambulatory volunteers were studied in three consecutive, randomized, double blind, crossover studies. Intervention: There were three interventions: 1) 12 subjects received an ID fat infusion with or without orlistat, an irreversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, in comparison with vehicle; 2) 12 subjects received ID sodium oleate (C 18 : 1), ID sodium caprylate (C 8 : 0), or ID vehicle; and 3) 10 subjects received ID sodium oleate with and without the CCK- 1 receptor antagonist <b>dexloxiglumide</b> or ID vehicle plus iv saline (placebo). The effect of these treatments on GLP- 1 concentrations and CCK release was quantified. Results: The following results were reached: 1) ID fat induced significant increase in GLP- 1 concentrations (P > 0. 004), and inhibition of fat hydrolysis by orlistat abolished this effect; 2) sodium oleate significantly stimulated GLP- 1 release (P > 0. 008), whereas sodium caprylate was ineffective compared with controls; and 3) <b>dexloxiglumide</b> administration abolished the effect of sodium oleate on GLP- 1. ID fat or sodium oleate significantly stimulated plasma CCK (P > 0. 006 and P > 0. 004) compared with saline, whereas sodium caprylate did not. Conclusion: Generation of long-chain fatty acids through hydrolysis of fat is a critical step for fat-induced stimulation of GLP- 1 in humans; the signal is mediated via CCK release and CCK- 1 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{consistently}} {{show that}} nasogastric nutrition delivers only about 60 % of nutritional goals in critically ill patients. The predominant reason is abnormal gastric motility, leading to delayed gastric emptying, which is evident clinically as large gastric residual volumes. Delayed gastric emptying occurs in about 50 %- 60 % of critically ill {{patients who are}} fed enterally and can result in malnutrition. Furthermore, delayed gastric emptying may {{increase the risk of}} aspiration of gastric contents. Recent research has improved our understanding of the complex abnormalities of gastric motor function that underlie delayed gastric emptying in the critically ill. Feed intolerance can be treated with prokinetic drugs and/or by the placement of postpyloric feeding catheters. The place of prokinetic agents in the treatment of feed intolerance is as yet unclear, but current evidence supports the administration of erythromycin combined with metoclopramide as first-line therapy. Other novel drugs, such as methylnaltrexone, mitemcinal, ghrelin agonists and <b>dexloxiglumide,</b> have potential advantages over these agents but require further investigation before widespread clinical use.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPrevious fMRI {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that glucose decreases the hypothalamic BOLD response in humans. However, the mechanisms underlying the CNS response to glucose have not been defined. We recently demonstrated that the slowing of gastric emptying by glucose is dependent on activation of the gut peptide cholecystokinin (CCK 1) receptor. Using physiological functional magnetic resonance imaging this study aimed to determine the whole brain response to glucose, and whether CCK plays a central role. Experimental designChanges in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal were monitored using fMRI in 12 healthy subjects following intragastric infusion (250 ml) of: 1 M glucose+predosing with <b>dexloxiglumide</b> (CCK 1 receptor antagonist), 1 M glucose+placebo, or 0. 9 % saline (control) +placebo, in a single-blind, randomised fashion. Gallbladder volume, blood glucose, insulin, and GLP- 1 and CCK concentrations were determined. Hunger, fullness and nausea scores were also recorded. Principal observationsIntragastric glucose elevated plasma glucose, insulin, and GLP- 1, and reduced gall bladder volume (an in vivo assay for CCK secretion). Glucose decreased BOLD signal, relative to saline, in the brainstem and hypothalamus as well as the cerebellum, right occipital cortex, putamen and thalamus. The timing of the BOLD signal decrease was negatively correlated with the rise in blood glucose and insulin levels. The glucose+dex arm highlighted a CCK 1 -receptor dependent increase in BOLD signal only in the motor cortex. ConclusionsGlucose induces site-specific differences in BOLD response in the human brain; the brainstem and hypothalamus show a CCK 1 receptor-independent reduction which is likely to be mediated by a circulatory effect of glucose and insulin, whereas the motor cortex shows an early dexloxiglumide-reversible increase in signal, suggesting a CCK 1 receptor-dependent neural pathway...|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is unclear}} to what extent {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms represent a normal perception of abnormal function or an abnormal perception of normal function, many believe that IBS constitutes the clinical expression of an underlying motility disorder, affecting primarily the mid- and lower gut. Indeed, transit and contractile abnormalities have been demonstrated with sophisticated techniques in a subset of patients with IBS. As a consequence, drugs affecting gastrointestinal (GI) motility have been widely employed {{with the aim of}} correcting the major IBS manifestations, ie, pain and altered bowel function. Unfortunately, no single drug has proven to be effective in treating IBS symptom complex. In addition, the use of some medications has often been associated with unpleasant side effects. Therefore, the search for a truly effective and safe drug to control motility disturbances in IBS continues. Several classes of drugs look promising and are under evaluation. Among the motor- inhibiting drugs, gut selective muscarinic antagonists (such as zamifenacin and darifenacin), neurokinin 2 antagonists (such as MEN- 10627 and MEN- 11420), beta 3 -adrenoreceptor agonists (eg, SR- 58611 A) and GI-selective calcium channel blockers (eg, pinaverium bromide and octylonium) are able to decrease painful contractile activity in the gut (antispasmodic effect), without significantly affecting other body functions. Novel mechanisms to stimulate GI motility and transit include blockade of cholecystokinin (CCK) A receptors and stimulation of motilin receptors. Loxiglumide (and its dextroisomer, <b>dexloxiglumide)</b> is the only CCKA receptor antagonist that is being evaluated clinically. This drug accelerates gastric emptying and colonic transit, thereby increasing the number of bowel movements in patients with chronic constipation. It is also able to reduce visceral perception. Erythromycin and related 14 -member macrolide compounds inhibit the binding of motilin to its receptors on GI smooth muscle and, therefore, act as motilin agonists. This antibiotic accelerates gastric emptying and shortens orocecal transit time. In the large bowel a significant decrease in transit is observed only in the right colon, which suggests a shift in fecal distribution. Several ‘motilinomimetics’ have been synthesized. Their development depends on the lack of antimicrobial activity and the absence of fading of the prokinetic effect during prolonged administration. 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 4 agonists with significant pharmacological effects on the mid- and distal gut (such as prucalopride and tegaserod) are available for human use. These ‘enterokinetic’ compounds are useful for treating constipation- predominant IBS patients. 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists also possess a number of interesting pharmacological properties that may make them suitable for treatment of IBS. Besides decreasing colonic sensitivity to distension, these drugs prolong intestinal transit and may be particularly useful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Finally, when administered in small pulsed doses, octreotide, besides reducing the perception of rectal distension, accelerates intestinal transit, although other evidence disputes such an effect...|$|E
