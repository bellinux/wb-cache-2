Comparison of successively grabbed images yielded the initial <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient,</b> and final <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient</b> and a relaxation {{time for the}} transition from the initial to the final desorption state, i. e. ageing of the bonds. Desorption experiments were performed from suspensions with different potassium nitrate concentrations (1, 10 and 50 mM) and at varying shear rates (15 - 200 s- 1). The initial <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient</b> beta 0, ranging from 1 x 10 (- 3) to 20 x 10 (- 3) s- 1, and the final <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient</b> beta(infinity), ranging from 0. 01 x 10 (- 3) to 0. 65 x 10 (- 3) s- 1 were both larger than the <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> calculated neglecting a possible residence time dependence.

Three coefficients {{can be used}} {{to describe}} the sorption/desorption of contaminants to soils. (1) The partition coefficient relates the contaminant concentration in the soil to the contaminant concentration in the aqueous phase. (2) The fraction of instantaneous sorption is the ratio of the time independent sorption to the total sorption. (3) The sorption rate constant quantifies the kinetics of the time dependent sorption. This study challenges the long accepted premise that the values of the sorption coefficients are equal to the values of the <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> and examines the ionic strength and temperature dependence of those coefficients. The sorption/desorption of naphthalene on Lincoln Fine Sand was examined with ionic strengths ranging from 0. 001 M to 0. 5 M. The partition coefficients varied as predicted with ionic strength but were about half to a third the predicted magnitude. An apparent minimum partition coefficient was observed at 0. 06 M. The fraction of equilibrium sorption was a maximum in the range of 0. 01 M to 0. 1 M. The sorption rate constants, α, decreased with increasing ionic strength. The α for the sorption data was 0. 5 hr- 1 at 0. 001 M decreasing to 0. 05 hr- 1 at 0. 5 M. α for desorption only decreased from 0. 13 hr- 1 to 0. 09 hr- 1 over the same ionic strength range.

The initial deposition rates increased linearly with particle concentrations in suspensions as expected from theoretical mass transport calculations. Deposition efficiencies of 0. 78 and 0. 62 were obtained for wall shear rates, G, of 15 and 50 s(- 1), respectively. Blocked areas, A(1) expressed {{as the number of}} particle cross sections, gamma, decreased from initially high to low values (A(1,G= 15) = 10 and A(1,G= 50) = 18, at infinite particle concentration) {{as a function of the}} particle concentration. This decrease in blocked area with particle concentration was explained as a consequence of the increased backscattering of flowing particles colliding with adhering particles. Backscattering due to collisions between flowing particles is obviously more frequent at higher Concentrations. Blocked areas, calculated using pair distribution functions, corresponded well with those obtained from deposition kinetics. Initial <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficients,</b> beta(0) ranging from 0. 3 x 10 (- 3) to 2. 0 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1), increased linearly with particle concentration in suspension due to an increase in the number of collisions between adhering and flowing particles per unit time. The final <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficients,</b> beta(infinity,) ranging from 0. 002 x 10 (- 3) to 0. 01 x 10 (- 3) s(- 1), and the relaxation time, 1 /delta, of the <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficient,</b> ranging from 50 to 1000 s, decreased as a function of the particle concentration because, as the effective interaction potential minimum is not the same for each adhering particle, weakly adhering particles will be removed first. The effective interaction potential minimum decreases as a function of shear rate due to increased hydrodynamic drag and lift forces resulting in higher <b>desorption</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> at higher shear rates...|$|R
40|$|Several {{oil sands}} {{tailings}} from Suncor Energy Inc. were analysed {{with respect to}} the mobility and solubility of the petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) contaminants. At sites where oil sands tailings materials have been disposed of and are covered with a growing medium, the PHCs from the tailings may slowly migrate into the reclamation cover, increasing their availability to the plants in the cover system, which could be detrimental to the development and establishment of the plant cover system. This study characterized the PHC content of the tailings and quantified the <b>desorption</b> and diffusion <b>coefficients</b> for F 2 and F 3 fraction PHCs. All tailings materials collected from Suncor were characterized for initial PHC content. <b>Desorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> were experimentally determined using batch tests for 9 tailings materials (MFT, LG MFT, PT MFT, Tailings Sand, P 4 UB Surface, P 4 UB Auger, 2 : 1 CT, 4 : 1 CT and 6 : 1 CT). The experimental results from the batch tests were fitted to a Langmuir hyperbolic isotherm model. Diffusion coefficients were determined by fitting the experimental results from a radial diffusion 1 -dimensional experiment to a Finite Difference Model. Diffusion coefficients for F 2 and F 3 Fraction PHCs were developed for 7 tailings materials (MFT, LG MFT, PT MFT, Tailings Sand, 2 : 1 CT, 4 : 1 CT and 6 : 1 CT). The diffusion coefficients (D*) and the Langmuir desorption constants (and) developed from these experiments are included in Table A. 1. The <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> resulting from this study are similar to those reported for the desorption of asphaltene, {{which is one of the}} components in oil sands tailings. The Langmuir isotherm model was found to be the best fit for the experimental desorption data; the Langmuir isotherm model is commonly used in sorption isotherms of organic chemicals. The results of the radial diffusion experiments agree with diffusion rates found by other researchers in similar porous media. More research may be needed to verify both of these preliminary results for the desorptive and diffusive transport of F 2 and F 3 PHC fractions in tailings. Tailings composition will continue to change as new technologies for fines settling and bitumen extraction are developed. The diffusion of PHCs from these new materials will need to be examined as it is probable that these changes will affect the transport and mobility of the contaminants...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} low-temperature hydrothermal experiments in which solutions containing Cs, Rb, and Sr were allowed to react with medium-grained biotite granite from Podlesí (Krušné hory Mts., Czech Republic). The experiments were performed at 115 and 150 °C under < 0. 5 kbar hydrostatic pressure, for durations of 1872 - 5562 hours. In these experiments, hydrothermal solutions containing Rb and Sr did not react with the rock-forming minerals in the granite. However, the Cs-containing solution did react with the rock-forming minerals, particularly the feldspars, to produce pollucite, a secondary Cs aluminosilicate. Pollucite could thus be used to delineate migration pathways of solutions through the granite samples. Three important migration pathways were distinguished: microcracks, grain boundaries, and cleavage planes. We also discuss the influence of sample processing on the observed permeability, {{and the effect of}} the crystallization of secondary phases on the disproportion between the sorption - <b>desorption</b> <b>coefficients...</b>|$|R
