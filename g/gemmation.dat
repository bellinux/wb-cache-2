The mesenchymal stem cells migrate into these epithelial buds and give rise to the lymphoid cells of the follicle medulla. However, research carried out in our laboratory, using the semi-thin serial section technique and the electron microscope, leads us to think that {{the early stages of the}} development of the bursal lymphoid follicle might take place in the following way: the stem cells migrate towards the proximal surface of the lining epithelium where they collect in an invagination. These cells gradually increase in number and a cellular mass is formed which, therefore, does not grow in the epithelial framework but under it. The epithelial invagination near the mesenchymal mass becomes more and more pronounced, making the epithelium progressively thinner until it is finally necrotized. At this point, the cells of the mesenchymal anlage protrude into the bursal lumen...|$|R

6000|$|Reproduction may {{be divided}} into two main classes, namely, sexual and asexual. The latter is {{effected}} in many ways--by the formation of buds of various kinds, and by fissiparous generation, that is by spontaneous or artificial division. It is notorious that some of the lower animals, when cut into many pieces, reproduce so many perfect individuals: Lyonnet cut a Nais or freshwater worm into nearly forty pieces, and these all reproduced perfect animals. (27/2. Quoted by Paget 'Lectures on Pathology' 1853 page 159.) It is probable that segmentation could be carried much further in some of the protozoa; and with some of the lowest plants each cell will reproduce the parent-form. Johannes Muller thought that there was an important distinction between <b>gemmation</b> and fission; for in the latter case the divided portion, however small, is more fully developed than a bud, which also is a younger formation; but most physiologists are now convinced that the two processes are essentially alike. (27/3. Dr. Lachmann also observes ('Annals and Mag. of Nat. History' 2nd series volume 19 1857 page 231) with respect to infusoria, that [...] "fissation and <b>gemmation</b> pass into each other almost imperceptibly." [...] Again, Mr. W.C. Minor ('Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' 3rd series volume 11 page 328) shows that with Annelids the distinction that has been made between fission and budding is not a fundamental one. See also Professor Clark's work 'Mind in Nature' New York 1865 pages 62, 94.) Prof. Huxley remarks, [...] "fission {{is little more than a}} peculiar mode of budding," [...] and Prof. H.J. Clark shows in detail that there is sometimes [...] "a compromise between self-division and budding." [...] When a limb is amputated, or when the whole body is bisected, the cut extremities are said to bud forth (27/4. See Bonnet 'Oeuvres d'Hist. Nat.' tome 5 1781 page 339 for remarks on the budding-out of the amputated limbs of Salamanders.); and as the papilla, which is first formed, consists of undeveloped cellular tissue like that forming an ordinary bud, the expression is apparently correct. We see the connection of the two processes in another way; for Trembley observed with the hydra, that the reproduction of the head after amputation was checked as soon as the animal put forth reproductive gemmae. (27/5. Paget 'Lectures on Pathology' 1853 page 158.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Let us take next a {{universal}} physiological law of a less conspicuous kind. To the ordinary observer, {{it seems that}} the multiplication of organisms proceeds in various ways. He sees that the young of the higher animals when born resemble their parents; that birds lay eggs, which they foster and hatch; that fish deposit spawn and leave it. Among plants, he finds that while in some cases new individuals grow from seeds only, in other cases they also grow from tubers; that by certain plants layers are sent out, take root, and develop new individuals; and that many plants can be reproduced from cuttings. Further, in the mould that quickly covers stale food, and the infusoria that soon swarm in water exposed to air and light, he sees a mode of generation which, seeming inexplicable, he is apt to consider [...] "spontaneous." [...] The reader of popular science thinks the modes of reproduction still more various. He learns that whole tribes of creatures multiply by gemmation--by a development from the body of the parent of buds which, after unfolding into the parental form, separate and lead independent lives. Concerning microscopic forms of both animal and vegetal life, he reads that the ordinary mode of multiplication is by spontaneous fission--a splitting up of the original individual into two or more individuals, which by and by severally repeat the process. Still more remarkable are the cases in which, as in the Aphis, an egg gives rise to an imperfect female, from which other imperfect females are born viviparously, grow, and in their turns bear other imperfect females; and so on for eight, ten, or more generations, until finally, perfect males and females are viviparously produced. But now under all these, and many more, modified modes of multiplication, the physiologist finds complete uniformity. The starting-point, not only of every higher animal or plant, but of every clan of organisms which by fission or <b>gemmation</b> have sprung from a single organism, is always a spore, seed, or ovum. The millions of infusoria or of aphides which, by sub-division or <b>gemmation,</b> have proceeded from one individual; the countless plants which have been successively propagated from one original plant by cuttings or tubers; are, in common with the highest creature, primarily descended from a fertilized germ. And in all cases--in the humblest alga as in the oak, in the protozoon as in the mammal--this fertilized germ results from the union of the contents of two cells. Whether, as among the lowest forms of life, these two cells are seemingly identical in nature; or whether, as among higher forms, they are distinguishable into sperm-cell and germ-cell; it remains throughout true that from their combination results the mass out of which is evolved a new organism or new series of organisms. That this law is without exception we are not prepared to say; for {{in the case of the}} Aphis certain experiments are thought to imply that under special conditions the descendants of an original individual may continue multiplying for ever, without further fecundation. But we know of no case where it actually is so; for although there are certain plants of which the seeds have never been seen, it is more probable that our observations are in fault than that these plants are exceptions. And until we find undoubted exceptions, the above-stated induction must stand. Here, then, we have another of the truths of Transcendental Physiology: a truth which, so far as we know, transcends all distinctions of genus, order, class, kingdom, and applies to every living thing.|$|E
60|$|Here; {{look into}} this opening in the milfoil and {{crowfoot}} bed. Do you see a grey film around that sprig? Examine it through the pocket lens. It is a forest of glass bells, on branching stalks. They are Vorticellae; {{and every one of}} those bells, by the ciliary current on its rim, is scavenging the water--till a tadpole comes by and scavenges it. How many millions of living creatures are there on that one sprig? Look here!--a brown polype, with long waving arms--a gigantic monster, actually a full half-inch long. He is Hydra fusca, most famous, and earliest described (I think by Trembley). Ere we go home I may show you perhaps Hydra viridis, with long pea-green arms; and rosea, most beautiful in form and colour of all the strange family. You see that lump, just where his stalk joins his bell-head? That is a budding baby. Ignorant of the joys and cares of wedlock, he increases by <b>gemmation.</b> See! here is another, with a full-sized young one growing on his back. You may tear it off if you will--he cares not. You may cut him into a dozen pieces, they say, and each one will grow, as a potato does. I suppose, however, that he also sends out of his mouth little free ova--medusoids--call them what you will, swimming by ciliae, which afterwards, unless the water beetles stop them on the way, will settle down as stalked polypes, and in their turn practise some mystery of Owenian parthenogenesis, or Steenstruppian alternation of generations, in which all traditional distinctions of plant and animal, male and female, are laughed to scorn by the magnificent fecundity of the Divine imaginations.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} {{surprising}} in {{the offspring of}} species or varieties crossed in the ordinary manner being modified; but the case of two plants within the same seed, which cohere and differ from each other, is curious. When a bud is formed after the cellular tissue of two species or two varieties have been united, and it partakes of the characters of both parents, the case is wonderful. But I need not here repeat what has been so lately said on this subject. We have also seen {{that in the case}} of plants the male element may affect in a direct manner the tissues of the mother, and with animals may lead to the modification of her future progeny. In the vegetable kingdom the offspring from a cross between two species or varieties, whether effected by seminal generation or by grafting, often revert, to a greater or less degree, in the first or in a succeeding generation, to the two parent-forms; and this reversion may affect the whole flower, fruit, or leaf-bud, or only the half or a smaller segment of a single organ. In some cases, however, such segregation of character apparently depends on an incapacity for union rather than on reversion, for the flowers or fruit which are first produced display by segments the characters of both parents. The various facts here given ought to be well considered by any one who wishes to embrace under a single point of view the many modes of reproduction by <b>gemmation,</b> division, and sexual union, the reparation of lost parts, variation, inheritance, reversion, and other such phenomena. Towards the close of the second volume I shall attempt to connect these facts together by the hypothesis of pangenesis.|$|E
6000|$|A further {{complication}} of the analogy is at hand. From the aggregation of units into organized groups, we {{pass to the}} multiplication of such groups, and their coalescence into compound groups. The Hydra, when it has reached a certain bulk, puts forth from its surface a bud which, growing and gradually assuming {{the form of the}} parent, finally becomes detached; and by this process of <b>gemmation</b> the creature peoples the adjacent water with others like itself. A parallel process is seen in the multiplication of those lowly-organized tribes above described. When one of them has increased to a size that is either too great for co-ordination under so rude a structure, or else that is greater than the surrounding country can supply with game and other wild food, there arises a tendency to divide; and as in such communities there often occur quarrels, jealousies, and other causes of division, there soon comes an occasion on which a part of the tribe separates under the leadership of some subordinate chief and migrates. This process being from time to time repeated, an extensive region is at length occupied by numerous tribes descended from a common ancestry. The analogy by no means ends here. Though in the common Hydra the young ones that bud out from the parent soon become detached and independent; yet {{throughout the rest of the}} class Hydrozoa, to which this creature belongs, the like does not generally happen. The successive individuals thus developed continue attached; give origin to other such individuals which also continue attached; and so there results a compound animal. As in the Hydra itself we find an aggregation of units which, considered separately, are akin to the lowest Protozoa; so here, in a Zoophyte, we find an aggregation of such aggregations. The like is also seen throughout the extensive family of Polyzoa or Molluscoida. The Ascidian Mollusks, too, in their many forms, show us the same thing: exhibiting, at the same time, various degrees of union among the component individuals. For while in the Salpæ the component individuals adhere so slightly that a blow on the vessel of water in which they are floating will separate them; in the Botryllidæ there exist vascular connexions among them, and a common circulation. Now in these different stages of aggregation, may we not see paralleled the union of groups of connate tribes into nations? Though, in regions where circumstances permit, the tribes descended from some original tribe migrate in all directions, and become far removed and quite separate; yet, where the territory presents barriers to distant migration, this does not happen: the small kindred communities are held in closer contact, and eventually become more or less united into a nation. The contrast between the tribes of American Indians and the Scottish clans, illustrates this. And a glance at our own early history, or the early histories of continental nations, shows this fusion of small simple communities taking place in various ways and to various extents. As says M. Guizot, in his History of the Origin of Representative Government,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The most {{complete}} life-history yet given of {{any member of}} the aphis family is that which M. Jules Lichtenstein has worked out with so much care {{in the case of the}} phylloxera of the oak-tree. In April, the winter eggs of this species, laid in the bark of an oak, each hatch out a wingless imperfect female, which M. Lichtenstein calls the foundress. After moulting four times, the foundress produces, by parthenogenesis, a number of false eggs, which it fastens to the leaf-stalks and under side of the foliage. These false eggs hatch out a larval form, wingless, but bigger than any of the subsequent generations; and the larvæ so produced themselves once more give origin to more larvæ, which acquire wings, and fly away from the oak on which they were born to another of a different species in the same neighbourhood. There these larvæ of the second crop once more lay false eggs, from which the third larval generation is developed. This brood is again wingless, and it proceeds at once to bud out several generations more, by internal <b>gemmation,</b> as long as the warm weather lasts. According to M. Lichtenstein, all previous observations have been made only on aphides of this third type; and he maintains that every species in the whole family really undergoes an analogous alternation of generations. At last, when the cold weather begins to set in, a fourth larval form appears, which soon obtains wings, and flies back to the same kind of oak on which the foundresses were first hatched out, all the intervening generations having passed their lives in sucking the juices of the other oak to which the second larval form migrated. The fourth type here produce perfect male and female insects, which are wingless, and have no sucking apparatus. The females, after being impregnated, lay a single egg each, which they hide in the bark, where it remains during the winter, till in spring it once more hatches out into a foundress, and the whole cycle begins over again. Whether all the aphides do or do not pass through corresponding stages is not yet quite certain. But Kentish farmers believe that the hop-fly migrates to hop-bines from plum-trees in the neighbourhood; and M. Lichtenstein considers that such migrations from one plant to another are quite normal in the family. We know, indeed, that many great plagues of our crops are thus propagated, sometimes among closely related plants, but sometimes also among the most widely separated species. For example, turnip-fly (which is not an aphis, but a small beetle) always begins its ravages (as Miss Ormerod has abundantly shown) upon a plot of charlock, and then spreads from patches of that weed to the neighbouring turnips, which are slightly diverse members of the same genus. But, on the other hand, it has long been well known that rust in wheat is specially connected with the presence of the barberry bush; and it has recently been proved that the fungus which produces the disease passes its early stages on the barberry leaves, and only migrates in later generations to the growing wheat. This last case brings even more prominently into light than ever the essential resemblance of the aphides to plant-parasites.|$|E

It {{has been found that}} application of GA 3 at concentrations of 10 - 9 - 10 - 4 M has no effect on the numbers of developing antheridia and oogonia. GA 3 stimulates the <b>gemmation</b> of capitular cells thus increasing the number of filaments in antheridia (by 45 % when 10 - 8 M is used).
