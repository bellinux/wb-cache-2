2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to counter newer, magnetically <b>fused</b> <b>mines,</b> some ships of the Sperrbrecher type were {{equipped}} with a large electromagnet fitted in their bows. Referred to as the VES system, this was intended to detonate magnetic mines well clear of the vessel, the design specifications calling for a distance of [...] from the hull at detonation. However, careful military intelligence work by the Royal Navy resulted in a method to defeat this method of minesweeping, sinking several Sperrbrecher through the careful <b>fusing</b> of <b>mines</b> laid as traps, their fuses desensitised to be activated only when the sweeping vessel was directly above them.|$|R

According to AzerNews, the weapons in this latest transfer include 21 tanks, 12 armored vehicles, five other battle machines, {{a great number of}} rocket launchers, over 1,050 cases of grenades, nearly 7,900 types of ammunition, 120 grenade launchers, over 4,000 sub-machine guns, TNT <b>fuses,</b> <b>mines</b> of various types, 14 mine-launchers, 9 Grad launchers, five cannons, and other weapons.|$|R
5000|$|In use {{the bombs}} are dropped from {{aircraft}} flying at speeds between 200 and 700 kn, and at altitudes of between 100 and 1,200 meters. An FMU-140/B fuze controls {{the opening of}} the dispenser at one of 10 predetermined altitudes between 90 m and 900 m using a doppler ranging radar or alternatively a 1.2 second time <b>fuse.</b> <b>Mine</b> arming begins when the dispenser opens with the activation of the mines' vanadium pentoxide batteries. The circular mines have a rectangular plastic [...] "aeroballistic" [...] adaptor. Once the mines reach the ground they arm in between 1.2 and 10 seconds.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} of the Sperrbrecher was to escort other vessels through cleared paths in {{defensive}} minefields, {{for the purpose of}} detonating any mines that might have strayed into the passageways. In addition, the ships of the Sperrbrecher type were, early in the war, used to clear suspected enemy minefields by simply sailing through them. Even with the strengthened hull and buoyant material, however, the ships suffered heavy losses in this role, and with the advent of acoustically and magnetically <b>fused</b> <b>mines,</b> this role became ineffective. Later in the war the Sperrbrecher type ships were used to escort U-boats in and out of harbour.|$|R

50|$|Some minefields are {{specifically}} booby-trapped to make clearing them more dangerous. Mixed anti-personnel and anti-tank minefields, anti-personnel mines under anti-tank <b>mines,</b> and <b>fuses</b> separated from <b>mines</b> {{have all been}} used for this purpose. Often, single mines are backed by a secondary device, designed to kill or maim personnel tasked with clearing the mine.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the <b>mine's</b> <b>fuse</b> {{mechanism}} {{was against}} the pillar, meaning that the mine had to be turned {{before it could be}} defused.

The Huolongjing, compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen sometime before the latter's death on 16 May 1375 (with a preface added by Jiao in 1412), featured many types of cutting-edge gunpowder weaponry for the time. This includes hollow, gunpowder-filled exploding cannonballs, land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights, pins, and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of <b>fuses,</b> naval <b>mines,</b> fin-mounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control, multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth {{from the end of the}} missile (shaped like a dragon's head), and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the threat that}} mines in the surf zone (ten foot curve to the high water mark) pose to Operational Maneuver From The Sea. Additionally, problems presented by minefields beginning at the high water mark and extending inland are reviewed. Effectiveness of notional minefields consisting of tilt rod and pressure <b>fused</b> anti-tank <b>mines</b> are modeled as a planar Poisson process. The delivery of the assault echelon (a Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward)) by landing craft is modeled as a simple circular flow process. Three methods for overcoming the minefields are developed and compared using five measures of effectiveness. A decision criteria for breaching a minefield by bulling through is offered. A breaching concept using fuel air explosives and a unique mine rake are presented. The thesis concludes that development of the 'Blast, Rake, Breach' concept should be pursued. NANAU. S.

50|$|Strung {{along the}} submarine's {{gunwales}} were two parallel sets of demagnetization cables, {{running from the}} stern to the bow planes. These were intended to dissipate the static charge that normally builds up when a boat's hull slices through the water, causing the steel in the hull to deteriorate over time. They were also meant to protect against magnetic mines, by nullifying the magnetic field which normally triggers the <b>mines</b> <b>fusing</b> system. A similar demagnetizing system was carried on many Japanese surface ships during {{the first part of}} the war, until they were later removed during refitting.|$|R
5000|$|Researcher Jacques Vallée {{describes}} a procedure on board , which was docked alongside the Eldridge in 1943.

This system was invented by a Canadian, Charles F.

British ships of the era often included such degaussing systems built into the upper decks (the conduits are still visible on the deck of [...] in London, for example). Degaussing is still used today. However, it has no effect on visible light or radar.

50|$|Electricity {{was then}} considered. The <b>fuses</b> within the <b>mine</b> did not blow, but {{evidence}} from the colliery electrician mentioned a previous occasion when sparking had burnt through a cable and not blown the fuses. Dr W M Thornton, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Armstrong College was then called as a witness. He considered three causes but settled on one in particular as the most likely; that a train of coal dust between the terminals of a junction box or switch causes arcing between the terminals which ignited the coal dust causing an explosion within the box. This explosion raised enough dust to trigger a bigger, fatal, explosion which spread throughout the mine.|$|R

50|$|The mine {{consists}} of a cylindrical steel main body containing a 60 millimeter mortar shell body (originally the M49A2), linked to a tall thin fuze stand. The fuze stand held either a pin based tripwire fuze or a combination pressure tripwire fuze with a pronged pressure cap. Later fuzes were sensitive to pressure or pull and could be used with a tripwire. When the mine is triggered a black powder charge launches the mortar shell out of {{the main body of}} the mine and into the air.

40|$|Infrared imagers {{are capable}} of the {{detection}} of surface laid <b>mines.</b> Several sensor <b>fused</b> land <b>mine</b> detection systems make use of metal detectors, ground penetrating radar and infrared imagers. Infrared detection systems are sensitive to apparent temperature contrasts and their detection capabilities are inversely proportional {{to the amount of}} background clutter generated by local surface non-uniformities. This may result in spurious detections, or even cancellation of true detections in a post classification process. Sub-surface mines can be detected when buried not too deeply. Furthermore, soil type and soil water content will influence the detection result. For this reason experiments in various soil types, including vegetation, and soil circumstances are essential for understanding and improving the infrared detection capabilities. We have performed outdoor experiments with different types of soil and weather conditions. Several examples are described and analyzed. Data analysis shows the strong correlation of apparent temperature with thermocouple gradients and solar energy, as well as a correlation of local standard deviation with these parameters. Model based temperature contrasts are predicted for several mines in sandy soils, and these are compared with infrared imaging apparent temperature measurements and thermocouple data. The comparison results are quite good but also show the complexity of the thermal infrared data, in particular due to infrared clutter, diurnal variations, and sky reflectance contributions. Model predictions are made for the application of active heating methods also. Limitations of the model and potential future expansions based on evaluation of experiments are discussed.
