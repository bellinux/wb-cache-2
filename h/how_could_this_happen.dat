After all, despite an estimated annual budget of $ 35 billion to $ 40 billion and many thousands of dedicated and bright employees using all the most sophisticated technologies available to the richest country on earth, the U.

40|$|In {{his book}} "Educational Pessimism" the {{sociologist}} J. TWARDELLA analyses a single German lesson in grade 10 of a Hauptschule (secondary school) class of disadvantaged students. The lesson begins well—with "a beautiful morning," {{according to the}} transcript—but soon becomes disastrous. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen?</b> TWARDELLA's detailed analysis shows {{that the relationship between}} the teacher and the students as well as between the teacher and her profession is disturbed and contradicted. On the one hand, the instruction is characterized by a negative anthropology of the student, an educational pessimism. On the other hand, the teacher is optimistic and believes in action-oriented instruction as the solution to the problem. Ultimately, it becomes evident that this abysmal combination is like an irreversible ideology based on a self-fulfilling prophecy and at the end there is only the maintenance of the status quo—no matter how senseless it is.

40|$|Opponents of the {{emissions}} trading scheme within the Coalition have {{embarked on a}} high-risk strategy, writes Norman Abjorensen in Inside Story TWO YEARS AGO the Liberal Party, dazed by defeat, suddenly roused itself. A usurper had stepped forward to grasp the leadership. With John Howard and Peter Costello both {{out of the equation}} and Tony Abbott lacking the numbers, Malcolm Turnbull was clearly the frontrunner in the confused aftermath of defeat. But there was enough anti-Turnbull sentiment to settle on a compromise candidate, the lacklustre Brendan Nelson, who managed to hold off the Turnbull challenge. The new leader ran to form, the Liberals languished in the polls, and Nelson was duly replaced by Turnbull, who had either won a few supporters or neutralised a few opponents during that unhappy period. A year later and the anti-Turnbull forces have not only regrouped, they have recruited in earnest; the party leader finding himself in a tiny minority faction as a burgeoning coalition of forces lines up against him. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen?</b> [...] .
