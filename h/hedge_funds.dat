5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million per annum. The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to <b>hedge</b> <b>funds.</b> Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means.

40|$|Defining {{contagion}} as correlation {{over and}} above that expected from economic funda-mentals, we find strong evidence of worst return contagion across <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> styles for 1990 to 2008. Large adverse shocks to asset and <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> liquidity strongly increase the probability of contagion. Specifically, large adverse shocks to credit spreads, the TED spread, prime broker and bank stock prices, stock market liquidity, and <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> flows {{are associated with a}} significant increase in the probability of <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> contagion. While shocks to liquidity are important determinants of performance, these shocks are not captured by commonly used models of <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> returns.

Finally, we examine whether extreme poor performance in the stock, bond, and currency markets is more likely when contagion in the <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> sector is high. We find no evidence that contagion in the <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> sector is associated with extreme poor performance in the stock and bond markets, but find significant evidence that performance in the currency market is worse when <b>hedge</b> <b>fund</b> contagion is high, consistent with the effects of an unwinding of carry trades. ...|$|R
