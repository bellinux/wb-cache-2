5000|$|Adiadochokinesia is a {{dyskinesia}} {{consisting of}} inability {{to perform the}} rapid alternating movements of <b>diadochokinesia.</b> Called also adiadochocinesia, adiadochokinesis, and adiadokokinesia.|$|E
5000|$|Dysdiadochokinesia, dysdiadochokinesis, dysdiadokokinesia, dysdiadokokinesis (from Greek δυς dys [...] "bad", διάδοχος diadochos [...] "succeeding", κίνησις kinesis [...] "movement"), often {{abbreviated}} as DDK, is {{the medical}} term for an impaired {{ability to perform}} rapid, alternating movements (i.e., <b>diadochokinesia).</b> Complete inability is called adiadochokinesia.|$|E
50|$|Abnormalities in <b>diadochokinesia</b> {{can be seen}} in {{the upper}} {{extremity}}, lower extremity and in speech. The deficits become visible in the rate of alternation, the completeness of the sequence, and in the variation in amplitude involving both motor coordination and sequencing. Average rate can be used as a measure of performance when testing for dysdiadochokinesia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diadochokinesia</b> or diadochokinesis is {{the ability}} to make {{antagonistic}} movements in quick succession, alternately bringing a limb into opposite positions, as of flexion and extension or of pronation and supination. Speech-language pathology defines it as the speed necessary to stop a determined motor impulse and substitute it with its opposite. The relative timing of this kind of movements is also called alternate motion rates (AMR) or sequential motor rates (SMR).|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Executive {{function}} deficits {{are observed}} {{in people with}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) from early stages and have great impact on daily living activities. Verbal fluency and oral <b>diadochokinesia</b> involve phonarticulatory coordination, response inhibition, and phonological processing and may also be affected in people with PD. This study aimed to describe the performance of PD patients and an age- and education-matched control group on executive function, verbal fluency, and oral <b>diadochokinesia</b> tests and to investigate possible relationships between them. Methods. Forty people with PD and forty controls were evaluated with Trail Making Test (TMT, executive function) and phonemic/semantic verbal fluency and oral <b>diadochokinesia</b> (/pataka/) tests. Groups were compared by ANOVA and relationships were investigated by Pearson tests. Results. People with PD showed longer times in parts A and B of TMT. They also said fewer words in phonemic/semantic verbal fluency tests and less syllables in the <b>diadochokinesia</b> test. Oral <b>diadochokinesia</b> strongly correlated to parts A and B of TMT and to phonemic verbal fluency. Conclusion. Oral <b>diadochokinesia</b> was correlated to executive function and verbal fluency. The cognitive-motor interaction in verbal fluency and oral <b>diadochokinesia</b> must be considered not to overestimate the cognitive or motor impairments in people with PD...|$|E

40|$|Several {{assumptions}} about {{the function of the}} cerebellum and semiotic signs have been described over the centuries. Among the long list of famous researchers who have provided a strong contribution and who have left their names on the highway of cerebellar research, Joseph Babinski appears as a prominent name. The description of various forms of cerebellar symptomatology was a major part of Babinski's work, and clinical terms that he introduced, namely hypermetry, <b>diadochokinesia,</b> and asynergy, remain part of contemporary clinical vocabulary. Babinski studied cerebellar signs in many patients and was able to conduct longitudinal studies that permitted him to understand the evolution of cerebellar dysfunction.

40|$|Hereditary ataxia, or motor incoordination, affects {{approximately}} 150, 000 Americans {{and hundreds}} of thousands of individuals worldwide with onset from as early as mid-childhood. Affected individuals exhibit dysarthria, dysmetria, action tremor, and <b>diadochokinesia.</b> In this review, we consider an array of computational studies derived from experimental observations relevant to human neuropathology. A survey of related studies illustrates the impact of integrating clinical evidence with data from mouse models and computational simulations. Results from these studies may help explain findings in mice, and after extensive laboratory study, may ultimately be translated to ataxic individuals. This inquiry lays a foundation for using computation to understand neurobiochemical and electrophysiological pathophysiology of spinocerebellar ataxias and may contribute to development of therapeutics. The interdisciplinary analysis suggests that computational neurobiology can be an important tool for translational neurology...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{associated}} with pathologically altered oscillatory activity. While synchronized oscillations between 13 and 30 Hz are increased within a cortico-subcortical network, cortico-muscular coupling is decreased. The present study aims at investigating the effect of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of the primary motor cortex (M 1) on motor symptoms and motor-cortical oscillations in PD. In 10 PD patients and 10 healthy control subjects, static isometric contraction, dynamic fast finger tapping and <b>diadochokinesia</b> of the more severely affected hand were investigated prior to and shortly after tACS of the contralateral M 1 at 10 Hz vs. 20 Hz vs. sham. During isometric contraction, neuromagnetic activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography. 20 Hz tACS attenuated beta band cortico-muscular coupling during isometric contraction and amplitude variability during finger tapping in PD patients but not in healthy control subjects. 10 Hz tACS yielded no significant after-effects. The present data suggest that PD {{is associated}} with pathophysiological alterations which abet a higher responsiveness towards frequency-specific tACS – possibly due to pathologically altered motor-cortical oscillatory synchronization at frequencies between 13 and 30 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Expectation {{contributes}} to placebo and nocebo responses in Parkinson’s disease (PD). While {{there is evidence}} for expectation-induced modulations of bradykinesia, {{little is known about}} the impact of expectation on resting tremor. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves cardinal PD motor symptoms including tremor whereas impairment of verbal fluency (VF) has been observed as a potential side-effect. Here we investigated how expectation modulates the effect of STN-DBS on resting tremor and its interaction with VF. In a within-subject-design, expectation of 24 tremor-dominant PD patients regarding the impact of STN-DBS on motor symptoms was manipulated by verbal suggestions (positive [placebo], negative [nocebo], neutral [control]). Patients participated with (MedON) and without (MedOFF) antiparkinsonian medication. Resting tremor was recorded by accelerometry and bradykinesia of finger tapping and <b>diadochokinesia</b> were assessed by a 3 D ultrasound motion detection system. VF was quantified by lexical and semantic tests. In a subgroup of patients, the effect of STN-DBS on tremor was modulated by expectation, i. e. tremor decreased (placebo response) or increased (nocebo response) by at least 10 % as compared to the control condition while no significant effect was observed for the overall group. Interestingly, nocebo responders in MedON were additionally characterized by significant impairment in semantic verbal fluency. In contrast, bradykinesia was not affected by expectation. These results indicate that the therapeutic effect of STN-DBS on tremor can be modulated by expectation in...|$|E
40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and {{freezing}} of gait (FOG) (freezers) demonstrate high gait variability. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine whether freezers display a higher variability of upper limb movements and elucidate if these changes correlate with gait. We were the first group to compare directly objectively measured gait and upper limb movement variability of freezers between freezing episodes. Patients with objectively verified FOG (n = 11) and PD patients without FOG (non-freezers) (n = 11) in a non-randomized medication condition (OFF/ON) were analyzed. Uncued antiphasic finger tapping and forearm diadochokinetic movements were analyzed via three-dimensional ultrasound kinematic measurements. Gait variability of straight gait was assessed using ground reaction forces. Freezers had shorter stride length (p = 0. 004) and higher stride length variability (p = 0. 005) in the medication OFF condition. Movement variability was not different during finger tapping or <b>diadochokinesia</b> between the groups. There was a trend towards more freezing of the upper limb during finger tapping for the freezers (p = 0. 07). Variability in stride length generation and stride timing was not associated with variability of upper limb movement in freezers. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) freezers have a higher spatial gait variability between freezing episodes; (2) freezing-like episodes of the upper limb occur in PD patients, and tend to be more pronounced among freezers than non-freezers for finger tapping; (3) spatial and temporal upper extremity variability is equally affected in freezers and non-freezers in an uncued task. Upper limb freezing is not correlated to lower limb freezing, implicating a different pathophysiology...|$|E

MÉTODO: cento e setenta e seis crianças, de 6 a 12 anos de idade, passaram por avaliação miofuncional orofacial, empregando o protocolo com escores, e os responsáveis foram entrevistados a respeito do aleitamento e hábitos de sucção de suas crianças. As correlações foram calculadas pelo teste de Spearman. RESULTADOS: na amostra estudada, a média de duração do aleitamento natural foi de 10, 30 meses (variando de zero a 60 meses), do aleitamento artificial 44, 12 (zero a 122 meses) e dos hábitos de sucção de 39, 32 meses (zero a 144 meses). Houve correlação negativa da duração do aleitamento natural com a duração do aleitamento artificial e a duração dos hábitos de sucção (p BACKGROUND: {{the development}} of oral motor control depends partially on motor and sensory experiences. AIM: to analyze {{the relationship between the}} duration of breastfeeding, artificial feeding and sucking habits, and of these parameters with the orofacial motor performance. METHOD: participants of this study were one hundred and seventy-six children aged 6 to 12 years. All subjects were submitted to an orofacial myofunctional clinical examination, using a protocol with scores, and parents/care takers were interviewed in respect to the feeding and sucking habits of their children. Correlations were calculated using the Spearman Test. RESULTS: in the studied sample, the mean duration of breastfeeding was of 10. 30 months (ranging from zero to 60 months), of artificial feeding was of 44. 12 months (zero to 122 months) and of sucking habits was of 39. 32 months (0 to 144 months). There was a negative correlation of breastfeeding duration with artificial feeding duration and sucking habits duration (p < 0001). The duration of the artificial feeding was positively correlated to the duration of sucking habits (p < 0001). The duration of breastfeeding was positively correlated with the mobility of the tongue and jaw (p = 0. 05).

OBJETIVO: identificar o perfil {{familial}} da fluência da fala - aspectos linguísticos, eletromiográficos e acústicos - em crianças com e sem história familiar próxima para a gagueira. MÉTODO: participaram do estudo 127 indivíduos, 32 crianças (probandos) e 95 membros da família imediata (pai, mãe, irmãs e irmãos) divididos em dois grupos: GI (CCG) : 17 probandos com diagnóstico de gagueira; 17 pais, 17 mães, 10 irmãos e 13 irmãs; e GII (CSG) : 15 probandos fluentes; 15 pais, 15 mães, 0 irmãos e 8 irmãs. Todos os procedimentos de testagem foram aplicados em todos os participantes: 1. Coleta das tipologias das rupturas; 2. Coleta eletromiográfica; 3. Coleta acústica. RESULTADOS: foi encontrado o percentual de 41, 1 % de mães afetadas; 35, 3 % de pais afetados; 16, 7 % de irmãs afetadas e 40 % de irmãos afetados. Foi observada similaridade na tipologia das rupturas da fala em todos os afetados de uma mesma família, mesmo havendo uma tendência a maior gravidade do distúrbio nos probandos. Foi encontrada similaridade na ativação muscular para as taxas de diadococinesia em todos os afetados de uma mesma família. Sugere-se um padrão motor para a fala, numa relação passível de ser mensurada pala captação da ativação muscular periférica, dentro de uma mesma família. Foi encontrada similaridade na variação acústica para as taxas de diadococinesia em todos os afetados de uma mesma família. CONCLUSÃO: esta pesquisa se caracteriza como uma primeira proposta de estudo endofenotípico da gagueira, em dois aspectos: critérios objetivos de inclusão e tipo de sintomatologia manifesta da gagueira. BACKGROUND: genetic {{factors as}} a possible cause of stuttering. AIM: to identify the speech fluency family profile (linguistic, electromyographic and acoustic aspects) in children with and without a close family history of stuttering. METHOD: the study included a total of 127 individuals, 32 children (probands) and 95 members of the immediate family (father, mother, sisters and brothers). The individuals were divided in two groups: GI (SC) was composed of 17 probands with a diagnosis of stuttering, 17 fathers, 17 mothers, 10 brothers, and 13 sisters, and GII (NSC) was composed of 15 fluent probands, 15 fathers, 15 mothers, no brothers, and 8 sisters. All testing procedures were applied to all participants as follows: 1) identification of disruption typology; 2) electromyographic analyses; and 3) acoustic analyses. RESULTS: the percentage of affected mothers was 41. 1 %, {{and the percentage of}} affected fathers was 35. 3 %. In addition, the percentage of affected sisters was 6. 7 %, and 40 % of the brothers were affected. Similarity was observed in the typology of speech disruptions in all of the affected individuals of the same family; however, a trend towards a greater severity of the disorder in probands was observed. Similarity was found in muscle activation for <b>diadochokinesia</b> rates in all the affected individuals in the same family. This suggests the existence of a speech motor pattern within the same family that can be measured by capturing peripheral muscle activation. Similarity was found in the acoustic variation for diadochokinetic rates in all affected individuals of the same family. CONCLUSION: this study represents one of the first endophenotypic research proposals on stuttering characterized by two aspects: objective inclusion criteria and the type of stuttering symptomatology manifested...|$|E
