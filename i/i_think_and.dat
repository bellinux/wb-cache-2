I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

Prior to the song's radio release, Carey spoke of it in an interview: [...] "It's pretty much [...] the classic style of my up-tempo classics like 'Fantasy' or 'Dreamlover,' [...] But it's kind of fun and has a new edge to it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>and</b> definitely having Jay-Z takes it to a whole 'nother level.

500|$|The {{music on}} Escape, in {{particular}} [...] "Five Minutes of Funk", was {{originally intended to}} be rock-oriented, with Hutchins suggesting that the song {{would be similar to}} the [...] "rawer" [...] work of groups such as The Isley Brothers. Whodini had planned to use a Minimoog synthesizer on the track, although Smith left his at home, assuming that he could find one in the UK. Unable to locate one, the group then heard Run–D.M.C.'s [...] "Rock Box" [...] and decided to follow a more R direction. Smith said that although he was told by Jive Records to make the album sound like Run–D.M.C., he [...] "didn't want to do exactly that. Whodini's a bit more adult, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>and</b> rap's not just for kids anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|On why {{he chose}} to return to television, Scorsese said [...] "What's {{happening}} the past 9 to 10 years, particularly at HBO, is what we had hoped for in the mid-Sixties with films being made for television at first. We'd hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also {{the ability to create}} another world and create longform characters and story. That didn't happen in the 1970s, 1980s and in the 1990s <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>And</b> of course ...HBO is a trailblazer in this. I've been tempted over the years to be involved with them {{because of the nature of}} long-form and their development of character and plot." [...] He went on to praise network HBO by saying, [...] "A number of the episodes, in so many of their series, they're thoughtful, intelligent [...] brilliantly put together... It's a new opportunity for storytelling. It's very different from television of the past." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding Bell's {{influence}} on Anna, director Chris Buck said her personality {{was just so}} fun and energetic. [...] "We had an Anna character but Kristen really came in and pushed it and made it even funnier and even sweeter <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>and</b> more believable as a three-dimensional character," [...] he said. He also admitted that he [...] "fell in love with 's voice and 's spirit". Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that girls could be funny. [...] "So she was a fantastic collaborator," [...] Lee added. [...] Songwriting duo Kristen-Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez later commented that they had written a lot of first songs for Kristen, for Anna but, [...] "The more we were working with Kristen Bell, the more, the more she influenced." [...] They quickly understand who Anna was because Anna's Kristen Bell.|$|E

500|$|Yeats had {{a life-long}} {{interest}} in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read {{extensively on the}} subjects throughout his life, {{became a member of}} the paranormal research organisation [...] "The Ghost Club" [...] (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892, he wrote: [...] "If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> all that I write." [...] His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats's work; W. H. Auden called it the [...] "deplorable spectacle of a grown man occupied with the mumbo-jumbo of magic and the nonsense of India." ...|$|E

2500|$|Through the years, {{the lyrics}} became more personal.

When asked about the possibility of recording an album in English, Juanes responded, [...] "singing in Spanish is very important because it's the language in which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> feel.

[...] Alyse Whitney of Wetpaint praised the beginning scene with Emma giving birth, saying [...] "the one standout moment was in the first minutes, showcasing Jennifer Morrison’s best acting to date. As Emma gave birth to Henry — and the electricity flickered, which could be a hint at her magic — and then refused to see him since she [...] "can’t be a mother," [...] our hearts sank. It was an emotional way to kick things off, but was the perfect way to show how far she’s come as she heads to save Henry with everyone on the Jolly Roger." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2012, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{shows in the}} United States and Europe, titled the Up Close and Personal Tour.

All of the North American shows took place in smaller-scale clubs, rather than a large arena or stadium. All pyrotechnics were removed from the shows. The European leg of the tour began approximately one month after the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitarist DJ Ashba discussed a potential follow up to Chinese Democracy in a 2012 interview, stating [...] "I've written and demoed up probably about 12 songs, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>And</b> some of them [...] has heard, some of them he hasn't yet.

My wife and I took advantage of this plan to have two children.

2500|$|In July 1999 at {{the height}} of Emin's Turner Prize fame, she created a number of monoprint {{drawings}} inspired by the public and private life of Princess Diana for a themed exhibition called Temple of Diana held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as They Wanted You To Be Destroyed (1999) related to Princess Diana's bulimia eating disorder, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as Love Was on Your Side and a description of Princess Diana's dress with puffy sleeves. Other drawings highlighted The things you did to help other people written next to a drawing by Emin of Diana, Princess of Wales in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase [...] "It makes perfect sence to know they killed you" [...] (with Emin's trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they [...] "could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings" [...] and [...] "It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They're quite sentimental <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>and</b> feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E
