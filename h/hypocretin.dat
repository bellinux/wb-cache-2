40|$|AbstractIn the postero-lateral {{hypothalamus}} {{are located}} two neuronal systems that utilize the neuropeptides melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and <b>hypocretins</b> (also called orexins) as neuromodulators. These systems have reciprocal connections between them, and project throughout {{the central nervous}} system. MCH {{has been involved in}} the generation of sleep, mainly REM sleep, while <b>hypocretins</b> have a critical role in the generation of wakefulness. MCHergic activity is also involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MD). In this regards, intracerebral administration of MCH promotes pro-depressive behaviors (i. e., immobility in the forced swimming test) and REM sleep hypersomnia, which is an important trait of depression. Furthermore, the antagonism of the MCHR- 1 receptor has a reliable antidepressant effect, suggesting that MCH is a pro-depressive factor. <b>Hypocretins</b> have been also involved in mood regulation; however, their role in depression is still on debate. Taking these data into account, we explored whether systemic subchronical treatment with Fluoxetine (FLX), a serotonergic antidepressant, modifies the concentration of MCH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as the preproMCH mRNA expression. We also evaluated the hypocretinergic system by quantifying the hypocretin-levels in the CSF and the preprohypocretin mRNA expression. Compared to control, FLX increased the levels of preprohypocretin mRNA without affecting the hypocretin- 1 CSF levels. On the contrary, FLX significantly decreased the MCH CSF concentration without affecting the preproMCH gene expression. This result is in agreement with the fact that MCH serum level diminishes during the antidepressant treatment in MD, and supports the hypothesis that an increase in the MCHergic activity could have pro-depressive consequences...|$|R
40|$|AbstractöThe <b>hypocretins</b> (orexins) are a newly identi¢ed peptide family {{comprised}} of two peptides, hypocretin- 1 and hypocretin- 2. Recent observations suggest an involvement of these peptides {{in the regulation}} of behavioral state. For example, these peptides are found {{in a variety of}} brain regions associated with the regulation of forebrain neuronal and behavioral activity states. Furthermore, when infused into the lateral ventricles in awake animals, hypocretin- 1 elicits increased duration of waking beyond that observed in vehicle-treated animals. Previous studies have been limited to an examination of the sleep^wake e¡ects of hypocretin- 1 in awake animals. Currently, the sleep^wake e¡ects of hypocretin- 2 {{and the extent to which}} <b>hypocretins</b> can initiate waking in the sleeping animal remain unclear. To better characterize the wake-promoting actions of the <b>hypocretins,</b> the current studies examined the sleep^wake e¡ects of varying doses (0. 007, 0. 07 and 0. 7 nmol) of hypocretin- 1 and hypocretin- 2 when administered into sleeping rats (e. g. remote-controlled infusions). Infusions of hypocretin- 1 and hypocretin- 2 into the lateral ventricles elicited a short latency (0. 7 nmol hypocretin- 1; 93 þ 30 s from the start of the 120 -s infusion) increase in electroencephalographic, electromyographic, and behavioral indices of waking. These infusions also produced substantial decreases in slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep. Hypocretin- 1 was more potent than hypocretin- 2 in these actions. Interestingly, hypocretin- 1 infused into the fourth ventricle elicited less robust waking which occurred with a longer latency than infusions into the lateral ventricles. These latter observations suggest a forebrain site of action participates in hypocretin- 1 -induced waking...|$|R

40|$|Hypocretin- 1 and - 2 (Hcrt- 1 and Hcrt- 2), also {{referred}} to as orexin-A and -B, are neuropeptides synthesized by a few thousand neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Hypocretin-containing neurons project throughout the brain, with a prominent input to basal forebrain structures involved in motivation, reward, and stress. However, the role of <b>hypocretins</b> in addiction-related behaviors remains largely unexplored. Here we show that intracerebroventricular infusions of Hcrt- 1 lead to a dose-related reinstatement of cocaine seeking without altering cocaine intake in rats. Hcrt- 1 also dramatically elevates intracranial self-stimulation thresholds, indicating that, unlike treatments with reinforcing properties such as cocaine, Hcrt- 1 negatively regulates the activity of brain reward circuitries. Hypocretin-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking was prevented by blockade of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing factor systems, suggesting that Hcrt- 1 reinstated drug seeking through induction of a stress-like state. Consistent with this interpretation, the selective Hcrt- 1 receptor antagonist SB- 334867 blocked footshock-induced reinstatement of previously extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior.

We examined the daily temporal pattern of hypocretin- 1 in the cisternal CSF of the squirrel monkey, a New World primate with a pattern of wake similar to that of humans. Hypocretin- 1 levels peaked in the latter third of the day, consistent with the premise that hypocretin- 1 is involved in wake regulation. When we lengthened the wake period by 4 hr, hypocretin- 1 concentrations remained elevated, indicating a circadian-independent component to hypocretin- 1 regulation.

Exercise (or physical activity) is the most powerful way of challenging the internal homeostatic process. This study examines the circadian differences in response to forced activity and homeostatic challenges on hypocretin- 1 (Hcrt- 1) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats. Hcrt- 1 levels were decreased after long-term immobilization at the end of active phase (zeigeber time- 0, ZT- 0) and increased after short-term forced swimming in the rest phase (ZT- 8). Nevertheless, no effects were observed after short-term immobilization, total sleep deprivation or cold exposure. We concluded that despite the relation between <b>hypocretins,</b> stress and sleep regulation reported in the literature, short-term total sleep deprivation, immobilization and cold exposure did not induce increases in CSF Hcrt- 1 levels at ZT- 0 and ZT- 8. On the other hand, the relationship between hypocretinergic system activation and motor activation is reinforced by decrease in Hcr- 1 levels after long-term immobilization at ZT- 0 and its increased levels after short-term forced swimming at ZT- 8 in CSF of rats.
