He pressed for greater use of active day-time tactical training rather than evening indoors drill, which he felt was key for a part-time volunteer force, and for a greater emphasis on the training and standards of officers.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{with the}} topic: "Leisure time {{activities in the}} Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> as prevention of the immobilization syndrome" {{is divided into two}} sections - theoretical and practical. In the theoretical section the terms relating to old age and types of leisure time activities offered by the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> are described. In the thesis conclusion I describe the immobilization syndrome also occurring in the elderly. Recently, there has been a large increase in senior population, and many senior people have been trying to keep active. Even when they are in Homes <b>for</b> <b>seniors,</b> they still try to find some stimulating activities that can bring joy to their lives. In the practical section I describe my survey research and its results and the answers to the research questions. The survey was carried out in the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> in Pacov, using a qualitative method of investigation by semi-structured interviews. The interviews were conducted with 6 nurses working in the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> and with 7 clients of the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> in Pacov. First of all, we set two goals that we wanted to achieve. The first goal was to find out the influence of leisure time activities on the immobilization syndrome, the second one was to give an account {{of the ways in which}} leisure time activities are offered to seniors, and to check whether seniors make use of those opportunities. To meet these targets, we stated the following research questions: How the offered leisure time activities in the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> affect the immobilization syndrome development in seniors? What leisure time activities are offered by the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors?</b> What leisure time activities are used most by seniors? The research questions were answered in the interviews which revealed that in the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> the activities most used by clients are ergotherapy and group exercises. The clients taking part in leisure time activities feel themselves in a good condition and are happy that such activities are available in the Home. The activities are also welcome by the nurses in the Home <b>for</b> <b>seniors,</b> because the elderly feel relaxed, are happier and the nurses have less work to do when clients are in a good physical and mental condition. The output of this work is represented by a booklet which was created to serve other Homes <b>for</b> <b>seniors</b> as information on leisure time activities <b>for</b> <b>seniors...</b>|$|R

However, further promotion was checked by his having come into conflict with his commander-in-chief, who regarded him as unsuited <b>for</b> <b>senior</b> command {{in part because of}} his writings; Pilcher was a keen student of the German army and its operational methods, and an active theorist who published a number of controversial books advocating the adoption of new military techniques as well as an anonymous invasion novel.|$|E

All the divisions expanded during 1943 and 1944, but T Division, despite trebling in size, remained the smallest, while E Division grew to be the largest. Security clearance was a problem. Scientists (including, at first, Oppenheimer) had to be given access to the Technical Area without proper clearance. In the interest of efficiency, Groves approved an abbreviated process by which Oppenheimer vouched <b>for</b> <b>senior</b> scientists, and three other employees were sufficient to vouch for a junior scientist or technician.|$|E
