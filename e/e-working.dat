This paper conceptualises the new <b>e-working</b> practices adopted by 'lead users' through grounded theory analysis. The findings suggest that lead users have adopted five different types of <b>e-working</b> strategies to help them optimise their work and travel efficiency. This study also found several barriers, such as organisational culture and employee preferences, which may reduce <b>e-working.</b> The authors hope that by conceptualising the various types of <b>e-working</b> practices, they will provide researchers and practitioners with the clarity needed to apply these concepts to their research work...|$|E

40|$|Work-life balance {{has been}} widely {{researched}} and many validated scales measuring the interaction between work and non-working lives currently exist. However, existing work-life balance scales {{are not related to}} applied actions or interventions and have not been linked to the emerging impact of <b>e-working.</b> <b>E-working</b> is now on the increase with forecasts for growth into the trillions worldwide by 2012. Whilst <b>e-working</b> has been linked to productivity gains, the impact of <b>e-working</b> on employees well-being and work-life balance has not been measured in depth. The purpose of this research was to develop a unique E-Work-life balance scale, with suggested ‘actionable’, applied interventions for individuals, supervisors and organisations, which would improve their <b>e-working</b> capability. The research also gathered self reports of job effectiveness within the new scale and of well-being using an existing well-being scale (SF 36 v 2). Over 250 e-workers took part in the research, across five studies, both qualitative and quantitative data was collected. The research found that remote technology provided the ability to manage work-life balance for many participants. Whilst the scales found a high degree of positivity for <b>e-working,</b> negative aspects also emerged, including over-working. Well-being was reported as good amongst the e-workers, however, there were signs of tiredness and burn out amongst some of the sample. Gender differences were explored but not found to be significant in these studies. Other demographic variables such as number of dependants were also not found to be significant. However, role autonomy and role type were found to be important when considering <b>e-working</b> job effectiveness. The classical method was used to develop the E-Work life scale which involved interviews, sorting methods, item reduction, checks for reliability, validity and factor analysis. The study was completed in three phases. Phase one reviewed research on existing work-life balance measures and conducted eleven interviews with exemplar e-workers across five different organisations, and three sectors. Findings showed differences in the types of e-workers, their access to technology, ability to work flexibly and individual competencies. Ten themes emerged from thematic analysis including, trust, management style, individual attributes and autonomy over workload. Phase two conducted an on-line survey testing the E-Work life scales, alongside an existing well-being scale. Over 250 <b>e-working</b> participants across 11 organisations and three sectors took part. Principal Component Analysis was completed to explore the dimensionality. Factor analysis supported items clustering into seven factors after item reduction, not all items in the sub-scales related to the postulated dimensions and further work would be required to demonstrate these links. Reliability of the E-Work life scale using Cronbach’s alpha was found to be 0. 8 after item reduction. Items were checked for face, content and criterion validity. A final uni-dimensional scale was produced containing 28 items. Phase three provided a set of suggested interventions that related directly to the scale, these were developed and tested through qualitative interviews with ten expert e-workers. Findings from framework analysis of the interviews indicated that to curb the negative affects of <b>e-working,</b> an organisational culture based on rewarding outputs as opposed to presenteeism would be beneficial. Autonomy to manage workload and management style were found to be important indicators. The E-Work life scale presents a unique contribution to research and practice by drawing together the impact of the two related topics of <b>e-working</b> and work-life balance. The scale is relevant to both employees and employers to improve their <b>e-working</b> capabilities. The scale included measures of job effectiveness and well-being further adding a new contribution to research in work-life balance. The scale forms part of a developing consultancy tool which will be commercially viable. Further testing of the scale and postulated dimensions is required on diverse <b>e-working</b> samples to complete Confirmatory Factor Analysis and to develop norms. Further studies could focus on developing competencies for e-workers continuing to develop the e-worker classification which emerged from this research. Other future studies could build on findings investigating in more depth the mental health of e-workers...|$|E
40|$|This book {{is devoted}} to a {{theoretical}} conceptualisation of the e-society. The e-society is a society where e-technologies are so fully integrated into the fabrics of the society that their use no longer entails major household decisions. It is a multi-dimensional phenomenon reflected in the mindsets and lifestyles of the people. Four key domains of an e-society, that is, e-government, e-commerce, <b>e-working</b> and e-networking, are systematically addressed. Then, a conceptual framework on the Stages of E-development is proposed to allow readers {{to have a better}} understanding of the current stage of e-development in their societies, and to facilitate policy-makers to make better decisions in supporting the emergence of e-societies...|$|E
30|$|The {{new media}} play an immense role in global education. In {{knowledge}} society and knowledge-based economy, {{knowledge and skills}} of citizens are becoming increasingly important. Under this perspective, a new paradigm of personalized on-demand learning emerges, where anyone, anytime, anywhere delivery of education and training is adapted to specific requirements and preferences of each individual citizen within different e-learning and <b>e-working</b> settings. When organizations (e.g., firms, universities, research laboratories, suppliers, and customers) become allies in partnership, a new platform for learning is added—the inter-organizational one. When organizations begin to adapt to larger networks, platforms for learning multiply. Virtual organizations are systems of networking partners who coordinate their activities through shared missions, visions, values, projects, and products.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{holistic}} analytical framework for tracing {{and understanding the}} progress of e-development is developed and adopted in an empirical case study of China’s e-development since 1998. In particular, the progress is analyzed systematically by benchmarking various ICT infrastructure and e-devices, the composition of Internet users, and the key dimensions of e-government, <b>e-working,</b> e-commerce, and e-networking. In addition, the questions of whether the geographical digital divide in {{the country has been}} narrowed is examined. Our findings show that (1) China has made noticeable progress in the e-development since 1998; yet, progress varied in different dimensions; (2) based on the overall performance, 2004 can be considered as the watershed for China to move from the formative stage to the developmental stage; (3) during the e-development, digital disparities in China have dramatically decreased at the provincial level, however, the urban-rural digital gap widened. We suggest that other than promoting affordable ICT possession, the wider and more diversified e-applications for different walks of life will be important for China to move towards the mature stage...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impact of remote <b>e-working</b> on the key {{research}} areas of work-life balance, job effectiveness and well-being. The study provides a set of generalisable themes drawn from the key research areas, including building trust, management style and the quality of work and non-working life. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is an exploratory study into the psychological factors affecting remote e-workers using qualitative thematic analysis of eleven in-depth interviews with e-workers, across five organisations and three sectors. All participants worked remotely using technology independent of time and location for several years and considered themselves to be experts. Findings: The paper provides insights into the diverse factors affecting remote e-workers and produces ten emerging themes. Differentiating factors between e-workers included access to technology, ability to work flexibly and individual competencies. Adverse impacts were found on well-being, due to over-working and a lack of time for recuperation. Trust and management style were found to be key influences on e-worker effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: Because of the exploratory nature of the research and approach the research requires further testing for generalisability. The emerging themes could be used to develop a wide-scale survey of e-workers, whereby the themes would be further validated. Practical implications: Practical working examples are provided by the e-workers and those who also manage e-workers based on the ten emerging themes. Originality/value: This paper identifies a number of generalisable themes that can be used to inform the psychological factors affecting remote e-worker effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Rapid {{developments}} {{in the field of}} information communication technology (ICT) mean that <b>e-working</b> has become increasingly common and prolonged – the “always-on-culture” potential to enhance work-life balance via increased flexibility in terms of time and location, as well as posing the risk of being ‘always on’ has been identified with potentially serious implications for the health and performance of employees. We identify a research agenda and review current organizational practice. Approach: We discuss current technological developments as well as prevalent research frameworks and terminology in the domain of work-life balance and beyond to evaluate their fitness for purpose. We also report findings from a survey of 374 employees working within UK businesses about current organisational practice. Findings: Over half of the organisations sampled do not have clear guidance regarding work-life balance and supporting employees with regards to ICT enabled working. Key challenges are the sheer volume of email traffic, lack of training and infrastructure and an absence of appropriate support. Practical implications: Organisations need to develop clear policies regarding the psychosocial aspects of technology use and provide evidence-based guidance to managers and employees. Social implications: Managers and individuals require support to engage with technology in a healthy and sustainable way. Research implications: The paper draws upon paradigms relevant to the work-home interface to question the assumptions made about flexible working in work-family conflict and work-family border theory. Research frameworks need {{to pay more attention to}} the socio-technological context and acknowledge the digital terrain. Original/ value: This is one of the first papers to survey organizational practice and support on the topic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Remote {{engineering}} (also {{known as}} online engineering) {{may be defined}} as a combination of control engineering and telematics. In this area, specific activities require computacional skills in order to develop projects where electrical devives are monitored and / or controlled, in an intercative way, through a distributed network (e. g. Intranet or Internet). In our specific case, we will be dealing with an industrial plant. Within the last few years, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of activities related to remote engineering, which may be connected to the phenomenon of the large extension experienced by the Internet (e. g. bandwith, number of users, development tools, etc.). This increase opens new and future possibilities to the implementation of advance teleworking (or <b>e-working)</b> positions. In this paper we present the architecture for a remote application, accessible through the Internet, able to monitor and control a roller hearth kiln, used in a ceramics industry for firing materials. The proposed architecture is based on a micro web server, whose main function is to monitor and control the firing process, by reading the data from a series of temperature sensors and by controlling a series of electronic valves and servo motors. This solution is also intended to be a low-cost alternative to other potential solutions. The temperature readings are obtained through K-type thermopairs and the gas flow is controlled through electrovalves. As the firing process should not be stopped before its complete end, the system is equipped with a safety device for that specific purpose. For better understanding the system to be automated and its operation we decided to develop a scale model (100 : 1) and experiment on it the devised solution, based on a Micro Web Server.

40|$|Abstract: Towards {{the latter}} {{end of the}} last decade there was growing {{recognition}} that Ireland’s transport and mobility patterns were unsustainable {{in the context of their}} economic, social and environmental impacts and consequences. The State had been spatially transformed during the “Celtic Tiger ” era with (sub) urban sprawl, fuelled by Ireland’s chronic car dependency, a feature of everyday life. Commuting to and from work increased noise and air pollution, traffic congestion and contributed considerably to carbon emissions augmenting globally negative anthropogenic climate change. In an apparent shift in transport policy, the government published Smarter Travel in 2007 where more environmentally sustainable modes of transport, such as walking, cycling and public transport, were encouraged to combat the country’s unusually high levels of car dependency. An essential feature of the Smarter Travel initiative was telework (<b>e-Working).</b> Working from home has the potential to reduce, or eliminate, the daily commute to and from work and was regarded by policymakers as a crucial element in reducing Ireland’s unsustainable patterns of mobility whilst continuing the pursuit of unhindered economic growth. However, telework remains marginalised in business terms and lacks the regulation and guidelines essential to legitimise it for employers and employees that wish to work from home. A neo-liberal approach to the practice adopted by policymakers is evident and in the absence of legislation employers retain sole discretionary decision making powers over telework schemes and home working conditions. Indeed, many key decision makers fail to appreciate or recognise the potential benefits that may accrue from telework, which is leading to ad hoc and disorganised arrangements to the detriment of this method of working. Telework appears destined to fail even before it has been given a chance to shine as an economic, social and environmental tool of sustainability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} issues and {{presents}} changes in practices {{relating to the}} new working as realized in the developing <b>e-working</b> world. The paper begins by reviewing my own experience. This is expressed as anecdote from my diary. Following this, the downside of e-work is argued to be characterized by atomization and fragmentation and is depicted under four headings: being an e-worker, engaging with work as an e-worker, contextualizing experience as an e-worker, and managing self and work as an e-worker. This section {{is followed by a}} brief review of how this downside has been achieved. The paper then goes on to discuss two models for developing the e-work process beyond the current debacle. The first model is one based on conventional practices and is concentrated on relieving the pressure. This conventional approach is also referred to as the provision for [...] . model. The model deals with providing technologies and inducements and meeting expenses of e-workers as fragmented elements of the workforce. It is a patchwork quilt of piecemeal planning. The second model, arising from the research behind the paper, involves thinking again–Where might we be? The process develops an invitation to join [...] . model, focusing on relationships. The paper goes on to describe a process for developing a systemic approach to e-work and non-e-work for large organizations and a means for applying the systemic development of e-work in full, and not just gesture. The paper concludes with an overview of the key learning points emergent from the research to date. Concerning the style of the paper, it is set out {{in the form of a}} Kolb learning cycle–this is the overarching methodology applied to the enquiry as a whole...|$|E
