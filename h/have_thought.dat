5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|Edward Augustus Freeman {{and other}} historians <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that this Siward was Siward Barn, arguing that Siward {{must have been}} a {{descendant}} of Uhtred the Bold, Earl of Northumbria, and Ælfgifu, daughter of King Æthelred the Unready, King Edward's father. Historian and translator of Orderic, Marjorie Chibnall, pointed out that this Siward is mentioned later in his Ecclesiastical History as a Shropshire landowner, in connection with the foundation of Shrewsbury Abbey. Ann Williams likewise rejected this identification, identifying this Siward firmly with the Shropshire thegn Siward Grossus. According to Williams' reconstruction, Siward Grossus and his brother Ealdred were the sons of Æthelgar by a daughter of Eadric Streona, Ealdorman of Mercia and Eadgyth, another daughter of King Æthelred, explaining the relationship Orderic believed they had with Edward the Confessor.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E

5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented that the development team should <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people <b>have</b> <b>thought.</b> Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, {{but it was}} originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E

5|$|The vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was {{a former}} captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was {{appointed}} by the African Committee of the Royal African Company, as the governor of Anomabu, a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. This position made him also vice-president of the RAC Council of the Castle. Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts, governor of the Castle, Stubbs was {{forced out of the}} governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months. Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC, accused him of being a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort. Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} reasons put forth {{as to why}} Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act. The Council's {{official}} reasoning {{was that they were}} unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers. Further, the council may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that the conflict was not as serious as Congress believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully. The second theory put forth is that Dickinson, having been an officer in the militia, was sympathetic to the soldiers' grievances. The third theory is that the Council refused to allow Pennsylvania, a sovereign state, to be subjugated by the demands of a few members of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may <b>have</b> <b>thought,</b> the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E

5|$|Viewing elves {{as being}} more or less like people, and more or less outside Christian cosmology. The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not {{explicitly}} try to integrate elves into Christian thought. Likewise, the early modern Scottish people confessed to encountering elves seem not to <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> of themselves as having dealings with the Devil. Nineteenth-century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community, {{that may or may}} not be Christian. It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act, to subvert the dominance of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was in his}} own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E
