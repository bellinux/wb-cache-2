The other nominees were Harry Enfield, for his performance in Harry and Paul's Story of the Twos, and Sarah Hadland, for her performance in The <b>Job</b> <b>Lot.</b> The pair were also jointly nominated for the 2015 British Academy Television Craft Award for comedy writer for their work on Inside No. 9, but lost to Mackenzie Crook {{for his work on}} Detectorists. Arthur Matthews and Matt Berry (Toast of London) and Mathew Baynton and James Corden (The Wrong Mans) were the other nominees. The following year, Guillem Morales was nominated for the Television Craft Award for Breakthrough Talent for his work on [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", but lost to Michaela Coel, who wrote Chewing Gum. The other nominees were D. C. Moore (Not Safe for Work) and Marcus Plowright (Muslim Drag Queens).|$|E
2500|$|The palace's art {{collection}} was assembled haphazardly in an eclectic manner, often {{with an eye}} to quantity rather than quality. Many of the artworks purchased for the palaces arrived as parts of a <b>job</b> <b>lot</b> as the sovereign acquired whole ready-assembled collections. The Empress' ambassadors in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam and London were instructed to look out for and purchase thousands of priceless works of art on her behalf. Ironically, while Saint Petersburg high society and the extended Romanov family derided Russia's last Empress for furnishing her palaces [...] "mail order" [...] from Maples of London, she was following the practices of Catherine the Great, who, if not exactly by [...] "mail order", certainly bought [...] "sight unseen." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to one {{description}} in 1996, [...] "The area dies at night ... It needs a neighborhood, a community." [...] During {{the past two}} decades there has been a shift towards greater residential living areas in the Wall Street area, with incentives from city authorities in some instances. Many empty office buildings have been converted to lofts and apartments; for example, the office building of Harry Sinclair, the oil magnate involved with the Teapot Dome scandal, was converted to a co-op in 1979. In 1996, a fifth of buildings and warehouses were empty, and many were converted to living areas. Some conversions met with problems, such as aging gargoyles on building exteriors having to be expensively restored to meet with current building codes. Residents in the area have sought to have a supermarket, a movie theater, a pharmacy, more schools, and a [...] "good diner". The discount retailer named <b>Job</b> <b>Lot</b> used to be located at the World Trade Center but moved to Church Street; merchants bought extra unsold items at steep prices and sold them as a discount to consumers, and shoppers included [...] "thrifty homemakers and browsing retirees" [...] who [...] "rubbed elbows with City Hall workers and Wall Street executives"; but the firm went bust in 1993.|$|E

5000|$|The {{collection}} of artifacts is lavish but random; genuinely valuable pieces of art share {{space with a}} lot of kitschy art objects of little value. This has caused some to feel the collection is superficial and gaudy. Geoffrey Moorhouse in his book Calcutta says it looks [...] "as if they had been scavenged from <b>job</b> <b>lots</b> on the Portobello Road on a series of damp Saturday afternoons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enrich the universe; rath-er. Some of {{the birds}} I made were new kinds of humming birds, and very {{beautiful}} little things, {{but some of them}} were simply rum. The rummest, I think, was the Anomalopteryx Jejuna. Jejunus-a-um--empty--so called because there was really nothing in it; a thoroughly empty bird--except for stuffing. Old Javvers has the thing now, and I suppose he is almost as proud of it as I am. It is a masterpiece, Bellows. It has all the silly clumsiness of your pelican, all the solemn want of dignity of your parrot, all the gaunt ungainliness of a flamingo, with all the extravagant chromatic conflict of a mandarin duck. Such a bird. I made it out of the skeletons of a stork and a toucan and a <b>job</b> <b>lot</b> of feathers. Taxidermy of that kind is just pure joy, Bellows, to a real artist in the art.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was soon}} {{manifest}} the shop paid {{only in the}} least exacting sense, and Miriam did not conceal her opinion {{that he ought to}} bestir himself and [...] "do things," [...] though what he was to do was hard to say. You see, when you have once sunken your capital in a shop you do not very easily get it out again. If customers will not come to you cheerfully and freely the law sets limits upon the compulsion you may exercise. You cannot pursue people about the streets of a watering place, compelling them either by threats or importunity to buy flannel trousers. Additional sources of income for a tradesman are not always easy to find. Wintershed at the bicycle and gramaphone shop to the right, played the organ in the church, and Clamp of the toy shop was pew opener and so forth, Gambell, the greengrocer, waited at table and his wife cooked, and Carter, the watchmaker, left things to his wife while he went about the world winding clocks, but Mr. Polly had none of these arts, and wouldn't, in spite of Miriam's quietly persistent protests, get any other. And on summer evenings he would ride his bicycle about the country, and if he discovered a sale where there were books he would as often as not waste half the next day in going again to acquire a <b>job</b> <b>lot</b> of them haphazard, and bring them home tied about with a string, and hide them from Miriam under the counter in the shop. That is a heartbreaking thing for any wife with a serious investigatory turn of mind to discover. She was always thinking of burning these finds, but her natural turn for economy prevailed with her.|$|E

[...] He sat up, fat and froggy and benevolent, like a bronze Buddha, and grew earnest. [...] "Consider--it's more than five years. You've continued the same policy from the start: with every rise, always holding on for five points higher. Always when I {{think we are}} going to have some weddings, you see a bigger thing ahead, and I undergo another disappointment. I think you are too hard to please. Some day we'll get left. First, we turned down the dentist and the lawyer. That was all right--it was sound. Next, we turned down the banker's son and the pork-butcher's heir--right again, and sound. Next, we turned down the Congressman's son and the Governor's--right as a trivet, I confess it. Next the Senator's son and the son of the Vice-President of the United States--perfectly right, there's no permanency about those little distinctions. Then you went for the aristocracy; and I thought we had struck oil at last--yes. We would make a plunge at the Four Hundred, and pull in some ancient lineage, venerable, holy, ineffable, mellow with the antiquity of a hundred and fifty years, disinfected of the ancestral odors of salt-cod and pelts all of a century ago, and unsmirched by a day's work since, and then! why, then the marriages, of course. But no, along comes a pair a real aristocrats from Europe, and straightway you throw over the half-breeds. It was awfully discouraging, Aleck! Since then, what a procession! You turned down the baronets for a pair of barons; you turned down the barons for a pair of viscounts; the viscounts for a pair of earls; the earls for a pair of marquises; the marquises for a brace of dukes. NOW, Aleck, cash in!--you've played the limit. You've got a <b>job</b> <b>lot</b> of four dukes under the hammer; of four nationalities; all sound in the wind and limb and pedigree, all bankrupt and in debt up to the ears. They come high, but we can afford it. Come, Aleck, don't delay any longer, don't keep up the suspense: take the whole lay-out, and leave the girls to choose!" ...|$|E

40|$|Lot {{splitting}} is {{a technique}} for accelerating the flow of work by splitting <b>job</b> <b>lots</b> into sublots. In this paper we investigate the lot splitting scheduling problem in a two-machine flow-shop environment with detached setups and with batch availability.

Our contribution is both theoretic and practical for the case of general (not necessarily equal) sublots. We identify properties of the optimal solution and develop a solution procedure to solve the problem. We then present a computational study which indicates that our solution technique is very efficient. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
50|$|When Ohrbach {{opened his}} store, he {{believed}} in cutting service to the bare essentials and sharing the savings with his customers. He also priced his goods in even numbers, while most of his competitors priced their goods in odd prices. Wiesen brought women’s ready-to-wear {{in the form of}} <b>job</b> <b>lots,</b> seconds, manufacturer’s overstocks, and irregulars. Ohrbach sold these in large volume and at low prices. After buying out Wiesen in 1928, he added men’s and children’s furnishings and accessories. He started to “trade up” his women’s wear and offer higher style garments. Other policies formalized at this time were no price advertising, minimum sales force, no alterations, no deliveries, cash and carry, and no special sales periods.|$|R
