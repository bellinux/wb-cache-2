At the time, Betances was one of five doctors {{that would have to}} take care of 24,000 residents.

5|$|Following von Spee's {{withdrawal}} from the Pacific, Australia was belatedly ordered on 8 November 1914 to join with several Japanese cruisers off Mexico to resume {{the hunt for the}} German cruisers.

It resulted in an artistic and architectural symbiosis best illustrated in the artifacts of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E

Judge Cross {{established a}} fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park {{for this event}} after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would {{be a boon to}} the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance.

After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
50|$|Static {{rejuvenation}} {{may also}} occur, in rare instances, when a downstream knickpoint erodes <b>its</b> <b>way</b> upstream <b>to</b> a lake which establishes base level for its tributaries. When the knickpoint reaches the lake, the lake drains, and the base level of upstream waters lowers rapidly {{from that of}} the (now former) lake to that of the river downstream of the knickpoint. At some point in the future, a quite dramatic example will appear when Niagara Falls cuts <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> Lake Erie.|$|R
