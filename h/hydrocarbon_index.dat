Total n-alkanes and PAHs concentrations ranged from 34 to 2, 155 and 696 to 10, 700 mu g kg(- 1), respectively. Some specific <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>indexes</b> suggested that terrestrial biogenic inputs are predominant compared to marine sources and that pyrolytic sources derived from wood and biomass combustion contribute to PAHs in the surface sediments. Total linear alkyl benzenes in Cortiou sediments ranged from 42. 9 to 502. 3 mu g kg(- 1). Low internal and external (I/E) isomers ratio (P 0) suggests that inadequately treated sewage is discharged into the marine environment while some environmental processes might change I/E ratios during transport seaward (P 1 -P 12).

40|$|Petroleum {{contamination}} {{impact on}} macrobenthic {{communities in the}} northeast portion of Todos os Santos Bay was assessed combining in multivariate analyses, chemical parameters such as aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>indices</b> and concentration ratios with benthic ecological parameters. Sediment samples were taken in August 2000 with a 0. 05 m(2) van Veen grab at 28 sampling locations. The predominance of n-alkanes with more than 24 carbons, together with CPI values close to one, {{and the fact that}} most of the stations showed UCM/resolved aliphatic hydrocarbons ratios (UCM:R) higher than two, indicated a high degree of anthropogenic contribution, the presence of terrestrial plant detritus, petroleum products and evidence of chronic oil pollution. The indices used to determine the origin of PAH indicated the occurrence of a petrogenic contribution. A pyrolytic contribution constituted mainly by fossil fuel combustion derived PAH was also observed. The results of the stepwise multiple regression analysis performed with chemical data and benthic ecological descriptors demonstrated that not only total PAH concentrations but also specific concentration ratios or indices such as >= C 24 :< C 24, An/ 178 and Fl/Fl + Py, are determining the structure of benthic communities within the study area. According to the BIO-ENV results petroleum related variables seemed to have a main influence on macrofauna community structure. The PCA ordination performed with the chemical data resulted in the formation of three groups of stations. The decrease in macrofauna density, number of species and diversity from groups III to I seemed to be related to the occurrence of high aliphatic hydrocarbon and PAH concentrations associated with fine sediments. Our results showed that macrobenthic communities in the northeast portion of Todos os Santos Bay are subjected to the impact of chronic oil pollution as was reflected by the reduction in the number of species and diversity. These results emphasise the importance to combine in multivariate approaches not only total hydrocarbon concentrations but also indices, isomer pair ratios and specific compound concentrations with biological data to improve the assessment of anthropogenic impact on marine ecosystems.

All the reservoir sands contained gas, known through density–neutron log combination procedure. Reservoir sand RS 1 has a movable <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>index</b> (MHI) of 0.63, 0.76 and 0.79 in Well 1, Well 2 and Well 4, respectively. According to Schlumberger (1985), if the movable <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>index</b> is {{less than or equal}} to 0.7 for sandstone and less than 0.6 for carbonates reservoirs, then there will be hydrocarbon movement during invasion; but if MHI is equal to 1 (one), it means that, there is no movement of hydrocarbon during invasion. From the computed values on Tables  1, 2, 3 and 4, reservoir sands will experience hydrocarbon movement during invasion, with recorded MHI values for reservoir sand RS 2 being 0.28, 0.30 0.40 for Well 1, Well 2 and Well 4, and RS 3 of 0.26 and 0.30 for Well 1 and Well 2. This corresponds to good porosity of the reservoir sands, since it satisfies the conditions of Schlumberger (1985). With the effective porosity values of 24.56, 23.01 and 24.00 % for Well 1, Well 2 and Well 4, respectively, these porosity values are in line with the range of 28 – 32 % for the Agbada Formation of the Niger Delta (Schlumberger 1985). It also falls within very good porosity value of 20 – 30 % recorded by Omolaiye and Sanuade (2013). The bulk volume of water is given as 5.03, 5.95 and 5.56 % in Well 1, Well 2 and Well 4. This implies that the bulk volume of water is constant and the zone is of single type. The irreducible water saturation is 7.79, 8.54 and 8.17 % for Well 1, Well 2 and Well 4. The bulk volume fraction of movable oil is recorded to be 12.85, 11.61 and 11.49 % for Well 1, Well 2 and Well 4. This means that hydrocarbon will be pushed during invasion and can be recovered on production; the hydrocarbon saturation for RS 2 is 68.51 % for Well 4, for RS 3 72.49 % for Well 3, for RS 2 74.16 %, for RS 3 77.34 % for Well 2, for RS 2 79.51 % and for RS 3 80.99 % for Well 1. This implies that this reservoir’s sands are viable reservoir units.|$|E

It is feasible to use the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>index</b> (P*G) and pseudo-Poisson ratio attributes for detection of gas enrichment zones.

Thus, photocatalysis and air-stripping were combined for the hydrocarbon removal from a real oily bilgewater sample and an original monitoring of both aqueous and gaseous phases was performed by GC/MS {{to better understand the}} process. Our results show that the <b>hydrocarbon</b> oil <b>index</b> [HC] can be reduced to its maximum permissible value of 15 ppmv (MARPOL) in only 8. 5 h when photocatalysis and air-stripping are used together in a synergistic way, as against 17 h when photocatalysis is used alone. However, this air-assisted photocatalytic process emits a large quantity of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and, within the first four hours, ca. 10 % of the hydrocarbon removal in the aqueous phase is actually just transferred into the gaseous one. Finally, we highlight that the n-alkanes with a number of carbon atoms higher than 15 (N-C > 15) are those which most decrease the rate of [HC] removal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Many attempts to trace environmental oil spills were successful where isotopic values were particularly distinct. However, difficulties arise when a large data set is analyzed and the isotopic differences between samples are subtle. In the present study, discrimination of diesel oils involved in a diesel theft case was carried out to infer the relatedness of the samples to potential source samples. This discriminatory analysis used a suite of <b>hydrocarbon</b> diagnostic <b>indices,</b> alkanes, to generate carbon and hydrogen isotopic data of the compositions of the compounds which were then processed using multivariate statistical analyses to infer the relatedness of the data set. The results from this analysis were put into context by comparing the data with the δ 13 C and δ 2 H of alkanes in commercial diesel samples obtained from various locations in the South Island of New Zealand. Based on the isotopic character of the alkanes, it is suggested that diesel fuels involved in the diesel theft case were distinguishable. This manuscript shows that CSIA when used in tandem with multivariate statistical analysis provide a defensible means to differentiate and source-apportion qualitatively similar oils at the molecular level.

It explores hyperspectral methods to detect changes in biophysical and biochemical parameters of vegetation affected by hydrocarbons in the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador. The literature review revealed that experiments in the laboratory, showed that in specific species hydrocarbons caused a reduced level of chlorophyll content, which is an indicator of stress. However, {{it was unclear whether}} the same effect would be observed in tropical forests. Fieldwork was conducted in several sites of the Amazon forest of Ecuador to establish whether this was the case. Foliage samples were collected in sites located within oil spills and also from pristine forest in the Yasuni National Park. More than 1, 100 leaves from three different levels of the vertical canopy profile (upper, medium and understory) were analysed for biophysical, biochemical and spectral properties. A second-order polynomial chlorophyll content model was estimated based on several published calibrations models which use a portable chlorophyll meter. Modelled chlorophyll content showed high correlations with methods using reflectance indices (0. 76) and the inversion process of the PROSPECT radiative transfer model (0. 71). The analysis of biophysical and biochemical parameters at the three canopy levels of vegetation growing near hydrocarbons leakages showed decreasing levels of foliar chlorophyll content which suggest a reduced photosynthetic activity, higher levels of water content, which may explain the thicker leaves in the upper canopy, and thinner leaves in the understory. Based on these results, hyperspectral Hyperion and CHRIS-Proba satellite images were used to explore the potential of several vegetation indices to detect the symptoms of vegetation affected by hydrocarbons. The results indicated that a combination of an index sensitive to chlorophyll content at canopy level (Sum Green) with the NDVI index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) are suitable to detect vegetation affected by <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Those <b>indices</b> accurately identified vegetation growing near sites polluted by the petroleum industry and also when applied to an area affected by hydrocarbons from natural macro-seepages, and areas where hydrocarbons may be near the surface. Two new vegetation indices are proposed to identify vegetation affected by <b>hydrocarbon</b> pollution. Those <b>indices</b> showed sensitivity to differentiate secondary forest polluted and non-polluted. Chlorophyll content maps were computed based on an approach which uses the MTCI (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) at leaf level and scaled up to canopy level. The results of this research contribute to knowledge of regarding forest degradation. The approach could be used to detect hydrocarbon seepages as indicators of petroleum reservoirs, as well as significant pollution from oil spills in forest ecosystems. Moreover, the parameters for hydrocarbon stressed vegetation could be employed in a carbon cycle model to explore the impacts of hydrocarbon pollution on the carbon dioxide and water fluxes from tropical forests which are crucial for the carbon and water cycles...|$|R

High gamma ray log values depict nonpermeable bed, (shale) and low gamma ray log values identified the permeable beds (sandstone). Comparison of the low gamma ray log value to a high resistivity reading from the resistivity log showed a probable hydrocarbon-bearing sand unit.

The fluorescence signal of this probe (Ex/Em: 254 ± 25 / 360 ± 50 nm) was compared to the spectrofluorimetric Excitation Emission Matrices (EEMs) of discrete samples taken from the same area. The probe signal, due to its relative "large" Excitation and Emission bands, covers the EEMs signature of several groups of compounds: PAHs, tryptophan-like material, humic substances. This study is part of a laboratory program that aims at developping observation tools for operational oceanography and urban marine zone management: The project SEA EXPLORER (leader ACSA-Meyreuil, partnerships: ACRI, ISITIV, IFREMER, LMGEM-COM, LOV) funded by the Ministery of Industry (Fond de Compétitivité des Entreprises, FCE).

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most serious problems facing many developed and developing countries, including Malaysia. Aliphatic hydrocarbons comprising straight chain carbons are class of <b>hydrocarbon</b> pollution <b>indices</b> in the environment of anthropogenic and natural origins. To identify the historical trend of development, sediment samples were collected using a gravity corer from the narrow waterway of Johor Strait in the southern part of Peninsular Malaysia. The core samples were soxhlet extracted, purified and fractionated using 2 -step column chromatography followed by instrumental analysis with Gas Chromatograph Flame Ionization Detector. The results showed that the hydrocarbon contamination followed 4 distinct patterns. The pre-war period or at the onset of industrial development has seen a minimum input of alkanes. The World War II and postwar period (1945 - 1960) saw a decrease in hydrocarbon contamination because of the significant reduction in oil transportation. The third phase (1960 - 1990) saw a rapid increase in hydrocarbon input due to rapid economic development, industrialization and motorization and human population growth. The 4 th phase (1990 -present) saw a trend toward decreasing contamination due to strict environmental regulations (1990 - 2005). Surface aliphatic hydrocarbon concentration may have resulted from port operations, shipping activities and accidental spills. Total alkane concentration for the surface, middle and bottom core were 3180, 835 and 263 μgg(- 1) dry weight, respectively. Fresh hydrocarbon input was inferred from the significant absence of pristane and phytane.

40|$|The Lunawa Estuary {{has been}} {{selected}} {{as a model for}} studying the long-term diagnoss of tropical estuarine pollution and its impact on ecosystems. Surface and short-core sediments from the Lunawa Estuary were collected, and analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, sulfur and <b>hydrocarbon</b> contents, hydrogen <b>index</b> and other related sediment properties. Water quality and surface sediment data indicate that the Lunawa Estuary is presently an anoxic water body. The upper part of the sediment cores, characterized by very high TOC values of more than 10 %, and absence of bioturbation along with strong laminations indicate anoxic water since 1970 AD, determined by 14 C dating. However, before 1970 AD, lower TOC content and presence of bioturbation and homogenous sediments with animal traces suggest the presence of oxic bottom water and thus a much better physicochemical condition. The lower part of the cores may also suggest the influence of gradual global warming. Regular laminations in the upper portions of the cores probably resulted from monsoon pulses with material preserved under anoxic condition...|$|R
30|$|Quick look methods (QLM) in log {{interpretation}} {{are helpful}} to the geologist because they provide flags, or indicators, that point to possible hydrocarbon zones. The importance of QLM is {{in their ability to}} provide information {{about the nature of the}} fluids in the pore spaces and the lithology of the reservoirs in a quick and simple way. Four ways of QLM are applied on the Middle Miocene Jeribe Formation from the well Ja- 49 in Jambour Oilfield. The apparent water resistivity (Rwa) method helped in quick detecting the hydrocarbon-bearing zones of the formation. The logarithmic movable oil plot method assisted in detecting the intensity of the movability of the hydrocarbons within the hydrocarbon-bearing zones of the formation. The SP versus Rxo/Rt overlay is an additional helpful way for detecting water and hydrocarbon-bearing horizons without need to know porosity. movable <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>index</b> (MHI) is also used as QLM for detecting the movability of the hydrocarbons through calculating the ratio of water saturation in the uninvaded zone to that of the flushed zone. Accordingly, the formation in the studied well appeared to be generally a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir with zones of different movable hydrocarbon potentiality. The application of MHI method indicated that about 53 % of the gross 56  m thickness of the formation contains movable hydrocarbons. The upper and lower 5  m of the formation appear to be containing the most efficient productive horizons. No actual oil water contact is observed in the studied section of Jeribe Formation, which means the oil column extends down to certain depth in the formations underlying Jeribe Formation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a study conducted to determine and evaluate the petrophysical properties of andquot;SEYIandquot; oil field, Niger delta {{with a view to}} understand their effects on the reservoirs hydrocarbon prospect and oil productivity of the field. The evaluated properties include porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, net / gross thickness and mobility which are all inferred from geophysical wire-line logs. A suite of wire-line logs comprising of gamma ray, resistivity, spontaneous potential and density logs for four wells from 'SEYI' oil field were analysed for reservoir characterisation of the field. The analyses carried out involves delineation of lithologies, identification of reservoirs and fluid types, wells correlation and determination of petrophysical parameters of identified reservoirs. Seven reservoirs namely: A, B, C, D, E, F and G were delineated with their tops and bases at depth from 2396 m to 3429 m. Their analysis indicate the presence of hydrocarbon in all the reservoirs. Computed petrophysical parameters across the reservoirs gave porosity as ranging from 0. 22 to 0. 31; permeability 881. 58 md to 14425. 01 md and average hydrocarbon saturation of 41. 44 %, 20. 29 %, 30. 82 %, 37. 92 %, 51. 20 %, 91. 97 % and 85. 11 % for reservoir A, B, C, D, E, F and G respectively. These results together with the determined movable <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>index</b> (MHI) values (0. 05 to 0. 75) of the reservoir units suggest high hydrocarbon potential and a reservoir system whose performance is considered satisfactory for hydrocarbon production...|$|E
30|$|Hydrocarbon play {{assessment}} of any hydrocarbon reservoir unit {{depends on the}} porosity, permeability, hydrocarbon saturation and water saturation of petrophysical model distributions and seismic reflections of reservoir rocks. The objective {{of the study is}} to resolve the ambiguities that are associated with hydrocarbon play {{assessment of}} an X-field in the Niger Delta basin. This was achieved through the use of pre-conditioned attributes, fault delineating seismic attributes such as coherence, variance and quantitative definition of the reservoir units of petrophysical model distributions, through the adoption of an integrated methodology of 3 D seismic and well log data. A quick look examination of the well log signatures revealed numerous reservoir sand units, but only three hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir sands were of interest to us (RS 1, RS 2 and RS 3). From the quantitative interpretation of well logs, the three identified reservoir sands were evaluated in terms of porosity, permeability, hydrocarbon saturation, shale volume, movable <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>index</b> and water saturation. Effective porosity values of 24.56, 23.01 and 24.00 % were obtained for Well 1, Well 2 and Well 4, respectively. This supports the known or already established porosity range of Agbada Formation of Niger Delta with range 28 – 32 %. The hydrocarbon saturation for RS 2 is 68.51 % for Well 4, for RS 3 72.49 % for Well 3 and for RS 2 74.16 % and for RS 3 77.34 % for Well 2. RS 2 of 79.51 % and RS 3 of 80.99 % for Well 1 were obtained. This shows how prolific the reservoir sand units are with hydrocarbon accumulation tendencies. Structural analysis revealed a highly faulted system that depicts a typical tectonic setting of the Niger Delta basin, and the computed attributes like coherence, and variance shows an optimum visualization of the faulting system. This implies that the trapping mechanism of the field is of both anticlinal and fault-assisted closure and also the viability of the reservoir units is high from the computed petrophysical parameters.|$|E
40|$|Extracellular {{polymeric}} substances (EPS) {{can contribute to}} the cellular degradation of hydrocarbons and have a huge potential for application in biotechnological processes, such as bioremediation and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR). Four bacterial strains from a Brazilian petroleum reservoir were investigated for EPS production, emulsification ability and biodegradation activity when hydrocarbons were supplied as substrates for microbial growth. Two strains of Bacillus species had the highest EPS production when phenanthrene and n-octadecane were offered as carbon sources, either individually or in a mixture. While Pseudomonas sp. and Dietzia sp., the other two evaluated strains, had the highest <b>hydrocarbon</b> biodegradation <b>indices,</b> EPS production was not detected. Low EPS production may not necessarily be indicative of an absence of emulsifier activity, as indicated by the results of a surface tension reduction assay and emulsification indices for the strain of Dietzia sp. the combined results gathered in this work suggest that a microbial consortium consisting of bacteria with interdependent metabolisms could thrive in petroleum reservoirs, thus overcoming the limitations imposed on each individual species by the harsh conditions found in such environments.

40|$|Upper Cretaceous pelitic rocks {{generate}} {{most of the}} {{oil reserves}} in Colombia. In Del Magdalena Upper Valley (MUV), the existenceof good quality outcrops and thermal evolution levels that vary from immaturity {{to the end of}} the oil generation “window” makes it one of themost appropriate regions for the study of primary migration and generation of oil in Upper Cretaceous. The main objectives of this work wereto study the organic facies of La Luna Formation in an outcrop section called Riacho Bambuca (Bambuca Creek), determine the oil generationpotential and characterize the paleoenvironment. For this research, 24 samples were used in palynofacies analysis (characterization ofthe kerogen components assembly) and in organic geochemistry analysis (Total Organic Carbon – TOC analysis and Rock-Eval pyrolysis,provided by Colombia Oil Institute – ECOPETROL). The palynofacies analysis included the use of microscopy techniques (transmitted whitelight and incident blue light). Furthermore, a Spore Coloration Index (SCI) analysis was made in order to determine the thermal maturationstage. The studied material was composed mainly of an amorphous organic substance, with its fluorescent coloration varying from yellow tobright orange. The palynomorph group is represented by spore morph and dinoflagellate cysts. The ligneous material are present in very lowpercentages; they are mainly opaque phytoclasts. The results of geochemical analysis showed TOC contents ranging from medium to high,excellent potential for the generation of hydrocarbons (PG > 4 mg HC/g of rock), hydrogen index ranging from 329 to 589 mg HC/g, andlow values of oxygen index, characterizing type II kerogen. The low degree of thermal maturation was determined by Spore Coloration Indexvalues ranging from 2, 5 to 3, 0, Tmax values below 440 °C and <b>Hydrocarbon</b> Production <b>Index</b> inferior to 0, 2. According to the organic faciesdata, La Luna Formation deposited in a marine environment with facies from disoxic-anoxic distal shelf and suboxic-oxic distal basin; therewas kerogen of excellent quality, and its quantity was adequate for the generation of oil.

This is a Tertiary basin, with a geographic extension approximately of 36. 000 km 2 and a sediments volume of ca. 161. 000 of km 3 (González de Juana et al., 1980). Among the petroliferous basins of Venezuela, the Falcon Basin is {{the one with the}} smallest reserves of liquid hydrocarbons, but it presents significant gas reserves and coal deposits.
