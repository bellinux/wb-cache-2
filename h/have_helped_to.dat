5|$|There are {{numerous}} important prehistoric remains in Orkney, {{especially from the}} Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that may <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> retain their structural integrity..|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} tucked under their arms. This behavior, which may <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> preserve their integrity.|$|E

5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and {{in certain parts of}} its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> support important hypotheses about pollination in the field of plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E

5|$|After the {{suspicious}} {{death of his}} wife Drogo fled England, and the castle was reassigned by William the Conqueror to Odo, the Count of Aumale. In 1096 it passed to Arnulf de Montgomery, but returned to the Aumales in 1102, who held it until 1221. Trade initially flourished and as a result William le Gros founded the fortified town of Skipsea Brough along the ridgeway just south of the castle, probably around 1160. The town was intended to bring in valuable revenue to the earls, but would also <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> defend the castle on its most vulnerable, overlooked side. The castle-guard system lapsed, with the surrounding estates paying their rents in cash instead.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was {{probably}} at the 1125 church council held at Westminster by the papal legate John of Crema, and shortly afterwards accompanied the legate on his journey back to Rome. He {{was still in}} Rome in 1126, and may <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> obtain a papal confirmation of his uncle's possession of Malmesbury Abbey, Abbotsbury Abbey, and Horton. At some point during his episcopate, an eighth archdeaconry was established in his diocese, for the West Riding area of Lindsey. Besides these reorganisations, Alexander {{had a number of}} clerics in his personal household, including Gilbert of Sempringham, who later founded the Gilbertine order. Other members of the bishop's household were Ralph Gubion, who became abbot of St Albans, and an Italian Bible scholar named Guido or Wido, who taught that subject while serving Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the pollution in the bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E

The club, which was revitalised in 1974 and organises an annual dinner for members, also receives contributions for the Cadwallader Trust; {{this has been a}} registered charity since December 1982 and supports rowing at the college both with capital expenditure and training costs. In the year ending 5 April 2008, the trust's expenditure was £19,001. Members of the Cadwallader Club <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> provide new boats and blades for the men's and the women's 1st VIIIs, and on the Saturday of Eights Week 2008, the trust presented the boat club with a new coxed four, named Cadwallader.

5|$|Research into fungal prions {{has given}} strong {{support to the}} protein-only concept, since {{purified}} protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also {{shed some light on}} prion domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. Fungal prions <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>to</b> suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic prion domains may vary between species—e.g., characteristic fungal prion domains are not found in mammalian prions.|$|E
