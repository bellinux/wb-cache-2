50|$|Fulminic {{acid and}} its salts (<b>fulminates),</b> for {{instance}} <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> are very dangerous, {{and are often}} used as detonators for other explosive materials, and are examples of primary explosives. The vapors also are toxic.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> is a {{detonator}} {{widely used}} in explosives.|$|R
50|$|First {{used as a}} priming {{composition}} in small copper caps beginning in the 1820s, <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> quickly replaced flints {{as a means to}} ignite black powder charges in muzzle-loading firearms. Later, during the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> or potassium chlorate became widely used in primers for self-contained rifle and pistol ammunition. <b>Mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> has the distinct advantage over potassium chlorate of being non-corrosive, but it is known to weaken with time, by decomposing into its constituent elements. The reduced mercury which results forms amalgams with cartridge brass, weakening it, as well. Today, <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> has been replaced in primers by more efficient chemical substances. These are non-corrosive, less toxic and more stable over time; they include lead azide, lead styphnate and tetrazene derivatives. In addition, none of these compounds require mercury for manufacture, supplies of which can be unreliable in wartime.|$|R
50|$|During his {{experimental}} career, he {{lost his}} left hand in a <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> explosion in 1894.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{inorganic}} compounds include the inorganic salts and complexes of the carbon-containing cyanide, cyanate, fulminate, thiocyanate and cyanamide ions. Examples of cyanides are copper cyanide (CuCN) and potassium cyanide (KCN), examples of cyanates are potassium cyanate (KNCO) and silver cyanate (AgNCO), examples of fulminates are silver <b>fulminate</b> (AgOCN) and <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> (HgOCN) and {{an example of}} a thiocyanate is potassium thiocyanate (KSCN).|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, two {{scenes from}} the first season of Breaking Bad were put under {{scrutiny}} in a Mythbusters Breaking Bad Special. Despite several modifications to what {{was seen in the}} show, both the scenes depicted in the show were shown to be physically impossible. In the [...] "Crazy Handful of Nothin'" [...] episode, Walt produces a batch of <b>fulminated</b> <b>Mercury,</b> ostensibly in crystalline form, and threatens to raze Tuco Salamanca's office to the ground. Although the compound is unstable, MythBusters has shown that Walt would have needed a much greater quantity of the compound along with a much faster throwing velocity, and that he and everyone else would have died from the concussive blast.|$|R
6000|$|... .... At the Coroner's inquest in {{the case}} of John Harvey there was {{considerable}} difficulty in ascertaining the cause of death, but as one witness testified that the deceased was pounding <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury</b> at the Powder Works just previously to his lamented demise, {{there is good reason to}} believe he was hoist into heaven with his own petard. In fact, such fractions of him as have come to hand, up to date, seem to confirm this view. This evidence is rather disjointed and fragmentary, but it is sufficient to discourage the brutal practice of pounding <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury</b> when our streets and Sunday-schools are swarming with available Chinaman who seldom hit back.|$|R
5000|$|In 1863 Alfred Nobel {{realized}} that although nitroglycerin {{could not be}} detonated by a fuse, it could be detonated by the explosion of a small charge of gunpowder, which in turn was ignited by a fuse. [...] Within a year, he was adding <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> to the gunpowder charges of his detonators, and by 1867 he was using small copper capsules of <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> triggered by a fuse, to detonate nitroglycerin.|$|R
50|$|Devi, {{along with}} her husband, helped Vimal Prasad Jain, a HSRA member, in running a bomb factory named 'Himalayan Toilets' (a {{smokescreen}} to hide the agenda of making bombs) at Qutub Road, Delhi. In this factory, they handled picric acid, nitroglycerine and <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> {{completely}} decomposed in a gamma source (0. 86 Mrad/h) after {{a dose of}} 208 Mrad. This exposure equates {{to approximately}} 2. 4 years in Tank 15 H and 4 years in Tank 12 H, one of the vessels of concern. Since the tanks lost the supernatant cover layer {{more than a decade}} ago, this study suggests that any <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> or closely related energetic species decomposed long ago if ever formed...|$|R
50|$|Silver {{fulminate}} {{was first}} prepared in 1800 by Edward Charles Howard {{in his research}} project to prepare a large variety of <b>fulminates.</b> Along with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> {{it is the only}} fulminate stable enough for commercial use. Detonators using silver fulminate were used to initiate picric acid in 1885, but since have only been used by the Italian navy. The current commercial use has been in producing non-damaging novelty noisemakers as children's toys and tricks.|$|R
50|$|HMTD {{is a more}} {{powerful}} initiating explosive than <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> but its poor thermal and chemical stability prevents its use in detonators.|$|R
50|$|In 1868, Henry Julius Smith of Boston, Massachusetts, {{introduced}} a cap that combined a spark gap ignitor and <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> the first electric cap able to detonate dynamite.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amount of}} these charges — three-fourths of a pound to each primer — has been {{included}} in the grand total already given. The primers contained also, as detonators, fuses holding each twenty grains of <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury.</b> The terminals of two connecting-wires were inserted in each fuse, and bridged with [...]001-inch silver platinum wires a quarter inch in length.|$|R
50|$|Fulminates were {{discovered}} by Edward Charles Howard in 1800. The use of fulminates for firearms was first demonstrated by a Scottish minister, A. J. Forsyth, who patented his scent-bottle lock in 1807; {{this was a}} small container filled with <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury.</b> Joshua Shaw then made the transition to their use in metallic encapsulations, to form a percussion cap, but did not patent his invention until 1822.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, he {{inserted}} into the cartridge {{the end of the}} fuse, to which was attached a small cap filled with <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury,</b> and tied it tightly up. This done, he laid the cartridge {{on the top of the}} boulder, placed two or three similar cartridges beside it, and covered all with a small quantity of sand, leaving the other end of the fuse projecting.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{firearms}} {{had to be}} cocked {{and caught}} by the [...] "sear", which holds the hammer back, before each shot. Pulling the trigger allows the hammer or striker to fly forward, striking the [...] "firing pin," [...] which then strikes the [...] "primer," [...] igniting an impact-sensitive chemical compound (historically, first <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury,</b> then potassium chlorate, now lead styphnate) which shoots a flame through the [...] "flash hole" [...] into the cartridge's propellant chamber, igniting the propellant.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1857, Orsini briefly visited England, {{where he}} {{contacted}} gunsmith Joseph Taylor {{and asked him to}} make six copies of a bomb of Orsini's own design; it would explode on impact and used <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury</b> as an explosive. The bomb was tested in Sheffield and Devonshire with the aid of French radical Simon Bernard. Satisfied, Orsini returned to Paris with the bombs and contacted other conspirators, Giuseppe Pieri, Antonio Gomez and Carlo di Rudio (later changed to Charles DeRudio).|$|R
50|$|A {{thorough}} {{search of}} the two rooms in his parents' house where Fuchs had lived revealed more IEDs but no traces of the equipment which he would have needed to produce and handle the unstable explosives (including <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> and nitroglycerol) contained in his IEDs.|$|R
50|$|Other {{materials}} such as DDNP (diazo dinitro phenol) are also used as the primary charge {{to reduce the amount}} of lead emitted into the atmosphere by mining and quarrying operations. Old detonators used <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> as the primary, often mixed with potassium chlorate to yield better performance.|$|R
5000|$|Joshua Shaw (a.k.a. Joseph Shaw) {{claimed to}} have invented the copper {{percussion}} cap in 1814, but experts no longer consider this a valid claim. He was an early developer of percussion primers and a gun dated to be no earlier than 1817, was made by William Smith of Lisle Street in London to test his prototype steel cap. Shaw, writing in the [...] Journal of the Franklin Institute in 1829 clearly states that he adopted the use <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury,</b> which was improvement over the corrosive chlorate of potash fulminate patented by Alexander John Forsyth.|$|R
5000|$|While hunting wild duck, he was {{dissatisfied}} with his flintlock fowling-piece {{due to its}} long lock time (the delay between the time the trigger is pulled and the time the main charge of gunpowder begins burning); {{by the time the}} pellets actually left the barrel, the target animal could hear the noise from the trigger being pulled and have time to either fly, dive, or run before the shot reached it. He patented his scent-bottle lock in 1807; this was a small container filled with <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes; {{but much}} more quickly than {{gunpowder}} does. It were better to say that a powder detonates when it all explodes at the same instant. Gunpowder appears to do so, but in reality it does not. One of the best detonators is <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury.</b> Detonating caps are therefore made of this, and one such cap put into the middle of that cartridge of dynamite and set fire to, by any means, would convert the cartridge itself into a detonator, and explode it with a shattering effect.|$|R
50|$|Diazodinitrophenol (DDNP) was {{the first}} diazo {{compound}} produced; it was subsequently used to make dyes and explosives. It forms yellow crystals in pure form; however, the color of impure forms may vary from dark yellow to green to dark brown. It is soluble in acetic acid, acetone, concentrated hydrochloric acid, most non-polar solvents and is slightly soluble in water. A solution of cold sodium hydroxide {{may be used to}} destroy it. DDNP may be desensitized by immersing it in water, as it does not react in water at normal temperature. It is less sensitive to impact but more powerful than <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> and almost as powerful as lead azide. The sensitivity of DDNP to friction is much less than that of <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> but it is approximately that of lead azide.|$|R
50|$|Drebbel's {{most famous}} written work was Een kort Tractaet van de Natuere der Elementen (A short {{treatise}} {{of the nature}} of the elements) (Haarlem, 1621). He was also involved in the invention of <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate.</b> He also discovered that mixtures of “spiritus vini” with mercury and silver in “aqua fortis” could explode.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nipping on {{a couple}} of detonators," [...] said Jefferson. [...] "Stand clear of the one on the deck. They're lined with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> and you want to take your shoes off when you come near that. Giant powder's {{innocent}} by comparison. I mean to try a stick or two of this consignment." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{percussion}} cap {{is a small}} cylinder of copper or brass with one closed end. Inside the closed end is {{a small amount of}} a shock-sensitive explosive material such as <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury.</b> The {{percussion cap}} is placed over a hollow metal [...] "nipple" [...] at the rear end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer that strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer. The flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge. Percussion caps were, and still are, made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets.|$|R
50|$|Potassium {{fulminate}} is the {{potassium salt}} of the fulminate ion. Its only use, aside from chemical demonstrations, {{is in the}} percussion caps for some early rifles. Usually prepared by reacting a potassium amalgam with <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate,</b> it is much less sensitive due to the ionic bond between potassium and carbon, unlike the weaker covalent bond between mercury and carbon.|$|R
5000|$|The Colt [...]44-caliber “Army" [...] Model was {{the most}} widely used {{revolver}} of the Civil War. It had a six-shot, rotating cylinder, and fired a 0.454 in round spherical lead ball, or a conical-tipped bullet, typically propelled by a 30-grain charge of black powder, which was ignited by a small copper percussion cap that contained a volatile charge of <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury</b> (a substance that explodes upon being subjected to a sharp impact). The percussion cap, when struck by the hammer, ignited the powder charge. When fired, balls had a muzzle velocity of about 900 feet per second (274 meters/second), although this depended on how much powder it was loaded with.|$|R
5000|$|The {{alteration}} {{of the military}} flintlock to the percussion musket was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan and steel [...] "frizzen" [...] with a nipple, and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint by a smaller hammer formed with a hollow made to fit around the nipple when released by the trigger. On the nipple was placed the copper cap containing the detonating composition, now made of three parts of chlorate of potash, two of <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury</b> and one of powdered glass. The hollow in the hammer contained the fragments of the cap if it fragmented, {{reducing the risk of}} injury to the firer's eyes.|$|R
5000|$|The caplock {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a hammer, similar to the hammer used in a flintlock, and a nipple (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "cone"), which holds a small percussion cap. The nipple contains a tube which goes into the barrel. The percussion cap contains a chemical compound called mercuric fulminate or <b>fulminate</b> of <b>mercury,</b> whose chemical formula is Hg(ONC). It is made from mercury, nitric acid and alcohol. When the trigger releases the hammer, it strikes the cap, causing the mercuric fulminate to explode. The flames from this explosion travel down the tube in the nipple and enter the barrel, where they ignite the main powder charge.|$|R
50|$|Amatol {{should not}} be stored in {{containers}} made from copper or brass, as it can form unstable compounds sensitive to vibration. Pressed, it is relatively insensitive but may be detonated by severe impact, whereas when cast, it is extremely insensitive. Primary explosives such as <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> were often used as a detonator, in combination with an explosive booster charge such as tetryl.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary {{detonators}} {{usually take}} the form of ignition-based explosives. Whilst they are mainly used in commercial operations, ordinary detonators are still used in military operations. This form of detonator is most commonly initiated using safety fuse, and used in non time-critical detonations e.g. conventional munitions disposal. Well known detonators are lead azide, Pb(N3)2, silver azide (AgN3) and <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate</b> Hg(ONC)2.|$|R
50|$|Tetrazene is {{slightly}} more impact-sensitive than <b>mercury</b> <b>fulminate.</b> When pressed enough, its sensitivity is reduced or destroyed; {{this is known}} as dead pressing. It also decomposes in boiling water. In contact with fire, it readily explodes, producing large amounts of black smoke. It is prepared by reacting sodium nitrite with an aminoguanidine salt dissolved in acetic acid at 30-40 °C.|$|R
