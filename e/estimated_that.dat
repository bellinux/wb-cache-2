5|$|According to the Bills of Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the true number of mortalities was {{probably}} twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London {{for the whole of}} the epidemic, <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E

5|$|Although a 2007 study <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> {{introducing}} DST to Japan {{would reduce}} household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use. This is probably because DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences.|$|E

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> {{there could be}} a small revenue effect because enacting the bill might change the number of federal employees who choose to contribute to the TSP, thus modifying their total tax liability. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, JCT <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> any revenue effects would be negligible.|$|R

5|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 12 {{percent of total}} forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; the losses were due to sorties in which the French were able to inflict heavy damages. Gaston Bodart <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the Austrian losses were lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.|$|E

50|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> {{implementing}} {{the legislation would}} have no {{significant impact on the}} federal budget. Based on information from the National Park Service, the CBO <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> the cost to maintain the inscription would be insignificant. Enacting S. 1044 would affect direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> the net effects of receiving and spending donated funds would be insignificant in each year. Enacting S. 1044 would not affect revenues.|$|R
50|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> {{implementing}} H.R. 3627 {{would have}} no significant cost to the federal government.

50|$|Assuming {{appropriation}} of the authorized amounts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> implementing H.R. 3530 would cost $125 million over the 2015-2024 period. We <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> enacting the bill would not change total direct spending over the 2015-2024 period; it would reduce such spending during the 2016-2021 period and increase it over the subsequent years. We also <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> bill would have an insignificant effect on revenues. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues.|$|R
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the price}} of raccoon pelts rose again {{to a high of}} 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was {{possible}} to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than hunting with dogs.|$|E
