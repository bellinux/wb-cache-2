5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{intended}} to use probability sampling sometimes end up using nonprobability samples because of characteristics of the sampling method. For example, using a sample of people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paid <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> to analyze <b>the</b> effect of education on earnings {{is to use a}} non-probability sample of persons who could be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paid <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> Because <b>the</b> education people obtain could determine their likelihood of being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paid <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> technically <b>the</b> sample <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paid <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> is a nonprobability sample for the question at issue. In such cases results are biased.|$|R

30|$|The {{share of}} {{foreign-born}} workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> has grown since 1996. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1996 to 2012 period, {{more than half}} of <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> total <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> was among <b>the</b> foreign born. <b>In</b> 2012, there were 25 million foreign-born persons age 16  years and older <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> representing 16.1 % of the total. 1 The economic adjustment of immigrant labor is important for understanding the economic well-being of immigrants and the host population, and immigrants’ impact on native workers. Previous studies on the economic assimilation of immigrants largely focused on immigrants’ adjustment on earnings, but little is known about immigrants’ labor market performance in terms of their employment and unemployment dynamics through changing macro-economic conditions.|$|R

25|$|The {{increase}} of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> of Western countries gained {{momentum in the}} late 19th century. At this point women married early on and were defined by their marriages. If they entered the workforce, it was only out of necessity.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{few women}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> layoffs were less {{common in the}} white-collar jobs and they were {{typically}} found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to {{the percentage of the}} population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{whether the}} decision to enter the military offers a different investment in human capital {{as indicated by the}} civilian earning of veterans. Using seven one month samples from the Current Population Survey, I run three linear regressions to compare the earnings of veterans by gender, the earnings of female veterans and non-veterans, and the earnings of male veterans and non-veterans. It appears that, between 2005 and 2013, veterans enjoyed a wage premium which existed for both male and female veterans. These results suggest that military service acts as a screening device or a bridge to employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civilian <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> Additionally, female veterans earn less than male veterans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civilian <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> Even though female veterans are more successful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civilian <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> than women with no military experience, they still suffer a gender wage gap.

25|$|The survey {{asks about}} the {{employment}} status of {{each member of}} the household 15 years of age or older as of the calendar week containing the 12th day of the month.

25|$|Most {{people are}} married {{when they reach}} {{retirement}} age; thus, spouse's employment status may affect one's decision to retire. On average, husbands are three years older than their wives in the U.S., and spouses often coordinate their retirement decisions. Thus, {{men are more likely}} to retire if their wives are also retired than if they are still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to Bedouin women’s lack of participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> A study conducted by economist Aamer Abu-Qarn determined that the most significant barriers to women’s employment are lack of education, lack of experience, and poor infrastructure in Bedouin towns. Surprisingly, factors that were not found significant by the model included the presence or number of children, the health of household members, {{and the level of}} modernity.|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{the general}} {{population}} have found strong generational differences in how women and men relate to feminism. But how well do these findings reflect feminism among African American men and women? The results of this study show that generational differences are very important for understanding feminism within the Black community. Also important are gender and involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paid <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> For African Americans of the baby bust generation, working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paid <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> seems an especially important even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of gender-conscious identities...|$|R

25|$|While about 31.9% of the city's {{population}} is not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> the city's largest employers are {{the federal and}} city governments, respectively. Philadelphia's largest private employer is the University of Pennsylvania followed by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. A study commissioned by the city's government projected 40,000 jobs {{to be added to}} the city by 2035, raising the city's 2010 number of jobs from 675,000 total to an estimated 715,000 jobs.|$|E
25|$|Reliable {{statistics}} concerning Bedouin women’s participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> {{are difficult}} to find. The same gender norms that limit women’s employment outside the home also prevents women from registering as unemployed at the unemployment offices. Nevertheless, {{it has been estimated}} that in 2007, only 11.4% of Bedouin women were employed outside of their homes. However, this estimate did not distinguish the types of work Negev Bedouin women engaged in outside of the household.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> were {{discrimination in the}} labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, {{and a lack of}} suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls {{are much more likely to}} drop out of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E

25|$|The {{emphasis}} was for war supplies {{as soon as}} possible, regardless of cost and inefficiencies. Industry quickly absorbed the slack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and the tables turned such that employers needed to actively and aggressively recruit workers.

25|$|The {{number of}} workers and, more importantly, their {{productivity}} help determine {{the health of the}} U.S. economy.
