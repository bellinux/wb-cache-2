5|$|Image filters. <b>Image</b> <b>filter</b> theory {{grew out}} of {{transmission}} line theory and the design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to transmission line analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely controllable passbands and other parameters. These developments took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate application was the economically important development of frequency division multiplexing for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> sections the same problem of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E

5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E

500|$|Several L half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. [...] The most important rule when constructing a composite <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> is that the image impedances must always face an identical impedance; like must always face like. [...] T sections must always face T sections, Π sections must always face Π sections, k-type must always face k-type (or the side of an m-type which has the k-type impedance) and m-type must always face m-type.

500|$|The {{major part}} of Cauer's legacy is his {{contribution}} to the network synthesis of passive networks. [...] Indeed, he is considered {{the founder of the}} field and the publication of his principal work in English was enthusiastically greeted, even though this did not happen until seventeen years later (in 1958). [...] Prior to network synthesis, networks, especially filters, were designed using the image impedance method. [...] The accuracy of predictions of response from such designs depended on accurate impedance matching between sections. [...] This could be achieved with sections entirely internal to the filter but {{it was not possible to}} perfectly match to the end terminations. [...] For this reason <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> designers incorporated end sections in their designs of a different form optimised for an improved match rather than filtering response. [...] The choice of form of such sections was more a matter of designer experience than design calculation. [...] Network synthesis entirely did away with the need for this. [...] It directly predicted the response of the filter and included the terminations in the synthesis.|$|E

500|$|Harrison used Campbell's <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> theory, {{which was}} the most {{advanced}} filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem. More advanced filter theory was {{brought to bear on}} this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being [...] "maximally flat". Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter. The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter, that is, one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, making it hard to recognise the design for what it is. Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the series capacitor, which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm. This is the only series capacitor in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a low-pass prototype. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the [...] "turning round the L" [...] impedance transform to achieve this.|$|E

2500|$|In {{respect of}} {{constant}} resistance filters, the term half section has {{a somewhat different}} meaning to other kinds of <b>image</b> <b>filter.</b> [...] Generally, a half section is formed by cutting through {{the midpoint of the}} series impedance and shunt admittance of a full section of a ladder network. [...] It is literally half a section. [...] Here, however, there is a somewhat different definition. [...] A half section is either the series impedance (series half-section) or shunt admittance (shunt half-section) that, when connected between source and load impedances of R0, will result in the same transfer function as some arbitrary constant resistance circuit. [...] The purpose of using half sections is that the same functionality is achieved with a drastically reduced component count.|$|E

5000|$|In {{those early}} days, filter theory {{was based on}} image {{impedance}} concepts, or <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> theory, which was a design approach developed from the well-established studies of transmission lines. The filter {{was considered to be}} a lumped component version of a section of transmission line, and was one of many within a cascade of similar sections. As mentioned above, the weakness of the <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> approach was that the frequency response of a network was often not as predicted when the network was terminated resistively, instead of by the required image impedances. This was essentially a mismatch issue and Zobel overcame it by means of matching end sections.
