Data are analyzed from {{a survey of}} food lovers in Australia, profiling their characteristics, pertinent travel behavior, desired experiences, trip and destination preferences, with special attention given to <b>isolating</b> <b>characteristics</b> and preferences {{of those who had}} already traveled for food-related experiences. In the conclusions we make recommendations for destinations seeking to develop food tourism, in effect providing a demand-based planning and marketing approach. A principal conclusion is that they are highly involved with food, think of themselves as gourmets, and they desire a multifaceted holiday. Core experiences include consumption of authentic cuisine, learning about food/beverages and gastronomic traditions, and socializing. These must be augmented through opportunities for broader cultural, natural, touring, and shopping experiences. Recommendations are made for extending this line of research and theory development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this study, the nanocomposites {{have been}} {{synthesized}} {{with the natural}} Tunisian clay which {{has the advantage of}} being cheap. In fact, it is composed of many kinds of clay (Kaolinite, Dolomite, calcite, Illite and Quartz). This clay has been cleaned, purified, dried and mixed with different resins currently used in many textile applications such as comfort, elasticity, impermeability … etc. The samples have been examined under MEB in order to identify them and ensure the formation of nanocomposites. The mixture resin/clay has been deposit on a 100 % cotton fabric (400 g/m 2) and tested on adiathermic power (AP%) measuring equipment. The parameter of thermal isolation of coated fabrics has been calculated through the difference in temperature between the interior and the exterior of the fabric in focus. It has been noticed that the increase in clay quantity improves significantly the thermal characteristics of the coated fabrics. The rigidity of the fabrics has also increased in terms of clay quantity, this proves that this new kind of fabric must be used in specific domains that compile their <b>isolating</b> <b>characteristics</b> and their increasing rigidity with the rate of clay inserted...|$|E

40|$|The ALTC funded ‘Studio Teaching Project’ {{confirmed}} that studio teaching {{is a key}} and indispensable characteristic of pedagogy in the discipline of Architecture. However increases in student numbers, expectations for feedback and accountability measures imposed by institutions have resulted in an escalation {{in the administration of}} courses. Academics are increasingly relinquishing their studio teaching roles to visiting and part-time contract teaching staff who are in turn becoming increasingly important to students achieving learning outcomes. It is widely assumed that anyone who has experienced a design studio education will know how to go about teaching in the studio. Whilst it is true that most university learning and teaching institutes provide manuals and training sessions for new tutors but little of this material describes the circumstances surrounding productive studio interactions. Furthermore whilst the visiting practitioner architect is hugely valued for their knowledge of current practice and in particular of ‘how buildings go together’ their particular mind-set is as designer/problem solver as distinct from educationalist. The proposed paper will focus on the nature of interactions between the student and their developing project work and the role the studio-instructor has in mediating these interactions. In observing interactions through the lens of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy this paper speculates a means for <b>isolating</b> <b>characteristics</b> and clarifying practical strategies to assist tutors in their role as studio advisers.

Three partial equilibrium models are considered: the Agricultural Member states MODeling (AGMEMOD) model, the Common Agricultural Policy SIMulation (CAPSIM) model, and the European Dairy Industry Model (EDIM).

40|$|We {{consider}} the semilinear wave equation with subconformal power nonlinearity in two space dimensions. We construct a finite-time blow-up solution with an <b>isolated</b> <b>characteristic</b> blow-up {{point at the}} origin, and a blow-up surface which is centered at the origin and has {{the shape of a}} stylized pyramid, whose edges follow the bisectrices of the axes in $R^ 2 $. The blow-up surface is differentiable outside the bisecrtices. As for the asymptotic behavior in similariy variables, the solution converges to the classical one-dimensional soliton outside the bisectrices. On the bisectrices outside the origin, it converges (up to a subsequence) to a genuinely two-dimensional stationary solution, whose existence is a by-product of the proof. At the origin, it behaves like the sum of 4 solitons localized on the two axes, with opposite signs for neighbors. This is the first example of a blow-up solution with a characteristic point in higher dimensions, showing a really two-dimensional behavior. Moreover, the points of the bisectrices outside the origin give us the first example of non-characteristic points where the blow-up surface is non-differentiable. Comment: 74 page...|$|R
