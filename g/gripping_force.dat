40|$|AbstractIntroductionHealthy {{subjects}} scale <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> {{to match}} the load defined by physical object properties such as weight, or dynamic properties such as inertia. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) show an elevated <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> in dynamic object handling, but temporal aspects of anticipatory <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control are relatively preserved. In PD patients, beta frequency oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia is suppressed prior to externally paced movements. However, {{the role of the}} subthalamic nucleus (STN) in anticipatory <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control is not known. MethodsAfter implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the STN, PD patients performed adaptive and voluntary <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> tasks, while we recorded subthalamic local field potentials (LFP) and scalp EEG. ResultsDuring adaptive <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control (Shake), we found event related desynchronization (ERD) in the beta frequency band, which was time-locked to the <b>grip</b> <b>force.</b> In contrast, during voluntary <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control (Press) we recorded a biphasic ERD, corresponding to peak <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> and <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> release. Beta synchronization between STN and cortical EEG was reduced during adaptive <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control. ConclusionThe time-locked suppression of beta oscillatory activity in the STN is in line with previous reports of beta ERD prior to voluntary movements. Our results show that the STN is involved in anticipatory <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control in PD patients. The difference in the phasic beta ERD between the two tasks and the reduction of cortico-subthalamic synchronization suggests that qualitatively different neuronal network states are involved in different <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control tasks...|$|R

40|$|Coordination {{between the}} normal force exerted by fingers on a held object and the {{tangential}} constraints at the fingertips helps to successfully manipulate objects.

Moreover, inter-individual variation in the modulation of <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> suggests that the moisture level of the skin could influence <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> strategy. In the present study we asked subjects to perform a horizontal point-to-point task holding an object with a precision grip. The object was equipped with a moisture sensor.

This study evaluated the <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> control in selected individuals with MS (n = 9) and healthy control subjects (n = 9) while they performed the task of lifting and placing an instrumented object on a shelf and the task of lifting the object and bringing it close to the mouth to mimic drinking.

The individuals with MS used significantly larger peak <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> and force ratio than control subjects while performing both tasks and for both hands.

EEG signals were acquired from eleven healthy subjects during four different imagined tasks performed with the right or left hand. Subjects were instructed to execute imagined grip movement at two different levels of force. Each task was executed 60 times in random order. The imagined <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> MRCP {{of the right}} or left hand was analyzed by superposition and averaging technology, a single-trial extraction method, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple comparisons. Significantly different features were observed among different imagined <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> tasks. These differences were used to decode imagined <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> parameters using Fisher linear discrimination analysis based on kernel function (k-FLDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Under the proposed experimental paradigm, the study showed that MRCP may characterize the dynamic processing {{that takes place in}} the brain during the planning, execution, and precision of a given imagined <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> task. This means that features related to MRCP can be used to decode imagined <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> parameters based on EEG.

40|$|AbstractBadminton {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular racket sports for which the grip remains crucial for performance. For {{ergonomic}} purposes, the hand–handle interface of tennis racket has been studied quite extensively. However, the literature shows a very limited knowledge on badminton <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> intensity. Particularly, the relationship between <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> and different badminton strokes is still poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to measure the differences of <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> intensity between four basic badminton strokes, forehand (FH), backhand (BH), smash (SH) and net roll (NR). Ten asymptomatic adult badminton players took part in this study. <b>Grip</b> <b>force</b> was recorded using an embedded capacitive pressure-sensing mat (TekScan 9811) wrapped around a badminton racket handle, from which total <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> could be determined. The sensor was loaded using a force rating of 0 - 1000 N (R 2 = 0, 93) and the sampling rate was 500 Hz. The subjects were instructed to hit 20 shuttlecocks, for each stroke, into a target on the court. Only successful trials were analyzed. A one-way repeated measure ANOVA (stroke) was used to compare the effect of <b>grip</b> <b>force.</b> Tukey post-hoc test was used when significant level (p<. 05) was reached. Average peak force magnitude was 117, 0 N± 45, 7 N, 166, 1 N± 58, 3 N, 209, 0 N± 56, 1 N and 83, 8 N± 59, 2 N for FH, BH, SH and NR conditions respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> applied on the handle was strongly depending upon the stroke, NR <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> was significantly greater than BH (p<. 01) and SH (p<. 01) <b>grip</b> <b>force.</b> Moreover, the <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> applied in the SH condition was higher than BH condition (p<. 01). Data analysis showed that each player had an individual <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> pattern repeatable, but it was observed a strong intersubject variability. The strokes in badminton are a mix of power, precision and manoeuvrability. These characteristics appear to be contradictory: e. g. the literature shows that an increase <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> (power) led to a decrease in wrist motion (manoeuvrability). The main result of the present study is that the subjects took into account these constraints and the type of the strokes by adapting their <b>grip</b> <b>force.</b> Particularly, the precision (NR) and power stroke (SH) were inversely related: a lower <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> led to a greater precision probably allowed by a greater wrist range of motion...|$|R

50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a chuck key, which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower <b>gripping</b> <b>force</b> to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with cylindrical than hexagonal shanks. Some lathe chucks have independently moving jaws which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). Collet chucks, rather than having jaws, have collets, which are flexible collars or sleeves that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we examine}} <b>grip</b> <b>forces</b> and load forces during {{point-to-point}} arm movements with objects grasped with a precision grip.

The same finding is observed in {{vertical and horizontal}} movements performed at various rates. In vertical movements, maximum <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> coincides in time with maximum load force. The maxima occur early in upward and later in downward movements. In horizontal movements, where peaks in load force are observed during both the acceleratory and deceleratory phases, <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> rises {{at the beginning of}} the movement and remains high until the end.

Previous experiments have shown that <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> reactions interact between the hands when holding a single object.

We hypothesized that coupling of <b>grip</b> <b>forces</b> should be stronger when holding a single object than when holding separate objects. We measured the <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> reactions elicited by unpredictable load perturbations when participants were instructed to hold one single or two separate objects. We simulated these objects both visually and dynamically using a virtual environment consisting of two robotic devices and a calibrated stereo display. In contrast to previous studies, the load forces arising from a single object could be uncoupled {{at the moment of}} perturbation, allowing for a pure measurement of <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> coupling.

40|$|Anticipatory <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> {{adjustments}} are a {{prime example}} of the predictive nature of motor control. An object held in precision grip is stabilized by fine adjustments of the <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> against changes in tangential load force arising from inertia during acceleration and deceleration. When an object is subject to sudden impact loads, prediction becomes critical as the time available for sensory feedback is very short. Here, we investigated the control of <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> when participants performed a targeted tapping task with a hand-held object. During the initial transport phase of the movement, load force varied smoothly with acceleration. In contrast, in the collision, load forces sharply increased to very large values. In the transport phase, <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> and load force were coupled in phase, as expected. However, in the collision, <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> did not parallel load force. Rather, it exhibited a stereotyped profile with maximum similar to 65 ms after peak load at contact. By using catch trials and a virtual environment, we demonstrate that this peak of <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> is pre-programmed. This observation is validated across experimental manipulations involving different target stiffness and directions of movement. We suggest that the central nervous system optimizes stability in object manipulation as in catching by regulating mechanical parameters including stiffness and damping through <b>grip</b> <b>force.</b> This study provides novel insights about how the brain coordinates <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> in manipulation involving an object interacting with the environment.

Drawing upon principles from psychophysics, teleoperation, and sensory substitution, we use a series of human subject experiments to quantify the value of <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> feedback for an amputee wearing a trans-radial myoelectric prosthesis. Our findings demonstrate that both able-bodied individuals and amputees scale and coordinate their <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> for the anticipated weight of an object, that control and <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> feedback should be located on the same body site to improve stiffness recognition, and that <b>grip</b> <b>force</b> {{feedback is}} more useful than vision feedback in stiffness recognition through a prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether sensory and motor problems {{in patients with}} non-specific neck and upper extremity pain can be ascribed to a deficit of sensory-motor integration. Methods: <b>Grip</b> <b>force</b> control and adaptation were measured in 81 cases, 32 former cases and 39 healthy controls, during repetitive lifting and holding of an object. The object (300 g) was lifted vertically over 20 cm and held for 5 s, using the dominant arm (the affected arm in all cases). The object was novel to the subjects when lifted for the first time, and was lifted five times consecutively. <b>Grip</b> <b>forces</b> orthogonal to the object's surface and its vertical acceleration were measured. Results: Cases used significantly higher <b>grip</b> <b>forces</b> than both other groups, while vertical acceleration was not different. After the initial lift, all groups significantly reduced the maximum <b>grip</b> <b>force.</b> Conclusions: Subjects with neck and upper extremity pain consistently use higher <b>grip</b> <b>forces</b> than controls, but adjust <b>grip</b> <b>forces</b> by a similar amount after the first lift. Compensation of impaired sensory information rather than a general deficit in sensory-motor integration seems to account for these findings. Significance: Non-specific neck and upper extremity pain coincides with objectifiable changes in control of <b>grip</b> <b>force.</b> © 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology...|$|R
