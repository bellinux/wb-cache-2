She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I {{want to be around}} Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.|$|E

And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

[...] "He has asked me to come, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not struggle with the millions on his trampled lawn".

500|$|In 1983, Bill Parcells' {{first year}} as head coach, Woolfolk gained 1,225yards from {{scrimmage}} for the Giants (857yards rushing and 368yards receiving) -- more yards than any Giants running back in the previous ten years. [...] He also set the NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 43carries (for 159yards) on November 20, 1983. Woolfolk gained 115yards on 26carries {{in the first half}} alone and said after the game: [...] "I'm not as tired as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be when somebody told me how many carries I had." [...] Ironically, Woolfolk's 43-carry record was broken in 1988 by Jamie Morris, the same player who also broke Woolfolk's career rushing record at the University of Michigan.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Sensual World" [...] {{has been}} renamed [...] "Flower of the Mountain" [...] and {{contains}} a passage of Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy from James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Bush said, [...] "Originally when I wrote the song 'The Sensual World', I had used text {{from the end}} of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series: [...] "After watching Joe [...] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never want to produce a show of my own." [...] However, he realized that if he ever did, {{this would be the}} best approach: [...] "For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [...] all came together in [...] I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.|$|E

[...] At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told {{the rest of their}} family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. [...] Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. [...] Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, [...] "I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. [...] And then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone..." [...] According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.|$|E

When I first heard the news, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> lie down and die," [...] she wrote to her mother. Houston tried to help out by {{assuming}} care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1969 film, Yawar Mallku/Sangre de cóndor/Blood of the Condor, Bolivian {{director}} Jorge Sanjinés portrayed Peace Corps {{volunteers in}} the camp as arrogant, ethnocentric, and narrow-minded imperialists out to destroy Indian culture. One particularly powerful scene showed Indians attacking a clinic while the volunteers inside sterilized Indian women against their will. The film {{is thought to be}} at least partially responsible for the expulsion of the Peace Corps from Bolivia in 1971. Peace Corps volunteer Fred Krieger who was serving in Bolivia at the time said, [...] "It was an effective movie – emotionally very arousing – and it directly targeted Peace Corps volunteers. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be lynched before getting out of the theatre.

[...] John Hawkins listed Corsi as number three on his list of [...] "The Most Annoying People on the Right", and wrote: [...] "Nobody has worked harder {{to convince people that}} the completely moronic North American conspiracy theory is real than the right's version of Dylan Avery, kooky Jerome Corsi."

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1936 the Swedish {{composer}} Gösta Nystroem, that was curator at Göteborgs Konsthall 1934-36, organizes a scholarship to Billman. Billman was {{given the opportunity to}} study art in March and April in Antwerp. The journey gave inspiration for new motifs. But above all had the harbour environments strongly reminded him of his years as a sailor. Within a year after the trip he made some of his classic black and white woodcuts with sailor motifs such as: Through the Red Sea - Changing of the guard in the stokehole (1936) and The newly signed on sailors (1936), which is one of Billman's best-known woodcuts. About the woodcut [...] Stoker watch goes over deck in the storm (1936/37) the artist said: [...] "I remember the first scene I got inspiration from. It was when the watch came up and the boat was filled with water and there they stood up to their necks in water, so to speak. That <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> try to portray. But it took many years. I had stored such motifs." [...] "I've experienced all my images myself", Torsten Billman often underlined.|$|E

She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her at the train. [...] In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who [...] "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, [...] "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men...They all had to lie {{on top of me}} and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> die. Just thought I would die." [...] A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film A House Divided. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, [...] "What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Leatherface was {{released}} in 1939. Mahjabeen's looks and talent brought more opportunities, ever since that ugly beginning against her wishes. At the age of four she became the bread earner in the Bux family. In an interview in 1962, Meena Kumari explained that the fact she had been supporting her parents {{from the age of}} four gave her immense satisfaction. Kumari further said [...] "The first day I trotted along to work, I little imagined that I was saying goodbye to the normal pleasantries of childhood. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go to the studio for a few days and then go to the school, learn a few things and play and make merry like other children, but that was not to be". Mahjabeen was admitted into a regular school, but that was not for long, because the demands of work frequently interrupted her curricula. She never went to school in any meaningful sense, and her education was the result of private tuition, and more significantly the result of individual interest; in every sense she was self-educated. Kumari concentrated most on Urdu although she could get by in English and Hindi. Little Mahjabeen used to carry her children's books onto the sets and even while travelling with her parents on outstation shoots. On the sets, little Mahjabeen was nicknamed [...] "Reading Mahjabeen".|$|E
