5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to <b>end</b> <b>a</b> match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{political}} and military machinations conducted by the U.S., the Pathet Lao, and the North Vietnamese in Laos that are described in the History of Laos since 1945, a Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos was signed in Geneva, Switzerland on 23 July 1962. The agreement, an attempt to <b>end</b> <b>a</b> civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Mount Vision, the two roads {{parallel}} {{each other}} {{into the town}} of Hartwick, where both intersect with another highway crossing Otego Creek, CR11D. The roads enter the hamlet of Jones Crossing, intersecting with another crossroad, the locally maintained Jones Crossing Road. In the rural backdrop north of Jones Crossing, NY205 intersects with CR45's western terminus. The parallel alignments of NY205 and CR11 <b>end</b> <b>a</b> short distance to the north in the hamlet of Hartwick as CR11 enters the community on the east–west Main Street and intersects NY205 in the hamlet's center. CR11 leaves NY205 for good outside of Hartwick, continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown, while NY205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward into the town of Otsego.|$|E

James also became the youngest player to reach 29,000 career points in the NBA.|$|E

In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the <b>end</b> <b>a</b> much more modest conversion, lacking the flight deck, was carried out.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars at either <b>end,</b> <b>a</b> food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E

5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the <b>end.</b> <b>A</b> spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Filao was {{the most}} notable storm of the season, {{originating}} in late February off northern Madagascar.

The strongest cyclone of the season was Gasitao, which formed {{at the same time}} as Hely and attained peak winds of 150km/h (95mph).

5|$|Due to Caroline’s compact size, {{sustained}} winds only reached 48mph (78km/h) in Brownsville, Texas.

It canceled most of the Labor Day holiday season for South Padre Island, one of the busiest weekends for tourism on the island.
