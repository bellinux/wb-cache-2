40|$|We {{calculate}} the critical parameters for some simple quantum wells {{by means of}} the Riccati–Padé method. The original approach converges reasonably well for nonzero angular-momentum quantum number l but rather too slowly for the s states. We therefore propose a simple modification that yields remarkably accurate results for the latter case. The rate of convergence of both methods increases with l and decreases with the radial quantum number n. We compare RPM results with WKB ones for sufficiently large values of l. As illustrative examples we choose the one-dimensional and central-field <b>Gaussian</b> <b>wells</b> as well as the Yukawa potential. The application of perturbation theory {{by means of the}} RPM to a class of rational potentials yields interesting and baffling unphysical results. Fil: Fernández, Francisco Marcelo.

40|$|A primary {{challenge}} in unsupervised clustering using mixture models is {{the selection of}} a family of basis distributions flexible enough to succinctly represent the distributions of the target subpopulations. In this paper we introduce a new family of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>Well</b> distributions (GWDs) for clustering applications where the target subpopulations are characterized by hollow [hyper-]elliptical structures. We develop the primary theory pertaining to the GWD, including mixtures of GWDs, selection of prior distributions, and computationally efficient inference strategies using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, as compared to standard Gaussian mixture methods, for the case of immunofluorescence imaging analysis, emphasizing the improved interpretability and parsimony of the GWD-based model...|$|E
40|$|A {{nuclear spin}} {{can act as}} a quantum switch that turns on or off ultracold {{collisions}} between atoms even when there is neither interaction between nuclear spins nor between the nuclear and electron spins. This "exchange blockade" is a new mechanism for implementing quantum logic gates that arises from the symmetry of composite identical particles, rather than direct coupling between qubits. We study the implementation of the entangling √(SWAP) gate based on this mechanism for a model system of two atoms with ground electron configuration ^ 1 S_ 0, spin 1 / 2 nuclei, trapped in optical tweezers.

40|$|We derive optimal-work finite time {{protocols}} for a colloidal particle in a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>well</b> in {{the general}} non-Markovian underdamped regime in contact with a single reservoir. Optimal work protocols with and without measurements of position and velocity are shown to be linear in time. In order to treat the underdamped regime one must address forcing the particle at the start {{and at the end}} of a protocol, conditions which dominate the short time behaviour of the colloidal particle. We find that for protocols without measurement the least work by an external agent decreases linearly for forced start-stop conditions while those only forced at starting conditions are quadratic (slower) at short times, while both decrease asymptotically to zero for quais-static processes. When measurements are performed protocols with start-end forcing are still more efficient at short times but can be overtaken by start-only protocols at a threshold time. Measurement protocols derive work from the reservoir but always below the predicted by the Sagawa's generalization of the second law. Velocity measurement protocols are more efficient in deriving work than position measurements. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|A {{new family}} of {{one-dimensional}} quantum models is proposed {{in terms of}} new potentials with a Gaussian asymptotic behavior but approaching to {{the potential of the}} harmonic oscillator when x → 0. It is shown that, in the energy basis of the harmonic oscillator, the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian operators of these new models can be derived from generating functionals. Pacs 03. 65. Ge The progress in algebraic and numerical computation offers one new possibilities of analyzing new classical or quantum systems that can not be analytically solved. The Schrödinger equation with an attractive radial Gaussian potential was analyzed with different perturbation methods leading to numerical results of convenient accuracy [1]. Other quantum models with Gaussian barriers were considered in the theory of electronic transport in mesoscopic systems [2, 3]. Some time ago we studied a simple one-dimensional relativistic model of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>well</b> using generating functionals for finding the matrix elements of the Klein-Gordon operator in the energy basis of the non-relativistic harmonic oscillator (HO) [4]. In this framework computational methods allowed us to point out the structure of the discrete energy spectra of the Gaussian wells which indicates that inside the well the quantum motion is close to an harmonic one. Here we would like to continue this study {{in the case of the}} non-relativistic quantum system, looking for general one-dimensional models with pseudo-Gaussian potentials. Our purpose is to define a large family of models whose 1 potentials have a Gaussian asymptotic behavior but approaching to the HO potential near x ∼ 0. The second objective is to show how the method of generating functionals works in this case, helping us to find the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian operators of our models in the energy basis of HO.

Finally, various complex systems ranging from double-well potentials to random landscapes are generated from individually controlled optical traps.
