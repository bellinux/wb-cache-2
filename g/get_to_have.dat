She doesn't mind pushing the boundaries. She's very high maintenance, which is fun to play." [...] She also stated she enjoys Nicole's [...] "promiscuous side" [...] because {{she seems to have}} another boyfriend every week. James also enjoys the role because of this and the fact she gets so many [...] "pash" [...] scenes with other cast members.|$|E
500|$|Jammal Simms {{was hired}} as the tour's {{director}} and main choreographer. Octavious Terry served as an assistant for directing, meanwhile Dondraico Johnson assisted choreography. They, along with twelve other members, composed the tour's creative team. In total, the Wonder World Tour included 124 traveling workers, 19 truckloads of equipment, and 15 buses. The stage was quite {{different from that of}} the Best of Both Worlds Tour. It consisted of a rectangular main stage, which featured staircases that elevated the center of the stage, and a narrow runway, which connected the main stage to a B-stage that ran the length of the main stage. Regarding the stage, Cyrus noted that it was [...] "something not many people <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>have.</b> I'm able to move around to each side so there's no one person who feels like they don't have the best seat. Every seat is the best seat." [...] Six LED multi-screen video units were located throughout the stage; the three largest were placed as the upstage wall, while the other three were hung by rigs above the stage. The center unit consisted of three screens that faced outward; two others were hung right and left to the center unit, both were double faced toward the center of the venue at a 45° angle, while the backside faced the upper-seat audience. The structure of the video panels was designed by Sims to ensure that all seats within the 270° angle at each venue received an equal view of the video screens. Video content and lighting were designed by Seán Burke; the latter was provided by Production Resource Group (PRG).|$|E

2500|$|The actress later {{reflected}} on Grace's transformation. She told Ellie Hooper from Closer that Grace was a [...] "one dimensional" [...] character when she debuted. She observed a [...] "big old change" [...] and viewers could finally see her heart amongst the evil. She became friendlier {{as a result}} of mothering Curtis and writers ensured Grace had more comedy about her character. She dreams of a normal life even though it is not achievable for her given her past. She can be [...] "a little bit of a freak" [...] in her pursuit of the perfect family life, but ultimately Wall believed Grace would never get her [...] "happily ever after". Wall enjoyed the complexities of Grace, adding [...] "the best thing about her is that I still get to be the big evil baddie who’s not very nice, but at the same time, I get to be funny and I <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a love story." [...] Kirkwood later said that the newly family oriented Grace [...] "will be fighting for love and loyalty rather than bags of money." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{event in}} {{gymnastics}} performed on floor is called floor exercise. The English abbreviation {{for the event}} in gymnastics scoring is FX. In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. The floor event now occurs on a carpeted 12m × 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs generally called a [...] "spring" [...] floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event; Depending on the level, they may choose their own, or, if known as a [...] "," [...] default music must be played. Levels three to six the music {{is the same for}} each levels along with the skills within the routine. However, recently, the levels have switched. Now, levels 6-10 are optional levels and they <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> custom routines made. In the optional levels (levels six to ten) there are skill requirements for the routine but the athlete is able to pick her own music without any words. The routine should consist of tumbling passes, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or pivots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling passes that usually includes at least one flight element without hand support. Each level of gymnastics requires the athlete to perform a different number of tumbling passes. In level 7 in the United States, a gymnast is required to do 2–3, and in levels 8–10, at least 3–4 tumbling passes are required.|$|E

The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves' brains, by and by <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a little brains of their own, so as {{to be able to tell}} a calf's head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.

6000|$|A {{sound of}} bells, and of {{sniffing}} and scuffling, roused him; a large grey goat {{had come up}} and was smelling at his hair--the leader of a flock, that were soon all round him, solemnly curious, with their queer yellow oblong-pupilled eyes, and their quaint little beards and tails. Awfully decent beasts--and friendly! What jolly things to model! He lay still (having learnt from the fisherman, his guardian, that necessary habit {{in the presence of}} all beasts), while the leader sampled the flavour of his neck. The passage of that long rough tongue athwart his skin gave him an agreeable sensation, awakened a strange deep sense of comradeship. He restrained his desire to stroke the creature's nose. It appeared that they now all wished to taste his neck; but some were timid, and the touch of their tongues simply a tickle, so that he was compelled to laugh, and at that peculiar sound they withdrew and gazed at him. There seemed to be no one with them; then, at a little distance, quite motionless {{in the shade of a}} rock, he spied the goatherd, a boy about his own age. How lonely he must be up here all day! Perhaps he talked to his goats. He looked as if he might. One would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> queer thoughts up here, get to know the rocks, and clouds, and beasts, and what they all meant. The goatherd uttered a peculiar whistle, and something, Lennan could not tell exactly what, happened among the goats--a sort of [...] "Here, Sir!" [...] seemed to come from them. And then the goatherd moved out from the shade and went over to the edge of the plateau, and two of the goats that were feeding there thrust their noses into his hand, and rubbed themselves against his legs. The three looked beautiful standing there together on the edge against the sky....|$|E
