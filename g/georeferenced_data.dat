40|$|Data-to-text {{systems are}} Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems that {{generate}} textural summaries of raw numerical data. To date such systems have concentrated exclusively on time series data. This is despite the increasing use {{and availability of}} low cost Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which has made analysis of <b>georeferenced</b> <b>data</b> commonplace in many scientific areas. This thesis describes original {{research in the field}} of NLG by addressing the problem of automatically generating textual summaries of georeferenced data; that is, any data that has a reference to its location on the Earth’s surface. The postulation that data-to-text technology can generate textural summaries of <b>georeferenced</b> <b>data</b> of comparable quality to human written ones for the same data set provides its focus. This research has carried out {{in the context of the}} RoadSafe project, whose primary outcome was development of a date-to-text application for generating road maintenance weather forecasts. This thesis is a thorough investigation of the practical and theoretical issues involved in generating good quality textural summaries of <b>georeferenced</b> <b>data.</b> It begins by surveying the current state of the art in data-to-text and the challenges that <b>georeferenced</b> <b>data</b> poses to such systems.

40|$|A {{technique}} to automatically locate Ground Control Points (GCPs) in large aerial images is presented considering {{the availability of}} low accuracy direct <b>georeferencing</b> <b>data.</b> The approach is based on image chips of GCPs extracted from vertical terrestrial images. A strategy combining image matching techniques was implemented to select correct matches. These matches were used to define a 2 D transformation with which the GCP is projected close to its correct position, reducing the search space in the aerial image. Area-based matching with some refinements is used to locate GCPs with sub-pixel precision. Experiments were performed with multi-scale images and assessed with a bundle block adjustment simulating an indirect sensor orientation. The accuracy analysis was accomplished based on discrepancies obtained from GCPs and check points. The results were better than interactive measurements and a planimetric accuracy of 1 / 5 of the Ground Sample Distance (GSD) for the check points was achieved...|$|R

A practical test with GPS, INS and a digital camera on a helicopter is evaluated. The camera was not calibrated beforehand. Instead an on-the-job calibration had to be done with support from the GPS and INS measurements.
