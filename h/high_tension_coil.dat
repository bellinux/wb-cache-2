5000|$|A low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> is an {{electrical}} device {{used to create}} a spark across the points of an ignitor on early 1900s gasoline engines, generally flywheel engines, hit and miss engines, and other engines of that era. In modern electronic terms, a low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> is simply a large inductor, {{an electrical}} device that stores energy for brief periods. The term [...] "low tension" [...] was the terminology of the day used to differentiate it from the term [...] "high tension", and generally meant [...] "low voltage" [...] (tension) as opposed to [...] "high voltage" [...] (<b>tension).</b> <b>High</b> <b>tension</b> <b>coils</b> produce <b>high</b> voltages, generally meant to produce a spark across a spark plug.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} Argonne Tokamak Experimental Power Reactor (TEPR) design studies, a {{toroidal}} field (TF) coil {{system has}} been designed. NbTi {{was chosen as the}} most suitable superconductor and 8 T was regarded as a practical peak field level in this study. The 16 -coil design was chosen as a reasonable compromise between 2 percent field ripple and 3 m access gap. To minimize the coil structure and the bending moments on the conductor, a pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> shape is necessary. A correct approach for determining the pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> profile in a bumpy TF coil system is given. Verification of the pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> by a three- dimensional stress analysis is presented. For coil quench protection, a series- connected scheme is proposed. (auth...|$|R

50|$|A simpler device, the low <b>tension</b> <b>coil,</b> {{was already}} in use for {{stationary}} engines and spark-ignition gas engines. This was a simple iron-core inductor, used with a battery and a switch called a contact breaker. It had a single winding and so was not a transformer like the trembler coil. When the piston was at the right point, the contact breaker opened, breaking the battery current. Self-induction due to the collapsing magnetic field generated a high voltage pulse in the coil, which {{was applied to the}} spark plug. The drawback of the low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> was that the high ignition voltage was generated in the same circuit as the low voltage battery current flowed in.|$|R
50|$|A low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> for engine {{ignition}} {{is used in}} conjunction with a battery and an ignitor. The ignitor {{is no more than a}} set of contacts that reside inside the combustion chamber of the engine. A series circuit is made between the three components: battery connects to coil, second terminal on the coil connects to the ignitor, second terminal on the ignitor (usually connected electrically and mechanically to the engine itself) connects to the second terminal of the battery.|$|R

According to the {{characteristics}} of <b>coiling</b> <b>tension</b> control characteristics and the requirements of actual engineering, establish the mathematical model of the double closed loop control system and use the traditional PID to tuning the model parameters.

50|$|A low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of an iron core that has wire wrapped around it. The size of the iron core, the number of turns of wire, {{and the size of}} the wire determine the electrical properties of the coil. Terminals are provided to connect the coil into the ignition circuit. The wood ends are provided for mechanical stability, to provide for the terminal placement and to hold the wire on the coil over time. A cloth or tape covering is provided to protect the windings.|$|R
5000|$|An {{inductor}} {{attempts to}} maintain a constant current flow through it. If the current in the circuit in which the inductor is connected goes down for some reason, the voltage developed across the inductor will go up {{in an attempt to}} try to maintain the constant current. When used with an ignitor ignition system in an engine, there is current flow when the ignitor contacts are closed. When the ignitor contacts are opened by the mechanical parts of the engine, current flow is interrupted. Because the low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> wants to maintain that current flow, the voltage across the coil rapidly goes up (usually to several hundred volts). When the voltage rises high enough, the voltage will jump the still very small gap of the ignitor contacts and create a spark which ignites the fuel mixture in the engine. Since there is a finite amount of energy stored in the coil, as soon as the spark jumps the gap the voltage across the coil collapses. As soon as the engine rotates and the ignitor contacts again close, current starts to flow through the coil and it again stores energy for the next cycle. A good description and moving gif of a low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> in operation can be found on Harrys Old Engines Ignition Page ...|$|R

40|$|The film <b>High</b> <b>Tension</b> (2005) is {{a complex}} and powerfully {{threatening}} portrait of queer monstrosity and negativity.

This thesis aims to tease out the nuances of <b>High</b> <b>Tension</b> 2 ̆ 7 s subversive twist.

The film presents an image of queer monstrosity that performs what Michael Moon calls sexual disorientation, as well as a profoundly queer disidentification.

40|$|Aim. The {{objective}} {{of our work}} {{was to determine whether}} there is a difference in fMRI activation between patients with <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma (HTG) and those with normal tension glaucoma (NTG). Method. The sample consisted of eight patients with different stages of <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma (3 females aged 41 – 65 and 5 males aged 40 – 73 years) and eight patients, also with different stages of normal tension glaucoma (6 females aged 53 – 70 and 2 males aged 40 – 52 years). The control group consisted of eight healthy subjects (3 females aged 23 – 46 and 5 males aged 23 – 65 years). All underwent complete ophthalmological examination, including visual field, colour vision, and electrophysiological functions. The results were compared with fMRI images after stimulation with black/white (BW) and blue/yellow (BY) checkerboard and then statistically processed. Results. The authors analyzed the results of published studies on <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> versus normal tension glaucoma in the images obtained by fMRI. They concluded on the basis of electrophysiological examinations that in <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma, damage of the whole visual pathway occurs, starting from retinal ganglion cells up to the visual cortex. In normal tension glaucoma the response of ganglion cells is relatively normal. The pathology is found mainly in the visual pathway. For this reason, the authors carried out fMRI examinations in <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma patients and patients with normal tension glaucoma. They found that advancing stages of <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma cause progression of fMRI activity decrease. These relations were not observed in normal tension glaucoma cases.
