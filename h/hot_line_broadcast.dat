The producer, David Susskind, also appeared on-camera, but Davidson did not. [...] The host was Gore Vidal, and Dorothy Kilgallen appeared on most episodes. [...] <b>Hot</b> <b>Line</b> was a different show from Susskind's nationally known Open End talk show. <b>Hot</b> <b>Line</b> was the first television show to use the recently invented ten-second broadcast delay to amplify viewer phone calls on the air. Davidson screened the viewer phone calls. She also made the first approach {{to some of the}} people who appeared as guests on <b>Hot</b> <b>Line,</b> including Malcolm X, whom she invited for <b>Hot</b> <b>Line</b> immediately after he gave a speech at The Town Hall. The <b>Hot</b> <b>Line</b> telecast of 2 February 1965 turned out to be Malcolm's final television talk appearance during his lifetime, although he and his wife can be heard talking twelve days later on locally telecast newscast reports of the bombing of their home.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBroadcasting is {{the process}} of {{transmitting}} information from an originating node (processor) in a network to all other nodes in the network. A local broadcast scheme only allows a node to send information along single communication links to adjacent nodes, while a <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme allows nodes to use paths of several communication links to call distant nodes. The minimum time possible for broadcasting in a network of n nodes when no node is involved in more than one communication at any given time is ⌊ log n⌋ phases. Local broadcasting is not sufficient, in general, for broadcasting to be completed in minimum time; line broadcasting is always sufficient. An optimal <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> is a minimum-time broadcast that uses the smallest possible total number of communication links. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of optimal line broadcasting in cycles, and we develop efficient methods for constructing optimal <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> schemes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnder {{the line}} {{communication}} protocol, calls {{can be placed}} between pairs of non-adjacent sites over a path of lines connecting them; only one call can utilize a line at any time. This paper addresses questions regarding the cumulative cost, i. e., sum of lengths of calls, of broadcasting under the line protocol in path networks. Let Pn be the path with n vertices, and Cn be {{the cost of an}} optimal, <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme from a terminal vertex in path Pn. We show that a minimum-cost <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme from any source vertex in Pn has cost no more than Cn and no less than Cn − n + 2 for any n ⩾ 2 and any time t > [log 2 n]. We derive a closed-form expression for the minimum cost of a minimum-time <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> from a terminal vertex in certain paths and relate this to costs from nearby sources...|$|R
