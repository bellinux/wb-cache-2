5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping jacks in the ring, showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second fall as they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When Octagón entered the ring, Guerrero <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> feigning an apology for a moment, before poking Octagón in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and Octagón. Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving Octagón at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed Octagón, with Barr throwing Octagón up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, Octagón rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. Moments later, the unsuspecting Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> and threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped against the car, then fell on the curb, dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E
500|$|At No Way Out, Big Show made {{a return}} to the company after taking time off for {{injuries}} beginning in December 2006. In his return promotional interview, Big Show threatened to give Rey Mysterio a chokeslam. Professional boxer and WBC Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who was in attendance and a close friend of Mysterio's, came to his aid and confronted Big Show. After Big Show <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> Mayweather attacked him with a combination of punches, which caused Big Show to bleed from the nose and mouth. The following night on Raw, Big Show challenged Mayweather to a wrestling match, which Mayweather accepted. As part of the storyline, Big Show arranged an exhibition match with fighter Brandon Hill, who was similar in size and stature to Mayweather. Unimpressed with Show's display of dominance over Hill, Mayweather told Show that [...] "at WrestleMania, I'm going to break your jaw". At their weigh-in for their WrestleMania match, Show threw Mayweather into a crowd of wrestlers to emphasise the disparity in size.|$|E
5000|$|The 2011 NFL Rules {{state in}} Rule 7, Section 2, Article 1(c): [...] "An {{official}} shall declare the ball {{dead and the}} down ended … when a quarterback immediately <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> (or simulates <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee)</b> behind the line of scrimmage".|$|R
60|$|A soldier <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> {{leveling}} <b>his</b> gun. More soldiers arrived, {{bringing up}} their rifles and aiming.|$|R

2500|$|Khrushchev {{wrote in}} his memoirs that Beria had, {{immediately}} after Stalin's stroke, gone about [...] "spewing hatred against [...] and mocking him." [...] When Stalin showed signs of consciousness, Beria <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and kissed his hand. When Stalin fell unconscious again, Beria immediately stood and spat.|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} the final out, Orosco threw his glove {{high in the}} air and immediately <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> while catcher Gary Carter ran out to the mound to embrace him {{with the rest of the}} team following. A famous photo of the celebration was taken by Mets photographer George Kalinsky. For many years, this was the final scene shown during the ending credits of the syndicated Major League Baseball news show This Week in Baseball, and was replaced in 1992 by the final out of the division-clinching victory by the Atlanta Braves in 1991. [...] And then, the song: [...] "Success" [...] by The Weather Girls was played.|$|E
2500|$|Tibthorpe {{did not run}} as {{a two-year-old}} but showed {{a great deal of}} promise in training: {{according}} to one story Bill Scott dismounted after an early gallop and <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> to thank God [...] "that he has sent me a bloody clinker at last". In early 1846 the name of Tibthorpe began to appear in the betting lists for The Derby: after being quoted at odds of 100/1 in late January, he was backed down to 25/1 over the next month. Tibthorpe made his first racecourse appearance in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 28 April, starting at odds of 5/1 in a field of six runners. Bill Scott produced a [...] "perfect" [...] display of jockeyship to win a slowly run race on his own horse, foiling a major gamble on a horse named Tom Tulloch. Tibthorpe's appearance and performance led to suspicions of foul play. During this period there were several cases of four-year-old horses having their identities faked and running in races, notably the British Classics, which were confined to three-year-olds. Tibthorpe's win at Newmarket was only confirmed after an examination of his teeth, demanded by Tom Tulloch's owner Lord Maidstone, which established that he was indeed a three-year-old colt. The Yorkshire-trained horse was promoted to second favourite for the Derby, and Scott renamed him after Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet a notable breeder of Thoroughbreds based at Sledmere.|$|E
6000|$|Maqueda {{threw back}} her hood and turned {{so that the}} light of the moon fell full upon her, whereon the old man <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Gulden cursed in amaze while Pearce <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> with {{an exclamation}} of concern. Then both {{began to talk}} at once. Kells {{interrupted}} them by lifting a weak hand.|$|R
50|$|Candeloro's {{signature}} move, {{in which}} he spins and <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> on the ice, is not allowed in amateur competition. He developed the spin accidentally when he slipped <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> during a scratch spin.|$|R
60|$|He <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and hid {{his face}} against Bess, and grasped {{her with the}} hands of a {{drowning}} man.|$|E
6000|$|The servant who had {{followed}} me staggered back shuddering, and <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> [...] "Oh, my God!" [...] he said, [...] "it's Sir Percival!" ...|$|E
60|$|August Naab <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> and, as {{the members}} of his family bowed their heads, he {{extended}} his hands over them and over the food laid on the ground.|$|E
6000|$|Reaching the pair, {{this strange}} fellow <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> and raised <b>his</b> cap <b>to</b> Eve, the great {{lady of the}} Claverings--Red Eve, as they called her through that country-side. Then he spoke, in a low, husky voice: ...|$|R
60|$|After Stein {{had left}} the room Joseph bolted the door behind him. Then he came to where Barney {{stood in the center}} of the apartment, and <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> took the young man's hand in his and kissed it.|$|R
5000|$|Sett Ra, when {{struck with}} a high attack toward <b>his</b> head, would <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> as <b>his</b> head caught fire. The body of Sett Ra would then dissolve, the wraps falling {{to the ground and}} the {{smoldering}} shoulder armor tumbling forward.|$|R
60|$|Holley went so fast {{he almost}} ran, {{and he got}} ahead of Bostil. Finally several hundred yards out in the sage he halted, and again <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> Bostil and the riders hurried on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mrs. Pickett. I {{was told}} that--Good Lord!" [...] The young doctor <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> beside {{the body and}} raised one of the arms. After a moment he lowered it gently to the floor, {{and shook his head}} in grim resignation.|$|E
60|$|Neale <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and parted the {{tufts of}} sage. Lower down the crack opened up. On the ground, just inside that crack {{he saw the}} gleam of a mass of {{chestnut}} hair. His first flashing thought was that here was a scalp the red devils did not get.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sire," [...] said Hugh, <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> again, [...] "a boon. This de Noyon, {{your enemy}} and mine, has cheated and mocked me. Grant {{to me and}} my servant, Richard the archer, {{permission}} to follow after him and be avenged upon him." ...|$|R
5|$|Luongo {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> with <b>his</b> skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. Due to the style of play, groin injuries are common for butterfly goalies. Luongo suffered one during the 2008–09 season and missed 24 games.|$|R
50|$|Jue Yuan {{declares}} {{that he will}} kill the Emperor, and he asks the Sifu to train him in his Northern Shaolin kung fu. The Sifu tells him that Shaolin kung fu is for defense, not killing, and besides, Jue Yuan isn't a monk. Jue Yuan <b>drops</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> presses <b>his</b> palms together, and says {{that he wants to}} become a monk.|$|R
60|$|Then Burns {{signed for}} the last drop. Wayne {{delivered}} it with trepidation, for {{it was a hard}} curve to handle. Moore fell all over himself trying to hit it. Little Burns <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> to block the vicious curve. It struck the ground, and, glancing, boomed deep on the breast protector.|$|E
6000|$|... "Run!" [...] Erick cried. He struck out, {{knocking}} the rod from the Senior Leiter's hand. They were all running, soldiers shouting, flashing their lights, stumbling {{against each other}} in the darkness. Erick <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> groping frantically in the bushes. His fingers closed over the handle of the case and he leaped up. In Terran he shouted to Mara and Jan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Bess! I know Lassiter {{speaks the}} truth. For when I shot Oldring he <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and fought with unearthly power to speak. And he said: 'Man--why--didn't--you--wait? Bess was--' Then he fell dead. And I've been haunted by his look and words. Oh, Bess, what a strange, splendid thing for Oldring to do! It all seems impossible. But, dear, {{you really are}} not what you thought." ...|$|E
60|$|The meeting {{broke up}} so {{suddenly}} that Billy had <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>to</b> escape {{the observation of}} those within the cabin. As it was, Theriere, who had started to leave a second before the others, caught a fleeting glimpse of a face that quickly had been withdrawn from the cabin skylight as though its owner were fearful of detection.|$|R
5000|$|Benedict {{was one of}} {{the first}} great goalies in {{professional}} hockey and a great innovator in the sport. He was the first goalie <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>to</b> stop the puck along the ice; at the time, <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> the ice was illegal. This earned him the nickname [...] "Praying Benny." [...] The first rule change the NHL made legalized his playing style.|$|R
5000|$|Another visual gag is a {{switched}} image, {{often at}} the beginning of a film. A subsequent view of the scene shows something not viewed before. Switched movement may be the gag, such as Charlie Chaplin in The Pawnshop. Chaplin fights with his coworker and punches at him once. Their boss walks in mid-swing and Chaplin changes the motion to act like he was <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>to</b> scrub the floor.|$|R
6000|$|For some {{seconds the}} man stared in his terror, {{and while he}} stared Suzanne slipped from the hut. Then muttering, [...] "It is {{the spirit of the}} witch, Sihamba, who prophesied my death--her spirit that haunts me," [...] he <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> and, {{trembling}} like a leaf, turned to creep from the hut. Next second he was dead, dead without a sound, for Sihamba was a doctoress, and knew well where to thrust with the spear.|$|E
6000|$|The dress {{dropped from}} his hands, and the deadly bluish pallor--which every doctor who {{attended}} him had warned his housekeeper to dread--overspread his face slowly. Mrs. Lecount had not reckoned {{on such an}} answer to her question as she now saw in his cheeks. She hurried round to him, with the smelling-bottle in her hand. He <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and caught at her dress with the grasp of a drowning man. [...] "Save me!" [...] he gasped, in a hoarse, breathless whisper. [...] "Oh, Lecount, save me!" ...|$|E
60|$|How {{long this}} unequal combat {{might have gone}} on it is {{impossible}} to say; for when Dickey found that he was likely to have no mercy shown him so long as the audience was so well pleased, he <b>dropped</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> and then tried to roll off the stage. Of course, he could roll over no more easily than a turtle, but he had stopped the supposed sanguinary fight, and he was satisfied. Having no one on whom they could wreak their vengeance without considerable danger to themselves, the combatants dispersed, and not until then did Mopsey remember that the very one whom they had been using so roughly was the one upon whom they depended to close the performance.|$|E
5000|$|Rinne {{utilizes}} {{the popular}} butterfly style of goaltending, <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> early and using <b>his</b> leg pads <b>to</b> block low shot attempts. At 6' 5" [...] (1.96m), Rinne {{is currently the}} fifth-tallest goaltender in the NHL, which gives him tremendous reach with his stick and leg pads. For a tall goaltender, he utilizes great footwork, has a great glove hand, but plays with a smaller stick than most goaltenders.|$|R
60|$|He <b>dropped</b> on <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> {{but could}} speak no word; when {{he raised his}} eyes again the whole glorious company had vanished.|$|R
25|$|Back in Vienna he rose {{quickly in}} the {{academic}} ranks. In 1926 he earned the title of associate professor, with a promotion to full professor two years later. Five years after that, in 1933, he formally succeeded Hochstetter as the anatomical institute's director. At the ceremony installing him in that position, he acknowledged Hochstetter's tutelage by <b>dropping</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> {{in front of the}} older man and kissing him on the hand.|$|R
