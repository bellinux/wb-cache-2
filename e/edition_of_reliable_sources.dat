5000|$|While Bede was a Northumbrian {{partisan}} {{and spoke}} with prejudice against the native Britons, his Ecclesiastical History of the English People is highly regarded for its effort towards an accurate telling of history, and for its use <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources.</b> When passing along [...] "traditional" [...] information that lacks a historical foundation, Bede takes care to note it as such.|$|R
50|$|The {{reliability}} of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the Sabda <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources.</b> The schools <b>of</b> Hindu philosophy have debated if, how and when {{reliability of}} source can be objectively established. Gautama, in the Nyayasutras, offers a description for a <b>reliable</b> <b>source.</b> Some schools, such as Charvaka, state that this is never possible, and therefore Sabda in the Vedas or anyone else, can never be a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.|$|R

50|$|Samkhya is {{the oldest}} of the {{orthodox}} philosophical systems in Hinduism, with origins in the 1st millennium BCE. It is a rationalist school of Indian philosophy, and had a strong influence on other schools of Indian philosophies.

5000|$|In Indian philosophy, Yoga is, {{among other}} things, {{the name of}} one of the six āstika {{philosophical}} schools. [...] The Yoga philosophical system aligns closely with the dualist premises of the Samkhya school. The Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god (Ishvara), unlike Samkhya. The epistemology of the Yoga school, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six prāmaṇas as the means <b>of</b> gaining <b>reliable</b> knowledge: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference) and śabda (āptavacana, word/testimony <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources).</b>|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{controversial}} undertakings of Cortés and the scarcity <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> information about him, it has become difficult to assert anything definitive about his personality and motivations. Early lionizing of the conquistadors did not encourage deep examination of Cortés. Later reconsideration of the conquistadors' character {{in the context of}} modern anti-colonial sentiment also did little to expand understanding of Cortés as an individual. As a result of these historical trends, descriptions of Cortés tend to be simplistic, and either damning or idealizing.|$|R

This story has come to be considered a hoax, due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources</b> backing it up.|$|R
50|$|The {{researcher}} into genealogy in Sri Lanka, (as in {{the rest}} of the Indian subcontinent) faces a significant problem due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>source</b> material. Unlike in the west, where there has been a long tradition of documenting genealogical data (i.e.: births, marriages and deaths) from very early times, in Sri Lanka it is only after the advent of the Portuguese that such information was recorded systematically in the Parish records. These records were destroyed by the Portuguese to prevent it from falling into the hands of the advancing Dutch Army.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, {{the theatre}} was {{featured}} on Ghost Hunt, a New Zealand television show, {{as it is}} claimed that the theatre is haunted.

5000|$|The Naiyayikas (the Nyaya scholars) {{accepted}} four valid means (pramaṇa) {{of obtaining}} valid knowledge (pramana) - perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), comparison (upamāna) and word/testimony <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources</b> (śabda). The Nyaya scholars, {{along with those}} from other schools of Hinduism, also developed a theory of error, to methodically establish means to identify errors and {{the process by which}} errors are made in human pursuit of knowledge. These include Saṁśaya (समस्या, problems, inconsistencies, doubts) and Viparyaya (विपर्यय, contrariness, errors) which can be corrected or resolved by a systematic process of Tarka ( [...] तर्क, reasoning, technique).|$|R
5000|$|Samkhya or Sankhya (सांख्य, IAST: [...] ) {{is one of}} the six āstika {{schools of}} Hindu philosophy.

These include pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference) and śabda (āptavacana, word/testimony <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources).</b> Sometimes described as one of the rationalist schools of Indian philosophy, this ancient school's reliance on reason was exclusive but strong.|$|R
30|$|The initial {{requirement}} of experiment was identification <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>source</b> for dermatology images. Thus, dermoscopic images for analysis are acquired from Hospital Pedro Hispano database which are 8 bit RGB images of size 768 × 560 pixels. The ground truth {{is also available}} with manual segmentation for the comparison with automated segmentation. For the selection between different options in experiment 1, we utilized 45 images out of 200 images. However, segmentation of dermoscopic images by using proposed technique is done in experiment 2 and experiment 3 is performed to compare the acquired result with already existing approaches.|$|R

Despite a lack <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources,</b> there are legends about the earthquake from Tōhoku region to Bōsō Peninsula.

Research in this field is hampered by the secrecy of the DPRK regime and the dearth <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources.</b> Nonetheless, using Chinese- and English-language sources, Peng Wang and Stephan Blancke look at developments over the past decade, intensified counter-narcotics co-operation between the Chinese and South Korean police forces, {{and the failure of}} the North Korean government to control private involvement in the illicit drug business, which has had an unexpected outcome: a crystal-meth epidemic. These trends expose a severe threat to Northeast Asia and the wider international community...|$|R
