25|$|The {{understanding}} of friction was further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785). Coulomb investigated {{the influence of}} four main factors on friction: {{the nature of the}} materials in contact and their surface coatings; the extent of the surface area; the normal pressure (or load); and the length of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose). Coulomb further considered the influence of sliding velocity, temperature and humidity, in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction that had been proposed. The distinction between static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>friction</b> is made in Coulomb's friction law (see below), although this distinction was already drawn by Johann Andreas von Segner in 1758.|$|E
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, <b>dynamic</b> <b>friction</b> prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

Although chemical reactions induced the strong bonding of interface, they decayed the strength of fine fibers, resulting in occurrence of the welding brittleness. To enhance the fracture resistance, the carbon fiber reinforced metal (CFRM) joint device was successfully developed by using a duplex-coated carbon fiber felt. The high joint strength was obtained. The carbon fiber acted as a deformation resistance by fiber-reinforced mechanics.

In this study, based on statistical methods, a quantitative model is developed that describes the friction behaviour of human skin {{as a function of the}} subject characteristics, contact conditions, the properties of the counter material as well as environmental conditions. Aims Although the frictional behaviour of human skin is a multivariable problem, in literature the variables that are associated with skin friction have been studied using univariable methods. In this work, multivariable models for the static and <b>dynamic</b> coefficients of <b>friction</b> as well as for the hydration of the skin are presented. Materials & Methods A total of 634 skin-friction measurements were performed using a recently developed tribometer.

40|$|This paper focusses on the time-energy optimal path {{following}} for robots. This considers {{the problem of}} moving along a predetermined geometric path with a minimal trade-off between the motion time and the two major thermal energy losses in electric actuators. Theses losses consist of resistive electrical losses and mechanical friction losses. When only {{taking into account the}} electrical losses for a simplified robotic manipulator, a convex reformulation has been derived previously [1]. In this paper we include the <b>dynamic</b> joint <b>friction</b> losses into the objective. This also implies that we have to include the <b>dynamic</b> joint <b>friction</b> into the robot equations of motion, which appear in the torque constraints. Both the resulting objective and torque constraints are non-convex. The present paper proposes an efficient sequential convex programming (SCP) approach to solve the resulting optimal control problem. A key step here is to decompose the non-convex functions involved as a difference of convex functions. Numerical simulations illustrate the fast convergence of the proposed method in only a few SCP iterations, confirming the efficiency of the proposed framework. This high efficiency allows for an efficient tool to investigate the trade off between time-optimality and energy-optimality. status: publishe...|$|R
