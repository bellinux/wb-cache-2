5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E

A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E

5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land {{reclamation}} by filling in marshes, mud flats, and <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts {{took place during}} the 19th century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-acre (20ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects {{in the middle of the}} century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.|$|E

5|$|Henry's wealth {{allowed him}} to {{maintain}} what was probably the largest curia regis, or royal court, in Europe. His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised {{a number of major}} nobles and bishops, along with knights, domestic servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling the <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> the official structures and the king.|$|E
5|$|More {{numerous}} than new-build forts {{were old}} forts upgraded to higher defensive specifications. Thus the two parallel ditches common around earlier forts could {{be joined by}} excavating the ground between them. Projecting towers were added. Gates were either rebuilt with projecting towers or sealed off by constructing a large rectangular bastion. The walls were strengthened by doubling the old thickness. Upgraded forts were generally much larger than new-build. New forts were rarely over one hectare in size and were normally placed to fill <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> old forts and towns. However, {{not all of the}} old forts that continued {{to be used in the}} 4th century were upgraded e.g. the forts on Hadrian's Wall and some other forts in Britannia were not significantly modified.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's ring system. They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E

30|$|The {{findings}} of this paper are {{similar to that of}} the research by Yue (2010) who uses the data from household surveys to analyze the reasonable and unreasonable parts of the salary <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> monopoly industries and competition industries and finds the unjustified part of the salary <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> monopoly industries and competition industries contributes more than 48 %. In comparison, this thesis also inspects the influence of controlling human capital on the salary <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> monopoly industries and competition industries. From Table  6 we can also see the changes on the proportion of the unreasonable part of the salary <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> the monopoly industries and competition industries when there is only control on human capital. But no matter what decomposition methods we use, there is no reversion on the ratio between unreasonable and reasonable parts. In the salary gap, inexplicable part still takes up a key share.

5|$|The Kirtlandian is a North American land-vertebrate faunal {{age of the}} Cretaceous period, {{following}} the Judithian and succeeded by the Edmontonian.

Previously, only five land-vertebrate ages were identified from the Late Cretaceous. as identified by Loris S.
