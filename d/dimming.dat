5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global <b>dimming</b> are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global <b>dimming</b> can occur at the same time. Global <b>dimming</b> interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global <b>dimming</b> is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E

50|$|If V, W, X are finite-dimensional, then so is L(V, W; X). For X = F, i.e. {{bilinear}} forms, {{the dimension}} of this space is <b>dim</b> V × <b>dim</b> W (while the space L(V × W; F) of linear forms is of dimension <b>dim</b> V + <b>dim</b> W). To see this, choose a basis for V and W; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix B(ei, fj), and vice versa. Now, if X is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have <b>dim</b> L(V, W; X) = <b>dim</b> V × <b>dim</b> W × <b>dim</b> X.|$|R

5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically <b>dimming</b> it) and a radial velocity effect detected in Kepler-10's spectrum provided the information needed {{to prove that it}} was indeed a planet. An additional, longer-period <b>dimming</b> was detected in Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal could have some other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called Blender.|$|E

5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global <b>dimming.</b> Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction in solar radiation at the surface may have led to the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global <b>dimming,</b> the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global <b>dimming</b> may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

40|$|Deep Hα {{images of}} a sample of nearby late-type spiral galaxies have been {{analyzed}} to characterize the morphology and energetic significance of the "Diffuse Ionized Medium" (<b>DIM).</b> We find that the <b>DIM</b> properties can be reasonably unified {{as a function of}} relative surface brightness, by using a new method to quantify the <b>DIM</b> importance in galaxies. This new approach is more consistent with the fundamentally morphological definition of the <b>DIM</b> as being `Diffuse', compared to the traditional way adopted in previous studies that could only isolate the <b>DIM</b> based on an absolute surface brightness criterion. Our results suggest that the variation of the <b>DIM's</b> significance among the galaxies is small enough so that the fractional contribution of the <b>DIM</b> to the global Hα luminosity in the galaxies is fairly constant, as has been observed. We found a smooth structural transition from HII regions to the <b>DIM,</b> suggesting that the ionizing energy for the <b>DIM</b> mainly comes from HII regions.

5|$|The 2001 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography concluded that the imbalance between global <b>dimming</b> and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which could ultimately lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} underlying global <b>dimming</b> {{may also}} have regional effects. While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are downwind from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled.

5|$|Global <b>dimming</b> is {{the gradual}} {{reduction}} {{in the amount of}} global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface that was observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it has been estimated to be of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. However, after discounting an anomaly caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, a very slight reversal in the overall trend has been observed.|$|E
5|$|It became {{apparent}} to the investigating science team that radial velocity data alone could not prove {{the existence of}} HAT-P-33b. As such, photometric observations of HAT-P-33 were conducted using the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory's 1.2-meter telescope, which hosted the KeplerCam CCD instrument. This data was used to create the light curve of HAT-P-33. In doing so, a slight <b>dimming</b> was observed where HAT-P-33b was believed to have transited its star.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface and not really a global average. Whether <b>dimming</b> (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has {{been a bit of}} an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed <b>dimming,</b> after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting <b>dimming</b> is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions are found in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional <b>dimming</b> and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E
5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global <b>dimming,</b> but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in diurnal temperature variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E
