5|$|The Tales of Beedle the Bard first {{appeared}} as a fictional book in J. K. Rowling's 2007 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel of the Harry Potter series. The book is bequeathed to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore, former headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It {{is described as a}} popular collection of Wizarding children's fairy tales, so that while Ron Weasley is familiar with the stories, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had not previously <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> due to their non-magical upbringing.|$|E

25|$|The Raetians {{are first}} {{mentioned}} (but only incidentally) by Polybius, and little is <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> till {{after the end}} of the Republic. There is little doubt, however, that they retained their independence until their subjugation in 15 BC by Tiberius and Drusus.|$|E

25|$|There {{once was}} a fourth primary pantheon, the Eastern Pantheon, based on the Greek pantheon led by Zeus.

25|$|Bevan joined Johnny Marr and the Healers in 2000. As a side project, {{he formed}} the band Shep (which {{included}} Winterhart on drums). The band played {{a handful of}} gigs in 2001–2002 and released some excerpts of recorded music via the web but nothing further was <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> after 2003. Winterhart joined the band , who split in 2001. He also drummed on an album by Aqualung {{as well as being}} part of Shep. Darlington joined Oasis in 2002 as a touring keyboardist (though not an official band member), and remained in that role until the band's split in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Custer {{embarked}} on his expedition with 1000-1200 men, in 110 wagons with numerous horses and cattle of the 7th Cavalry, along with artillery {{and two months}} food supply. The expedition also took a number of Native American scouts led by Bloody Knife and Lean Bear. At the time, the Black Hills were relatively unknown, with few white expeditions ever returning from them The commander of Custer's engineering corps, Captain Hardy, assured {{him that he had}} <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and had them marked on his maps, but had never entered them during his earlier expeditions. En route to the Black Hills, Custer's party managed to locate the track of Hardy's group when they spotted two lines of sunflowers that had grown along the ruts of his passing wagons.|$|E

25|$|The Numayrids were an Arab dynasty {{based in}} Diyar Mudar (western Upper Mesopotamia). They were emirs (princes) of their namesake tribe, the Banu Numayr. The senior {{branch of the}} dynasty, founded by Waththab ibn Sabiq in 990, more or less {{continuously}} ruled the Euphrates cities of Harran, Saruj and Raqqa until the late 11th century. In {{the early part of}} Waththab's reign (990–1019), the Numayrids also seized Edessa, until the Byzantines conquered it in the early 1030s. In 1062, the Numayrids lost Raqqa to their distant kinsmen and erstwhile allies, the Mirdasids, while by 1081, their capital Harran and nearby Saruj were conquered by the Turkish Seljuks and their Arab Uqaylid allies. Numayrid emirs continued to hold isolated fortresses in Upper Mesopotamia, such as Qal'at an-Najm and Sinn Ibn Utayr near Samosata until the early 12th century, but nothing is <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> after 1120.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} in their early performances as [...] "the New Yardbirds" [...] and was featured as their opening number in Led Zeppelin's 1968 and 1969 tours, and was included on several bootleg albums. [...] In an interview, early MTV video host J.J. Jackson, who pointed out {{that he does not}} characterize Led Zeppelin's music as heavy metal, described a bootleg recording from their first American tour, [...] "if this were the only recording somebody ever <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> it doesn't get much more 'heavy metal' sounding than this, does it?" [...] They later revived it for their final tour [...] "Over Europe" [...] in 1980. Though a studio version was never recorded by Led Zeppelin, as a solo artist Page recorded, during his Outrider sessions in 1988, a version similar to the Led Zeppelin 1980 version.|$|E
500|$|Built in 1935, Girl Pat was the {{property}} of the Marstrand Fishing Company of Grimsby. On 1 April 1936, Orsborne, with a crew of four and his brother James as a , took the vessel out on what the owners authorised as a routine North Sea fishing trip of two to three weeks' duration. After leaving port, Orsborne informed the crew that they were going on an extended cruise in more southerly waters. Nothing more was <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> until mid-May, when the owners, who had by then assumed the vessel lost, received invoices relating to its repair and reprovisioning in the northern Spanish port of Corcubión. Subsequent sightings placed her in the Savage Islands, at Dakar in Senegal, and Îles du Salut off the coast of French Guiana in South America. The captain's main means of navigation during a voyage of more than [...] was a sixpenny school atlas and a compass. At one point Girl Pat was reported wrecked in the Bahamas, with all hands lost. After the vessel's capture and detention following a chase outside Georgetown on 19 June, Orsborne and his crew were hailed as heroes in the world's press.|$|E

500|$|Still in the Bay Area, Guard and Reynolds had {{organized}} themselves somewhat more formally into an entity named [...] "The Kingston Quartet" [...] with friends bassist Joe Gannon and vocalist Barbara Bogue, though as {{before they were}} often joined in their performances by other friends. At one engagement at Redwood City's Cracked Pot beer garden, they met a young San Francisco publicist named Frank Werber, who had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> from a local entertainment reporter. Werber liked the group's raw energy but did not consider them refined enough to want to represent them as an agent or manager at that point, though he left his telephone number with Guard. Some weeks later (and following a brief period in which Reynolds was temporarily replaced in the quartet by Don MacArthur), Guard and Reynolds invited Werber to a performance of the group at the Italian Village Restaurant in San Francisco, where Werber was so impressed by the group's progress that he agreed to manage them provided they replace Gannon, in whose professional potential Werber had no faith. Bogue left with Gannon, and Guard, Reynolds, and Werber invited Shane to rejoin the now more formally organized band. Shane, who had been performing part-time as a solo act at night in Honolulu, readily assented {{and returned to the}} mainland in early March 1957.|$|E
2500|$|Co-star George Clooney also {{expressed}} initial {{reservations about the}} choice of Jonze.

2500|$|... "His arms bear a {{resemblance}} to the armour of his time, quite unlike the Mycenaean, although he persistently casts them in antiquated bronze, not iron. His gods had temples, and the Mycenaeans built none, whereas the latter constructed great vaulted tombs to bury their chieftains in and the poet cremates his. A neat little touch {{is provided by the}} battle chariots. Homer had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> but he did not really visualize what one did with chariots in a war. So his heroes normally drove from their tents a mile or less away, carefully dismounted, and then proceeded to battle on foot." ...|$|E

2500|$|We do {{not know}} {{anything}} about them, except some work in the LEP. We first <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> when Commander Root [...] "doused his cigar in the coffee cup of a passing gremlin" [...] just before he saw the footage of Captain Holly Short's kidnap in the first book. Also, as Root was in the terminal {{on his way to}} Fowl Manor, the attendant is being mobbed by a large amount of gremlins. [...] It's also possible that in the graphic novel a gremlin is seen attaching an arm patch to Root as they prepare to head to Fowl Manor. They have also been mentioned when Commander Root slapped at a paramedic gremlin who was applying burn salve to his forehead after being burnt on a whaling ship in book one page 123. Gremlin could also be another name for goblin as gremlins only appear in the first book. It Is also likely that they are related to goblins, but more intelligent.|$|E
2500|$|There is, however, {{very clear}} {{evidence}} that Eleanor's property dealings made her widely unpopular. John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury warned Eleanor that her activities in the land market and her association with the highly unpopular moneylenders caused outcry, gossip, rumour and scandal across the realm. [...] Given the chroniclers' passages quoted above, the accusation is indeed borne out by contemporary writers. Peckham also warned her of complaints against her officials' demands upon her tenants. Eleanor must {{have been aware of}} the truth of such reports since, on her deathbed, she asked Edward to name justices to examine her officials' actions and make reparations. The surviving proceedings from this inquest reveal a pattern of ruthless exactions, often (but not always) without Eleanor's knowledge. Her executors' financial accounts record the payments of reparations to many of those who brought actions before the judicial proceedings in 1291. [...] In her lifetime, Eleanor had righted such wrongs when she <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and her deathbed request of Edward indicates that she knew, suspected, or feared, that her officials had perpetrated many more transgressions than were ever reported to her.|$|E
2500|$|Freudenthal {{points out}} the analogy between Philo's ideas and those of Hoshaiah, and W. Bacher expresses his opinion that if Hoshaiah had not himself read the philosopher's works, he at least had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> from Origen, the most {{important}} champion of Philo (J. Q. R. iii. 357). In a dialogue with Hoshaiah regarding circumcision, a [...] "philosopher" [...] (identified as Origen by Bacher) asked: [...] "If the rite possesses such virtue, why did not God create the first man circumcised?" [...] Hoshaiah replied that man, with all things created on the first six days, needs improving and perfecting, and that circumcision conduces to perfection (Gen. R. xi. 6). Bacher quotes a passage in which Hoshaiah refuted the incarnation dogma: [...] "When God created Adam the angels mistook him for a deity and wished to sing the hymn 'Holy! Holy! Holy!' But when God put Adam to sleep they knew him to be mortal, as the prophet said: 'Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?'" [...] (Isa. ii. 22; Gen. R. viii. 10).|$|E

2500|$|Geffen Records {{bought out}} the band's {{contract}} with Enigma Records in 1989 and released the third Death Angel album, Act III, in 1990. Produced by Max Norman (who had previously worked with Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth, Savatage, Fates Warning and Loudness), the album showcased the band's newfound use of full-band backing vocals, while fusing elements of funk, thrash, and heavy metal {{with the use}} of acoustic guitars to give the album a varied feel, while staying true to the group's heavy roots. The album featured the singles [...] "Seemingly Endless Time" [...] and [...] "A Room with a View" [...] (a ballad sung mostly by guitarist Rob Cavestany), and both songs also received airplay on Headbangers Ball, but a mainstream breakthrough still proved elusive. (The band released the [...] "A Room with a View" [...] video and single under the name [...] "D.A.," [...] and Cavestany explained to a reporter {{at the time that he}} now found the band's original name [...] "Restricting. The name Death Angel seems to imply hardcore thrash gloom-and-doom death metal, and we're not like that at all. If I were presented with 10 records, and one of them was by a band called Death Angel, and I'd never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> I'd stick that one on the bottom!") ...|$|E
2500|$|As [...] "In Dreams" [...] was {{released}} in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} the UK in top billing with the Beatles, whose popularity was on the rise. When he arrived in Britain, however, he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and, annoyed, asked rhetorically, [...] "What's a Beatle anyway?" [...] to which John Lennon replied, after tapping his shoulder, [...] "I am". On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy, Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through 14 encores. Finally, when the audience began chanting [...] "We want Roy!" [...] again, Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back. Starr later said, [...] "In Glasgow, we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything." [...] Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work. Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.|$|E
