30|$|Hardcopy <b>fire</b> <b>reports</b> from 1942 to {{the present}} contain {{narratives}} recorded by firefighters or the local park ranger (often the same individual) {{at the time of}} the fire, or shortly thereafter. Many of these narratives are rich with information about fire behavior, local vegetation, and fuel conditions. They often contain detailed descriptions of weather conditions, <b>fire</b> progression, scouting <b>reports,</b> and management actions. All <b>fire</b> <b>reports</b> for lightning-caused <b>fires</b> were read and those with detailed narratives were identified. This subset was evaluated for use as case studies. To insure that the sample fires spanned the range of management policies, at least one fire per decade from the 1940 s to the 1980 s with a duration greater than 4.5 days was selected. <b>Fire</b> <b>reporting</b> and management changes (e.g., narratives with little or no description of the vegetation; indirect fire line construction) in the 1980 s made it difficult to discern fire behavior characteristics useful for case studies from this decade.|$|R

5000|$|Fires {{detected}} {{from space}} are already {{too large to}} make accurate assessments for control. Cell phones in wilderness areas still suffer from lack of signal. Today, some fire lookout towers remain in service, because having human eyes being able to detect smoke and call in the <b>fire</b> <b>report</b> allows fire management officials to decide early how the fire is to be managed. The more modern policy is to [...] "manage fire", not simply to suppress it. Fire lookout towers provide a reduction in time of fire detection to time of fire management assessment.|$|E

50|$|Jan. 11, 1985, Sweatt {{finished}} his late shift {{as a cook}} {{at one of the}} Roy Rogers Restaurants and followed a male stranger in his 30s, whom he found attractive, to his house. Sweatt actually had a desire to meet him. Wanting to see the stranger again, Sweatt went home and returned to his house with a 2-liter soda bottle filled with gasoline. From the front porch of the stranger's house, he poured the gasoline under the front door, and lit it. On {{the second floor of the}} house, the stranger (Roy Picott) and his wife, daughter and stepdaughter, were all sleeping. His son and stepson were asleep in the basement and were unharmed. The others suffered severe burn injuries and his wife, Bessie Mae Duncan was killed. The official <b>fire</b> <b>report</b> at the time mistakenly blamed a dropped cigarette for the reason the fire started.|$|E
50|$|It is {{revealed}} in the series finale that Lt. Ken ("Lou") Shea is killed in the explosion, with {{the other members of}} Ladder 62 survived with relatively minor injuries. (The episode starts, however, as if it's the other way around, with Lou walking with a cane to give a eulogy for the other guys, only to find it to be a dream Tommy was having.) After he assumes the Lieutenant's position and completes the scene of the <b>fire</b> <b>report,</b> Tommy puts in his retirement papers and announces his intention to retire from active duty. An altercation at a playground to which he had taken Wyatt calls into question his ability to adapt to civilian life. After delivering his infant son at the family's apartment, Janet encourages Tommy to return to 62 Truck. The final scenes following Lou's funeral show Tommy giving a passionate speech about courage and the call of being a firefighter to a group of FDNY recruits at the New York City Fire Academy, as the other members of 62 Truck look on. Tommy turns over the floor to his new commanding officer, the newly promoted Lieutenant Franco Rivera, who begins to berate the probies as Tommy drives off in his truck while having a conversation with Lou's ghost.|$|E

50|$|After {{the fire}} had been extinguished, {{businesses}} affected by the <b>fire</b> <b>reported</b> that items were missing from their businesses.

30|$|Distinct {{patterns}} in fire behavior were apparent between suppressed and unsuppressed lightning-caused fires. <b>Fire</b> <b>report</b> narratives provided examples of fires persisting through precipitation events and becoming active after periods of dormancy.

They have been organized into three groups: persistence through precipitation events, emergence from dormancy, and large unsuppressed fires.|$|E
