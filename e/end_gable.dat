5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and Episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an <b>end</b> <b>gable,</b> as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the Baroque extravagance in church building seen on the continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II. The Gothic windows may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the existing common framework of new churches.|$|E

As a result, there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches. The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance. The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith, who had become a Jesuit in his youth. These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in Greyfriars Kirkyard, a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by Donato Bramante (1444–1514). The Latin Cross form, increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's Canongate Kirk (1688–90), but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked up, making it, in effect, a T-plan.|$|E

40|$|Solarus is {{one company}} in Sweden which is {{developing}} solar collectors. The type of collector that is {{developed at the}} moment is an asymmetrical low-concentrating PV/T Collector that can produce both electrical and thermal power. This collector consists of two similar troughs where each trough has one absorber and PV cells at the top and the bottom of the absorber. The main purpose of this thesis work is to investigate the performance of PV/T collector from Solarus with two different sides, transparent and reflective <b>end</b> <b>gables.</b> Temperature dependency is also interesting to be analyzed in order to see the difference power output in various temperatures. Doing literature study, preparing the test rig, installing PV/T collectors into test stand, and solving the problems are the way how this thesis works. Finding proper control valves, removing air bubbles, making new fitting, and building new support stands are the parts of troubleshooting that has already been done. When all the systems are ready, measurement can be performed. The first task was to figure out the I-V curve for the PV cells. After that, daily performance was done for both troughs with transparent and reflective <b>end</b> <b>gables.</b> During that measurement, the flow rate was set constant of 25 l/h. The last experiment is varying the flow rate to get different temperature for PV cells. There is no significant difference in electrical output between the trough which is using transparent and reflective <b>end</b> <b>gables.</b> Solarus should review of these <b>end</b> <b>gables</b> again especially for economic issue. The other experiments such as incident angle modifier (IAM) and trajectory movement should be performed and analyzed to improve the performance of the collector. For example, by modifying the IAM, the maximum angle can be found for this type of collector because in this thesis work, only fixed angle or 36 ° was used. Both transversal and longitudinal IAM should be performed and analyzed for optimizing this collector. Moving the collector could not be performed because of the limitation of the test stand. By turning out the collector to the sun means the collector will receive more direct than beam radiation. The direct radiation is much more important for this low concentrating collector than beam radiatio...|$|R

50|$|Architecturally, the Kirk has a Dutch-style <b>end</b> <b>gable</b> and a curious, small doric-columned portico {{over the}} entrance. The <b>end</b> <b>gable</b> is {{topped with a}} golden cross inside a pair of antlers, the now {{obsolete}} coat of arms of the Canongate, first placed on {{the apex of the}} roof in 1824 and replaced by those from a stag shot at Balmoral by King George VI in 1949. The Kirk's interior has a cruciform layout (highly unusual for a post-Reformation, pre-Victorian Church of Scotland building). The Kirk's interior was extensively remodelled in 1882, with the inclusion of a pipe organ and a central pulpit. These unsympathetic alterations were removed in the early 1950s, along with the galleries. The resulting reordering considerably increased the levels of light; the original dignified simplicity of the Kirk was able to be appreciated once more. The Kirk was further restored in 1991 by the Stewart Todd partnership, followed by the installation of a new Danish-built Frobenius pipe organ in 1998, in memory of the late Very Rev Dr Ronald Selby Wright. This was the 1000th organ to be built by the Frobenius company.|$|E
