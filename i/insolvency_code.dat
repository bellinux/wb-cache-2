40|$|Unitary {{insolvency}} proceeding was {{the core}} of <b>insolvency</b> <b>code</b> reformation, {{that has been in}} effect since 1991. This law replaced former bankruptcy code and compensation code. The pattern was set by American Chapter 11 US Bankruptcy codes. One of the main goals was to create legal system that would enable to reorganize companies in difficulties and so protect values and jobs. German insolvency law proposes in fact two reorganisation modes. Reorganization according to an insolvency plan and transferred reorganization (asset deals). Especially the transferred reorganization is very popular in practise because of quite fast process and risk and former burden elimination. Twenty years application of this legal regulation proved the <b>insolvency</b> <b>code</b> application in practise. The <b>insolvency</b> <b>code</b> provided many companies second chance. In spite of that, a critical approach is necessary as well as realisation of limits and problems that appear in practise. Two decades experience with companies' reorganization in Germany could be an inspiration for solving critical situations in Czech companies and for Czech insolvency law as well. reorganization, reorganizace, insolvency law, company crisis, German <b>insolvency</b> <b>code,</b> reorganization plan, insolvenční zákon, podniková krize, německý insolvenční řád, plán reorganizace...|$|E

30|$|Motivated by the {{insolvency}} administrator compensation {{observed in}} Germany {{and several other}} European countries, our setting was restricted to a linear contract based on the liquidation and continuing value so far. In the following, we look how the results change when the continuation value is the insolvency administrator’s private information and, thus, not contractible. Therefore, the compensation is restricted to fixed payments conditional on liquidation (b_ 0) and continuation (b_ 1). Table 1 in Appendix A shows that fixed payments as insolvency administrator compensation are also common in several European <b>insolvency</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{essential}} {{result in}} the preceding two sections states that insolvency procedures coordinated by a better-informed insolvency administrator will never simultaneously achieve optimal creditor satisfaction and no filtering failure if the insolvency administrator’s compensation is designed as typical in many <b>insolvency</b> <b>codes.</b> The driving force behind this result is {{a conflict of interest}} between the creditor and the better-informed insolvency administrator that originates from uncompensated costs and non-monetary benefits. As discussed in the model description above, these typically represent liability risks and non-monetary benefits, such as building a valuable reputation from reorganizing and continuing the insolvent firm.|$|R
30|$|Motivated by the {{discussion}} of the German <b>insolvency</b> <b>code,</b> we assume that the insolvency administrator’s payoff is proportional to the value realized in the insolvency procedure. 3 The shares can depend on liquidation and continuation and are denoted as β _ 0 (liquidation) and β _ 1 (continuation). To keep things simple, we abstract from any direct expenses of the insolvency administrator for preparing and performing the plan if the plan is accepted by the creditors and implemented.|$|E
40|$|This thesis empirically {{investigates the}} United Kingdom (UK) <b>insolvency</b> <b>code</b> by {{focusing}} on the formal procedures available to distressed firms in the UK. The UK <b>insolvency</b> <b>code</b> is characterised as a creditor-oriented system that enforces a binding agreement between the company and the creditors with a view to maximising payouts to the creditors. However, the government has introduced two major legislative changes – the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Enterprise Act 2002 – to move the UK <b>insolvency</b> <b>code</b> away from its creditor-orientation and towards a system that will increase the chances of distressed, but viable, firms in the UK to reorganise. The introduction of the Insolvency Act 1986 paved the way for distressed companies in the UK to enter into a formal procedure (administration) specifically introduced as a means of encouraging a culture of reorganisation for distressed firms in the UK. This thesis investigates the functioning of the UK code, {{by focusing on}} the two main formal procedures available to distressed firms (administration and administrative receivership) after the introduction of the 1986 Act. The introduction of the Enterprise Act 2002 resulted to the abolition of the administrative receivership procedure while maintaining the administration procedure as the key formal rescue procedure in the UK <b>insolvency</b> <b>code.</b> Hence, conducting research in the UK formal insolvency procedure is important as it provides empirical evidence on the administration procedure, which is now the main rescue vehicle under the Enterprise Act 2002. The thesis focuses on the post- 1986 regime in the UK. It consists of 8 chapters including 3 empirical chapters. Chapter 5 examines a large sample of UK firms that initiated administration or administrative receivership procedures between 1996 and 2001. The aim is to investigate the choice of the resolution form between administration and administrative receivership. The main research question is to investigate whether the newly introduced administration procedure catered for firms with a different set of financial and other characteristics to those that entered administrative receivership. The findings show that there are some distinguishing characteristics between firms entering administration and those entering administrative receivership, implying that administrative receivership was not necessarily the most appropriate insolvency procedure for all distressed firms. Chapter 6 examines a sample of UK firms that entered administration between 1996 and 2001. The aim of this chapter is to investigate the differences between firms that reorganised in administration versus those that liquidate. The key issue here is whether administration procedure can differentiate between firms potentially likely to survive and those likely to fail. The findings show that there are significant differences between firms that reorganise and those that fail in administration, suggesting that the administration procedure is able to discriminate between viable and non-viable firms. Chapter 7 examines the subsequent performance of UK firms that reorganised in administration between 1996 and 2001 relative to a matched sample firms from the same industry and of relatively the same size. The aim was to assess the subsequent performance of companies that reorganise in administration using several key ratios, covering the period from two years prior to failure until three years afterwards. The results show significant improvements in the financial performance of reorganised firms, relative to a matched sample firms, during the period after entering administration. In summary, these results show the importance of introducing the administration procedure in the Insolvency Act 1986. Prior to this date, there was the possibility that some of those firms that reorganised in administration post- 1986 might have been liquidated as there was no formal procedure aiming to reorganise distressed firms at that time. The findings clearly show the potential of the administration procedure in attracting distressed firms capable of reorganising. That procedure has now become the foundation upon which the UK <b>insolvency</b> <b>code</b> is built as indicated by the Enterprise Act 2002. However, having said that, the 1986 system also opened the way for severely distressed companies that should have been liquidated speedily in administrative receivership to attempt reorganisation in administration, thus wasting those firms’ already severely depleted resources further. In my opinion, the Enterprise Act 2002 should safeguard against this by putting in place procedures to prevent economically distressed companies from attempting to reorganise in administration...|$|E
30|$|According to German {{bankruptcy}} law, an insolvency administrator’s compensation {{depends on}} {{the total amount of}} the insolvency assets realized in the insolvency procedure and on the compensation parameters defined by the <b>insolvency</b> <b>code.</b> The monetary compensation is typically defined as a share of the realized assets (Sec. 1 et seq. Insolvenzrechtliche Verguetungsverodnung (InsVV)). From this compensation, the insolvency administrator has to pay his general administrative costs (Sec. 4 InsVV).

The identification of these elements is carried out by making reference to the types of deeds that, following taken legal action, can entail liability and the coverage of the debts by the members of the managing body as well as by other persons having contributed to the debtor's state of insolvency. The analysis of the deeds concentrates around two connected centers of interest: The analysis of the deeds such as they are regulated by the two regulations and the case where for certain deeds there need to be identified the elements of repeatability in the two regulations and then the relevant case-law applicable for the respective deed is analyzed.

30|$|The {{insolvency}} administrator is {{of particular}} importance in the German Insolvency Code; therefore, we use the German insolvency procedure {{as the basis for}} our analysis. Nonetheless, our study is not limited to Germany, as insolvency administrators are common in many <b>insolvency</b> <b>codes.</b> 1 German <b>insolvency</b> proceedings begin after creditors or the management of the bankrupt firm declare insolvency. The reasons for such a declaration are illiquidity, impeding illiquidity or over-indebtedness (Sec. 16 et seq. Insolvenzordnung (InsO)). In a next step, an insolvency judge examines whether the remaining assets are sufficient to cover the insolvency costs (Sec. 26 InsO and Haarmeyer, in: Kirchhof et al. (2014), to Sec. 26, Note 11) and delegates the responsibility and management of the bankrupt firm to an insolvency administrator (Sec. 27 (1) InsO). Thereafter, the insolvency administrator must continue operations, secure remaining assets and develop options {{for the future of the}} firm. During this time, the insolvency administrator privately obtains information about the viability and conditions of the firm and therefore learns whether a liquidation or continuation of the bankrupt firm is beneficial.|$|R

40|$|Although {{previous}} research generally finds bankruptcy prediction models to outperformauditors' views on going concern, accuracy in identifying failing companies is lower. Recent research questions whether bankruptcy {{is the best}} proxy for assessing going concern, since filing for bankruptcy is not synonymous with the invalidity of the going concern assumption. Furthermore, in contrast to debtor oriented countries such as the US, liquidation {{is the most likely}} outcome of corporate insolvency in creditor oriented countries such as the UK, Germany, Australia and New Zealand. This suggests that bankruptcy prediction models have limited use for assessing going concern in creditor oriented countries. Previous research hasnot recognised this distinction between corporate bankruptcy and liquidation in developing statistical models as an audit tool for assessing going concern. This study examines the efficacy of a corporate liquidation model and a benchmark bankruptcy prediction model for assessing company liquidation. It finds that the liquidation model is more accurate in predicting company liquidations in comparison with the benchmark bankruptcy prediction model. Most importantly.

40|$|The {{practice}} of German companies {{to indulge in}} forum shopping in England to achieve beneficial treatment under English insolvency proceedings has encouraged the German Government to make significant changes to German insolvency laws by introducing new legislation {{in the form of}} the Law for the Further Facilitation of the Rehabilitation of Companies (“Gesetz zur weiteren Erleichterung der Sanierung von Unternehmen” “ESUG“). The Act states that the impetus for the reform was the move of German companies to England which started a general discussion of “Germany, as a restructuring jurisdiction” (“Sanierungsstandort Deutschland”). Such forum shopping activities increased the awareness of the perceived weaknesses of the German system. This research looks at forum shopping from a Darwinian perspective. Germany and England as Member States of the European Union compete with each other as movement of capital to another Member State has a negative effect on the country’s economy. A reputation as a “bad restructuring jurisdiction” has an impact on the choice of business location and could act as a disincentive to company incorporations in Germany. Freedom of establishment allows companies to choose a regime which fulfils their needs, the Member States have to be motivated to attract companies and be willing to adapt to changes to keep up with business demands. In particular it should be borne in mind that forum shopping is not a one-dimensional activity and in itself constitutes an element of investment. The quality of a country’s legal restructuring framework has an impact on a company’s choice of business location in the first place and its willingness to invest and hence to attract debt financing. Taking the example of Germany and England, it is argued that forum shopping activities foster the development, improvement, reform and revision of existing laws. This thesis argues that Insolvency Darwinism results in a global alignment and convergence of insolvency systems so that the jurisdictions within the EU imitate each other with their rescue-friendliness. This competition for the “best insolvency regime” results in a more perfect insolvency landscape. The alignment with more rescue-friendly insolvency regimes is preferred to avoid unwanted forum shopping activities, whereas a “fettered Darwinian approach” of partially imitating another system will fail to deliver the desired result. This thesis critically examines whether Germany has achieved its aim of establishing a “culture of second chance” in changing the <b>Insolvency</b> <b>Code</b> (“Insolvenzordnung”) introduced by the ESUG. Chapter one serves to explain why forum shopping functions as a driver of insolvency law perfection, using a “Darwinian approach” and Darwin’s core thesis of “natural selection” to explain the competition of jurisdictions in insolvency law. Chapters two and three give an overview of the developments of the rescue culture in Germany and England. Chapters four to eight compare and contrast the different key areas in Germany and England, examining the situation in Germany before and after the introduction of the ESUG. Specific focus is put on the question of whether the changes introduced by the ESUG were driven by forum shopping activities and whether these changes led in fact to a more “perfect“ insolvency regime, in the sense as examined in chapter one.

In the context of India, bankruptcy reforms were enacted {{for the first time}} in 2016 in the form of a unified <b>Insolvency</b> and Bankruptcy <b>Code.</b> In this paper, we investigate the impact of a regulatory intervention by the Indian central bank over the last decade in leading an attempt to prevent bank failure in the absence of a sound bankruptcy process. We assess how the volume of restructured assets at bank level impacted risk taking of Indian banks over the time period 2003 – 2012. During this period, a large number of banks restructured their distressed assets as a means to reduce NPAs. Our results show that higher levels of restructured assets significantly reduced risk taking as banks benefited from low provisioning, and this relation is more pronounced for banks that had lower loan loss provisions. We also find that by restructuring distressed assets, public sector banks benefited significantly more in improving their stability than private sector domestic and foreign banks. Overall, our main results suggest that similar regulatory support in the absence of a strong legal-system, can be implemented to avoid bank fragility in other emerging market economies...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary Foreign {{participation}} in the financial sectors of emerging market economies (EMEs) increased rapidly during the 1990 s. It has continued to expand so far in this decade, on balance – although its pace fell somewhat following problems in Argentina in 2002 and the global slowdown in mergers and acquisitions. While banks accounted {{for the majority of}} financial sector foreign direct investment (FSFDI), they were joined during this period by securities and investment firms. In a number of countries in Latin America and central and eastern Europe (CEE), foreign banks now account for a major share of total banking assets. In Asia, the share of foreign banks is, overall, much lower, but still substantial. FSFDI was fostered by financial liberalisation and market-based reforms in many EMEs. The liberalisation of the capital account and financial deregulation paved the way for foreign acquisitions and the integration of EME financial firms into an expanding global market for corporate control. This underlines the character of FSFDI {{as part of a broader}} trend towards consolidation and globalisation in the financial industry. In some cases, heightened competition in traditional markets increased pressure on major international banks to find new areas for growth. With financial institutions in advanced economies increasingly searching for profit opportunities at the customer and product level, FSFDI offered a means of access to EME markets with attractive strategic opportunities to expand. The integration of EME financial firms into the global market has resulted in a wider diversity of financial institutions operating in EMEs and – given their greater emphasis on risk-adjusted profitability – a broad range of business strategies. These include expansion into local retail banking and securities markets, where elements such as client relationships and reputation are important components of the franchise value of operations. Such factors have tended to raise the costs of exiting a country and hence increased the permanence of FSFDI. Improvements in local financial infrastructure made the risks of conducting business in EMEs easier to manage, but events such as the Russian default in 1998 and Argentine actions in 2002 also made financial institutions more sensitive to the potential consequences of low-probability, but high-cost events involving country risk. Thus, financial institutions in industrial countries now tend to evaluate country risk separately and more rigorously by applying country-focused stress testing and other techniques. Because the objective of preserving the franchise value may have narrowed the room for strategic manoeuvre, risk managers now more actively seek ways to mitigate the impacts of realisations of country risk – for example, by using more local funding and establishing in advance potential sources of funds for stress scenarios. Nonetheless, a projection of long-run profitability remains the prerequisite for staying in the host country. An important, lasting benefit of FSFDI is its effect on financial sector efficiency that arises from local banks’ exposure to global competition. Generally, host countries benefit from the technology transfers and innovations in products and processes commonly associated with foreign bank entry. Foreign banks exert competitive pressures and demonstration effects on local institutions, often inducing them to reassess business practices, including local lending practices. The result can be better risk management, more competitive pricing, and in general a more efficient allocation of credit in the financial sector as a whole. Foreign banks’ presence can also help to achieve greater financial stability in host countries. Host countries may benefit immediately from foreign entry, if the foreign bank recapitalises a struggling local institution and, in the process, also provides needed balance of payments financing. The better capitalisation and wider diversification of foreign banks, along with the access of local operations to parent funding, may reduce the sensitivity of the host country banking system to local business cycles and changing financial market conditions. Their use of risk-based credit evaluation (and spillovers to local banks’ practices) tends to reduce concentration in lending and, in times of financial distress, fosters prompter recognition of losses and more timely resolution of problems. In stress situations, foreign-owned institutions can also provide an alternative location for deposits that does not involve capital outflows. Notwithstanding these benefits, the growing involvement of foreign firms in the financial systems of EMEs has given rise to concerns, especially where a majority of EME banking assets have become foreign-owned. One set of issues arises when integration transforms a domestic institution such that key decision-making and control functions – including strategic planning and risk management – are shifted to the parent. This shift may reduce the information available to host country supervisors and monetary authorities, and it may interfere with the access of authorities to key firm decision-makers. The reduction in information could become an issue, especially when parent institutions make subsequent strategic changes that significantly affect host country financial markets. If the integrated firms’ equities are delisted, the resulting loss of information and market signals may not be fully offset by financial disclosures by the global institution. Another concern is that the financial sector of a globally integrated host country may have greater exposures to shocks that arise from external economic, financial, and strategic developments. The relevance of these issues very much depends on bank and host country-specific factors, such as the business strategy and management approach of individual banks, the legal form of operations or the composition of the host country financial system. Adjustments in the supervisory framework can help offset the attendant information loss and resulting risks to financial stability. Host country regulators have the capacity to impose information and disclosure requirements on subsidiaries and, in principle, also on branches. In addition to ensuring adequate information from the local operation, supervisors should make fuller use of existing frameworks for cross-border supervisory information sharing. More generally, the mutual benefits of increasing the extent of cooperation among home and host country supervisors are compelling because of the additional complexity introduced by the expansion of banks’ operations into EMEs, the intensifying competitive dynamic in global markets, and the potential relevance of EME operations for the risk assessment of the equity holders and creditors of the parent. Information sharing among authorities responsible for financial stability is especially important in periods of market stress. In such situations, information sharing frameworks often emphasise the flow of information from host to home country. At the same time, however, home country supervisors and financial institutions should recognise the need in the host country for information when the parent bank has problems, especially when the bank’s subsidiary is a large presence in an EME’s financial markets. Similarly, central banks need to be in close contact when a parent bank’s problems appear likely to affect a local EME subsidiary or branch. Although new strategies by acquired banks may present challenges to supervisors, they can also be a catalyst for developing supervisory skills. Accordingly, developing pertinent technical skills should be an important area of cooperation between authorities in advanced and EME countries. In some markets, foreign-owned banks have been prominent in the rapid expansion of consumer lending and foreign currency lending to both households and businesses. Supervisors need appropriate tools to assess how such credit is managed by banks, and authorities in charge of financial stability may need additional information and techniques to monitor for financial vulnerabilities. Cross-border information sharing, training programmes and other forms of technical assistance may help meet this need. The EME financial reforms that triggered the 1990 s expansion of FSFDI did not come without some costs of adjustment (including having to weather difficult periods) in moving towards a more marketdriven system, but they also generated demonstrable and substantial long-term benefits. Accordingly, public policy should be focused on maximising these benefits by continuing to encourage diversity and competition in financial systems – not only between foreign and domestic banks, but also between banks and other financial institutions. Given the prominence of country risk in investing firms’ strategic decision-making, measures aimed at reducing country risk should be especially beneficial. One essential component of host country policy in this direction is a commitment to growth and stability. Another is the protection of property rights and equal treatment of banks, irrespective of ownership. From this viewpoint, a more extensive implementation of the internationally recognised set of financial standards and codes can help to reduce country risk. Another related policy element to reduce country risk is strengthening of legal frameworks. The smooth functioning of the market for corporate control would be assisted by greater international compatibility of accounting standards, takeover rules, and <b>insolvency</b> <b>codes.</b> As highlighted in this report, the availability and quality of local information may be of particular relevance in this context. Regional integration of EME financial systems, often within a framework for broader economic integration in the region, is another complementary approach to this objective. There is substantial anecdotal evidence of major benefits from regional compacts such as those of the European Union and NAFTA. In the case of very poor countries where some special support for FSFDI may be merited, public sector provided political risk insurance, if properly designed, could be useful.
