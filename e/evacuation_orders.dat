Some of the residents, {{such as the}} 7200 at Naraha town, were permitted to return during daylight hours only, but others were ordered to remain away. The area did not become seriously contaminated and was safe to visit without protective clothing. In 2015, the <b>evacuation</b> <b>order</b> for Naraha was completely lifted, allowing residents to return and reconstruction efforts to begin.

5|$|Late on September 1, {{when the}} storm began to retrograde, {{hurricane}} warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to Grand Isle, Louisiana, as advisories along {{the west coast of}} the Florida Peninsula were allowed to expire. By the time officials lifted <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders,</b> the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety. Roughly 250,000 people in the Florida Panhandle, 175,000 in Alabama, 70,000 in Mississippi, and 50,000 in Louisiana—a total of 545,000—were ordered to leave. Several hundred thousand of the people affected by the new string of <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> had also been forced to leave just days earlier, and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve. Governor Graham's office reported that during the entire storm event, 1.25 million people from Florida evacuated at some point, and state police in Louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000. In total, nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course.|$|E
5|$|While moving northward off {{the coast}} of Florida, Irene was {{initially}} expected to make landfall along the South Carolina coastline, prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue a Hurricane Warning from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Because of this, voluntary <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> were issued for portions of South Carolina. However, when the track shifted further to the east, mandatory <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> were issued for coastal areas of North Carolina, with tens of thousands removed from their homes. The evacuation order included several beach towns; those living in low-lying areas and mobile homes were advised to seek shelter. In addition, many of those left homeless from Hurricane Floyd's passage just weeks before were evacuated to shelters. Jim Hunt, the Governor of North Carolina, declared a state of emergency, with the state's emergency management team switching from a recovery objective towards a preparations mission.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters {{never heard the}} <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders.</b> 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene. Within hours of the attack, a substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E

In {{preparation for the}} storm, about 500,000people were given <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders,</b> and the Red Cross opened 87shelters. As a result, all southbound lanes of Interstate 65 from Mobile to Montgomery were closed.|$|E
5|$|Harry Randall Truman (October 30, 1896 – May 18, 1980) was a {{resident}} of the U.S. state of Washington who lived on Mount St. Helens.

He was the owner and caretaker of Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake, located at the south end of Spirit Lake at the foot of the mountain in the danger zone at the time of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|On November8, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana president, Charlotte Randolph, {{declared}} a state of emergency for the parish as the storm approached the United States Gulf Coast. Although no evacuations were issued, all schools and government offices were closed through November10. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in Plaquemines Parish along coastal areas. The Belle Chasse Auditorium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees for the duration of the storm. Grand Isle mayor David Carmadelle issued voluntary <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> for residents in recreational vehicles and trailers on the island.

5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders.</b> An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> {{began on}} September 16, when {{officials}} issued a voluntary evacuation for portions of four counties and one entire county. By around 24hours before landfall, mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties, {{all of which}} but one were for the entire counties. All coastal counties from Cape Fear northward were under a mandatory evacuation. A survey of 603 residents in northeastern North Carolina indicated 57% of residents along the Outer Banks and 77% of residents in storm surge-prone areas of the Pamlico Sound did not evacuate despite being under a mandatory evacuation. The two primary reasons stated for the residents' evacuation decisions were the hurricane's strength and track. The media and statements from officials were two other reasons. 70% of people along the Outer Banks heard the official evacuation notices, though only 30% of residents near the Pamlico Sound heard the notices. A {{majority of the respondents}} to the survey who heard the evacuation notices left the area. None of the surveyed evacuees from the Outer Banks went to a public shelter; 60% went to a friend or a relative's house and 24% went to a motel. Evacuees on the Outer Banks generally went elsewhere in North Carolina or to Virginia. For evacuees around the Pamlico Sound, only 9% left for a public shelter, while 75% left for a friend or relative's house. Most near the Pamlico Sound remained in their own neighborhood or own county. Of the 19 North Carolina counties issuing <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders,</b> the duration of the evacuation process varied between 3hours to 12hours in Dare County. Five counties reported heavy amounts of traffic, while traffic problems included stalled cars along roads, inadequate route signing, and flooded or damaged roads.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of a hurricane warning in North Carolina on August17, mandatory <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> were declared for the outermost islands in the state. Local police assisted significant traffic as an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people left the region. At {{the height of the}} evacuations, delays in some places exceeded three hours. Despite the large number of evacuees, an additional 50,000 people were estimated to have stayed home and wait out the storm. Several bridges in the area were shut down prior to Bob's arrival as hurricane-force winds were likely to create life-threatening conditions on them. The National Park Service in the state also shut down campgrounds across the Outer Banks. An evacuation shelter was also opened in Carteret County.|$|E

On 29 October it had captured Perekop {{in an attempt to}} encircle White forces north of the isthmus, but the Soviet cavalry units that were to complete the encirclement failed and many of Wrangel's troops escaped. On 8 November the 6th Army captured the Turkish Wall and began its advance south. Wrangel issued <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> and by 16 November most of the White troops had evacuated. Kork was awarded an Honorary Revolutionary Weapon on 30 December 1920 for the capture of Perekop and Yushunskaya positions and the occupation of Crimea.|$|E
5|$|Initially, forecasters {{predicted}} Irene to {{parallel the}} west coast of Florida, weakening to a tropical storm before making landfall on the west-central portion of the state. However, when a more eastward track became evident, officials in Monroe, Charlotte, Lee, and Manatee Counties issued <b>evacuation</b> <b>orders</b> for people in mobile homes and recreational vehicles. In addition, Key West issued a curfew during the storm's onslaught. The National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Florida City around the Florida Peninsula to Boca Grande, including all of the Florida Keys and the Dry Tortugas. A Tropical Storm Warning was also issued from Florida City northward to Savannah, Georgia. In addition, the majority of flights during Irene's passage were cancelled in Miami International Airport. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of emergency}} on Florida the day before Irene made landfall, and ordered for the activation of the Florida National Guard to aid in disaster efforts.|$|E
5|$|On August25, Florida's Emergency Operations Center was {{activated}} in Tallahassee {{to monitor}} {{the progress of the}} hurricane. Before Katrina moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area. Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing.
