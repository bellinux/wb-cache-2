40|$|The <b>Incoterms,</b> {{international}} commercial terms, offer a rare {{example of}} highly standardised terms for commercial transactions. In this paper {{we present a}} logical analysis of the <b>Incoterms.</b> Our analysis shows {{that there is a}} rich variety of different cases of deontic and defeasible reasoning in the <b>Incoterms.</b> Most of the rules in the <b>Incoterms</b> are expressed in deontic notions such as obligation, permission and right. Also, most of these rules have a defeasible character {{in the sense that they}} hold for the normal case, but can be overruled in exceptional circumstances. The results from this logical analysis could contribute to the discussion about the role of deontic and defeasible logics in the representation of and reasoning about legal domains. We also describe how, based on our logical analysis, a legal advisory system for the <b>Incoterms</b> can be implemented in Prolog. This implementation could be further developed into a legal advisory system that could offer advice to commercial users about the choice of the most suitable <b>Incoterms</b> to include in their commercial contracts. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how risks and costs can be reduced when working with <b>incoterms</b> in {{purchasing}} within the Asia-Pacific region. To fulfil this purpose, the following two research questions have been developed: 1. How does the case company currently work with <b>incoterms</b> when purchasing within the Asia-Pacific region? 2. How can risks and costs be reduced when working with <b>incoterms</b> when purchasing within the Asia-Pacific region? Method - Theories relevant for the study's purpose were collected through a literature study. To apply the theoretical framework to empirical data, a case study was conducted at a company. The empirical data was gathered through interviews and document studies. Findings - Use of the standard <b>Incoterms</b> 2010 is considered to be a good tool for reducing risks and costs when purchasing within the Asia-Pacific region, where risk management is a necessary complement. It is required that all employees working with <b>incoterms</b> have the right knowledge about the <b>incoterms</b> in order to use them correctly. The knowledge can be disseminated through the organisation by using knowledge management. It is also considered important to understand the differences between countries, in order to reduce the risk of misunderstanding. Contributions - The result of the study facilitates for companies who do not know how to work correctly with <b>incoterms.</b> The study contributes to decreasing the gap in theory regarding working with <b>incoterms</b> in the APAC region. It also facilitates for companies who do not know how to disseminate knowledge internally. Limitations - The case study was conducted at a company based in Thailand, which limited the ability to communicate, due to linguistic differences. Future research - It would be of interest to conduct an empirical study at other case companies of different sizes within the APAC region and in other trade regions. In addition, it would be interesting to study how internal courses about working with <b>incoterms</b> can be implemented in different types of organisations.

50|$|While Incoterms {{were first}} {{published}} in 1936, it has been revised every 10 years. Incoterms inform sales contract by defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved {{in the delivery of}} goods from seller to buyer. Incoterms 2010, the 8th revision, refers to the newest collection of essential international commercial and trade terms with 11 rules. <b>Incoterm</b> 2010 was effective on and from January 1, 2011. The terms were devised in recognition of non-uniform standard trade usages between various States. When incorporated into a sale contract, the <b>Incoterm</b> code provides a detailed interpretation of rights and obligations between parties.|$|E
50|$|This <b>Incoterm</b> {{requires}} that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named terminal. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.|$|E
50|$|In {{many respects}} this <b>Incoterm</b> has {{replaced}} FOB in modern usage, although the critical {{point at which}} the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place.

50|$|The type of {{insurance}} contract {{depends on the}} <b>Incoterm</b> adopted by the parties in a sale contract. A CIF sale contract requires the seller to obtain insurance cover for the voyage. An FOB contract however places no obligation on the buyer or seller to obtain insurance, although it is prudent for the buyer to protect against potential losses. It {{is not uncommon for}} the buyer in a FOB contract to request the seller to arrange insurance on an understanding that they will reimburse the insurance costs incurred.|$|E
50|$|Freight transport, or shipping, {{is a key}} in {{the value}} chain in manufacturing.

50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{the duty}} {{costs of the}} goods may be {{calculated}} against a specific <b>Incoterm</b> (for example in India, duty is calculated against the CIF value of the goods, and in South Africa the duty is calculated against the FOB value of the goods). Because of this {{it is common for}} contracts for exports to these countries to use these Incoterms, even when they are not suitable for the chosen mode of transport. If this is the case then great care must be exercised to ensure that the points at which costs and risks pass are clarified with the customer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the changes between the <b>Incoterms</b> 2000 and the <b>Incoterms</b> 2010 from a risk management perspective, and highlights {{the challenges that}} traders may encounter when dealing {{with some of these}} terms. For example, the problematic FOB term and its use in containerisation is not likely to have been totally resolved, although the <b>Incoterms</b> 2010 have attempted to ameliorate the situation. The new terms DAT (Delivered at Terminal) and DAP (Delivered at Place) should be useful for cross border transactions within Customs Union blocs, such as the European Union. The paper concludes that the new <b>Incoterms</b> 2010 provide improved definitions, and more effectively contextualise the use of old terms that are out of synch with today’s modern practices. However, if traders continue to cling to their old habits and fail to update their delivery terms and arrangements to reflect contemporary practices, much of the work and progress that the ICC has put into this change process will be lost...|$|R

50|$|Freight transport, or shipping, {{is a key}} in {{the value}} chain in manufacturing. With {{increased}} specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport. Transportation creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production {{to the place of}} consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.

50|$|The seller {{pays for}} the {{carriage}} of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship {{in the country of}} Export. The Shipper is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer's facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer does require the seller to obtain insurance, the <b>Incoterm</b> CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, most jurisdictions require {{companies}} to provide {{proof of export}} for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is {{under no obligation to}} provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another <b>Incoterm,</b> such as FCA seller's premises, may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process. 228 ...|$|E

50|$|International freight forwarders, NVOCCs {{and customs}} brokers often charge for {{transferring}} documents to another transportation company at destination.

This fee is separate from documentation fees charged by carriers and NVOCCs as part of the freight charges on a bill of lading and is separate from other fees for document preparation or for release of cargo. Some companies call this an administration fee, document fee, document transfer fee, but it exists in some form in most destinations and is well known to most shippers.

5000|$|Under FOB {{terms the}} seller bears all costs and risks {{up to the}} point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's {{responsibility}} does not end at that point unless the goods are [...] "appropriated to the contract" [...] that is, they are [...] "clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods." [...] Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the <b>Incoterm</b> FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce. In some common law countries such as the United States of America, FOB is not only connected with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any [...] "vessel, car or other vehicle." ...|$|E
