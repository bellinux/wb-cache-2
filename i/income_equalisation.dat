40|$|A {{progressive}} {{income tax}} penalises those taxpayers with a fluctuating income (for example, farmers), {{as compared with}} those on a stable income with the same average. However there are various methods of smoothing taxable income and hence reducing average tax payments. One such scheme is the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme which was proposed by the Taxation Working Party of the Agricultural Development Conference in 1965 and was subsequently adopted by the Government. Under this scheme a farmer can deposit up to a quarter of his income from one year in the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Fund. He must withdraw a deposit within five years, adding the withdrawal to his income for that year. However, using the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme has an opportunity cost, an opportunity foregone elsewhere. The funds deposited with the Government earn no interest. A thousand dollars deposited in the Fund for a year could have reduced a farmer’s overdraft with his bank by that amount, saving him about $ 75, In deciding how best to use the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme to smooth taxable incomes, the tax saving gain from a smoother income must be balanced against the opportunity cost of storing the income in the Equalisation Fund. This paper describes a method for farmers and their advisers for making optimal use of the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme. Optimal {{is defined as the}} maximisation of the present value of post-tax incomes. However readers should be aware that the scheme is of little value in reducing tax payments unless the farmer’s income is highly variable. In presenting the method which involves dynamic programming, the mathematics has been put in appendices so that the paper can be followed by those not skilled in mathematical techniques. The paper is divided into four sections. Firstly, a method of estimating farm income variability is given. Secondly, a method is presented for estimating the extra tax paid because of a fluctuating income. Thirdly, the results of using the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme on historical incomes from Lincoln College's Ashley Dene farm are discussed. Finally, the rules for making optimal use of the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme under realistic circumstances are presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that {{liquidity}} is an important determinate of farm viability. This is particularly so with a rural sector which suffers large variations in income and has a business cycle which typically extends for several years. Present tax arrangements, coupled with a desire by producers to minimise tax, means that surplus cash in high income years is mostly invested in further improvements, developments or capital equipment. An enhanced <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme could play a significant role as a risk management tool for producers as well as reducing calls for government assistance during periods of adversity. Suggestions are made for improving the operation and delivery of the scheme including amalgamating Farm Management Bonds and the <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Scheme into one scheme operated by financial institutions under an agency agreement.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made in this paper to examine the impact of {{international}} remittances on poverty and income inequality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In carrying out the study, 34 SSA countries for which relevant data are available, between 1980 and 2009, were sampled for the poverty analysis whilst a sample size of 36 was used in the remittances-income inequality exploration. A set of dynamic panel-data models was estimated using system Generalized Method of Moments. It was found that remittances have significant poverty-alleviating effect, with {{the poorest of the poor}} being the least beneficiaries. Additionally, International remittances have <b>income</b> <b>equalisation</b> effects in countries with relatively narrower income gap, but with an intensifying income-inequality aggravating effects in countries with relatively wider income gap. It is, thus, concluded that although remittances have huge potentials to alleviate poverty and equilibrate incomes in SSA, these remittances have size-effects to the detriment of relatively poorer countries and countries with relatively higher income gap. Therefore, the paper recommends that, although the poverty-alleviating effects and <b>income</b> <b>equalisation</b> effects of remittances cannot be downplayed, it is imprudent for SSA policymakers to overly exclusively on remittances as a poverty-reduction strategy towards sustainable socioeconomic development of the sub-region. ...|$|E

It successively studies the influence of uncertainty in the knowledge of individual incomes, the impact of equivalence scales and finally the consequences of capital accumulation. If uncertainty does not modify fundamentally the equity properties of ELIE, equivalence scales can have non trivial consequences depending on the relation between income and fertility. Finally, capital accumulation introduces strong inequalities in taxation. The paper relies on simulations of the income distribution, calibrated on French data and on the use of taxation indices. inequality, ELIE, income distribution...|$|E
40|$|ELIE can be {{interpreted}} as a minimum income scheme, financed by lump-sum taxes. While Kolm is careful in stating that his theory of macro-justice does not apply to individuals voluntarily working less than the "initial equal labour" k, we consider an extended scheme in which equal-labour <b>income</b> <b>equalisation</b> is also applied to these individuals. This extended ELIE may induce social waste as individuals with a low taste for working may opt for voluntary unemployment. We simulate the magnitude of this social waste with microdata for Belgium and compare extended ELIE with a first-best scheme and a second-best scheme (based on a linear income tax), implementing the same minimum income. The social waste induced by extended ELIE is intermediate between the social waste induced by the first-and second-best schemes, and remains relatively small for realistic levels of redistribution. Assumptions about the preferences of the voluntarily unemployed play a crucial role...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} half decade Australian {{economic}} policy has been adventurous in its departure from full employment and in its tolerance of increases in the inequality of income, but has been remarkable timid in its approach to the reform of social security and the income tax. In this climate a guaranteed income scheme, with its combination of tax reform, social security reform and <b>income</b> <b>equalisation</b> had little chance of a receptive hearing. However as I have pointed out elsewhere (Manning 1981 b p. 33) the apparent stability of the present system belies {{the urgency of the}} questions that surround it; reform may soon be forced upon us and we should therefore prepare for it by continuing to investigate alternative social security systems including guaranteed income schemes.

40|$|In {{a recent}} report to government, an <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Deposit (IED) Scheme for {{commercial}} farmers and crop insurance for small scale farmers have been recommended as risk management strategies. An IED has been considered {{in the past in}} South Africa but rejected largely due to tax implications. Conditions have now changed as various countries (Australia, Canada and USA) strongly promote such a scheme as a risk management strategy while the South African crop insurance program has failed to attract farmers. A main criticism of an IED in the past was that if it is used in conjunction with the In/Out farmer’ tax provision, that farmers can obtain tax benefits if they destabilise their incomes. This can be avoided by adopting a tax rule that farmers may only invest the positive difference between their current taxable income and their moving average taxable income in an IED. It is further recommended that the Land Bank deposit scheme (Income Tax Paragraph 13 A) be abolished and be replaced by an IED that covers both livestock, crops and horticulture.

40|$|Hail {{insurance}} {{is provided by}} the private sector in South Africa but crop insurance (drought insurance) programmes, after a promising start, failed to attract customers. A crop insurance programme (drought) for small-scale commercial farmers, who are not yet paying tax, has been recommended to government. The purpose in this research is to study the economic viability of such a programme drawing on the US experience. The US programme is well developed but heavily subsidised. During 1998 US growers paid $ 900 million in premiums while during 1995 - 98 the US government spent $ 1. 2 billion per year on subsidies. An area insurance plan (farmers are insured as a group) is shown to be more appropriate for small farmers growing dryland field crops such as maize because risk is systemic (drought related) while adverse selection, moral hazard etc are overcome. Individual crop insurance will not be viable due to the cost of farm visits (verification of claims) and the non-availability of information. As {{a large part of the}} cost to government goes to administration of crop insurance it is recommended that an <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Deposit (IED) scheme for small growers receive serious consideration with the government making a contribution as for example in Canada.

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that an <b>Income</b> <b>Equalisation</b> Deposit (IED) scheme could be a feasible new risk management tool for commercial farmers in South Africa. This prompted a study of practicing consultants ’ (tax experts) views on determining what types of farmers {{would be likely to}} use the scheme. During 2000, a postal survey of 24 consultants was conducted mainly in KwaZulu-Natal, and in the Maize Triangle and surrounding areas. Each consultant was to review nine scenarios (eight plus a control, giving 192 observations) and decide whether they would recommend an IED scheme for each scenario. A statistical experimental design was used to structure the scenarios, allowing for main and interaction effects between variables that could influence the potential use of an IED scheme. Discriminant analysis revealed that, ceteris paribus, farmers with higher annual net farm incomes (>R 300, 000), lower debt/asset ratios (< 15 %), more variable net farm incomes, and less off-farm income would most likely use an IED scheme. In terms of ranking, ceteris paribus, high risk maize farmers, intermediate risk maize farmers and high risk livestock farmers are more likely to use an IED scheme than are low risk maize farmers, low and intermediate risk livestock farmers and diversified farmers. These results support the use of an IED scheme as a risk management tool as higher risk farmers are more likely {{to make use of the}} scheme...|$|E

40|$|The {{last two}} decades {{witnessed}} an ongoing trend towards fiscal decentralisation in Europe – sub-central governments have been given more responsibilities and greater shares in public spending (Bloechliger & Vammalle 2012). The policy of decentralisation brings with it a promise of increased efficiency in terms of service provision and resource allocation on local and regional levels. The often unwanted consequence of decentralisation is that growing taxing powers and financial autonomies given to territorial units are accompanied by growing disparities in terms of wealth and/or income distribution between local governments. Hence the need for fiscal equalisation appears. The overriding objective of fiscal equalisation is to correct imbalances in fiscal capacity of territorial units resulting from sub-central autonomy and differentiation in terms of tax bases and to allow local and regional governments to provide their citizens with services of comparable quality and quantity. A recent study across eighteen countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom) showed that fiscal equalisation involves transfers varying from 0. 5 % to 3. 8 % of GDP (Bloechliger, Merk, Charbit, Mizell 2007). Depending on specific arrangements, equalisation mechanisms may be {{in line with the}} chosen policy for development, supporting either territorially balanced development or placing emphasis on development engines. This paper builds on notions of fiscal federalism and fiscal equalisation to give a better view of approaches to <b>income</b> <b>equalisation</b> between territorial units in six European countries. Countries chosen for comparison within the framework of this paper are different in terms of geographical location, size, levels of socio-economic development and adopted local government systems. The major criterion for choosing case study countries was their geographical location, as it is the authors’ intention to highlight differences in approach to fiscal equalisation between the Nordic countries (Finland and Sweden), Central European countries (Poland and Hungary), and the Mediterranean countries (Greece and Portugal). The hypothesis which is put forward and tested by the research team is as follows: The attitudes and approaches towards fiscal equalisation between local governments in: (1) the Nordic countries, (2) the Central European countries and (3) the Mediterranean countries differ significantly, reflecting cultural differences and different economic conditions in these countries. Specifically, the following sub-hypotheses are put forward and tested: + higher level of socio-economic development tends to favour stronger equalisation policy and mechanisms between local governments; + countries where local governments participate to a greater degree in public sector expenditures require far stronger equalisation mechanisms. The hypotheses are backed up by reasonable expectation that the extent of horizontal equity pursued in each country is based on value judgments of political actors in power. There might also be efficiency motives for equalisation grants (King 1984, 140 - 146). The first sub-hypothesis may be justified by the need of developing countries to favour rapid growth and encourage people to move from low productivity areas to highly productive areas, resulting with strategies favouring development engines and cautious with regards to high levels of redistribution (i. e. by means of equalisation grants to local governments in lagging areas). Respectively the more developed countries tend to emphasise equality at the expense of a lower growth rate and tend to favour stronger equalisation policy and mechanisms between local governments. The second sub-hypothesis is a natural anticipation that big volumes of local government activities lead rather to big than low volumes of equalisation of local government expenditures. The paper starts with snap-shot descriptions of countries chosen for analysis. Country backgrounds present situation in terms of socio-economic development, inequality in terms of personal wealth distribution and approaches to equalisation of personal incomes in respective 3 countries.

40|$|Trade is {{the most}} {{important}} integration link in the overall world production. After the Second World War it induced the establishment of economic integrations. In the last three decades international trade has been more dynamic than the growth of the world production. The data show that the commodity trade is the strongest component of the world purchase and sale, although the international trade in services has grown a bit faster than the commodity trade. However, the share of services in the world trade does not exceed 20 per cent. International trade has most developed among developed countries, keeping up the mutual development of foreign direct investments and know-how and technology transfer. The empirical research shows that apart from the benefits gained by capitalisation of comparative advantages the trade growth is also influenced by benefits resulting from the impact of the economy of scale, competition and spreading of knowledge. Reduction of tariff and elimination of non-tariff barriers constantly opens new opportunities to benefit from international trade in commodities and services. Commodity trade of OECD countries confirms that the volume of trade does not depend only on liberalisation of tariff and non-tariff barriers, but growth to a certain degree reflects the size of the country, geographic elements and transport costs. Therefore, the empirical works predominantly analyse the power of trade as an indicator of the manifested commodity trade, embracing the characteristics such as competition pressures, but not including some deeper political meaning. The previously mentioned factor is significant, since given the policy and competition small countries are naturally more dependent on foreign trade, although competition pressures among big countries largely result from competition inside themselves. A significant change in the trade structure has been recorded in the period of over two years. At first, intra-industrial trade became equal to traditional inter- industrial production, and afterwards it has even exceeded it. For a long time the factors of foreign trade growth have been disputable. The works of Baier and Berstrand show that income growth and reduction of customs produce the main impact on foreign trade growth. In their opinion liberalisation of trade within GATT and WTO {{is one of the main}} driving forces in international trade. Reduction of trade costs also produces some impact on foreign trade growth, while approximation of incomes is less significant. Badlinger and Breuss have explored the elements that in the last four decades of the last century made an impact on faster growth of inter-trade of EU- 15 member countries. They have estimated the relative impact of the income growth, <b>income</b> <b>equalisation</b> as well reduction of tariffs and trade costs on the intra-trade of EU- 15 member countries. The results show that the income growth increases by 70 per cent the intra-trade of these countries. Also, the European integration and liberalisation of GATT and WTO increase by 25 per cent the commodity intra-trade of EU- 15...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the extent}} and forms of class relations in the Soviet Union. The theoretical approach adopted to the analysis 'of the Soviet class structure {{is based on a}} critique of the classical Marxist approach to class, as well as of common sociological approaches to class, particularly the Weberian conception of class. These issues are the concern of the Introduction, which outlines an alternative approach to class structure based on a conception of relations of production which differs from the classical Marxist approach, particularly in avoiding any reliance on the labour theory of value for defining relations of production and hence for demarcating class boundaries. Chapter One provides an outline of developments in the Soviet rural class structure in the 1920 s, and by criticising common conceptions of such developments argues that the strategy of socialist transformation adopted in the policy of forced collectivisation was economically unnecessary and politically disastrous. The purpose of this Chapter is to throw the contemporary class structure of the Soviet Union into historical relief, by indicating the historical context out of which many contemporary features of the Soviet Union developed. It is hoped that this will indicate that many features of the contemporary social structure are historically specific, rather than being necessary features of a state socialist society. Following from this, the analysis of relations of production in the 1960 s and 1970 s is begun in Chapter Two, where the relations between different kinds of economic agents, particularly collective economic agents (economic units) are examined, using the approach developed in the Introduction to analyse the relations of production as relations between economic agents, which affect the relative economic capacities of agents. It is argued that, because such capacities are always subject to change through processes of struggle and negotiation, an important but hitherto rather neglected aspect of the relations,of production concerns the policies of economic agents. Consequently, the manner in which agents at various levels in the economy calculate both their own internal state and the course of action which they adopt with respect to other agents is subjected to detailed scrutiny in this Chapter. Chapter Three analyses the legal and political conditions of the relations of production, since in the Soviet Union such economic relations are operative primarily between state agencies, or collective agencies whose relations to the state agencies are legally and politically regulated by the state. Consequently, the issue of the 'withering away of the state' with the decline of private property is considered, as well as various common Western conceptions of Soviet politics. Following on from this, the analysis of politics in terms of a series of 'arenas of struggle' is proposed, and in the light of this approach the capacities of the main central party and state agencies to regulate the economy (and hence to determine the relations of production by implementing effective economic plans) is reviewed. The conclusion from this review is that there are serious limits on the capacity of such central party and state agents to co-ordinate the division of labour, so that theories of an all-powerful totalitarian party or elite dominating Soviet politics and the economy are misguided. Nevertheless, it is argued that there is sufficient central control of the state agencies for one {{to be able to say}} that various state agencies do not pursue autonomous objectives. In other words, political relations between state agencies are not such as to preclude socialist planning of the overall economy. Chapter Four examines welfare and social policy as a means of assessing the importance of non-wage forms of income, and concludes that the overall effect of such forms of public expenditure is probably, as intended, to equalise incomes. This point is taken up again in Chapter Five, where the occupational structure and wage differentials are examined, prior to an overall assessment of the distribution of income, which concludes that a policy of <b>income</b> <b>equalisation</b> has been pursued fairly successfully over the past twenty-five years or so. While such a policy may now be running into difficulties of various kinds, in so far as it has been successfully pursued, it has meant that the connection between the distribution of income and the access of agents to the means of production has been partially undermined. Hence class relations have been seriously weakened in the Soviet Union, and it is concluded that they are non-existent within the state sector of the economy. However, this does not mean that there is no class structure in the Soviet Union since collective farm members are still in a different class position from state employees. There may also be capitalist relations in the so-called 'parallel economy' but their extent must be severely limited by the official prohibitions on such activities which means that, if resources are diverted from official purposes, this is largely done on an individual 'self-employed' basis. It is also argued that the 'intelligentsia' cannot be considered as a single, separate stratum from the state employed 'working class' or the collective farm members. Consequently, the official theory of the Soviet class structure must be considered to be seriously deficient...|$|E
