5|$|In March 2004, the ACLU, {{along with}} Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, sued {{the state of}} California on behalf of six {{same-sex}} couples who were denied marriage licenses. That case, Woo v. Lockyer, was eventually consolidated into In re Marriage Cases, the California Supreme Court case which led to same-sex marriage being available <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state</b> from June 16, 2008 until Proposition 8 was passed on November 4, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae {{was first}} {{described}} by the American mycologist Harry Delbert Thiers in 1971, from collections made in San Mateo County, California, the previous year. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> it {{is known as the}} manzanita bolete because of its close association with manzanita trees. It is classified in subsection Versicolores of the section Leccinum in the genus Leccinum. Closely related species in this section include L.piceinum, L.monticola, L.albostipitatum, and L.versipelle.|$|E

5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy was widespread <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state.</b> Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state.</b> Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1960, Stebbins was {{instrumental}} in the establishment of the Department of Genetics at the University of California, Davis, and was active in numerous organizations involved in the promotion of evolution, and of science in general. He was elected to the National Academy of Science, was awarded the National Medal of Science, and was involved in the development of evolution-based science programs for California high schools, as well as the conservation of rare plants <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|From December 1873 {{until the}} {{expiration}} {{of his term}} in 1877, Stevenson was generally recognized as the chairman (later known as the floor leader) of the minority Democratic caucus in the Senate; {{he was the first}} person to have acted in the capacity. During the Forty-fourth Congress, he chaired the Committee on Revolutionary Claims. He did not seek reelection at the end of his term. In the disputed 1876 presidential election, he was one of the visiting statesmen who went to New Orleans, Louisiana, and concluded that the election had been fairly conducted <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{the federal}} {{property}} is an enclave, then {{the federal government}} has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded the land to the federal government. The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state.</b> The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E

5|$|In 1758 the State of New Jersey {{purchased}} the Indian title to lands <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>State,</b> {{and as a}} consideration for the purchase, bought a tract of land as a residence for the Indians, having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State, any law or usage, or law then existing, to the contrary notwithstanding. The Indians, {{from the time of}} purchase, lived upon the land until the year 1801, when they were authorized, by an act of the Legislature, to sell the land.|$|E
5|$|In a heavy fog in October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. Instead, they repaired Leipzig enough to keep her afloat, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> provided gunfire support to the defenders of Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945. As the Germans continued to retreat in the east, Leipzig was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians. She reached Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>state,</b> US 50 {{switches}} to Interstate 64 before splitting onto its own alignment in eastern O'Fallon. It heads east through Trenton, Breese, Carlyle crossing the Kaskaskia River, Salem, Flora and Lawrenceville to the Wabash River along a corridor between Interstates 64 and 70. US 50 enters Indiana at the Wabash River, bypassing Vincennes and Washington and passing through Bedford, Seymour, and Versailles. It meets the Ohio River at Aurora, and soon crosses into Ohio, running through downtown Cincinnati via Fort Washington Way (Interstate 71). The route crosses southern Ohio via Hillsboro, Chillicothe, and Athens, joining the four-lane divided Corridor D (State Route 32) west of Athens. It meets the Ohio River around Belpre, and crosses the newer Blennerhassett Island Bridge (previously crossing the Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge) into greater Parkersburg, West Virginia.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the town}} of Illertissen is in Bavaria, its {{proximity}} to other towns in the neighbouring state of Baden-Württemberg has allowed it to participate <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state's</b> competition. <b>In</b> 1963, it became the first Bavarian team to win the Württembergischen-Pokal (Württemberg Cup) when they defeated SV Hussenhofen.|$|R

5|$|Landis {{was born}} in Millville, Ohio, in 1866. His name was a {{spelling}} variation on the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the American Civil War, where his father was wounded in 1864. Landis {{spent much of his}} youth in Indiana; he left school at fifteen and worked in a series of positions <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state.</b> His involvement in politics led to a civil service job. At age 21, Landis applied to become a lawyer—there were then no educational or examination requirements for the Indiana bar. Following a year of unprofitable practice, he went to law school. After his graduation, he opened an office in Chicago, but left it when Walter Q. Gresham, the new United States Secretary of State, named him his personal secretary in 1893. After Gresham's death in 1895, Landis refused an offer of an ambassadorship, and returned to Chicago to practice law and marry.|$|E
5|$|Like Daniel, most {{party members}} came from pietist churches, and most were former Republicans. Elected {{as the head}} of the Maryland branch of the party, he {{attended}} the 1884 Prohibition Party National Convention in Pittsburgh. After being selected as temporary chairman of the convention, the delegates chose Daniel to be nominated for vice president alongside the presidential nominee, John St. John. The party platform was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the alcohol problem. In the election that year, the Prohibition ticket fell far short of victory, as expected, but placed third with 1.5 percent of the vote—a marked improvement over the 0.1 percent the 1880 Prohibition candidates had received. Further, their vote total in New York—just over 25,000—was more than enough to throw the election <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state</b> from James G. Blaine, the Republican, to Grover Cleveland, the Democrat. Because pro-temperance voters usually voted Republican, many historians credit St. John and Daniel with costing Blaine the election.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling {{in the case}} of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was {{resident}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state</b> and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment. All of these measures passed.|$|E
50|$|The Chester County Council is a Boy Scouts of America {{council that}} serves Chester County, Pennsylvania {{and part of}} Cecil County, Maryland <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>state's</b> {{northeast}} corner.

50|$|Before {{they were}} expelled, the Cherokee gained enough gold-mining {{experience}} {{to participate in}} later gold rushes in California in 1849 and Colorado in 1859.
