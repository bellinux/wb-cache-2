50|$|Photochemical {{reactions}} are {{initiated by the}} absorption of a photon, typically in the wavelength range 290-700 nm (at {{the surface of the}} Earth). The energy of an absorbed photon is transferred to electrons in the molecule and briefly changes their configuration (i.e., promotes the molecule from a ground state to an excited state). The excited state represents what is essentially a new molecule. Often excited state molecules are not kinetically stable in the presence of O2 or H2O and can spontaneously decompose (oxidize or hydrolyze).

Indeed, reactive oxygen species have been observed when soil surfaces are exposed to sunlight. The ability of irradiated soil to generate singlet oxygen was found to be independent of the organic matter content, and both the mineral and organic components of soil appear to contribute to this process.

This includes confirming the identity of materials, designing reaction vessels, controlling light sources, and adjusting the reaction atmosphere. However, observation of natural phenomena often provides initial inspiration for further study. For example, during the 1970s it was generally agreed that nitrous oxide (N2O) has a short residence time in the troposphere, although the actual explanation for its removal was unknown. Since N2O does not absorb light at wavelengths greater than 280 nm, <b>direct</b> <b>photolysis</b> had been discarded as a possible explanation. It was then observed that light would decompose chloromethanes when they were absorbed on silica sand, and this occurred at wavelengths far above the absorption spectra for these compounds. The same phenomenon was observed for N2O, leading to the conclusion that particulate matter in the atmosphere is responsible for the destruction of N2O via surface-sensitized photolysis. Indeed, the idea of such a sink for atmospheric N2O was supported by several reports of low concentrations of N2O in the air above deserts, where there is a high amount of suspended particulate matter. As another example, the observation that the amount of nitrous acid in the atmosphere greatly increases during the day lead to insight into the surface photochemistry of humic acids and soils and an explanation for the original observation.|$|E

The first study compares <b>direct</b> and sensitized <b>photolysis</b> of dibenzothiophene-S-oxide (DBTO) and dibenzoselenophene-Se-oxide (DBSeO). Quantum yield and solvent oxidation data are used to separate the direct irradiation conditions, plus benzophenone-sensitized and anthraquinone-sensitized irradiation of DBSeO, into one mechanistic class. Acridine-sensitized photolysis of DBSeO and triplet sensizitization of DBTO result in deoxygenation, but go by different mechanisms than the direct irradations. The two sensitized cases that appear mechanistically linked to <b>direct</b> DBTO <b>photolysis</b> are ones in which the spectroscopic triplet of DBSeO, which is very likely of comparable energy to the selenium-oxygen BDE, is populated by triplet energy transfer. The main focus of the work presented in this dissertation is on exploration of modifications to TiO 2 {{in order to improve}} absorption of terrestrial sunlight [...] Aromatic organic probe molecules are used in these chapters to evaluate the oxidative chemistry of doped TiO 2 and test the efficacy of the catalyst with visible irradiation. Tungsten-modified titanium dioxide catalysts are compared for their photocatalytic activity. No special visible absorbance is apparent for the sol-gel catalyts. However, an increase in the single-electron transfer chemistry with the presence of WOx is noted, and a distinct wavelength dependence on the product ratios. 13 C-modified TiO 2 was prepared in order to facilitate study of the dopant atoms and trace their chemical fate throughout the process. Several different carbon species are identified. Some variation in the chemical degradation of quinoline is noted among the catalysts, but coke-containing TiO 2 catalysts are not qualitatively better catalysts for use with visible light with this substrate. S-TiO 2 was produced by a literature method, and was shown to facilitate the degradation of organic molecules under UV and visible light. Visible irradiation of sulfur-doped TiO 2 did not produce hydroxyl-type chemistry, but could accomplish single-electron transfers in favorable cases. The utility of sulfur-doped TiO 2 as a photocatalyst over undoped titania depends entirely whether the requirement for visible-light functionality, even if at low efficiency, outweighs a modest drop in the efficiency of catalysis using UV light. Selenium-modified TiO 2 is capable of degrading quinoline at a slightly faster rate than undoped TiO 2 under UV light. Irradiation with 3 ̆e 435 nm light shows no evidence for efficient production of hydroxyl-like species, but single-electron transfer chemistry is still operative. Examinations of Se-TiO 2 under hypoxic conditions show that the Se atoms are capable of trapping photogenerated electrons, as evidenced by XPS. The last study investigates the feasibility of using deep UV treatment for abatement of ammonia in livestock and poultry barn exhaust in a series of laboratory scale experiments. These experiments simulated moving exhaust air with controlled UV wavelength and dose, NH 3 concentrations, humidity, and presence of H 2 S. Reactions were monitored using chemiluminescence detection, GC-MS, and high resolution FTIR. The data show that removal of NH 3 is plausible, but highlights concerns over ozone and N 2 O emission...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Engineering: Chemical) [...] Tshwane University of TechnologyDue {{to the impact}} of the rapidly growing demand for energy worldwide, as well as {{concerns}} over global warming, there has been a resurgence of interest in nuclear energy in the developed world. However, further deployment of this otherwise cleaner source of energy in other lesser developed regions is hindered by concerns over accumulation of radioactive waste from nuclear reactor operation and fuel processing. In fuel processing, the problem is the volume of effluent waste generated which mainly consists of toxic organic compounds. The use of decontamination reagents such as CCl 4 together with phenolic tar results in wastewater with a high content of chlorophenols. Chlorophenols are compounds of serious environmental concern due to their toxic and carcinogenic impacts. In this study, the extent of dehalogenation of toxic aromatic compounds was evaluated using a photolytic advanced oxidation process (AOP) followed by biodegradation in the second stage. A hard-to-degrade toxic pollutant, 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) was used as a model compound representing recalcitrant aromatic pollutants in wastewater streams from the nuclear industry. A two stage photo assisted AOP/bioreactor system demonstrated great potential in the removal of toxic 4 -CP simulated nuclear process water wastewater. Adding hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as a catalyst further improved the dehalogenation rate but the effect was limited by the scavenging of (OH•) radicals under high concentrations of H 2 O 2. High degradation rate was achieved in the UV/H 2 O 2 advanced oxidation system as opposed to <b>direct</b> UV <b>photolysis.</b> A Monod-like model was used to evaluate the biodegradation kinetics over a wide range of initial concentrations. The model revealed that 4 -CP degradation process followed quasi-second order kinetics. This study demonstrates the potential of enhanced biological treatment of nuclear wastewater using a cleaner and energy effective technology...|$|R
40|$|Photocatalytic {{ozonation}} of phenol and {{oxalic acid}} (OA) {{was conducted with}} a Ag+/TiO 2 catalyst and different pathways were found for the degradation of different compounds. Ag+ greatly promoted the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants due to its role as an electron scavenger It also accelerated the removal rate of OA in ozonation and the simultaneous process for its complex reaction with oxalate. Phenol could be degraded both in <b>direct</b> ozonation and <b>photolysis,</b> but the TOC removal rates were much higher in the simultaneous processes due to the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals resulting from synergetic effects. The sequence of photo-illumination and ozone exposure in the combined process showed quite different effects in phenol degradation and TOC removal. The synergetic effects in different combined processes {{were found to be}} highly related to the properties of the target pollutants. The color change of the solution and TEM result confirmed that Ag+ was easily reduced and deposited on the surface of TiO 2 under photo-illumination, and dissolved again into solution in the presence of ozone. This simple cycle of enrichment and distribution of Ag+ can greatly benefit the design of advanced oxidation processes, in which the sequences of ozone and photo-illumination can be varied according to the needs for catalyst recycling and the different properties of pollutants.
