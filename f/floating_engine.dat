25|$|After noon, {{a renewal}} of the {{conflagration}} on the Gateshead side arose as a stream of blazing sulphur made its way east along the riverbank, setting light to Mr. Davidson's flour mill, which had hitherto merely been ruined by the explosion. It was quickly alight, and for several hours afterwards the fire travelled east from building to building. This mass of buildings was still alight at midnight, {{at which point the}} flames were licking at St. Mary's church; but this was saved by heroic effort. In the emergency, it was resolved to demolish by explosion some of the already shattered houses to the east of the fire to form a firebreak, a task quickly accomplished by parties of sappers and miners. By this means, and by the action of the powerful <b>floating</b> <b>engines,</b> the fire was confined and at length consumed and extinguished.|$|R

40|$|Practical {{challenges}} from both experiment and calculation sides were discussed for determining two piece twin land {{oil control ring}} friction. A <b>floating</b> liner <b>engine</b> was used for twin land oil control ring study. Effects of <b>floating</b> liner <b>engine</b> system dynamics and piston skirt friction were addressed and methods to mitigate them were discussed. A deterministic twin land oil control ring model was used for ring friction calculation. Variation of the surface roughness at different spots of the liner {{and its effects on}} both hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication predictions were discussed. A multi-point correlation method was introduced to address surface variation effects on the twin land oil control ring model. Ring land width variation between two lands as well as along the circumference and its effects on calculation were shown, and methods to address it were discussed. By taking all these necessary steps in both experiments and calculations, this study shows that a reasonable match can be achieved between the measured and calculated friction, which covers all three lubrication regimes. This study lays a foundation for realistically predicting the friction of piston rings in internal com-bustion engines...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} interest in decreasing {{the environmental impact}} from internal combustion engines as well as increasing the fuel efficiency has led to deeper investigation into {{the components of the}} engine. The mechanical friction in an engine is a major concern, any improvements or reductions in friction can have large implication on the' efficiency of the engines. This thesis focuses on the piston/ ring pack assembly and its contribution to friction. It investigates several key components and trends in friction for the piston/ ring pack assembly, specifically the trends related to the oil control ring and the liner surface. The <b>Floating</b> Liner <b>Engine</b> is used in this study to isolate results from different components. The data collected can be used for comparative analysis and to identify trends in the friction trace. The thesis starts with describing the <b>Floating</b> Liner <b>Engine</b> system at MIT in detail. Both the data collection and the hardware systems are described as well as the test capabilities of the <b>Floating</b> Liner <b>Engine.</b> The results used in the thesis have been collected using the motoring condition. The oil control ring {{plays a key role in}} controlling the supply of oil to the top two rings and hence has a higher tension that the top two rings. This leads to the oil control ring having a significant contribution to the total friction of the system. The two most prevalent oil control rings used in the industry are the twin land oil control ring (TLOCR) and the three piece oil control ring (TPOCR). The thesis investigates the effect of changing liner roughness on the friction of the TLOCR. A comparison between the TLOCR and the TPOCR is also performed using the same liner surfaces. The results from these studies show a marked difference between the friction traces from the two oil control rings. by Sarthak Vaish. Thesis: S.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of an IEEE 754 -compliant, single-precision, coarse-level pipelined <b>floating</b> point <b>engine</b> designed using a new Electronic System Level tool. The starting point was the Softfloat ANSI-C implementation of the standard. Minimal modifications, {{in the form of}} two parallel processes, were introduced to map the ANSI-C code to the Input/Output interface of a Cardbus-based Field-Programmable Gate Array prototyping board. The remaining part of the code was directly synthesized to gates using Cebatech’s C 2 R compiler and a number of configurations were studied with various degrees of functionalunit sharing and capabilities. Preliminary results clearly identify the potential of next generation ESL tools in transforming control-oriented applications written in ANSI-C code directly to synthesizable verilog, in record time. At the same time, the generated silicon exhibits up to two orders of magnitude better cycle performance compared to the Softfloat standard executing on an In-order superscalar processor (simulated) thus making a strong statement for the suitability of the ESL tool for the silicon synthesis of control-dominated applications. The design was validated both at the C-level as well as on an E 14 PicoComputing FPGA board were it achieved an operating frequency of 64 MHz. I...|$|R
