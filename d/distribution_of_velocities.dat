25|$|In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell {{discovered}} the distribution law of molecular velocities. Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields are propagated outward from their source {{at a speed}} {{equal to that of}} light and that light is one of several kinds of electromagnetic radiation, differing only in frequency and wavelength from the others. In 1859, Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>velocities</b> of the molecules of a gas. The wave theory of light was widely accepted by the time of Maxwell's work on the electromagnetic field, and afterward the study of light and that of electricity and magnetism were closely related. In 1864 James Maxwell published his papers on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, and stated that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon in the 1873 publication of Maxwell's Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. This work drew upon theoretical work by German theoreticians such as Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber. The encapsulation of heat in particulate motion, and the addition of electromagnetic forces to Newtonian dynamics established an enormously robust theoretical underpinning to physical observations.|$|E

Determination of energy coefficient, momentum and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> sediment concentration depend on <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>velocity</b> profile.

40|$|The {{relative}} motion between the Pacific and Australian plates across the central South Island of New Zealand, {{as measured by}} repeated GPS measurements, is distributed over a region more than 80 km wide. The surface <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>velocity</b> is fit almost equally well by a model in which deformation of the lower lithosphere is concentrated into very narrow slip zones below one or two major faults and by a model in which the lower lithosphere deforms in a broad shear zone. Observations of the splitting of SKS waves permit {{distinction between the two}} models {{on the basis of the}} finite strain they predict. Deformation in the deep lithosphere that was limited to narrow shear zones would not produce measurable splitting; hence any splitting observed should not correlate with surface tectonics. However, the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> fast propagation directions revealed by observations of shear wave splitting do reflect surface tectonics. In particular, the orientations of fast propagation directions are consistent with the finite strain calculated by assuming that the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>velocity</b> at depth within the lithosphere resembles the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>velocity</b> measured at the surface by GPS.
