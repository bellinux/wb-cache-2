40|$|Background: Area-based health inequalities may partly be {{explained}} by higher levels of area disorder in deprived areas. Area disorder may cause safety concerns and hence impair health. This study assessed how, for whom and in what conditions the intervention Meeting for Care and Nuisance (MCN) {{had an impact on}} neighbour nuisance and area safety in four deprived districts in Arnhem, the Netherlands. Methods: Realist evaluation methodology was applied to uncover how, for whom, and under what conditions MCN was expected to and actually produced change. Expected change was based on action plans and scientific theories. Actual change was based on progress reports, media articles, interviews with district managers, and quantitative surveys. Results: Three levels of impact were distinguished. At the organisational level, partly as expected, MCN’s coordinated partnership strategy enabled role alignment, communication, and leadership. This resulted in a more efficient approach of nuisance households. At the level of nuisance households, as expected, MCN’s <b>joint</b> <b>assistance</b> and enforcement <b>strategy</b> removed many of the underlying reasons for nuisance. This resulted in less neighbour nuisance. At the district level, perceptions of social control and area safety improved only in one district. Key conditions for change included a wider safety approach, dense population, and central location of the district within the city. Conclusions: This realist evaluation provided insight into the mechanisms by which a complex area-based intervention was able to reduce neighbour nuisance in deprived areas. Depending on wider conditions, such a reduction in neighbour nuisance may or may not lead to improved perceptions of area safety at the district level...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} written {{at the end}} of 2004 at a {{critical}} time {{in the development of the}} education sector in Tanzania and of rapid changes in the wider picture of government / development partner relations- characterised by rapid moves towards harmonisation, the development of a <b>Joint</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Strategy</b> for Tanzania, and ‘Mkukuta ’ the first of the ‘second generation ’ Poverty Reduction Strategies. One of the most frequently quoted expectations of donor harmonisation is reduced transaction costs (TCs), as an early step towards increased aid effectiveness. This paper attempts to look at the different kinds of TC – administrative, tying and fiscal, to see how they play out through different funding instruments: projects, pooled fund support to the education sector, sector support, and what are their likely implications in the context of moves towards increased budget support. It is argued that TCs do exist only as discreet units (missions, reports, audits etc) which can be cut down upon with consequent increases in efficiency. Rather they form the most visible part of a spectrum that should blend into sustainable partnership and commitment to doing what is necessary to eradicate poverty. In practice this is not the case.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} what aid has actually been doing {{in the area of}} environment in Tanzania through a critical review of the flows, modalities and management of aid. Focusing on the funding for environmental degradation projects, the study notes that budget expenditure allocation to these activities is around 0. 04 per cent of Tanzania's total expenditure. This is a problem given that in the near future financing for climate change alone would need around US$ 1 billion per year (or nearly 10 per cent of the budget). Ultimately, aid money is critical for Tanzania, as over 90 per cent of funds for environment come from donors. To ensure maximum effectiveness of aid, Tanzania, in collaboration with its many development partners, introduced the Tanzania <b>Joint</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Strategy.</b> This resulted in an improvement in the country's operational development strategies and by 2010 out of 13 indicators with applicable targets, six were met. The paper concludes that environmental efforts in Tanzania depend heavily on donor money. This will not be sustainable because, with time, moral hazard will develop to the extent that environmental protection obligations will need to be integrated with economic activities. This calls for reinforcing the 'polluter pays' principle...|$|E

40|$|Zambia {{has a huge}} {{agricultural}} potential, {{which is}} still largely untapped, and could {{play a key role}} in growth and poverty eradication. Since the early 2000 s, the government has implemented important reforms to promote privatisation and trade reforms, leading to higher investment and a strong growth in export crops such as cotton and horticulture. Despite this success, agricultural productivity, especially for food crops, remains low. The study shows that public resources to the agricultural sector have drastically decreased since the early 1990 s, while private sector providers have not stepped in to fill the void left by the government disengagement from input supply and marketing. Despite a strong government commitment to reverse this trend, budget figures show that the share in total allocations dropped again in the 2008 budget. The study also argues that evaluations of past donor interventions in agriculture are not very positive, especially in terms of their sustainability. Projects often paid little attention to local absorptive and implementing capacity, had too narrow a focus on production and food security, and lacked an adequate understanding of the socio-economic conditions and behaviour of the target groups. Lack of co-ordination resulted in duplications and insufficient scale. A new generation of donor projects emerged in the early 2000 s, with a strong focus on commercialisation and the development of market linkages, especially via contract farming. These projects have borne good results in terms of production volumes, quality standards and access to international commodity chains, as well as farmers’ income. The key challenge for donors is to scale up these success cases and ensure sustainability. The implementation of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Strategy</b> for Zambia 2007 - 2010 is an opportunity to achieve a better division of labour, strengthen synergies on the ground and reduce transaction costs for government.

40|$|Following the {{publication}} of the draft Tanzanian <b>Joint</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Strategy</b> (JAS) in July 2005 which outlined a medium-term framework for enhancing aid effectiveness through the rationalisation and alignment of development partner approaches, a series of consultations on this draft strategy took place both within government agencies and among Development Partners. The Development Partner Group in Health (DPG-H) took this opportunity to hold a two-day workshop in late September with the first day devoted to discussing the implications of the JAS for Development Partners, Ministry of Health and President's Office Regional Administration and Local Government. The second day was used as a time to internally reflect on the present functioning of the DPG-H Group, identifying ways of enhancing the work of the group in response to the changing environment. Discussions {{on the first day of}} the Retreat were structured around the five key elements of the JAS, i. e., Sector Dialogue, Aid Modalities, TA and Capacity Building, Division of Labour and Monitoring & Evaluation. Presentations were made by Development Partners with input/comments and clarification given by the Ministry of Health, President's Office Regional Administration and Local Government; and Ministry of Finance. Group work was undertaken in the afternoon to further address pertinent issues that were raised from the plenary discussions in the morning session. This resulted in a number of recommendations that included the following: supporting an effective division of labour; harmonising support with government plans and priorities irrespective of the funding modality; complementarity and coordination enhanced between the various aid modalities; basket funding to continue as a transition towards General Budget Support (GBS); demand driven technical assistance; and over time developing an agreed competency/profile skills mix of health development partners. The second day was an opportunity for members of the DPG-H to come together and reflect on the work of the group - where it had come from, the current functioning of the group (strengths/challenges) and looking forward. A number of presentations were made that covered the background of the group; the history of the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) and the role of development partners; the sector dialogue structures, the expectations and challenges with respect to communication; strengthening the ways of working as a group and the development of an activity plan for prioritising activities. During the plenary sessions a number of recommendations were agreed that included better structuring of the DPG-H meetings; regularity of meetings (once month but more frequently when required); enhancing the coherency and linkages with the overall Development Partner Group; developing and agreeing a work plan and communication strategy; re-visiting the division of labour in terms of roles and responsibilities; putting in place a fully staffed DPG-H Secretariat and organising a troika chairing structure for the group. Moreover, a number of critical suggestions and recommendations were made for further strengthening sector dialogue that centred around revising the structure of the SWAp. As they had implications beyond the mandate of the DPG-H, it was concluded that this would require further discussions, elaboration and agreement by the Ministry of Health/PORALG. ...|$|E

40|$|Exoskeletons {{have the}} ability to improve {{locomotor}} performance {{for a wide range of}} individuals: they can improve the economy of normal walking, aid in load carriage for soldiers, assist individuals with walking disabilities, and serve as gait rehabilitation tools. Although it may seem obvious how exoskeletons should be developed to provide a benefit to the user, the complexity of the human neuromuscular system makes developing effective exoskeleton <b>assistance</b> <b>strategies</b> a challenge. Rather than using intuition to guide our attempts at the design and control of ankle exoskeletons, we need to garner a deeper understanding of how ankle exoskeletons affect locomotor coordination and utilize such findings to facilitate effective interaction between the device and the human. This thesis details an iterative approach towards the development of ankle exoskeleton <b>assistance</b> <b>strategies.</b> We first performed a controlled experiment to observe the human response to specific assistance techniques. We then sought to explain the reasons for the observed responses by estimating muscle-tendon mechanics and energetics at the assisted joint using simulations of a musculoskeletal model. Through experimentation and simulation we found that individuals change and adapt their coordination patterns when walking with ankle exoskeletons, often in unexpected ways. Based on these findings, we developed and tested a novel ankle exoskeleton <b>assistance</b> <b>strategy</b> that adjusts exoskeleton behavior online in response to measured changes in the user. Such individualized, adaptive control approaches seem promising for discovering effective exoskeleton <b>assistance</b> <b>strategies.</b> Eventually we want to apply such strategies to populations with gait disabilities, but only once we have a better understanding of the mechanisms driving gait impairments. To that end, we designed and are conducting an experiment to investigate the relationship between features of post-stroke gait and energy economy. We expect our experimental findings to aid in the development of more accurate predictive models of human locomotion and to motivate new methods for developing assistive and rehabilitative techniques using robotic exoskeletons...|$|R
