5|$|After {{travelling}} to the Himalaya {{the first}} time, the Workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering. Over {{a span of}} 14 years, they traveled eight times to the area, {{which at the time}} was almost completely unexplored and unmapped. Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment, <b>freeze-dried</b> foods, sunblock, or radios. On each expedition, they explored, surveyed, and photographed, ultimately reporting on their findings and creating maps. The couple shared and alternated responsibilities; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles.|$|E
5|$|In 1497 Bristol was the {{starting}} point for John Cabot's voyage of exploration to North America. For many years Bristol merchants had bought <b>freeze-dried</b> cod, called stockfish, from Iceland for consumption in England. However the Hanseatic League, which was trying to control North Atlantic trade at this time, sought to cut off supplies to English merchants. It has often been suggested that this drove Bristol's merchants to look West for new sources of cod fish. On the other hand, while Bristol merchants did largely abandon Iceland in the late-15th century, Hull merchants continued to trade there. Moreover, recent research has shown that England's fisheries off Iceland actually grew significantly from the 1490s, albeit the centre for this activity shifted from Bristol to East Anglia. This makes it hard to sustain the argument that Bristol merchants were somehow 'pushed out' of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable <b>freeze-dried</b> borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E
25|$|Since 2004, <b>freeze-dried</b> indigo, or instant indigo, {{has become}} available. In this method, the indigo {{has already been}} reduced, and then <b>freeze-dried</b> into a crystal. The {{crystals}} are added to warm water to create the dye pot. As in a standard indigo dye pot, care {{has to be taken}} to avoid mixing in oxygen. <b>Freeze-dried</b> indigo is simple to use, and the crystals can be stored indefinitely {{as long as they are}} not exposed to moisture.|$|E

25|$|The Kreca company kills its animal-feed insects {{by putting}} {{them into a}} fridge or {{freeze-drying}} them. Insects destined for human consumption are first sterilized in hot water and then are refrigerated or <b>freeze-dried.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many hikers use <b>freeze-dried</b> precooked entrees for hot meals, quickly reconstituted {{by adding}} boiling water. An {{alternative}} is Ultra High Temperature (UHT) processed food, {{which has its}} moisture retained and merely needs heating with a special, water-activated chemical reaction.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in 3001: The Final Odyssey, {{astronaut}} Frank Poole's <b>freeze-dried</b> body, {{found by}} a spaceship beyond {{the orbit of}} Neptune, is revived by advanced medical science. The novel details the threat posed to humanity by the alien monoliths, whose actions are not always as their builders had intended.|$|E
25|$|Live {{probiotic}} {{cultures are}} available in fermented dairy products and probiotic fortified foods. However, tablets, capsules, powders, and sachets containing the bacteria in <b>freeze-dried</b> form are also available. Probiotics taken orally can be destroyed by the acidic conditions of the stomach. A number of microencapsulation techniques are being developed to address this problem.|$|E

Compounds that contain articles, prepositions or conjunctions, such as rent-a-cop, mother-of-pearl and salt-and-pepper, are also often hyphenated.|$|E
25|$|Closely coextending with peak {{psychedelic}} effects, {{mean time}} to reach peak concentrations (Tmax) {{was determined to be}} 10–15 minutes in whole blood after IM injection, and 2 minutes in plasma after IV administration. When taken orally mixed in an ayahuasca decoction, and in <b>freeze-dried</b> ayahuasca gel caps, DMT Tmax is considerably delayed: 107.59 ± 32.5 minutes, and 90–120 minutes, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Deaths from snakebites are {{uncommon}} {{in many parts}} of the world, but are still counted in tens of thousands per year in India. Snakebite can be treated with antivenom made from the venom of the snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of different species of snake is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted; the serum is separated, purified and <b>freeze-dried.</b> The cytotoxic effect of snake venom is being researched as a potential treatment for cancers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{nutrients}} {{are available in}} the must and skins of the grapes themselves but sometimes are supplemented by winemakers with additions such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), <b>freeze-dried</b> micro-nutrients (such as Go-Ferm and Ferm-K) and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some Italian wine regions is the ripasso method of adding the leftover pomace from the pressing of other wines into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast.|$|E
25|$|Most krill is {{processed}} to produce fish food {{for use in}} aquariums and aquacultures. The krill is sold <b>freeze-dried,</b> either whole or pulverized. Krill as a food source {{is known to have}} positive effects on some fish, such as stimulating appetite or resulting in an increased disease resistance. Furthermore, krill contains carotenoids and is thus used sometimes as a pigmentizing agent to color the skin and meat of some fish. About 34% of the Japanese catch of E. superba and 50% of E. pacifica are used for fish food; the Canadian catch is used almost exclusively for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} to Japan by the Dutch in the 17th century, but remained a curiosity until the lifting of trade restrictions in 1858. The first European-style coffeehouse opened in Tokyo in 1888, and closed four years later. By the early 1930s there were over 30,000 coffeehouses across the country; availability in the wartime and immediate postwar period dropped to nearly zero, then rapidly increased as import barriers were removed. The introduction of <b>freeze-dried</b> instant coffee, canned coffee, and franchises such as Starbucks and Doutor Coffee in the late 20th century continued this trend, {{to the point that}} Japan {{is now one of the}} leading per capita coffee consumers in the world.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{reducing}} the risk of rejection is to use a technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person's rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet's membrane are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea. Furthermore, it is possible to transplant <b>freeze-dried</b> donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance of rejection. Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that graft rejection is more likely to occur in penetrating keratoplasty than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all of the}} TNF inhibitors, {{infliximab}} is {{an expensive}} medication, costing about US$900 for a 100mg dose, and within the United States is covered by almost every medical insurance plan (though caps on many plans {{make it possible to}} be covered for only a subset of treatments {{in the course of a}} year). Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (<b>freeze-dried)</b> powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.|$|E
25|$|Mars analog {{habitats}} {{are established}} to prepare astronauts, engineers, and researchers {{for the future}} challenges of sending a manned mission to Mars. These analogs are inhabited by small teams of volunteers and may operate under “Mars-like” conditions {{for a few days}} to over a year. Habitats are often located in areas that closely resemble the environment of Mars, such as polar deserts. While living in the habitats, crew members are mostly isolated from the outside world, survive on a diet of <b>freeze-dried</b> food, and may conduct field experiments while wearing protective space suits. Meanwhile, researchers analyze the crew members’ medical and psychological conditions and study the social and teamwork dynamics of the crew.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{products}} are sold {{for the convenience}} of consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee or who {{do not have access to}} coffeemaking equipment. Instant coffee is dried into soluble powder or <b>freeze-dried</b> into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water. Originally invented in 1907, it rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the post-war period, with Nescafé being the most popular product. Many consumers determined that the convenience in preparing a cup of instant coffee more than made up for a perceived inferior taste, although, since the late 1970s, instant coffee has been produced differently in such a way that is similar to the taste of freshly brewed coffee. Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine invented in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatment}} for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake. Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent). In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, {{with the exception of}} the coral snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse. The serum is separated and further purified and <b>freeze-dried.</b> It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes antivenom. For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom. Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{does not}} require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL. First, a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent (e.g. polylactic acid in dichloromethane) then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion. Before the two phases can separate, the emulsion is cast into a mold and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen. The frozen emulsion is subsequently <b>freeze-dried</b> to remove the dispersed water and the solvent, thus leaving a solidified, porous polymeric structure. While emulsification and freeze-drying allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL (since it {{does not require}} a time consuming leaching step), it still requires the use of solvents. Moreover, pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular. Freeze-drying by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds. In particular, it is used to prepare collagen sponges: collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into a mold, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized.|$|E
500|$|By the 13th century Bristol {{had become}} a busy port. [...] Woollen cloth became its main export during the fourteenth to fifteenth century, while wine from Gascony and Bordeaux, was the {{principal}} import. In addition the town conducted an extensive trade with the Anglo-Irish ports of southern Ireland, such as Waterford and Cork, {{as well as with}} Portugal. [...] From about 1420–1480 the port also traded with Iceland, from which it imported a type of <b>freeze-dried</b> cod called 'stockfish'.|$|E
500|$|Dishes served include palate cleansers made {{of vodka}} and green tea, frozen in liquid nitrogen, a snail {{porridge}} that {{was described by}} one food critic as [...] "infamous", and ice creams of both crab, and egg and bacon, each of which resulted in increased media attention for the restaurant. The mock turtle soup has an Alice in Wonderland theme, where a fob watch formed of <b>freeze-dried</b> beef stock covered with gold leaf is dropped into a tea cup and has a beef stock [...] "tea" [...] poured over it that dissolves the gold and the watch. A plate of ox tongue and vegetables is served alongside it to place into the soup. Toast sandwiches are served as a side dish. It had been developed for an appearance on Heston's Feasts, and was afterwards added to the menu at the restaurant. Dishes are served with additional sensory inputs, such as [...] "Sounds of the Sea", a plate of seafood served with a seafood foam {{on top of a}} [...] "beach" [...] of tapioca, breadcrumbs and eel. Alongside the dish, diners are given an iPod to listen to crashing waves whilst they eat. Other additional sensory components include [...] "The smell of the Black Forest" [...] that accompanies a kirsch ice cream.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of complex nutritional supplements and advances in <b>freeze-dried</b> cultures of LAB, winemakers would cultivate their inoculum of lactic acid bacteria from culture slants provided by laboratories. In the 1960s, these winemakers {{found it easier to}} create starter cultures in media that contained apple or tomato juice. This [...] "tomato juice factor" [...] was discovered to be a derivative of pantothenic acid, an important growth factor for the bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|Tiwanaku's {{location}} {{between the}} lake and dry highlands provided key resources of fish, wild birds, plants, and herding grounds for camelids, particularly llamas. Tiwanaku's economy was based on exploiting {{the resources of the}} lake Titicaca, herding of llamas and alpacas and organized farming in raised field systems. Llama meat was consumed and potatoes, quinoa, beans and maize grown. Storage of food was important in the uncertain high altitude climate, so technologies for <b>freeze-dried</b> potatoes and sun-dried meat were developed.|$|E
2500|$|Chuño is a <b>freeze-dried</b> potato product {{traditionally}} made by Quechua and Aymara {{communities of}} Peru and Bolivia, [...] {{and is known}} in various countries of South America, including Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. In Chile's Chiloé Archipelago, potatoes are the main ingredient of many dishes, including milcaos, chapaleles, curanto and chochoca.

2500|$|An initial {{estimate}} of the toxicity of CYN in 1985 was that an [...] at 24 hours was 64±5nbsp&mg of <b>freeze-dried</b> culture/kg of mouse body weight on intraperitoneal injection. A further experiment in 1997 measured the LD50 as 52nbsp&mg/kg at 24 hours and 32nbsp&mg/kg at 7 days, however the data suggested that another toxic compound was present in the isolate of sonicated cells used; predictions made by Ohtani et al. about the 24‑hour toxicity were considerably higher, and it was proposed that another metabolite was present {{to account for the}} relatively low 24‑hour toxicity level measured.|$|E
2500|$|Cultured yeasts {{that are}} <b>freeze-dried</b> and {{available}} for inoculation of wine must are deliberately grown in commercial labs in high oxygen/low sugar conditions that favor {{the development of}} these survival factors. One of the reasons that some winemakers prefer using inoculated yeast is the predictability of fermentation due to the high level of survival factors that cultured yeast are assured of having without necessarily needing to expose the wine to additional levels of oxygen. Winemakers using [...] "ambient" [...] yeasts that are resident in their winery may not have this same assurance of survival factors and may need to compensate with other winemaking techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Pure culture yeasts {{that are}} grown {{in a lab}} are often freeze dried and {{packaged}} for commercial use. Prior to their addition into must, these yeasts need to be re-hydrated in [...] "starter cultures" [...] that must be carefully monitored (particularly in regards to temperature) {{to insure that the}} yeast cells are not killed off by cold shock. Ideally winemakers want to add enough inoculum to have a viable cell population density of 5 million cells per milliliter. The exact amount of <b>freeze-dried</b> culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1gram per gallon (or 25grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added.|$|E
