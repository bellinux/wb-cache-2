5|$|The Native Americans' victory {{celebrations}} were short-lived. Public {{shock and}} outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's {{knowledge about the}} remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band {{across the border into}} the North-West Territories, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return. When crossing the border into Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.|$|E
5|$|James {{asserted}} {{his authority}} not only over the nobility but also upon the Church and lamented that King David I's benevolence towards the Church proved costly to his successors {{and that he}} was 'a sair sanct to the croun'. James also considered that the monastic institutions in particular needed improvement and that they should return to being strictly ordered communities. Part of James's solution was to create an assembly of overseeing abbots and followed this up by establishing a Carthusian priory at Perth to provide other religious houses with an example of internal conduct. He also sought to influence Church attitudes to his policies by having his own clerics appointed to the bishoprics of Dunblane, Dunkeld, Glasgow and Moray. In March 1425, James's parliament directed that all bishops must instruct their clerics to offer up prayers for the king and his family; a year later, parliament toughened up this edict insisting that the prayers be given at every mass under sanction of a fine and severe rebuke. This same parliament legislated that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> Scotland should 'be governed under the king's laws and statutes of this realm only'. From this, laws were enacted in 1426 to restrict the actions of prelates whether it was to regulate their need to travel to the Roman Curia or their ability to purchase additional ecclesiastical positions while there. In James's parliament of July 1427, it is evident that statute being enacted had the purpose of reducing the powers of the church jurisdiction.|$|E

Moreover, the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the U.S.: A/Victoria/75 (H3N2), which spread simultaneously, also caused illness, and persisted until March.

The heavens influenced <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> different ways by influencing elements connected to certain humors, important information in reaching a diagnosis. The physician could determine which humor was unbalanced in the patient and prescribe a new diet to restore that balance.

25|$|Fritz Perls {{presented}} {{his theory of}} dreams {{as part of the}} holistic nature of Gestalt therapy. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed. Jung argued that one could consider <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.|$|E

Completing a census form is compulsory by law for <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand on census night but respondents {{are able to}} object to answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion {{more than doubled in}} two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census. Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.|$|E

Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E

500|$|Ford {{was confronted}} with a {{potential}} swine flu pandemic. In the early 1970s, an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On February 5, 1976, an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; health officials announced that [...] "swine flu" [...] was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that <b>every</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> the United States be vaccinated. Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% {{of the population was}} vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976.
