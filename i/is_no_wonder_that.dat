Therefore, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Vincent in both of his papers of 1834 and 1836 states Budan's theorem and contrasts it with the one by Fourier. Vincent was the last author in the 19th century to state Budan's theorem in its original form.|$|E
25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{began reading}} Shakespeare's plays and poetry {{when he was}} a young boy. He would involve himself so closely with the plays that he was once terrified by the Ghost in Hamlet and had to [...] "have people about him". Johnson's fascination with Shakespeare {{continued}} throughout his life, and Johnson focused his time on Shakespeare's plays while preparing A Dictionary of the English Language, so it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Shakespeare is the most quoted author in it.|$|E

It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during this time and surely {{felt that he was}} in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E

500|$|More than {{a century}} after his death, {{literary}} critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets. Yvor Winters claimed that [...] "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson". F. R. Leavis agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, [...] "When we read him we know, beyond question, {{that we have here}} a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really is criticism". Edmund Wilson claimed that [...] "The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism". The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson's work firmly within the Western canon, describing him as [...] "unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him...Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity, one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour." [...] It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.|$|E

2500|$|The term is {{now widely}} used by {{researchers}} and academicians {{and so is}} no longer merely a slang term, but a name clearly attached to a recognized and well-studied segment of U.S. culture: [...] "Most of the professional research on growing up in military families {{has contributed to the}} perpetuation of the 'brat' label," [...] sociologist and noted expert on the study of military brats Morten Ender wrote.

2500|$|Operation Goodwood almost cost Montgomery his job, as Eisenhower seriously {{considered}} sacking him and only {{chose not to}} do so because to sack the popular [...] "Monty" [...] would have caused such a political backlash in Britain against the Americans at a critical moment in the war that the resulting strains in the Atlantic alliance were not considered worth it. Montgomery expressed his satisfaction at the results of Goodwood when calling the operation off. Eisenhower {{was under the impression that}} Goodwood was to be a break out operation. There was a miscommunication between the two men or Eisenhower did not understand the strategy. Alan Brooke chief of the British Imperial General Staff wrote: [...] "Ike knows nothing about strategy and is quite unsuited to the post of Supreme Commander. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Monty's real high ability is not always realised" [...] Bradley fully understood Montgomery's intentions.

2500|$|... "Black women's {{relationships}} to their bodies occur within overlapping cultural contexts that offer contradictory messages about their value and function". In a male dominated society, it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> women {{used to work}} hard to align themselves with male images including how they'd dressed. As women generally gained access to and exposure within the offerings of several sectors of society, for example music, movies and television, we saw more images of what constituted attractiveness emerge. Following this came the perception of freedom to express oneself through several avenues including apparel. Rappers Lil' Kim and Eve are known for resorting to trends surrounding being scantily clad with provocative tattoos and being perceived as attractive in the process. Not all female rappers, or female artists in general have resorted to these methods within their careers. [...] "..the recent appearance of Black women performers, songwriters, and producers in Black popular culture has called attention {{to the ways in which}} young Black women use popular culture to negotiate social existence and attempt to express independence, self-reliance, and agency".|$|E
2500|$|Holmes was {{partially}} modelled on his former university teacher Joseph Bell. In 1892, {{in a letter}} to Bell, Doyle wrote, [...] "It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man," [...] and, in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> after the study of such a character [...] I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal." [...] Robert Louis Stevenson was able, even in faraway Samoa, to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: [...] "My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.... can this be my old friend Joe Bell?" [...] Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, the famous Edgar Allan Poe character C. Auguste Dupin. Dr. (John) Watson owes his surname, but not any other obvious characteristic, to a Portsmouth medical colleague of Doyle's, Dr James Watson.|$|E
2500|$|Crabbe's life at Parham was not happy. The {{former owner}} of the estate had been very popular for his hospitality, while Crabbe's {{lifestyle}} was much more quiet and private. His solace here was the company of his friend Dudley Long North and his fellow Whigs who lived nearby. Crabbe soon sent his two sons George and John to school in Aldeburgh. After four years at Parham, the Crabbes moved to a home in Great Glemham, Suffolk, placed at his disposal by Dudley North. The family remained here {{for four or five}} years. In 1796 their third son, Edmund {{died at the age of}} six. This was a heavy blow to Sarah who began suffering from a nervous disorder from which she never recovered. Crabbe, a devoted husband, tended her with exemplary care until her death in 1813. Robert Southey, writing about Crabbe to his friend, Neville White, in 1808, said [...] "It was not long before his wife became deranged, and when all this was told me by one who knew him well, five years ago, he was still almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and hopeless malady. A sad history! It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> he gives so melancholy a picture of human life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{successful}} {{conclusion of}} the Normandy campaign saw {{the beginning of the}} debate between the [...] "American school" [...] and [...] "British school" [...] as both American and British generals started to advance claims about who was most responsible for this victory. Brooke wrote in defence of his protégé Montgomery: [...] "Ike knows nothing about strategy and is quite unsuited to the post of Supreme Commander. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Monty's real high ability is not always realised. Especially so when 'national' spectacles pervert the perspective of the strategic landscape". About Montgomery's conduct of the Normandy campaign, Badsey wrote: [...] "Too much discussion on Normandy has centered on the controversial decisions of the Allied commanders. It was not good enough, apparently, to win such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe unless it was done perfectly. Most of the blame for this lies with Montgomery, who was foolish enough to insist that it had been done perfectly, that Normandy – and all his other battles – had been fought accordingly to a precise master plan drawn up beforehand, from which he never deviated. It says much for his personality that Montgomery found others to agree with him, despite overwhelmingly evidence to the contrary. His handling of the Battle of Normandy was of a very high order, and as the person who would certainly have been blamed for losing the battle, he deserves the credit for winning it".|$|E
2500|$|John Carbutt (1832–1905) {{was born}} in Sheffield, England. [...] His first stop in the New World was Canada. The Chicago, Illinois city {{directory}} of 1861 {{is the first to}} bear his name in the United States. [...] During the 1860s in Chicago, Carbutt was a prolific producer of stereoviews of Chicago, the Upper Mississippi, and the [...] "Great West." [...] Western images included the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad and portraits of Indians. [...] Carbutt may be best recognized for his significant contributions to the advancement of photographic processes in the 19th Century and early 20th Century. He was among the earliest photographers to experiment with magnesium light (January 1865), he experimented with dry plates as early as 1864 and began producing commercial dry plates in 1879. [...] Carbutt and Dr. Arthur W. Goodspeed produced the earliest X-ray photographs in February 1896. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> his biographer William Brey barely mentions his Civil War photographs. [...] The largest known output of Civil War photographs by Carbutt are 40 or so stereoviews of the 134th Illinois Infantry camped at Columbus, Kentucky. [...] The 134th was a 100-day unit that were in Columbus from June 1864 until October 1864. [...] Lincoln's funeral train was photographed by Carbutt as it passed through Chicago on May 1, 1865 and he followed the train to Springfield where he obtained photographs of Lincoln's home. [...] The last of the great Sanitary Fairs was held in Chicago in June 1865 and Carbutt was there to photograph the interior and exterior of the second Northwestern Soldiers Fair. [...] Although the war was over the Illinois soldier's homes at Chicago and Cairo, Illinois required continued funding and the fair helped cover other continuing expenses of the Northwestern Sanitary Commission.|$|E
