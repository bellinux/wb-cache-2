25|$|As student {{enrollment}} continued to grow, another renovation project was planned {{to increase the}} capacity of the high school while updating the facilities to better meet students' needs. The two-year project began in 1995 and required the ninth grade students to remain in their respective middle schools another year. Students in grades 10-12 occupied half of the high school while the other half was being renovated. Staff and students then picked up and moved all books, furniture and equipment into the renovated half of the building in 1996, and construction began on the other half. The $30 million renovation project connected the former ninth grade building and the high school. New construction took place over the former parking tiers with a new cafeteria (seating capacity of 600), gymnasium (capacity of 2000), library/media center, and enclosed walkway. All classrooms were reconfigured with additional classrooms located in the former library and cafeteria. The familiar curving hallways remained, but new terrazzo floors, ceiling tiles, and freshly painted lockers were added. Along with updated lab facilities, technology was a <b>huge</b> <b>part</b> of the project, as over 500 computers were added throughout the building.|$|E
