5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. <b>Just</b> <b>keep</b> in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
25|$|Bam Teli {{is about}} the {{psychological}} games involved in human relationships, when people often hurt each other, sometimes leaving incurable wounds behind. In this song Tarkan advises not {{to get involved in}} such games, sometimes we should <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> silent, show understanding and acceptance of the other and leave things to time.|$|E

25|$|The Unfederated Malay States, on {{the other}} hand, {{maintained}} their quasi-independence, had more autonomy, and instead of having a Resident they were required only to accept a British Advisor, though in reality they were still bound by treaty to accept the advice. The British undertook far less economic exploitation as they primarily wished to <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> these states in line. Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu were surrendered by Siam after the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. Independent Johor, meanwhile, had to surrender Singapore to the British earlier on. Despite the Sultan's political effort, {{he was forced to}} accept an advisor in 1914, becoming the last Malay state to lose its sovereignty (British involvement in Johor actually began as early as 1885).|$|E
25|$|For many years, {{movie studios}} were {{careless}} with old props, costumes, scripts, and other materials, unaware of their increasing value as memorabilia. Often, workers would <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> props as souvenirs without permission, {{aware that their}} employers did not particularly care. One of the more notorious of these was costumer Kent Warner, who amassed a large private collection and supplemented his income with sales. It was he who found the slippers in February or March 1970 while helping {{to set up a}} mammoth auction of MGM props and wardrobe. They had been stored and forgotten in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department. One pair became the centerpiece of the auction. Warner kept the best pair for himself, size 5B, and apparently sold the rest.|$|E

It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review for PopMatters, Chris Conaton expressed disappointment in the album's predictability, noting, [...] "At this point it’s {{pretty clear that}} the band is comfortably ensconced in their lifestyle and content to <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> doing {{things the way they}} have been for years." [...] In a lukewarm review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek observed, [...] "there is something here for virtually every fan -- or detractor -- to grab hold of." [...] Sputnikmusic criticized Mangini's drum parts, describing them as [...] "bland", as well as the decision to include three ballads, but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review.|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki forgoes {{traditional}} screenplays in his productions, instead {{developing the}} film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. [...] "We {{never know where}} the story will go but we <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> working on the film as it develops," [...] he said. In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to [...] "enrich the visual look", though he ensures that each film can [...] "retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and {{still be able to}} call my films 2D". He oversees every frame of his films.|$|E

Dylan threw him out of his limousine, saying, [...] "You're not a folksinger. You're a journalist".|$|R

500|$|I don't think it's {{important}} to take it too literally.

500|$|With the video, Madonna {{broke the}} taboo of interracial relationships. Although {{at first it}} seems that Madonna denies the Hispanic guy in favour of the photographer, later she rejects him, {{implying}} her desire to control her own sexual pleasures or going over the established pop borderlines with lyrics like [...] "You <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> on pushing my love, over the borderline". The contrasting image of Madonna, first as a messy blonde in the Hispanic sequence and later as a fashioned glamorous blonde, suggested that one can construct one's own image and identity. Portraying herself as a Hispanic also had the clever marketing strategy of appealing to Hispanic and black youths, thus breaking down racial barriers.|$|E
500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the period}} 1974–1975, FANK forces officially grew from 100,000 to {{approximately}} 250,000 men, but probably only numbered around 180,000 due to payroll padding by their officers {{and due to}} desertions. U.S. military aid (ammunition, supplies, and equipment) was funneled to FANK through the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC). Authorized a total of 113 officers and men, the team arrived in Phnom Penh in 1971, under the overall command of CINCPAC Admiral John S. McCain, Jr. [...] The attitude of the Nixon administration could be summed up by the advice given by Henry Kissinger to the first head of the liaison team, Colonel Jonathan Ladd: [...] "Don't think of victory; <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> it alive." [...] Nevertheless, McCain constantly petitioned the Pentagon for more arms, equipment, and staff for what he proprietarily viewed as [...] "my war".|$|E
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|... "Here We Go Again" [...] is an uptempo power pop song, with guitar {{lines and}} pop hooks. Critics made {{comparisons}} with works by Kelly Clarkson, particularly the song [...] "Since U Been Gone". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] {{is written in}} the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of F5. It has a basic sequence of F–Dm–Dm–Gm/B–F as its chord progression. The song's lyrics chronicle the protagonist's on-off relationship with an indecisive boy as she sings that [...] "Something about you is so addictive". Lovato explained: [...] "So it's about, basically, being in a relationship where you break-up and you make-up, and you break-up and it's like 'Here we go again, we <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> doing this over and over'." ...|$|E
