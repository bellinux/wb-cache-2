25|$|John Dean {{believed}} that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman {{could go to}} the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president’s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> prod attendees’ recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked for}} a minute as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{anticipate}} that day by the exercise of his reason.|$|E
60|$|Bream Mortimer looked embarrassed. He wriggled {{a little}} and moved his arms as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> flap them.|$|E
6000|$|... "He had," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Morel, [...] "if he didn't hurtle {{himself up}} as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> {{to get in}} the {{smallest}} space he could." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a troubled}} {{look in his}} face, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to recall {{memories}} that had somehow escaped him, and Hilda, resolutely repressing the impulse to burst into a flood of tears, said cheerfully: ...|$|R
50|$|The feature {{was a huge}} success. Word spread internationally and a story {{made the}} front page of the Wall Street Journal, with Mayo often being asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to {{challenge}} the power and principles of various religions.|$|R
60|$|Her {{companion}} sat {{looking at}} her with a gloomy stare, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make up the deficiencies in her logic.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her; first as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> remember, then {{as if he}} might have been trying to forget. [...] "Nothing, I think--at that place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{altogether}} {{like that}} man’s movements, sir. He crawls about as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put away {{as much time}} as possible. The boy, too, has disappeared.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, certainly," [...] said Mr. Arbuton, {{and looked}} about {{him with an}} eye of cold, uncompassionate inspection, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> it by a {{standard}} of taste, and, on the whole, finding the poor little church vulgar.|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't {{want to do}} him any harm, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to earn {{an honest}} living," [...] put in Roger, [...] "but {{we want you to}} be on your guard in any {{dealings}} you may have with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|As Big Sam passed Black Paul {{he winked}} and whispered: [...] "The old fool is {{doing exactly what}} I would have done <b>if</b> <b>he</b> hadn't come aboard. This suits my plan as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> his best to please me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I think I {{can keep}} awake," [...] stammered Bobby {{and opened his}} eyes very wide as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> stretch his eyelids {{so as to make}} them stay open.|$|E
60|$|He {{started off}} across the plain, and coming back too late for lunch, found Kemp on the veranda. Kemp looked as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be philosophical, but found it hard.|$|E
60|$|His hat was {{off before}} {{he opened the}} door; his {{comforter}} too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> overtake nine o'clock.|$|E
60|$|The Frog {{looked at}} the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.|$|R
60|$|Drummer looked up. There was Unc' Billy Possum's sharp {{little face}} {{sticking}} out of his doorway, and Unc' Billy looked very sleepy and very cross {{and at the same}} time as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> very hard to be polite and pleasant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's different. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> very handsome, in {{a certain}} way." [...] The {{daughter}} said nothing, and the mother added: [...] "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to conceal {{that he had come}} second-cabin, and was not going to let us know that he crossed with us?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{appeared}} to be now my turn to frighten him. The color left his face. He passed his hand restlessly over his forehead, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> brush some delusion out of his brain.|$|E
6000|$|The Rogue had got {{the clue}} he wanted, though {{he held it}} with a clumsy hand. Looking perplexedly at the passionate face, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> work out a sum in his mind, he slowly answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] sighed Arthur, sinking {{back on the}} ground, [...] "that's {{the most}} {{wonderful}} thing that's ever happened to me." [...] He looked as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> put things seen in a dream beside real things.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you notice," [...] he whispered, [...] "that we {{can hear}} the wind much plainer here than in the passage? I believe I can feel a current of fresh air, too. I wonder <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to cut his way through to the air-hole. It's only a few feet up." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{when those}} who {{followed}} {{him with a}} candle reached the cellar-floor, there was Snag, with his head between the barrels, wagging his tail as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to jerk it off, and whining with joy {{as he tried to}} stick his cold nose into the rosy face of little sleeping Bob.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you know, Esther," [...] {{said the}} younger, [...] "I think {{he begins to}} take more notice of things, {{especially}} when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> out-of-doors. <b>He</b> looks around on the scenery, and his eye brightens, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew all about it; and sometimes he knits his brows, and looks down so, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mike {{looked hard}} at my guardian, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> learn {{a lesson from}} his face, and slowly replied, [...] "Ayther to character, or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{subject of}} {{conversation}} {{happened to be}} very congenial to Cheenbuk's cast of mind. He remained thinking and gazing upwards {{for a minute or}} two, then he said meditatively, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> work out some mental problem-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Sam {{looked up}} with a frown of attention, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> take in the new light; but he did take it in, and smacking his hands {{together}} with a noise like a pistol-shot, said, [...] "Ay, that's it! We don't want what is grudged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kurt Busch went incident-free {{until the}} 2016 Coke Zero 400 at Daytona. Kurt Busch {{had a strong}} racecar in the latter stages of the race. Entering the tri-oval on the last lap, Busch was running 3rd when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> spun out by Joey Logano. Busch went across the stripe {{sideways}} and lost 25 positions. Kurt Busch composed himself after the race, but called out Logano for his actions. An aghast Busch said in a post-race interview, [...] "Joey just drove straight through us. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to go from 5th to first or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to defend his teammate. But he just lifted our rear tires off the ground...You can't go from 5th to first, there's just no way." [...] Crew chief Tony Gibson was just as frustrated over the incident, saying in a tweet, [...] "Stupid is as stupid does." ...|$|R
60|$|Having said this, {{the old man}} relapsed into silence, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> {{to figure}} out how the work might be done with less of danger, and I sat staring at him in a rage, for to my mind he had much the same as compassed his own death and mine by not {{speaking}} of all the perils in our path.|$|R
5000|$|... "Since the war, Forrest {{has lived}} at Memphis, and his {{principal}} occupation {{seems to have}} <b>been</b> to <b>try</b> and explain away the Fort Pillow affair. He wrote several letters about it, which were published, and always {{had something to say}} about it in any public speech he delivered. <b>He</b> seemed as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> always to rub away the blood stains which marked him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{cannot be}} an Italian; {{at least not}} a Roman," [...] {{observed}} an artist. [...] "I never knew {{one of them to}} care about ablution. See him now! It is as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> wash off' the time-stains and earthly soil of a thousand years!" ...|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{sat down}} with his big bushy tail curled around to keep his toes warm, cocked his head on one side, {{and looked up at}} Blacky the Crow as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> see right inside that black head {{to find out what was}} going on there.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Daniel {{was seated}} {{by the window}} as usual, {{looking out over the}} distant hills as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> peer in at the gates of that city where so many loved ones awaited him, and it was some moments before Toby could make him {{understand}} what it was he was trying to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} that Uncle Roger meant what he said," [...] remarked the Story Girl. [...] "I couldn't get a look into his eyes. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to hoax us {{there would have been}} a twinkle in them. He can never help that. You know he would think it a great joke to frighten us like this. It's really dreadful to have no grown-ups you can depend on." ...|$|R
50|$|Neither fighter {{managed to}} deliver any {{significant}} {{damage to the}} other until Cro Cop was defeated by Mir at 4:02 of the third round by KO. In a later interview for a Croatian television station Cro Cop stated that he suffered a disc herniation {{three weeks before the}} fight with Mir. He decided not to inform the UFC about this injury because he believed it would seem as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> {{to pull out of the}} fight.|$|R
50|$|The scene likely {{represents}} {{some type}} of courtship, but the roles being played by the two figures are not clear. The woman has just drained the {{glass of wine and}} the man seems impatient to pour her more, almost as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to get her drunk. A musical instrument, the cittern, lies on the chair with musical notebooks. But the figure of Temperance is depicted in the stained glass window, adding to the tension in the scene.|$|R
