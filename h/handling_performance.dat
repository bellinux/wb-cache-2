25|$|Various {{engineering}} refinements {{that had}} gone into the Tempest II were incorporated into the last Tempest variant, designated as the Tempest VI. This variant was furnished with a Napier Sabre V engine with 2,340hp (1,700kW). The more powerful Sabre V required a bigger radiator which displaced the oil cooler and carburettor air intake from the radiator's centre; air for the carburettor was drawn through intakes on {{the leading edge of the}} inner wings, while the oil cooler was located behind the radiator. Most Tempest VIs were tropicalised, the main feature of this process being an air filter which was fitted in a fairing on the lower centre section. Other changes included the strengthening of the rear spar and the inclusion of spring tabs, which granted the variant superior <b>handling</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
40|$|Race {{cars are}} {{characterized}} by very high drive torques and <b>handling</b> <b>performances.</b> However, high torques are useless if they cannot be converted into vehicle acceleration due to macro-slippage of the driven tyres.
