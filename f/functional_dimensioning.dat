The composite interface area is of specific significance in this respect. The presented method initiates diffusion processes with phase reformation to obtain a firmly-bonded metal joint...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the <b>functional</b> <b>dimensioning</b> (FD) concept applied to the construction sector. FD addresses the issue of tolerance; construction involves several trades working together while each trade has its own construction tolerances. To investigate this problem, three case studies are investigated. The first one describes a classic case of a window in a bay and the way constructors solved the resulting tolerance problems. The second case study describes the notion of chain dimension. The last case study presents the notion of wedge as a solution to solve problems related to tolerance gap accumulation. This paper is of interest to the scientific community that is working to industrialize the construction sector and also to architects (in the design), construction managers (onsite), and manufacturers (construction trades) ...|$|E

Then, a simulation is performed, to verify if the real features of the part can simultaneously fit the virtual gage.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{functional}} approach to optimal dimensioning of automotive transmission shafts. In particular, the paper summarizes {{the results of a}} research activity developed on automotive transmission shafts to reduce the unpleasant movement of the transmission lever known as “shift lever movement”. The design problem was faced by focusing the axial clearances of the wheels assembled on the transmission shaft. First, the functional approach to optimal dimensioning proceeds from the study of different working conditions of the automotive manual transmission and focuses on corresponding geometrical constraints and design parameters. Then, it uses simplified schemes, each of them related to a different working condition, to set a series of <b>functional</b> <b>dimensioning</b> loops for the transmission shaft. Subsequently, the approach introduces an appropriate index to evaluate the Information Content for each dimensioning scheme and it addresses the optimal dimensioning scheme, related to the minimization of the Information Content. After this, the approach foresees worst-case to check the axial clearances of the wheels assembled on the shaft. In a such way the effect of the dimensioning are directly evaluated in terms of performances of the transmission. In fact, the reduction of axial clearances for the wheels assembled on the shaft causes a direct reduction of the “shift lever movement”. The functional approach to optimal dimensioning is applied to an automotive transmission set and the proposed dimensioning schema of the shaft is compared with different dimensioning schemes including one currently used in an international automotive company. A final discussion of the results, in terms of reduction of axial clearances of the parts assembled on the shaft, is provided...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{accomplish}} the analysis of a transmission shaft belonging to a longitudinal gearbox {{in order to reduce}} the axial clearances of the parts assembled on the shaft. The paper demonstrates also that the study of assembly conditions allows simplifying the analysis and the evaluation of different dimensioning schemes. Method - A previous functional approach to optimal dimensioning is used but it is associated to the analysis of relationships between the parts assembled on the shaft, the corresponding functional surfaces and the related dimensioning schemes. Then, a statistical analysis of tolerance chain is accomplished by using different IT grades that characterize dimensional tolerances. Result - The optimal <b>functional</b> <b>dimensioning</b> scheme of an automotive transmission shaft is accomplished. The scheme is able to guarantee the minimum axial clearances of parts assembled on the shaft. Discussion & Conclusion - The paper deals with the application of a functional approach to the optimal dimensioning of an automotive transmission shaft. The automotive transmission set is characterized by different working conditions, geometrical constraints and design parameters. Therefore, a preliminary decomposition of the assembly in several subsystems or groups is necessary to clearly analyse the longitudinal gearbox. Then, the study of assembling conditions and related functional surfaces allow simplifying the evaluation of different dimensioning schemes. In fact, the functional approach, aimed to optimal dimensioning, uses a worst-case and statistical analyses to directly check the axial clearances of the wheels assembled on the shaft. Therefore, the effects of dimensioning are directly evaluated in terms of performances of the transmission. Therefore, the different dimensioning schemes are evaluated through the functional approach, as the optimal scheme is able to guarantee the whole set of functional requirements of the shaft...|$|E

The problem is to ensure that the studied functional requirement will be well respected considering the tolerances on influential parts. The aim of this paper is to compare two methods of tolerance analysis of a mechanical system: the method of "analysis lines" and the method of "polytopes". The first method needs a discretization of the ending functional surface according to various analysis lines placed on the outer-bound of the face and oriented along the normal of the surface. For each analysis line, the result is the sum of the influences of each junction defects on the search characteristic using pre-established relations for classical types of junctions. The calculation is very fast and it can express the result as a formula according to the tolerances, if necessary with a statistical approach. The second method uses polytopes (finite sets of point in n). The polytopes are defined from the acceptable limits of the geometric deviations of parts and possible displacements between two parts. Minkowski sums and intersections polytopes are then carried out to take into account all geometric variations of a mechanism. Tools like OpenCASCADE have been developed to quickly realize intersections and Minkowski sums. This comparison is performed on a simple example specified with the method CLIC.

We prove that on the class of finite-valued graphs with a successor relation, the query SP, where SP(a, b, i) if the shortest path between a and b is of cost, i, is not monadic second-order definable, i. e. it cannot be defined by a second-order formula with existential and universal second-order quantifiers on monadic relations. We then conclude that it can neither be defined by iterated inductions with one recursion variable, nor by stratified logic programs with one recursion variable.

The first procedure executes the verification of the functional requirements by automatically extracting the <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> chains in the mechanical sub-assembly. Then a second procedure performs an optimization of the dispersions on the basis of unknown variables. The third procedure uses the optimized values of the dispersions to compute the optimized average values and tolerances of the <b>functional</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the chains. A statistical and cost based approach is integrated in the methodology in order to take account of the capabilities of the manufacturing processes and to distribute optimal values among the individual components of the chains.

Methods:This descriptive correlational study was conducted on 50 patients with breast cancer, selected via convenience sampling in Kerman, Iran. To collect data Stress Coping Strategy Scale (Moss and Billings, 1982) and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C 30, version 3. 0) were used. For data analysis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and stepwise regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 21. Results: The results showed a significant positive relationship between problem-focused coping strategies and two dimensions of QOL including total symptoms and functional scale (P= 0. 01). In addition, emotion-focused coping strategies had a significant negative correlation with total symptoms and <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of QOL (P= 0. 01). Emotion-focused coping styles predicted a higher rate of the variance in the <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of QOL compared to problem-focused coping styles (34. 7 % vs. 26. 2 %). The functional scale was significantly correlated with problem-focused coping styles (P= 0. 001 and β= 0. 512), indicating the predictive value of this scale. Moreover, the <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of QOL was significantly correlated with emotion-focused coping strategies (P= 0. 001 and β=- 0. 612), showing the significance of this scale as a negative predictor. Conclusion: Problem-focused coping styles had the most significant contribution to the functional scale of QOL.
