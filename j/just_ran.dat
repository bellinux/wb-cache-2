25|$|In 1871, the Lawrence Street Railway Company {{opened and}} offered {{citizens}} {{easy access to}} hotels and businesses along Massachusetts Street. The first streetcar was pulled by horses and mules and the track <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> along Massachusetts Street. After the 1903 flood, the Kansas River bridge had to be rebuilt but was not considered safe for a streetcar to pass over. The Lawrence Street Railway Company closed later that year. In 1907, C.L. Rutter attempted to bring back a bus system, after having failed in 1902. In 1909, a new streetcar system was implemented putting Rutter out of business and lasting until 1935.|$|E
25|$|Colts RB Edgerrin James {{topped the}} 100-yard mark {{for the second}} {{straight}} game, and he also scored his first rushing touchdown of the year in this game. His 2-yard touchdown run was the only touchdown scored, and the kickers for both teams both kicked in two field goals each. The Browns defended the deep pass and the potent Colts offense all game, and the Colts <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> the ball. Both of the quarterbacks combined for only 11 incomplete passes. Colts QB Peyton Manning finished the game 19 for 23 with 228 yards passing and one interception as Browns QB Trent Dilfer finished 22 of 29 for 208 passing yards.|$|E
25|$|The retinue of a besieged castle usually {{consisted}} {{of only a}} few able-bodied men. If the siege was foreseen, the castle's peacetime complement of three to twenty men could be doubled or tripled. And in an emergency, at least the higher ranks could take refuge in the main tower. A castle was only regarded as conquered when the bergfried had fallen. This could take some weeks. During this time the attacker had to continue to feed and pay his men. Sometimes, therefore, the mercenaries of the besieger <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> away or even turned against their commander, if they had to wait too long for success.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, the Nevada {{defense had}} {{difficulty}} stopping the Maryland run. Nevada's rush defense allowed 258yards, compared with its regular-season average of just 74.5yards allowed per game. This was especially true after a well-rested Da'Rel Scott entered {{the game in}} the middle of the third quarter. Head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> through us like we weren't there."

500|$|The revived Doctor Who {{series was}} to feature a script by Stephen Fry, {{set in the}} 1920s. Rumours {{appeared}} on the BBC's websites shortly after the airing of the new Series 1 and the story was pencilled in as the eleventh episode of Series 2. According to a video diary entry by David Tennant, Fry attended the very first cast read-through for Series 2, indicating that his script was still under consideration at that point. Due to budgetary constraints, the episode was moved to Series 3 and replaced by Fear Her. The story was subsequently abandoned, as Fry did not have spare time for the rewriting necessary to replace Rose with Martha. Fry said, [...] "They {{asked me to do}} a series and I tried, but I <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> out of time, and so I wrote a pathetic letter of [...] "I'm sorry I can't do this" [...] to Davies." ...|$|E

Clague later said: [...] "Mrs Lennon <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> {{straight}} {{out in front of}} me. I just couldn't avoid her. I was not speeding, I swear it. It {{was just one of those}} terrible things that happen." [...] Baird and Jackie (aged eleven and eight respectively) were sent straightway to stay in Edinburgh at their Aunt Mater's, and were not allowed to attend the funeral. [...] They were told two months later by Norman Birch (Lennon's uncle) that their mother had died. Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Uncle Norman Birch were made legal guardians of the girls—ignoring Dykins' parentage, as he had never legally married Julia.

[...] Rihanna explained: [...] "When we wrote the song, {{it was kind of}} a freestyle...I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, I just went in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to me like that, 'Come here Rude Boy, is you big enough'?, it does sound so disgusting!"

Her reunion with her daughter was uncertain to the last, as Hubbard had second thoughts about letting her go as he drove Northrup and Alexis to the local airport. She persuaded him that the compulsion instilled by the communists would be dissipated by going ahead with the flight: [...] "Well, I have to follow their dictates. I'll just go to the airplane." [...] She was so desperate to leave by the time she got to the airport that she left behind her daughter's clothes and her own suitcase and one of Alexis's shoes fell off as she dashed to the plane.

500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

500|$|Although the NHL had not {{suspended}} Richards for {{his actions}} against Booth, the incident {{was instrumental in the}} League's newfound efforts to eliminate hits to the head, particularly against players who cannot see the oncoming checker approaching (as was the case with Booth). Several months after Booth's October 2009 concussion, Boston Bruins forward Marc Savard was hit by Matt Cooke in a similar fashion on March 7. Later that month, on March 25, the NHL Board of Governors and NHL Players' Association's executive board voted in favour of a rule penalizing [...] "blindside hits" [...] (bodychecking a player after having skated laterally towards him undetected, an idea similar to one's [...] "blind spot" [...] while driving). That same night, Booth suffered his second concussion in five months during a game against the Montreal Canadiens. While reaching back to retrieve a loose puck, Booth was hit in the head by opposing defenceman Jaroslav Špaček's shoulder. No penalty was called on the play, while Booth was helped off the ice and taken to hospital. The hit did not receive suspension and did not spark controversy as Booth's previous concussion had. Following the game, Panthers forward Nathan Horton asserted that [...] "It wasn't a dirty hit"; Špaček expressed concern for Booth, but explained that [...] "when he turned I was standing right there and basically he <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> at me." [...] Sidelined for the remaining nine games of the season, Booth finished the campaign with 16 points (eight goals and eight assists) over 28 games. After pushing for a playoff spot the previous season, the Panthers ranked second-worst in the East with 32 wins and 77 points.|$|E
500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>ran</b> through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E
