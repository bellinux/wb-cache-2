[...] "Are you sure it was 08:00?" [...] Ryba pressed—"Are you sure it wasn't 08:02?" [...] The player replied that he wasn't: [...] "No. Maybe it was even 08:03.

500|$|At {{four o'clock}} in the morning of 21 October Nelson ordered the Victory to turn towards the {{approaching}} enemy fleet, and signalled the rest of his force to battle stations. He then went below and made his will, before returning to the quarterdeck to carry out an inspection. Despite having 27 ships to Villeneuve's 33, Nelson was confident of success, declaring {{that he would not be}} satisfied with taking fewer than 20 prizes. He returned briefly to his cabin to write a final prayer, after which he joined Victory’s signal lieutenant, John Pasco. Mr Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet [...] "England confides that every man will do his duty". You must be quick, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> more signal to make, which is for close action. Pasco suggested changing confides to expects which, being in the Signal Book, could be signalled by the use of a single code (using three flags), whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter by letter. Nelson agreed, and the signal was hoisted.|$|E
500|$|The New Zealanders {{travelled}} to New York City, {{where they}} played an exhibition game, {{then on to}} San Francisco. There they played two official matches against British Columbia, and won both easily. The tour programme thus ended; New Zealand had played 35 games and lost only once. Gallaher had played in 26 of those matches, including four Tests. Over their 32 matches in the British Isles New Zealand scored 830 points and conceded 39; overall they scored 976 points and conceded only 59. On their arrival back in New Zealand on 6March 1906, the All Blacks were welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 before being hosted at a civic reception in Auckland. Invited {{to speak at the}} reception, Gallaher said: [...] "We did not go behind our back to talk about the Welshman, but candidly said that on that day the better team had won. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> recommendation to make to the New Zealand [...] Union, if it was to undertake such a tour again, and that is to play the Welsh matches first." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to admit this record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, FLOC asked labor {{organizer}} {{and consultant}} Ray Rogers for help.

[...] " [...] 'You had these little nuns get up at stockholders' meetings saying <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> share and you're a dirty so and so,' says John Dunlop, secretary of labor in the Ford administration, {{who was involved in}} the FLOC battle." [...] The company's public image began to suffer. FLOC then targeted three members of Campbell's board of directors for economic pressure. FLOC also picketed Philadelphia National Bank, one of Campbell's major creditors. Shortly thereafter, depositors threatened to pull $500,000 out of the bank.|$|E
2500|$|In 1886, Pratt's wife Sarah Pratt {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} that, while in Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her [...] "one of his spiritual wives" [...] while Pratt was in England on missionary service. To Smith's proposal, Sarah replied, [...] "Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ... to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> good husband, and that is enough for me."

2500|$|Ultimately, all the {{attempts}} at mediation failed, {{as the chief}} condition of Admiral Méndez Núñez was the proper salute to the Spanish flag, the return by the Chileans of the captured Schooner Covadonga and the immediate payment of a crippling indemnity. The talks broke over {{the matter of the}} flag salute. When General Kilpatrick threatened to defend the port with the US squadron and attack the Spanish fleet, Admiral Méndez Núñez famously responded with, [...] "I will be forced to sink , because even if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> ship left I will proceed with the bombardment. Spain, the Queen and I prefer honor without ships than ships without honor." [...] Consequently the Spanish Admiral, notwithstanding the protest of the diplomatic corps, gave notice on March 27 to all neutrals to evacuate the city.|$|E
2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked [...] "If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive." [...] The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: [...] "As long as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tensions {{continued}} {{throughout the}} 19th century. Isabella II of Spain, who reigned from 1833 to 1868, became a dominant figure in Spanish-American relations. In 1839 she {{became involved in}} the Amistad affair, over the fate of the schooner La Amistad and the 53 slaves she carried. Isabella was one of several claimants to their ownership, and even after its resolution in 1841, following a Supreme Court decision, the Spanish government continued to press for compensation. She involved her country in the Chincha Islands War (1864–66), which pitted Spain against her former possessions of Peru and Chile. The American Minister to Chile, Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, was involved in an attempt to arbitrate between the combatants of the Chincha Islands War. The attempt failed, and Kilpatrick asked the American naval commander Commander Rodgers to defend the port and attack the Spanish fleet. Admiral Casto Méndez Núñez famously responded with, [...] "I will be forced to sink , because even if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> ship left I will proceed with the bombardment. Spain, the Queen and I prefer honor without ships than ships without honor." [...] ("España prefiere honra sin barcos a barcos sin honra".) ...|$|E

2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an anaglyph 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E
