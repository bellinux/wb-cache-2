5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

Toschi was impressed with their knowledge of the case and afterwards, he realized that he had learned a lot from them.

The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

Samantha claims to not remember anything about her abduction and is reluctant to stay or tell Mulder where he can find her.

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
