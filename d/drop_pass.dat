25|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>pass</b> : when {{a player}} passes the puck {{directly}} behind {{him to a}} teammate. If executed properly, the puck stops moving and the pass's receiver catches up to it.|$|E
25|$|The lob pass is {{executed}} by {{throwing the ball}} in a high arc, with the ball initially being held behind the head and being released above the head. The <b>drop</b> <b>pass</b> {{is similar to the}} lob pass. The major difference is with the catcher: a lob pass is for a catcher who is stretching to get away from a defender, while a <b>drop</b> <b>pass</b> is for a catcher who will move into free space to receive the ball. These two passes are sometimes referred to as throw-up passes. The purpose of the lob and drop passes is to get around a defender and reach a teammate who is moving away from the passer. The lob pass is used because it is very accurate and covers both long and short distances.|$|E
25|$|Different {{positions}} require different passing skills. The fake pass {{should be}} mastered by every position. The centre pass should be mastered by the Centre. The Centre should also master any pass {{that must be}} made on the run. Both the Goal Attack and Wing Attack should be familiar with the long passes and the lob and <b>drop</b> <b>pass.</b> The Goal Attack should also be familiar with all styles of passing. The Goal Shooter should know how to do penalty passes. The Wing Defence should also be comfortable making lob passes. The Goal Defence should know how to make goal-line passes. The Goal Keeper should be comfortable making penalty passes and inbounding the ball.|$|E

500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the <b>drop</b> <b>pass.</b> According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the <b>drop</b> <b>pass</b> one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E

50|$|The {{deciding}} game six was {{marred by}} one of the most infamous blown official calls in NHL playoff history. With the game tied 1-1, the Islanders Butch Goring picked up a <b>drop</b> <b>pass</b> from New York left wing Clark Gillies which had clearly gone back over the Flyers' defensive zone blue line into center ice. Linesman Leon Stickle waved the play as safe and Goring threaded a pass to right wing Duane Sutter who beat Philadelphia goalie Pete Peeters for a 2-1 New York lead. The Flyers argued vehemently to no avail. The Flyers defense and Peeters appeared to relax as if play had been blown dead once the puck went over the blue line. Flyers captain Mel Bridgman stated the play changed the momentum of the game at a critical time even though the Flyers scored shortly afterwards to tie the score 2-2. Stickle admitted after the game that he had blown the call.|$|E
50|$|In the fourth, Washington {{tried to}} rally as Forbath {{connected}} again, {{this time from}} 45 yards, but Washington could not score again, as a myriad of <b>dropped</b> <b>passes</b> and a turnover on downs with just over four minutes remaining sealed their fate, as the final score remained 27-12.|$|R
50|$|The Raiders offense {{completely}} {{struggled to}} move the ball and had several three and outs, mainly due to penalties and <b>dropped</b> <b>passes</b> (notably by Randy Moss who got booed after his second <b>dropped</b> <b>pass)</b> {{and it looked like}} it would come back to haunt them as the Steelers moved down midway through the fourth quarter and it looked like they would surely tie the game. However, on third and goal, cornerback Chris Carr would intercept Roethlisberger's pass and return it 100 yards for a touchdown. It was the second longest interception return in Raiders history. This gave the Raiders a 20-6 lead. However, they couldn't hold it long, as the Steelers quickly moved downfield and scored the only offensive touchdown of the game, a 25-yard completion to Willie Parker.|$|R
50|$|New York Giants signed Preston on January 7, 2014. Parker had 36 {{catches for}} 418 {{yards and two}} touchdowns on the year. He also contributed to special teams as a returner.

50|$|Carroll had {{one last}} {{chance to win the}} game in the fourth quarter. On their final possession, Carroll had four plays from inside the nine yard line in an attempt to score a touchdown.

50|$|The Raiders began 2012 {{by losing}} a very poorly {{executed}} home opener on Monday Night Football to San Diego 22-14.

On the bright side, defensive performance was decent and helped contain the Chargers' passing game.|$|R

50|$|The Chargers offense, which ranked {{fifth in}} the NFL in yards in 2013, {{suffered}} from uncharacteristic <b>dropped</b> <b>passes.</b> Arizonas late field goal {{in the second quarter}} came after a Chargers interception set up by Eddie Royal stopping on his route as a Rivers pass went to the Chiefs Jerraud Powers. The Chargers Marcus Gilchrist dropped an apparent sure interception in the third quarter.|$|R
500|$|The Volunteers {{started at}} their 27-yard line {{to begin the}} drive, but went three and out and punted back to the Hokies without gaining a first down. The kick was {{returned}} to the Tech 39-yard line, where the Hokies' offense started with 31 seconds remaining in the quarter. On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still <b>dropped</b> the <b>pass</b> after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the <b>dropped</b> <b>pass</b> as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I think if he could have made that catch, we could have gotten back in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took a lot out of us." [...] After Still's <b>dropped</b> <b>pass,</b> DeShazo threw two incomplete passes and Virginia Tech punted back to Tennessee. The kick was caught by near the Tennessee 10-yard line, and returned {{all the way to the}} Virginia Tech 37-yard line. At the end of the third quarter, Tennessee still led, 3516.|$|R
50|$|After {{their only}} bye week, Auburn went to Lexington, Kentucky {{to face the}} Kentucky Wildcats on a Thursday night. It was a great game for both teams. Kentucky had <b>dropped</b> <b>passes</b> and threw an {{interception}} {{in the end zone}} which cost the Wildcats. On the final, possible game-winning, drive for Kentucky, Auburn stopped them on 4th and 3 with almost 30 seconds left to win.|$|R
50|$|Arkansas and Kansas State are met for {{the first}} time in postseason and for the fifth time overall. The {{previous}} game was since 1967, and the Wildcats lost 28-7. K-State was uncharacteristically sloppy, <b>dropping</b> <b>passes</b> and making other mistakes. Arkansas built a 19-9 lead before K-State showed life, pulling within 3, making the game 19-16. The Wildcats were not able to continue to momentum, and lost 29-16.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, McCourty made a pledge to aid recovery efforts with a donation of $100 for every tackle he makes during the 2013 season, and $200 per interception.

50|$|Despite {{his great}} career at ASU, Hagan had a poor showing during the Senior Bowl {{practices}} by <b>dropping</b> <b>passes,</b> which many predicted would damage his {{stock in the}} upcoming draft.

His draft preparation with IMG was chronicled in the film Two Days in April.|$|R
