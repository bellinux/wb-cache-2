I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.|$|E

Šešelj {{was at the time}} an anti-Communist dissident and was subsequently described for his activities in the Yugoslav Wars as [...] "a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition." [...] Later Šešelj became leader of the Serbian Radical Party, a government coalition partner of Serbian President Slobodan Milosević. In 1998, Đujić publicly stated that he regretted awarding that title to Šešelj. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I was naïve when I nominated Šešelj [...] Vojvoda; <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> people to forgive me. The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milošević" [...] and that he is [...] "disappointed in Šešelj for openly collaborating with Milošević's Socialist Party, with Communists who have only changed their name. [...] Šešelj has sullied the reputation of Chetniks and Serbian nationalism." ...|$|E

2500|$|For example, if {{a person}} {{regularly}} asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., [...] "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., [...] "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information {{about the way the}} interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> partner for a hug or kiss, then my partner will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.|$|E

2500|$|In his memoir, Courage and Consequence, Rove devotes three {{chapters}} to Wilson's New York Times op-ed {{and subsequent}} grand jury investigation. Rove writes that before his third {{appearance before the}} grand jury, Robert Luskin went back and looked through all of Rove's saved emails from April through September 2003. Luskin, according to Rove, uncovered an email Rove had written to Steve Hadley in which Rove discussed a conversation he had had with Matt Cooper concerning Wilson's op-ed. Rove writes that while the [...] "email didn't jog any better recollection of the call", he immediately told Fitzgerald, after being sworn in, {{that he wanted to}} [...] "set the record straight." [...] After presenting the email to Fitzgerald, Rove writes that [...] "it was as if I'd detonated a bomb in the shabby little room." [...] Rove writes that before his fourth appearance before the grand jury he received a [...] "target warning" [...] by Fitzgerald. Rove describes his fourth appearance as [...] "brutal from the first moment", and that the grand jury [...] "hung on Fitzgerald's every word." [...] After Rove's testimony, Fitzgerald told Luskin [...] "All things being equal, we are inclined to indict your client." [...] According to Rove, Luskin and Fitzgerald meet for hours in Chicago on October 20 to discuss the matter. At some point during the meeting, [...] "Fitzgerald turned to what was really bothering him: my conversation with Matt Cooper. Was I lying {{about not being able to}} recall my phone conversation with him the morning of July 11, 2003?" [...] Specifically, Rove writes, Fitzgerald wanted to know why [...] "in December 2003 or January 2004 did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>my</b> aides...to find any evidence of contact with Matt Cooper." [...] It was at this moment, according to Rove, that Luskin revealed his conversation with Viveca Novak in which Luskin learned that Cooper [...] "had insisted around Times Washington bureau that he had talked to [...]" [...] Luskin then revealed to Fitzgerald that it was he who instructed Rove to have his aides find any records of that contact. According to Rove, Fitzgerald was [...] "stunned", and stated to Luskin, [...] "You rocked my world." [...] Rove writes that it [...] "was clear Fitzgerald had originally intended to indict Libby and me on the same day." [...] Rove also writes that in the end, Luskin had a [...] "charitable view of Fitzgerald...the prosecutor never leaked, and he treated Luskin with respect and was forthcoming about his evidence and concerns." ...|$|E
