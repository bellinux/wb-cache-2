5000|$|Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, low-performance, the {{low-cost}} {{and most}} common {{material for the}} glue sticks (e.g., the light amber colored Thermogrip GS51, GS52, and GS53). They provide sufficient strength between 30 and 50 °C but are limited to use below 60-80 °C and have low creep resistance under load. The vinyl acetate monomer content is about 18-29 percent by weight of the polymer. High amounts of tackifiers and waxes are often used; an example composition is 30-40% of EVA copolymer (provides strength and toughness), 30-40% of tackifier resin (improves wetting and tack), 20-30% of wax (usually paraffin-based; reduces viscosity, alters setting speed, reduces cost), and 0.5-1% of stabilizers. Fillers can be added for special applications. Can be formulated for service temperatures ranging from −40 to +80 °C, and for both short and long open times and {{a wide range of}} melt viscosities. High stability at elevated temperatures and resistance to ultraviolet radiation, which can be further enhanced with suitable stabilizers. High vinylacetate content can serve for formulating a hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive (HMPSA). EVA formulations are compatible with paraffin. EVA was the base for the original hot melt composition. The composition of the copolymer influences its properties; increased content of ethylene promotes adhesion to nonpolar substrates such as polyethylene, while increased content of vinyl acetate promotes adhesion to polar substrates such as paper. Higher ethylene content also increases mechanical strength, block resistance, and paraffin solubility. Higher vinyl acetate content provides higher flexibility, adhesion, hot tack, and better low-temperature performance. Adhesive grade EVA usually contains 14-35% vinyl acetate. Lower molecular weight chains provide lower melt viscosity, better wetting, and better adhesion to porous surfaces. Higher molecular weights provide better cohesion at elevated temperatures and better low-temperature behavior. Increased ratio of vinyl acetate lowers the crystallinity of the material, improves optical clarity, flexibility and toughness, and worsens resistance to solvents. EVA can be crosslinked by, e.g., peroxides, yielding a thermosetting material. EVAs can be compounded with aromatic hydrocarbon resins. Grafting butadiene to EVA improves its adhesion. Its dielectric properties are poor due to high content of polar groups, the dielectric loss is moderately high. Polypropylene HMAs are a better choice for high-frequency electronics. EVAs are optically clearer and more gas and vapor permeable than polyolefins. Nearly half of EVA HMAs is used in packaging applications. Cryogenic grinding of EVAs can provide small, water-dispersible particles for <b>heat-seal</b> applications. EVA can degrade primarily by loss of acetic acid and formation of a double bond in the chain, and by oxidative degradation. EVA can be compounded into a wide range of HMAs, from soft pressure-sensitive adhesives to rigid structural adhesives for furniture construction.|$|E
40|$|The <b>heat-seal</b> {{strength}} and failure modes of laminated films with Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials were investigated. <b>Heat-seal</b> strength increases with platen temperature for all samples. The maximum achievable <b>heat-seal</b> strength for laminated film using LDPE and LLDPE as sealant material is 0. 598 N/mm and 4. 02 N/mm, respectively.

A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling <b>heat-seal</b> strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level.

40|$|Packages {{made from}} {{flexible}} film often use a heat-sealing process to ensure closure. The process involves joining two surfaces of film with heat and pressure across {{a period of}} time. <b>Heat-seal</b> problems arise when another substance partially obstructs the film-to-film contact.

This study 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis is that a non-contaminated seal will be stronger than a contaminated seal.

40|$|Poly-L-lactide (PLLA) is {{a widely}} used {{sustainable}} and biodegradable alternative to replace synthetic non-degradable plastic materials in the packaging industry. Conversely, its processing properties are not always optimal, e. g. insufficient melt strength at higher temperatures (necessary in extrusion coating processes). This thesis reports on research to improve properties of commercial PLLA grade (3051 D from NatureWorks), to satisfy and extend end-use applications, such as food packaging by blending with modified PLLA. Adjustment of the processability by chain branching of commercial poly-L-lactide initiated by peroxide was evaluated. Several well-defined branched structures with four arms (sPLLA) were synthesized using pentaerythritol as a tetra-functional initiator. Finally, several block copolymers consisting of polyethylene glycol and PLLA (i. e. PEGLA) were produced to obtain a well extruded material with improved heat sealing properties. Reactive extrusion of poly-L-lactide {{was carried out in}} the presence of 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 wt% of various peroxides [tert-butyl-peroxybenzoate (TBPB), 2, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 5 -(tert-butylperoxy) -hexane (Lupersol 101; LOL 1) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) ] at 190 C. The peroxide-treated PLLAs showed increased complex viscosity and storage modulus at lower frequencies, indicating the formation of branched/cross linked architectures. The material property changes were dependent on the peroxide, and the used peroxide concentration. Gel fraction analysis showed that the peroxides, afforded different gel contents, and especially 0. 5 wt% peroxide, produced both an extremely high molar mass, and a cross linked structure, not perhaps well suited for e. g. further use in a blending step. The thermal behavior was somewhat unexpected as the materials prepared with 0. 5 wt% peroxide showed the highest ability for crystallization and cold crystallization, despite substantial cross linking. The peroxide-modified PLLA, i. e. PLLA melt extruded with 0. 3 wt% of TBPB and LOL 1 and 0. 5 wt% BPO was added to linear PLLA in ratios of 5, 15 and 30 wt%. All blends showed increased zero shear viscosity, elastic nature (storage modulus) and shear sensitivity. All blends remained amorphous, though the ability of annealing was improved slightly. Extrusion coating on paperboard was conducted with PLLA, and peroxide-modified PLLA blends (90 : 10). All blends were processable, but only PLLA with 0. 3 wt% of LOL 1 afforded a smooth high quality surface with improved line speed. Adhesion levels between fiber and plastic, as well as heat seal performance were marginally reduced compared with pure 3051 D. The water vapor transmission measurements (WVTR) of the blends containing LOL 1 showed acceptable levels, only slightly lower than for comparable PLLA 3051 D. A series of four-arm star-shaped poly-L-lactide (sPLLA) with different branch length was synthesized by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide using pentaerythritol as initiator and stannous octoate as catalyst. The star-shaped polymers were further blended with its linear resin and studied for their melt flow and thermal properties. Blends containing 30 wt% of sPLLA with low molecular weight (30 wt%; Mwtotal: 2500 g mol- 1 and 15000 g mol- 1) showed lower zero shear viscosity and significantly increased shear thinning, {{while at the same time}} slightly increased crystallization of the blend. However, the amount of crystallization increased significantly with the higher molecular weight sPLLA, therefore the star-shaped structure may play a role as nucleating agent. PLLA-polyethylene glycol–PLLA triblock copolymers (PEGLA) with different PLLA block length were synthesized and their applicability as blends with linear PLLA (3051 D NatureWorks) was investigated with the intention of improving <b>heat-seal</b> and adhesion properties of extrusion-coated paperboard. PLLA-PEG-PLLA was obtained by ring opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide using PEG (molecular weight 6000 g mol- 1) as an initiator, and stannous octoate as catalyst. The structures of the PEGLAs were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR). The melt flow and thermal properties of all PEGLAs and their blends were evaluated using dynamic rheology, and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). All blends containing 30 wt% of PEGLAs showed slightly higher zero shear viscosity, higher shear thinning and increased melt elasticity (based on tan delta). Nevertheless, no significant changes in thermal properties were distinguished. High molecular weight PEGLAs were used in extrusion coating line with 3051 D without problems...|$|E
