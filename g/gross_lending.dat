40|$|Housing {{is widely}} {{connected}} to economy factors, and its complexity cause difficulties in prediction. Therefore {{it is essential}} to understand the mechanism underlying the housing market. This study suggests that fundamental macroeconomic factors, i. e. <b>Gross</b> Domestic Product, <b>Lending</b> Rate, Unemployment Rate, Construction Cost and Consumer Price Indices play important roles in determining the house prices. In this paper, econometric methodology has been adopted to study the relationship between housing price and fundamental macroeconomic factors in Malaysia for the period 1988 – 2007. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model and Vector Error Correction (VEC) Model has been employed to examine the long term relationships and short run relationships between housing price and macroeconomic factors. The long run equilibrium shows that housing price is positively related to Consumer Price Indices but negatively related to other macroeconomic factors. The short run equilibrium shows the existence of long run influence from economic factors to house prices. Low coefficients of variables in the short run equilibrium indicates housing price is less elastic in responding to the changes of macroeconomic factors in short run. The relationships between house price and each macroeconomic factor are inspected through Granger causality test and generalised impulse response function. The results show that house price Granger causes <b>Gross</b> Domestic Product, <b>Lending</b> Rate, Construction Cost and Consumer Price Indices. According to the generalised impulse response analysis, Housing Price itself, <b>Gross</b> Domestic Product, <b>Lending</b> Rate and Construction Cost are highly sensitive to the changes of housing pric...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} the interdependence between US monetary {{policy and the}} S&P 500 using structural VAR methodology. A solution is proposed to the simultaneity problem of identifying monetary and stock price shocks by {{using a combination of}} short-run and long-run restrictions that maintains the qualitative properties of a monetary policy shock found in the established literature (Christiano et al., 1999). We find great interdependence between interest rate setting and real stock prices. Real stock prices immediately fall by 7 - 9 percent due to a monetary policy shock that raises the federal funds rate by 100 basis points. A stock price shock increasing real stock prices by one percent leads to an increase in the interest rate of close to 4 basis points. 1) The capital adequacy ratio 2) Ratio of Residential mortgages to <b>Gross</b> <b>lending</b> 3) An expected loss measure 4) A concentration risk measure 5) The return on assets 6) Norges Bank’s liquidity indicatorVAR, monetary policy, asset prices, identification. ...|$|E
40|$|Norges Bank {{has since}} 1989 been using a risk index for banks. The {{purpose of this}} risk index is to {{identify}} potential problem banks, and to obtain a general picture of {{the health of the}} banking industry. In 1994 the risk index was reconstructed based on research by Sigbjørn Atle Berg and Barbro Hexeberg. Using the Norwegian bank crisis 1988 - 1993 as their estimation period they concluded that it would be sufficient to include four indicators in the risk index. The risk index comprising these four indicators has been left unchanged since 1994, while the banking sector has experienced substantial structural changes. Thus, the need to re-estimate the risk index is clearly present. In this paper a logit model is estimated based on observations from the period 2000 - 2005. In competition with 23 new indicators, none of the four indicators from the current risk index are included in the recommended risk index. This underlines the need to re estimate such a risk index at regular intervals. In order to ensure that the new risk index has good properties during a deeper bank crisis than the one experienced after 2000, the predicting properties of the recommended indicators are also tested on eleven failed banks from the period 1990 - 93. The new risk index gives strong and early signals well in advance before the crisis culminates in all of the eleven banks. The risk index includes the following six indicators: 1) The capital adequacy ratio 2) Ratio of Residential mortgages to <b>Gross</b> <b>lending</b> 3) An expected loss measure 4) A concentration risk measure 5) The return on assets 6) Norges Bank’s liquidity indicatorNorwegian banks, bank failure prediction, logit model, forecasting accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Ten years ago, {{persistent}} dysfunctionalities on mortgage markets {{inherited from}} the previous decade greatly contributed to the largest financial crisis in half a century. Since then, significant deleveraging processes have been observed in some EU markets, such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain, where the ratios of outstanding residential lending to household disposable income have contracted markedly. In these economies, the 2016 volumes recorded for both outstanding and <b>gross</b> residential <b>lending</b> were much below 2007 levels, although a timid recovery could be observed in recent years. By contrast, the volume of mortgage activities moved around significant upward paths in Belgium, France, Germany and Sweden, and stagnated somewhat in the Netherlands and Denmark. In terms of products, excluding Sweden, the share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) for <b>gross</b> residential <b>lending</b> has been moving along downward trends in all the analysed mortgage markets. And these downward trends have deepened in all countries (excluding the UK and Sweden) {{in the last three}} years. As a result, the aggregate ARM market share contracted markedly in the last decade. Whereas fluctuations in current spreads between ARM rates and fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) rates appeared overall to be a powerful driver behind the ARM market share over the last decade, this impact seemed to trail off in the last four years. In the current context where FRMs are considered to be historically low, many households are likely to anticipate increases in fixed interest rates on the foreseeable horizon, resulting in greater preference for FRMs, no matter the level of spreads. Other factors related to mortgage and household characteristics could also impact on this preference for FRMs: the average amount of mortgages, evolution of household income, etc. Finally, some encouraging signs of convergence in recent years in spreads, ARM market shares as well as ratios of household residential debt to disposable income could contribute somehow to reinforcing the consistency and efficiency of euro monetary policy...|$|R

Therefore, this study investigates the perceptions of the current level of regulation on the UK mortgage market. The research found there is a strong perception that the level of regulation is hindering lending and competition within the market. More specifically this study uses a qualitative approach of in-depth interviews with five financial and regulatory professionals. The results suggest that two professionals perceived regulation as positive for the UK mortgage market. Regulation is perceived positively because of its ability to give consumers greater market confidence, the implementation of loss mitigation strategies that prevent house repossession and the loss of irresponsible lenders. Three professionals perceived regulation as highly negative because it has reduced the lending rate, created barriers to entry thus reducing competition, has moved careless lending to other areas of the market such a...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{mortgage}} contracts {{dominate the}} UK mortgage market (Miles, 2004). The {{dominance of the}} variable rate mortgage contracts has important consequences for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy decisions and systemic risks (Khandani et al., 2012; Fuster and Vickery, 2013). This raises an obvious concern that a mortgage market such as that in the UK, where the major proportion of mortgage debt is either at a variable or fixed for {{less than two years}} rate (Badarinza, et al., 2013; CML, 2012), is vulnerable to alterations in the interest rate regime. Theoretically, mortgage choice is determined by demand and supply factors. So far, most of the existing literature has focused on the demand side perspective, and what is limited is consideration of supply side factors in empirical investigation on mortgage choice decisions. This paper uniquely explores whether supply side factors may partially explain observed/ex-post mortgage type decisions. Empirical results detect that lenders’ profit motives and mortgage funding/pricing issues may have assisted in preferences toward variable rate contracts. Securitisation is found to positively impact upon <b>gross</b> mortgage <b>lending</b> volumes while negatively impacting upon the share of variable lending flows. This shows that an increase in securitisation not only improves liquidity in the supply of mortgage funds, but also has the potential to shift mortgage choices toward fixed mortgage debt. The policy implications may involve a number of measures, including reconsideration of the capital requirements for the fixed, as opposed to the variable rate mortgage debt, growing securitisation and optimisation of the mortgage pricing policies...|$|R

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis affected microfinance institutions (MFIs) as lending growth was constrained by scarcer borrowing opportunities, while the economic slowdown negatively impacted asset quality and profitability. It also {{brought to the}} fore the relatively high interest rates that MFIs charge to their (low-income) customers. This paper revisits the issue of systemic risk of MFIs, and finds that contrary to the evidence before the crisis, MFI performance is correlated not only to domestic economic conditions but also to changes in international capital markets. It also presents an empirical analysis of lending rates {{with the purpose of}} informing policy decisions, and finds that loan sizes, productivity, and MFI age contribute to explain differences in lending rate levels. This suggest that regulation (and policies) promoting MFI competition, and innovation in lending technologies have a better chance to result in decreased lending rates.

40|$|Problem statement: This study {{investigated}} the relationship between credit market development and economic growth for Greece for the period 1979 - 2007 using a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Questions were raised whether economic growth spurs credit market development {{taking into account the}} negative effect of inflation rate on credit market development. This study aimed to investigate the short-run and the long-run relationship between bank <b>lending,</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product and inflation rate applying the Johansen cointegration analysis. Approach: To achieve this objective classical and panel unit root tests were carried out for all time series data in their levels and their first differences. Johansen cointegration analysis was applied to examine whether the variables are cointegrated of the same order taking into account the maximum eigenvalues and trace statistics tests. Finally, a vector error correction model was selected to investigate the long-run relationship between economic growth and credit market development. Results: A short-run increase of economic growth per 1 % induces an increase of bank lending 2. 2 %, while an increase of inflation rate per 1 % induces a relative decrease of bank lending per 5. 6 % in Greece. The estimated coefficient of error correction term is statistically significant and has a negative sign, which confirms that there is not any problem in the long-run equilibrium between the examined variables.

40|$|Arguably, {{the credit}} risk models {{reported}} in the literature for the retail lending sector have so far been less developed than those for the corporate sector, mainly {{due to the lack of}} publicly available data. Having been given access to a dataset on defaulted mortgages kindly provided by a major UK bank, this work first investigates the Loss Given Default (LGD) of mortgage loans with the development of two separate component models, the Probability of Repossession (given default) Model and the Haircut (given repossession) Model. They are then combined into an expected loss percentage. Performance-wise, this two-stage LGD model is shown to do better than a single-stage LGD model (which directly models LGD from loan and collateral characteristics), as it achieves a better Rsquare value, and it more accurately matches the distribution of observed LGD. We next investigate the possibility of including macroeconomic variables into either or both component models to improve LGD prediction. Indicators relating to net <b>lending,</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product, national default rates and interest rates are considered and the interest rate is found to be most beneficial to both component models. Finally, we develop a competing risk survival analysis model to predict the time taken for a defaulted mortgage loan to reach some outcome (i. e. repossession or non-repossession). This allows for a more accurate prediction of (discounted) loss as these periods could vary from months to years depending on the health of the economy. Besides loan- or collateral-related characteristics, we incorporate a time-dependent macroeconomic variable based on the house price index (HPI) to investigate its impact on repossession risk. We find that observations of different loan-to-value ratios at default and different security type are affected differently by the economy. This model is then used for stress test purposes by applying a Monte Carlo simulation, and by varying the HPI forecast, to get different loss distributions for different economic outlooks.
