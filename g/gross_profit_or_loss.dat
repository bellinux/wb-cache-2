40|$|In this paper, as a {{technique}} to measure the market risk of banking accounts, we construct models for the statistical measurement of the movement of period <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss.</b> In doing so, we present two frameworks, namely, the earning-at-risk (EaR) model, which captures the period <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> {{in terms of the}} realized <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> according to the currently used cost method, and the expanded value-at-risk (VaR) method which also includes the movement of market valuation as part of the period <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss.</b> We then examine the usefulness and limitations of both models by performing simulations on bond portfolios. It is shown that the EaR model is limited {{by the fact that it}} is not capable of comparing strategies from the standpoint of risk versus return. When using the EaR model as a risk measurement tool, it is essential to conduct longterm simulations.

This study uses data from 34 samples during year 2007 – 2009. It is an empirical study using regression model with dummy variable. Therefore, before conducting hypothesis testing, the classic assumption testing was done. Beside that, t-test was done and shows there is significant average difference of <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> volatility in company using average method and FIFO method. The results show that: Inventory valuation method has significant influence toward <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> volatility. But, inventory valuation method doesn’t have significant influence toward ROA and cost of sale volatility using 95 % level of confidence.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{experimental evidence}} {{about how the}} interaction between a company's earnings and its information system influences the degree of honest reporting by managers in a capital budgeting task. Specifically, {{the results show that}} participants overstate cost less when the manager's cost report determines whether the firm earns a gain <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> than when their report does not affect whether the firm earns a <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> (i. e., the firm always earns either a <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> regardless of the cost report). Further, the results suggest that the impact of the earnings situation on the degree of honesty depends on whether the firm uses an information system that improves its ability to detect misreporting. Specifically, the earnings situation has less effect on the degree of honesty when the firm uses an information system. This is because the information system decreases honesty when the manager's report determines whether the firm earns a <b>profit</b> <b>or</b> <b>loss</b> but increases it otherwise. This study provides important insights into the conditions under which information systems can crowd out prosocial behavior. status: publishe...|$|R
