5|$|Ithan Creek {{is within}} the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The Piedmont Uplands section has {{generally}} old, hard upland rocks that eroded from the Appalachian Mountains. The rocks in the watershed date to the Precambrian Era and Lower Paleozoic Era. The surficial geology mainly consist of felsic <b>gneiss</b> and mafic <b>gneiss</b> formations, with small amounts of serpentinite {{near the mouth of}} the creek. Silvery mica schist is exposed along the creek. According to a report by the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, the exposures are rare in the vicinity of Ithan Creek.|$|E

The east side of the park near Indian Field contains Yonkers granite, an igneous rock that mixed with Fordham <b>gneiss</b> as a hot magma before later cooling.|$|E
5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those <b>gneiss</b> stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all <b>gneiss</b> stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered <b>gneiss</b> rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the <b>gneiss</b> stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gneisses</b> which crop {{out along}} the {{southern}} coast of Ameralik between Kangimut-sangmissoq and Qasigianguit (K-s-Q) {{are the subject of}} long-standing controversy concerning their relationship to the early Archean Amitsoq <b>gneisses</b> of the Godthaab district. On the basis of field observations, it was argued that <b>gneisses</b> at Kangimut-sangmissoq and Qasigianguit are correlatives of the early Archean Amitsoq <b>gneisses.</b> The data were reexamined and it is concluded that the K-s-Q <b>gneisses</b> represent an addition of substantially juvenile mantle-derived material to the Archean craton of West Greenland during the late Archean times. Some of the parent magmas have undergone interaction with older crust, as indicated by Pb isotope evidence for contamination with Amitsoq-derived Pb. However, the positive epsilon Nd(I) value for the K-s-Q <b>gneisses</b> firmly rules out any significant material contribution from the Amitsoq <b>gneisses</b> to the K-s-Q <b>gneisses...</b>|$|R

5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include <b>gneiss,</b> schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic <b>gneiss</b> found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton.

The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of <b>gneiss</b> of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite <b>gneiss</b> to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro.

50|$|The oldest {{part of the}} Lewisian {{complex is}} a group of <b>gneisses</b> of Archaean age that formed in the {{interval}} 3.0 - 2.7 Ga.

40|$|The {{early history}} of the Lhasa terrane remains poorly {{constrained}} due to the poor exposure of the Proterozoic rocks. We report here U–Pb zircon ages, geochemical and Hf isotopic data for granite <b>gneisses</b> and biotite <b>gneisses</b> from the Bomi Complex {{in the eastern part}} of the Lhasa terrane, south Tibet. Petrological and geochemical data suggest that the protoliths of the granite <b>gneisses</b> and the biotite <b>gneisses</b> could be granites and tonalites, respectively. LA-ICPMS U–Pb zircon analyses yielded ages of 1343 ± 27 Ma (MSWD = 0. 3) and 1276 ± 22 Ma (MSWD = 0. 4) for two granite <b>gneisses,</b> and a consistent age of ca. 1250 Ma for two biotite <b>gneisses.</b> These ages are interpreted as the magma crystallization time of both the <b>gneisses</b> protoliths, and thus the Bomi Complex represents the oldest rocks found in the Lhasa terrane. Our data indicate that the Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons from the Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks in the Lhasa terrane could be derived from the Lhasa terrane itself or the Tethyan Himalaya, rather than necessarily from the Albany-Fraser belt in the Australia. Geochemical characteristics show that the granite <b>gneisses</b> have an aluminous A-type granite affinity. The two granite <b>gneisses</b> dated in this study have zircon εHf(t) values between + 4. 0 and + 1. 8 and between + 2. 6 and + 0. 2, respectively. They have identical twostage Hf model ages of 2. 0 Ga. We suggest that the protoliths of the granite <b>gneisses</b> were produced by protracted high temperature partial melting of a felsic intracrustal source in an extensional setting. In contrast, the biotite <b>gneisses</b> have similar geochemical characteristics to those of calc-alkaline granitoids that probably formed in a subduction-related environment. Zircons from the two dated biotite <b>gneisses</b> have relatively higher εHf(t) values of + 8. 1 to + 3. 6 and + 10. 5 to + 5. 7, respectively, indicating a juvenile mantle contribution to their magma source. Earlier magmatism at 1343 – 1276 Ma may formed in a continental rift setting related to the final breakup of supercontinent Columbia, while subsequent magmatism of 1250 Ma resulted from subduction of ocean slab during the assemblage of Rodinia. We thus infer that the Bomi Complex was related to the contact zone between the Eastern Ghats Belt and. the Archean cratons in southeastern India during the Mesoproterozoi...|$|R

40|$|Bay d'Espoir on {{the south}} coast of Newfoundland exposes a section across the southeastern {{marginal}} metamorphic belt of the Newfoundland Appalachians. Two major tectonostratigraphic divisions are recognized; in the south the Little Passage <b>Gneisses</b> of the older division (probably Precambrian), consisting of amphibolitic and psammitic <b>gneisses</b> intruded by tonalite, are overlain by metavolcanic and metasedimentary cover rocks of the younger division, the Baie d'Espoir Group (possibly Ordovician). The Little Passage <b>Gneisses</b> have been intruded post-tectonically by a megacrystic potash feldspar granite. Both this granite and the enclosing <b>gneisses</b> are extensively mylonitised and reconstituted close to the contact with the cover rocks and the gneissic foliations have been largely destroyed. [...] The Baie d'Espoir Group has undergone two, regionally penetrative deformations, the second of which has produced a major recumbent south-east facing anticline, the Bay d'Espoir Nappe. These deformations are {{the cause of the}} mylonitised and reconstituted zone along the contact with the Little Passage <b>Gneisses.</b> Garnetiferous leucocratic granite and associated aplites and pegmatites have intruded the Little Passage <b>Gneisses,</b> the megacrystic granite, and the Baie d'Espoir Group after its first deformation but before its second; the intrusion coincided with the metamorphic climax of the Baie d'Espoir Group. Sheets of this garnetiferous granite have been tightly folded with the reconstituted <b>gneisses</b> near the contact with the cover. [...] It is concluded that the <b>gneisses</b> form the basement to the Baie d'Espoir Group and that the contact is now tectonic. Deposition of the Baie d'Espoir Group was along a continental margin which was initially of Atlantic-type but later changed to Andean-type. Deformation was probably caused by continental collision along the line of the Cape Ray Fault and the Lower Palaeozoic outcrop of central Newfoundland.

5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and <b>gneiss.</b> In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One <b>gneiss</b> fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing <b>gneiss,</b> later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

40|$|High-grade, highly {{deformed}} <b>gneisses</b> crop out continuously {{along the}} Masanteo peninsula and constitute {{the upper part}} of the lower crustal section in the Cabo Ortegal nappe (NW Spain). The rock sequence formed by migmatitic quartzo-feldspathic (qz-fsp) <b>gneisses</b> and mafic rocks records the early Ordovician (ca.   480 – 488  Ma) injection of felsic dioritic/granodioritic dykes at the base of the qz-fsp <b>gneisses,</b> and Devonian eclogitization (ca.   390. 4  ±  1. 2  Ma), prior to its exhumation. A SE-vergent ductile thrust constitutes the base of quartzo-feldspathic gneissic unit, incorporating mafic eclogite blocks within migmatitic <b>gneisses.</b> A NW-vergent detachment displaced metasedimentary qz-fsp <b>gneisses</b> over the migmatites. A difference in metamorphic pressure of ca.   0. 5  GPa is estimated between both gneissic units. The tectono-metamorphic relationships of the basal ductile thrust and the normal detachment bounding the top of the migmatites indicate that both discrete mechanical contacts were active before the recumbent folding affecting the sequence of <b>gneisses</b> during their final emplacement. The progressive tectonic exhumation from eclogite to greenschist facies conditions occurred over ca.   10  Ma and involved bulk thinning of the high-grade rock sequence in the high pressure and high temperature (HP–HT) Cabo Ortegal nappe. The necessary strain was accommodated by the development of a widespread main foliation, dominated by flattening, that subsequently localized to a network of anastomosing shear bands that evolved to planar shear zones. Qz-fsp <b>gneisses</b> and neighbouring mafic granulites were exhumed at >  3  mm yr − 1, and the exhumation path involved a cooling of [*]∼[*]  20  °C/ 100  MPa, These figures are comparable to currently active subduction zones, although exhumation P–T trajectory and ascent rates are at the hotter and slower end in comparison with currently active similar settings, suggesting an extremely ductile deformation environment during the exhumation of qz-fsp <b>gneisses</b> within a coherent Cabo Ortegal nappe...|$|R
