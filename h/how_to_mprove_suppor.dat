This powerful resource aggregation increases the application runtime environment complexity. A simple programming model, capable of hiding this complexity, facilitates {{the use of}} grid technology in high-performance computing. The message passing interface can play this role and make the grid more accessible to developers with parallel programming skills. In this paper we present MGF, a grid-enabled MPI implementation which extends the existing MPICH-G 2. MGF aims are: to allow the transparent use of coupled Grid resources within the MPI library; to give programmers a detailed view of the execution system network topology; to use the most efficient channel available for point-to-point communications and finally, <b>to</b> <b>mprove</b> collective operation efficiency by introducing a delegation mechanism...|$|R

Two experiments has been setup to record vibration of handheld drill using accelerometer placed at certain points of the hand drill. Through experiment, the obtained data was analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Operational deflection shape (ODS) technique and the data being verify which gives the natural frequency at 476. 07 Hz which is 5. 7 % higher that theoretical value. From the data the PID controller is designed and tunes using Ziegler Nichols method which gives peak amplitude at 0. 0144 and settling time at 0. 45 s. From the result it is believed that this proposed controller can reduce the vibration and give good improvement to the handheld tool performance...|$|R
40|$|Human-assistive {{wearable}} technologies {{can monitor}} {{the position of}} a worker in a critical worksite and improve his safety by raising warnings when he is in a dangerous zone. In railway worksites, it is observed that GNSS localization is not applicable due to the relevant localization errors, which are only partially attributable to the specific characteristics of the worksite. Besides, alternative solutions that rely on the support of anchors have the drawback of lengthening the set-up and dismantle time of the worksite. To provide safe localization of railway trackside workers, a system that exploits augmented-GNSS wearable sensors is proposed. Each sensor includes a GPS receiver capable of sharing its coordinates with the other sensors, and is further complemented with a lowcost multi-way distance meter to measure its distance from the other sensors. The main attention is paid to the data fusion approach adopted <b>to</b> <b>mprove</b> the accuracy of the position estimate by combining the relative distance measurements to the GPS coordinates...|$|R

Sustainability is not simply about changing practices but more centrally about agreeing to change practices together’ (Flanagan et al. 2011). To achieve such ends, groups need to improve processes for making complex decisions together. The challenge faced recently in Copenhagen (including a large number of diverse participants in policy discussions) indicates the need for new ways <b>to</b> <b>mprove</b> discursive democracy. Poverty and climate change are ‘wicked’ problems (Rittel and Webber 1984) that comprise many diverse interrelated variables and that have a strong value and emotional dimension. The shortcomings of many approaches to these problems is that they are expert driven, do not involve the public in decision making, and have a narrow focus on technical issues. They do not consider issues in terms of their interrelated complexity with human cultural issues and values.

Components of this protocol are then discussed in further detail, including: (1) auditory brainstem response (ABR) evaluation, (2) the use of acoustic immitance measures, (3) behavioral audiologic assessment, (4) visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA), (5) optimizing the clinical VRA procedure, (6) obtaining ear-specific thresholds, and (7) developing recommendations for amplification.

40|$|As governments, {{businesses}} and {{communities around the}} world begin to seriously address {{a wide range of}} sustainability issues, tourism has come under increasing criticism. This criticism of tourism highlights its contributions to negative environmental impacts such as climate change (Verbeek and Mommaas, 2008), its continued exploitation of global North-South economic and political inequalities (Klein-Vielhauer, 2009) and its foundation in what is increasingly seen as unnecessary consumption (Lansing and de Vries, 2007). This growing pressure on tourism to justify its existence and to better manage its impacts, both positive and negative, creates a challenge for tourism researchers to better understand the nature of tourism development and its impacts on destinations (Mason, 2008). Despite a long history of literature on tourism impacts, the subject still remains largely descriptive and atheoretical, especially in the social domain (Moscardo et al., 2013; Wall and Mathiesen, 2006). Research in this area continues to focus primarily on resident perceptions of impacts with little detailed analysis of the links among these perceptions and actual features of tourism and its development (Andereck and Nyuapane, 2010). There is a growing consensus that better conceptual models are needed to describe and explain in detail the mechanisms that link tourism processes and characteristics to effects on destination regions, especially effects on the people who live and work in these places (Deely et al., 2012; Moscardo et al., 2013). Such models are necessary <b>to</b> <b>mprove</b> the practice of tourism development...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{clarifying}} the oxides that {{form on the}} surface of a 1. 2 Si- 1. 5 Mn (in wt%) transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steel during intercritical annealing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were employed as complementary tools for analyzing the oxides. The results indicate that both the dew point of the annealing atmosphere and the soaking time play important roles in the oxides forming on the surface. Regarding the steel annealed at 800 ◦C in a low dew point (dp) atmosphere of − 70 ◦C, the surface oxides were initially amorphous and were composed of a mixture of SiO 2 and xMnO · SiO 2 (x< 0. 7). After soaking for 60 s, a small amount of Mn 2 SiO 4 precipitated in xMnO · SiO 2. The steel annealed at 800 ◦C at dp = 0 ◦C showed significant internal oxidation. Initially, a mixture of SiO 2, xMnO · SiO 2 and Mn 2 SiO 4 formed on the surface. After soaking for 60 s, SiO 2 and Mn 2 SiO 4 transformed to xMnO · SiO 2 and MnSiO 3, respectively. However, some Mn 2 SiO 4 still remained at the grain boundaries. © 2012 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10. 1149 / 2. 050212 jes] All rights reserved.

40|$|Human {{teeth are}} the most robust and stable parts of the body, {{providing}} biological clue material for forensic purposes even {{when most of the}} oter means of identifcation have been seriously affected by adverse environmental conditions. In particular blood grouping, isozymes, serum proteins and DNA polymorhphisms can be detected from teeth that protect these identification markers in addition to the traditional dental records. While in general the value of traditional dental records in the forensic work is decreasing eg due <b>to</b> <b>mproved</b> dental care, the newer means of identification from tooth material provide considerable promise for effective identification in difficult cases. The DNA analysis from tooth material has been shown to ba a viable route in forensic analysis, when other material for such an analysis is unusable. However in most cases useful biologic material other than teeth is abailable, and then DNA analysis can be made from other tissue with less effort than by using teeth. Also, in cases with lacking other tissue, blood grouping, isozymes and serum proteins may provide cheaper inherited combinations of blood grouping, isozymes and serum proteins can be treated similary to polymorphic DNA loci as independent markers, their identification can be managed if the false positives and negatives in analysis can be minimmised, and the corresponding frequencies of occurrence are known. It was {{the purpose of the present}} work to review the methods of forensic identification from tooth material, based on analysis of blood grouping, isozymes and serum proteins. It appears that such a combined analysis provides a robust method for forensic purposes. Nevertheless, for efficient identification it is recommended that as many (multiple) forensic methods as possible are combined, so that faster and cheaper methods such as imminent medical forensics are used first, and more thorough analysis is used to support and complement these methods. </p...|$|R
