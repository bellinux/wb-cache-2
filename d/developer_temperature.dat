40|$|Diffractive zone-plate lenses {{are widely}} used as optics in {{high-resolution}} x-ray microscopes. The achievable resolution in such microscopes is presently not limited by the x-ray wavelength but by limitations in zone-plate nanofabrication. Thus, for the advance of high-resolution x-ray microscopy, progress in zone-plate nanofabrication methods are needed.   This Thesis describes {{the development of new}} nanofabrication processes for improved x-ray zone-plate optics. Cold development of the electron-beam resist ZEP 7000 is applied to improve the resolution of soft x-ray Ni zone plates. The influence of <b>developer</b> <b>temperature</b> on resist contrast, resolution, and pattern quality is investigated. With an optimized process, Ni zone plates with outermost zone widths down to 13 nm are demonstrated. To enhance the diffraction efficiency of Ni zone plates, the concept of Ni-Ge zone plates is introduced. The applicability of Ni-Ge zone plates is first demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment, and then extended to cold-developed Ni zone plates with outermost zone widths down to 13 nm. For 15 -nm Ni-Ge zone plates a diffraction efficiency of 4. 3 % at a wavelength of 2. 88 nm is achieved, which is about twice the efficiency of state-of-the-art 15 -nm Ni zone plates. To further increase both resolution and diffraction efficiency of soft x-ray zone plates, a novel fabrication process for W zone plates is developed. High resolution is provided by salty development of the inorganic electron-beam resist HSQ, and cryogenic RIE in a SF 6 plasma is investigated for high-aspect-ratio W structuring. We demonstrate W zone plates with 12 -nm outermost zone width and a W height of 90 nm, resulting in a 30 % increase in theoretical diffraction efficiency compared to 13 -nm efficiency-enhanced Ni-Ge zone plates. In addition to soft x-ray zone plates, some lenses for hard x-ray free-electron-laser applications were also fabricated during this Thesis work. Fabrication processes for the materials W, diamond, and Pt were developed. We demonstrate Pt and W-diamond zone plates with 100 -nm outermost zone width and respective diffraction efficiencies of  8. 2 % and 14. 5 % at a photon energy of 8 keV. QC 2011111...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a new iterative method for optimally selecting a vertical retrieval grid {{based on the}} location of the information while accounting for inter-level correlations. Sample atmospheres initially created to parametrise the Radiative Transfer Model for the Television Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV) forward model are used to compare the presented iterative selection method with two other common approaches, which are using levels of equal vertical spacing and selecting levels based on the cumulative trace of the averaging kernel matrix (AKM). This new method is shown to outperform compared methods for simulated profile retrievals of temperature, H 2 O, O 3, CH 4, and CO with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). However, the benefits of using the more complicated iterative approach compared to the simpler cumulative trace method are slight and may not justify the added effort for the cases studied, but may be useful in other scenarios where temperature and trace gases have strong vertical gradients with significant estimate sensitivity. Furthermore, comparing retrievals using a globally optimised static grid vs. a locally adapted one shows that a static grid performs nearly as well for retrievals of O 3, CH 4, and CO. However, <b>developers</b> of <b>temperature</b> and H 2 O retrieval schemes may at least consider using adaptive or location specific vertical retrieval grids...|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} development of reliable 4 K cryocoolers improves the future prospects for magnets made from low temperature superconductors (LTS). The {{hope of the}} <b>developers</b> of high <b>temperature</b> superconductors (HTS) has been to replace liquid helium cooled LTS magnets with HTS magnets that operate at or near liquid nitrogen temperature. There has been limited success in this endeavor, but continued problems with HTS conductors have greatly slowed progress toward this goal. The development of cryocoolers that reliably operate below 4 K will allow magnets made from LTS conductor to remain very competitive {{for many years to}} come. A key enabling technology for the use of low temperature cryocoolers on LTS magnets has been the development of HTS leads. This report describes the characteristics of LTS magnets that can be successfully melded to low-temperature cryocoolers. This report will also show when it is not appropriate to consider the use of low-temperature cryocoolers to cool magnets made with LTS conductor. A couple of specific examples of LTS magnets where cryocoolers can be used are given...|$|R

This paper presents the main goals, the organization and the working approach of EUROPAIRS. It also presents the status of the viability assessment studies for coupling HTR with industrial end-users systems as one of the main pillars of the project. The main goal of the viability assessment is to identify developments required to remove the last technological and licensing barriers for a viable coupling scheme.

HTR are thus well suited {{to most of the}} non-electric applications of nuclear energy, which represent about 80 % of total energy consumption. This opens opportunities for reducing CO 2 emissions and securing energy supply which are complementary to those provided by systems dedicated to electricity generation. A strong alliance between nuclear and process heat user industries is a necessity for developing a nuclear system for the conventional process heat market, much {{in the same way as}} the electro-nuclear development required a close partnership with utilities. Initiating such an alliance is one of the objectives of the EUROPAIRS project just started in the frame of the Euratom 7 th Framework Programme (FP 7) under AREVA coordination. Within EUROPAIRS, process heat user industries express their requirements whereas nuclear industry will provide the performance window of HTR. Starting from this shared information, an alliance will be forged by assessing the feasibility and impact of nuclear CHP from technical, industrial, economical, licensing and sustainability perspectives. This assessment work will allow pointing out the main issues and challenges for coupling an HTR with industrial process heat applications. On this basis, a roadmap will be elaborated for achieving an industrially relevant demonstration of such a coupling. This roadmap will not only take into consideration the necessary nuclear developments, but also the required adaptations of industrial application processes and the possible development of heat transport technologies from the nuclear heat source to application processes. Although only a small and short project (21 months), EUROPAIRS is of strategic importance: it will generate the boundary conditions for a rapid demonstration of collocating HTR with industrial processes as proposed by the European High Temperature Reactor Technology Network (HTR-TN).
