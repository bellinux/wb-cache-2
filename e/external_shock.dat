The boundary layer was removed through the ramp bleed slot and bypassed the subsonic diffuser and engine where it would otherwise have caused excessive duct loss and unacceptable distortion at the engine. Since the ramp bleed slot was in the subsonic diffuser, and downstream of the shock system, changes in flow demanded by the engine would be accommodated with corresponding changes in the bleed slot flow without significantly affecting the <b>external</b> <b>shock</b> pattern.

25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an <b>external</b> <b>shock</b> throws the system toward a new equilibrium point.

40|$|<b>External</b> <b>shocks,</b> such as {{commodity}} price fluctuations, natural disasters, {{and the role}} of the international economy, are often blamed for the poor economic performance of low-income countries. The author quantifies the impact of these different <b>external</b> <b>shocks</b> using a panel vector autoregression (VAR) approach and compares their relative contributions to output volatility in low-income countries vis-à-vis internal factors. He finds that <b>external</b> <b>shocks</b> can only explain a small fraction of the output variance of a typical low-income country. Internal factors are the main source of fluctuations. From a quantitative perspective, the output effect of <b>external</b> <b>shocks</b> is typically small in absolute terms, but significant relative to the historic performance of these countries.

They discuss the magnitude of these shocks and country responses to them in Brazil, Ireland, and Korea and present numerical results for some other countries. The authors find that the magnitude of <b>external</b> <b>shocks</b> may be greater than previously recognized. The size and components of the shock depend on such factors as the country's openness to trade, the composition of its imports and exports, and its level of external debt.
