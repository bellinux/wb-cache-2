5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. He wrote to the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> the {{injuries}} caused during a fight is a controversial issue. Hitting {{to the head}} was less common in the bare-knuckle era {{because of the risk}} of hurting the boxer's hand. Gloves reduce the number of cuts caused, but British Medical Association research has stated that gloves do not reduce brain injuries and may even increase them, because the main cause of injury is acceleration and deceleration of the head, and fighters wearing gloves are able to punch harder to the head. Gloves may reduce the amount of eye injuries, especially if they are thumbless, but retinal tears and detached retinas still occur to boxers wearing modern gloves.|$|E

500|$|The diamond was {{originally}} bought by Harriet Annenberg Ames, {{the sister of}} the billionaire publisher Walter Annenberg, in 1967. Annenberg Ames felt unable to wear the diamond in her native New York City, and decided to sell the stone. She later said that [...] "I found myself positively cringing and keeping my <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> for fear it would be seen.... It sat in a bank vault for years. It seemed foolish to keep it if one could not use it. As things are in New York one could not possibly wear it publicly".|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of double gloving versus single gloving {{was made with}} regard to its effects on tactile discrimination and dexterity in 17 surgeons of all grades and specialties. Surgeons were assessed by their ability to tie surgical knots, and Dellon's moving two-point discrimination test. Tests were performed single gloved, double gloved with the larger <b>glove</b> <b>on</b> the outside, and double gloved with the larger <b>glove</b> <b>on</b> the inside. Double gloving did not alter two-point discrimination {{or the ability to}} tie surgical knots in this study.

500|$|The show is {{produced}} by Bernie Su who was previously responsible for Pemberley Digital's other webseries. Filmed at YouTube's Space LA production studio, it premiered on the site on August 19, 2014. Prior to the show's premiere, accounts on social media for various characters in the show were created, allowing viewers to interact with Frankensteins protagonists. Joe Hanson, host of PBS Digital's It's Okay To Be Smart, acts as the show's science consultant. In early episodes of the show, Frankenstein neglected to wear gloves during her experiments which Su claimed was because, [...] "real science and real-life procedures aren't sexy for entertainment". During its run, fans noticed this and called the show out for the error; in later episodes she is depicted with <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> for all of her scientific work. The first season of the show concluded after 24 five- to eight-minute episodes on October 31, 2014.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} single, Girls' Generation {{performed}} [...] "Paparazzi" [...] on the Japanese music program Music Station on June 22, 2012, where the group wore tuxedos and pink <b>gloves.</b> <b>On</b> July 9, 2012, the group staged their second {{performance of the}} song on Fuji Television's Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ, where the members wore tuxedos with black gloves. The accompanying music video for [...] "Paparazzi" [...] was directed by Toshiyuki Suzuki and is almost seven minutes long. In the video, Girls' Generation performs on stage in a theatre, with the set inspired by classic musicals. The video begins with the members wearing trench coats and [...] "whimsically prancing" [...] to Gene Kelly's [...] "Singin' in the Rain". During the main performance of [...] "Paparazzi", the video is intercut with scenes of the members being followed by photographers. They perform in two different outfits – showgirl-inspired costumes and tuxedos with pink gloves. Jeff Benjamin from Billboard praised the dance routines for their [...] "perfect nine-piece synchronization" [...] and opined that the pink gloves of the girls resembled those worn by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

500|$|After {{the video}} ended, she then {{came on the}} stage wearing a tutu shaped dress with pointed {{shoulder}} pads and peplum. Her dancers were clad in Louis Vuitton Steven Sprouse printed trousers which matched Gaga's shoes. The backdrop changed to show blinking disco lights and Gaga {{stood in the center}} wearing her video sunglasses which display the line [...] "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow". A remix of the intro for [...] "Just Dance" [...] started and Gaga was joined by her dancers on stage. When the song shifts to the bridge, Gaga once again is handed her disco stick and performs the bridge with it. The ending shifts to a remixed version of the song. Then Gaga and the dancers, joined by DJ Space Cowboy or DJ Nicodemus, take a bow in front of the audience. Gaga comes back with her dance to perform the encore. The encore of the tour consisted of [...] "Boys, Boys, Boys" [...] and the original version of [...] "Poker Face". Gaga was dressed in a khaki leotard embellished with crystals. She wore an admiral's cap and <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> her hands, both were decorated with the word Gaga on them.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} could see his opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> it was so easy for him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
500|$|Early scenes {{animated}} by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly {{like that of}} a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were [...] "rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet" [...] and felt that they should [...] "forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.|$|E

But she could hear the resounding blows, and with the sound of each blow she felt a sickening sensation in the pit of her stomach.

500|$|When {{the head}} of {{household}} finds a suitable tree, he {{stands in front of}} it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words [...] "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the Sign of the Cross, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: [...] "I have come to you to take to my home, to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place." [...] He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put <b>gloves</b> <b>on</b> before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. It must not be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man. In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called [...] "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off {{from the base of the}} tree. In Šumadija, half of a circular loaf of bread is left on the stump, the other half being eaten on the way back home. In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.|$|E

The fight ended in the fourth round after a cut to the Kuziemski was deemed bad enough for the referee to stop the fight.

Also, pundits criticized the prosecution for calling Mark Fuhrman to the witness stand in the first place; they criticized the prosecution for lack of due diligence, which should have discovered his earlier racist statements. The D.A.'s office argued that the defense would have called Fuhrman anyway and that no one knew of the existence of the McKinny tapes until after the trial started.|$|E
