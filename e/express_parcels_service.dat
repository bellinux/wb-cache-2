While it is reaping {{more and more}} express market, the managers are facing difficult decisions to design the service network. This paper investigates the HPTB-EPS network design problem and analyses the time-space characteristics of such network. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated integrating the service decision, frequency, and network flow distribution. To solve the model, a decomposition-based heuristic algorithm is designed by decomposing the problem as three steps: construction of service network, service path selection, and distribution of network flow. Numerical experiment using real data from our partner company demonstrates the effectiveness of our model and algorithm. We found that our solution could reduce the total cost by up to 16. 3 % compared to the carrier’s solution. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness and flexibility of the solutions of the model...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn city logistics, courier <b>express</b> and <b>parcel</b> <b>services</b> (CEP) {{deal with}} last mile {{deliveries}} {{in an urban}} environment. CEP route vehicles to deliver parcels to costumers distributed in the cities area. Customers expect fast and reliable services to reasonable prices. As a result, CEP have to plan and execute their routing efficiently. In a city logistic environment, CEP faces several challenges. Especially, travel times between customers are not deterministic but uncertain and differ during the day regarding traffic volumes and stochastic events like congestion. Further, city traffic flows are controlled by traffic control management (TM). TM decisions additionally impact travel times for CEP. This paper shows the impact of TM decisions to travel times and emphasizes the benefit of cooperational planning between CEP and TM...|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} difference between a second party logistics provider and a third-party logistics provider {{is the fact that}} a 3PL provider is always integrated in the customs system. The 2PL is not integrated, in contrast to the 3PL he is only an outsourced logistics provider with no system integration. A 2PL works often on call (e.g. <b>express</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>services)</b> whereas a 3PL is almost every time informed about the workload of the near future. Another point that differs 2 and 3PL is the specification and customizing of services. A 2PL normally only provides standardized services. 3PL’s against it often provide services that are customized and specialized on the needs of their customer. This is possible by the long term contracts that are usual in the third-party logistics market. So there are customized logistics services are needed the contracts in the 3PL segment have to be long term, because customizing always costs money. A cost effectiveness for the third-party logistics provider is only given over longer periods of time with a stable contract and stable profits. In contrast to that second party logistic services can’t be customized, concerning to the fluctuating market with hard competition and a price battle on a low level. And there we have another distinguishing point between 2PL and 3PL: Durability of contracts. 3PL contracts are long term contracts, whereas 2PL contracts are of a low durability, so that the customer is flexible in responding to market and price changes.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{the advent}} of the Internet in private {{households}} and in almost every company in the last two decades, many things have changed. One of the major changes concerns the rapid growth of the e-commerce utilization, which brings changes to the transportation system – e. g., courier, <b>express</b> and <b>parcel</b> <b>service</b> providers (CEP) sector with it. Thus, the CEP sector is the most increasing and dominant logistics sector worldwide. Especially in agglomerations, a high growth potential is expected for the future. It is mostly driven by the demand of private households and retail in urban agglomerations. Considering the importance of CEP, the knowledge about CEP – from a transport modeller's view – is still scarce. There are several studies with focus on consumer's e-commerce behaviour or the supply side. However, – as far as the authors are aware of – there are no extensive studies examining both, transport demand and supply. This, however, is crucial for a better understanding and modelling of CEP actors. We present our first results and a theoretical and empirical based approach to characterise not only the supply side of CEP service providers, but also the demand side of private households, and businesses regarding e-commerce as a driver for the development of freight demand...|$|R
40|$|This study conceptualizes the {{relationship}} between etailing (e-retailing) and the <b>parcel</b> <b>express</b> industry (PEI) and analyzes their co-evolution in China. Four operational models of etailing {{are discussed in the}} context of their intertwining relations with different forms of <b>parcel</b> <b>express</b> <b>services.</b> This co-evolution generated compound outcomes because of the late start of PEI and the fast growth of online shopping in China. These four models coexist, with two standing out as major types that suggest future directions. Two major geographical imprints of this process are explained and conceptualized: (1) the zonal delivery strategy by supply-chain-based e-merchants, which is conceptualized into a choice model of order-fulfilling locations to strengthen timely delivery; and (2) the Baoyou strategy advocated by e-market-based retailers and their logistic support for a slower, low-cost market of larger geographical coverage compared to the first strategy. Both strategies demonstrate that co-evolution is not only a path-dependent process but is also associated with place-dependent institutions...|$|R
