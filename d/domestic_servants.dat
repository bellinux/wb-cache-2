5|$|Missouri was {{admitted}} {{as a slave}} state. During the 1840s, the number of slaves increased but their percentage relative to the population declined; during the 1850s, both the number and percentage declined. Roughly 3,200 free blacks and slaves lived in St. Louis in 1850, working as <b>domestic</b> <b>servants,</b> artisans, crew on the riverboats and stevedores.|$|E

5|$|Most {{activities}} {{were open to}} slaves except politics, which was reserved for citizens. The principal use of slaves was in agriculture, but hundreds of slaves were also used in stone quarries or mines, and perhaps two per household were <b>domestic</b> <b>servants.</b> It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, {{with as many as}} 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, with average of three or four slaves per household, except in poor families.|$|E
5|$|Henry's wealth {{allowed him}} to {{maintain}} what was probably the largest curia regis, or royal court, in Europe. His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised {{a number of major}} nobles and bishops, along with knights, <b>domestic</b> <b>servants,</b> prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling the gaps between the official structures and the king.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became <b>domestic</b> <b>servants.</b>|$|E

5|$|Smith {{was born}} as Frank Wenham in Tonbridge, Kent, on 9 June 1885. He was the illegitimate son of Oswald Cox, {{a member of}} a {{prominent}} local family who resided at Marl Field House, and one of his <b>domestic</b> <b>servants,</b> Minnie Wenham, whom Frank would never come to know. Considered an embarrassment by the wealthy Cox family, from an early age he was sent away to live with relatives, and aged four sent to a boarding school where he was physically abused by staff before being removed from the institution by his paternal grandmother, who took him for a year in Switzerland. From 1899 to 1901, he studied at Bedales School, where he developed his lifelong hobby of book binding, before becoming the apprentice to a cabinet maker in Kendal until 1906.|$|E
5|$|The French {{settlers}} brought {{both black}} and Indian slaves to St. Louis; although the majority were used as <b>domestic</b> <b>servants,</b> others worked as agricultural laborers. In 1769, the Spanish prohibited Indian slavery in Louisiana, but the practice was entrenched among the French Creoles in St. Louis. As a compromise, Spanish governors ended the Indian slave trade but allowed the retention of current slaves and any children born to them. In 1772, a census determined {{the population of the}} village to be 637, including 444 whites (285 males and 159 females) and 193 African slaves, with no Indian slaves reported due to their technical illegality. During the 1770s and 1780s, St. Louis grew slowly and the Spanish commanders were replaced often.|$|E
5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and wilfully evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants {{were expected to}} be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as <b>domestic</b> <b>servants</b> for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.|$|E

5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as <b>domestic</b> <b>servants,</b> and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{encouraged}} to leave the workforce {{and the creation of}} large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with their utilities, school fees and household expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five percent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men as women were for the most part employed as <b>domestic</b> <b>servants,</b> weavers or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.|$|E
25|$|The Victorian era in {{particular}} became notorious for {{the conditions under}} which children were employed. Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous, often fatal, working conditions. In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults. Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as <b>domestic</b> <b>servants</b> (there were over 120,000 <b>domestic</b> <b>servants</b> in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while <b>domestic</b> <b>servants</b> worked 80-hour weeks.|$|E

25|$|Legally {{employed}} domestic {{workers are}} distinct from illegally employed <b>domestic</b> <b>servants.</b> While legally employed domestic house workers are fairly compensated {{for their work}} in accordance with national wage laws, <b>domestic</b> <b>servants</b> are typically forced to work extremely long hours for little to no monetary compensation, and psychological and physical means are employed to limit their mobility and freedom. In addition, deportation threats are often used to discourage internationally trafficked persons from seeking help.|$|E
25|$|Edwardian Britain {{had large}} numbers {{of male and female}} <b>domestic</b> <b>servants,</b> in both urban and rural areas. Men relied on working class women to run their homes smoothly, and {{employers}} often looked to these working class women for sexual partners. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small wage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system inside the mansion. The number of <b>domestic</b> <b>servants</b> fell in the Edwardian period due to a declining number of young people willing to be employed in this area.|$|E

25|$|Planters held slaves {{for use as}} field hands, laborers, artisans, and <b>domestic</b> <b>servants.</b> In the city, slaves worked {{primarily}} as <b>domestic</b> <b>servants</b> and artisans, although they also worked with merchants, shippers, and {{in a wide variety}} of trades. Plantations raised commodity crops of tobacco and hemp, and thoroughbred horse breeding and racing became established in this part of the state. In 1850, one-fifth of the state's population were slaves, and Lexington had the highest concentration of slaves in the entire state. It also had a significant population of free blacks, who were usually of mixed race. By 1850, First African Baptist Church, led by London Ferrill, a free black from Virginia, had a congregation of 1,820 persons, the largest of any, black or white, in the entire state.|$|E
25|$|During the Republic of China (1912–49) {{and earlier}} Chinese governments, women were legally {{bought and sold}} into slavery {{under the guise of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>servants.</b> These women were known as Mui Tsai.
