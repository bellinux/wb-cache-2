25|$|Megler quickly {{recognized}} {{the danger of}} overfishing on the Columbia and was an early proponent of legislated <b>fishing</b> <b>limits</b> and of fish hatcheries as a method to combat the collapse of salmon fisheries as seen in California and on the East Coast. He {{was one of the}} founders of The Oregon & Washington Fish Propagating Co., a collection of Columbia River salmon packers who in 1877 established the first salmon cannery in the Pacific Northwest on a tributary of the Clackamas River in Oregon. In 1888, it became a station of the United States Fish Commission.|$|E
25|$|Oyster {{dredging}} became {{important and}} started in 1828 centering around the Chausay oyster beds, where the French also wished to fish. News of these beds brought 300 fishing boats {{from the south}} of England, Gorey pier was rebuilt to assist them and after ten years, the beds were shown to be over fished. The Royal Navy and French Navy arrived. At its peak in 1857, 179,690 tubs of oysters were dredged. The capture of a Jersey boat resulted in an invasion of Granville by fisherman who destroyed equipment on the French fishing fleet. To avoid this act of war, the two governments enacted <b>fishing</b> <b>limits.</b> The fishing beds were dying and a ban was introduced. The fishermen ignored the ban resulting in the Jersey Militia firing cannonballs at the fishing boats before arresting 100 men who were fined in court. So ended the “oyster riot”, the English fishermen sailing back to England in 1861. This dramatic event would be followed by many future disputes over fishing rights especially around Minquiers which took until 1953 before the International Court of Justice confirmed that Jersey owned them.|$|E
2500|$|The 1970s {{were marked}} by the Cod Wars— several {{disputes}} with the United Kingdom over Iceland's extension of its <b>fishing</b> <b>limits</b> to [...] offshore. Iceland hosted a summit in Reykjavík in 1986 between United States President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament. A few years later, Iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as they {{broke away from the}} USSR. Throughout the 1990s, the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes. To that end, Iceland provided aid and expertise to various NATO-led interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq.|$|E
50|$|The Utah DWR allows {{fishing in}} the lake; bass (6 <b>fish</b> <b>limit),</b> {{bluegill}} (50 <b>fish</b> <b>limit),</b> and tilapia (no limit, mandatory keep and kill). The tilapia criteria {{reflect the fact that}} this species was introduced to Blue Lake illegally, and it competes with the native game fish for habitat.|$|R

2500|$|Northern pike {{are also}} a problem in Holter Lake. [...] The fish has long been present in small numbers in the lake, where it consumes more {{desirable}} native species like burbot, brown trout, and cuttrout trout. In March 2011, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) set no limit {{on the number of}} northern pike anglers may take from Holter Lake and the waters just above it. A month later, the agency said it had completed an environmental assessment of a plan to remove northern pike from the Missouri River and its feeder streams. The agency sought public comment on the plan, which it said would take three to five years to complete at a cost of $20,000. The agency intended to use nets and [...] "passive" [...] fish traps to remove the pike, but might employ [...] "active" [...] measure like electric fishing, gill netting, or trap netting if the passive measures were not effective. In April 2011, the FWP removed all <b>fishing</b> <b>limits</b> on northern pike from the headwaters of the Missouri River to Holter Dam in order to encourage fishermen to eradicate the species. In March 2012, the state began a project to eradicate all northern pike from the headwaters of the Madison, Gallatin, and Jefferson rivers to Holter Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E

In the United States and Canada more use is made of large factory trawlers, while the huge blue water fleets operated by Japan and the Soviet-bloc countries have contracted. In western Europe, fishing vessel design is focused on compact boats with high catching power.|$|R

50|$|Condition index in {{fish can}} be used to make {{management}} decisions such as <b>fishing</b> <b>limits</b> in specific areas. For example, Ratz and Lloret (2002) observed that Atlantic cod living in colder waters, such as Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank, were in poorer condition than cod living in warmer waters such as the North Sea and Irish Sea. They suggest that the warmer waters might be able to support higher fishing rates than the colder waters.|$|E
50|$|Walleye - Stizostedion vitreum. Also {{known as}} pickerel, pike-perch, and wall-eye pike. Similar to the pike, the walleye {{is found in}} all waterbodies in the Park and Recreation Area, except Shaw Lake. Considered {{one of the most}} {{desirable}} sport fish in the Boreal region, walleye were over-harvested by commercial fishing and recreational anglers in the 1970s and 1980s. Strict guidelines have helped these populations recover, although <b>fishing</b> <b>limits</b> are still in place.|$|E
50|$|Recreational {{fishing for}} {{northern}} red snapper has been popular for a long time, restricted mostly by <b>fishing</b> <b>limits</b> intended to ensure a sustainable population. The first minimum size limit was introduced in 1984, after a 1981 report described quickly declining harvests (both commercial and recreational) From 1985 to 1990, the annual recreational catch of red snapper was about 1.5 million. From 1991 to 2005, the catch was substantially higher, varying {{from year to year}} from 2.5 to 4.0 million.|$|E

5000|$|In 1975, the Icelandic Government urged Canada to {{establish}} a 200-mile offshore <b>fishing</b> <b>limit</b> to protect itself from overfishing by foreign fleets. The Foreign Minister of Iceland, Einar Aguisson, said [...] "we sincerely hope Canada will establish an offshore limit of 200 miles". The Icelandic President Kristján Eldjárn said during a tour of Canada that [...] "Iceland can't wait any longer because of depleted fish stocks and if Canada joins us we will then have an important ally." ...|$|R

50|$|The Icelandic {{government}} again {{extended its}} <b>fishing</b> <b>limits,</b> {{this time to}} 50 nmi km. It had two goals in extending these limits: (1) to conserve fish stocks and (2) to increase Iceland's share of total catches. The reasons Iceland pursued 50 mile fishery limits, rather than the 200 mile limits which they had also considered, were that the most fruitful fishing grounds were within the 50 miles, and patrolling a 200-mile limit {{would have been more}} difficult.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s the fishing {{industry}} of Grimsby declined (to less than 15% of 1970 levels by tonnage by 1983) due to fuel costs (1973 fuel crisis), decline in fish stocks, Icelandic exclusion zones (see cod war), and new EEC <b>fishing</b> <b>limits,</b> though the port's market share remained roughly constant at around 20%, imported landings from Icelandic ships (as well as from ships of Norway, Faroes, Denmark, Belgium and Holland) became important to the continuation of Grimsby's role as a 'fish port'.|$|E

Elwha Dam was built privately from 1910 to 1912 by Thomas Aldwell, who owned land in the area. This {{resulted}} in blocking passage of migrating <b>fish,</b> <b>limiting</b> them to the lower 4.9 mi of river below the dam. In 1927 Glines Canyon Dam was built 7 mi upriver of Elwha Dam.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{constant}} disputes with Spain over fishing rights since 1973 when Morocco declared an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), {{resulting in a}} 70 nmi km coastal <b>fishing</b> <b>limit.</b> This was extended to 200 nautical miles (370 km) in 1981. In February 2012 {{it was reported that}} the Spanish Prime Minister was urging Morocco to negotiate an agreement about these differences. Western Sahara is not internationally recognised as part of Morocco, and Moroccan fisheries in the territory are considered in violation of international law.|$|R
