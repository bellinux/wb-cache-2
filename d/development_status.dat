5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human <b>Development</b> <b>status.</b> It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E

With high confidence, Nicholls et al. (2007, p.317) concluded that on vulnerable coasts, the costs of adapting to climate change are lower than the potential damage costs.|$|E

25|$|Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer {{discuss the}} HDI from the {{perspective}} of data error in the underlying health, education and income statistics used to construct the HDI. They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's <b>development</b> <b>status</b> and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.|$|E
25|$|Encouragement of {{regional}} development was given increased attention under the First Wilson Government, {{with the aim}} of narrowing economic dispratiies between the various regions. A policy was introduced in 1965 whereby any new government organisation should be established outside London and in 1967 the government decided to give preference to development areas. A few government departments were also moved out of London, with the Royal Mint moved to South Wales, the Giro and Inland Revenue to Bootle, and the Motor Tax Office to Swansea. A new Special <b>Development</b> <b>Status</b> was also introduced in 1967 to provide even higher levels of assistance. In 1966, five development areas (covering half the population in the UK) were established, while subsidies were provided for employers recruiting new employees in the Development Areas. A Highlands and Islands Development Board was also set up to “re-invigorate” the north of Scotland.|$|E

500|$|The game began {{production}} {{alongside the}} company's second project, , and remained in development after that game's 1993 release. It then {{continued through the}} creation of their titles System Shock (released in 1994) and Flight Unlimited. The game was subject to numerous delays, which Schmidt later attributed to its lack of a set deadline. He stated that the team was [...] "trying to go with the same philosophy" [...] as the company's earlier games, in that they would [...] "develop the systems and the game would come out of it". However, the team's development priorities regularly changed, and the programmer who led the project left several years into production. According to Schmidt, his departure meant that [...] "there was no-one left who was psyched about making this really [...] simulation". Despite this fact, the team continued using the idea, even though serious difficulties were involved in achieving it. Schmidt said that the game's <b>development</b> <b>status</b> was uncertain after the programmer left, and that he inherited the role of lead programmer around that time merely because the position had to be filled. He later assumed the role of project leader. In January 1995, Looking Glass showed Terra Nova alongside Flight Unlimited at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, under their [...] "Immersive Reality" [...] marketing label.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Rajinikanth {{signed up}} for P. Vasu's Chandramukhi (2005), a remake of the Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu. Upon release the film was highly {{successful}} at the box office, and in 2007 it set the record of being the longest running Tamil film. Chandramukhi was also dubbed in Turkish and in German as Der Geisterjäger and released in the respective nations. Following Chandramukhis release, {{it was reported that}} AVM Productions was set to produce a film directed by Shankar starring Rajinikanth — the largest collaboration yet for a Tamil film. The film was titled Sivaji and was released in the summer of 2007, following two years of filming and production. It became the first Tamil film to be charted as one of the [...] "top-ten best films" [...] of the United Kingdom and South Africa box offices upon release. Rajinikanth received a salary of , {{for his role in the}} film, which made him the second highest paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan. During the production of Sivaji, Soundarya Rajinikanth announced her intention of producing a computer-generated imagery film starring an animated version of her father titled Sultan: The Warrior. The film was set for release in 2008, however, it entered development hell, and its <b>development</b> <b>status</b> would become unknown over the next few years.|$|E

2500|$|According to Moss, {{socioeconomic}} {{factors that}} affect impoverished populations such as education, income inequality, and occupation, represent the strongest and most consistent predictors of health and mortality. [...] The inequalities in the apparent circumstances of individual's lives, like individuals' access to health care, schools, their conditions of work and leisure, households, communities, towns, or cities, affect people's ability to lead a flourishing life and maintain health, according to the WHO. The inequitable distribution of health-harmful living conditions, experiences, and structures, is {{not by any means}} natural, [...] "but {{is the result of a}} toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics". Therefore, the conditions of individual's daily life are responsible for the social determinants of health and a major part of health inequities between and within countries. Along with these social conditions, [...] "Gender, education, occupation, income, ethnicity, and place of residence are all closely linked to people's access to, experiences of, and benefits from health care." [...] Social determinants of disease can be attributed to broad social forces such as racism, gender inequality, poverty, violence, and war. This is important because health quality, health distribution, and social protection of health in a population affect the <b>development</b> <b>status</b> of a nation. Since health has been considered a fundamental human right, one author suggests the social determinants of health determine the distribution of human dignity.|$|E
