5|$|Ornithologists {{and bird}} watchers have {{recorded}} {{a total of}} 175species at the IBA. Several <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the high total of bird species observed: {{there is a large}} area of forest in the IBA, as well as great habitat diversity. The location of the IBA along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations.|$|E
5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> {{the likelihood that}} an injury will be fatal. In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury. In the US, patients with fall-related TBIs have an 89% survival rate, while only 9% of patients with firearm-related TBIs survive. In the US, firearms {{are the most common}} cause of fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% are considered to be suicides.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava flows and pyroclastic masses, has been shaped by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 years past and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been generated on the north and east flanks of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|The {{three factors}} of Virchow's triad—venous stasis, hypercoagulability, {{and changes in}} the endothelial blood vessel lining (such as {{physical}} damage or endothelial activation)—contribute to DVT and are used to explain its formation. Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. Various risk <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> DVT, though many at high risk never develop it.|$|E
5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the rising rates of {{childhood}} obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to}} be the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

25|$|Many <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> {{the decline}} of manufacturing. The late 1970s saw an {{increase}} in land prices. Real estate became the new business. Land originally reserved for factories were now converted to houses or shopping malls. Along with the opening up of global trade in China via the 1978 economic reform, factories were gradually re-located to the mainland for even cheaper labour.|$|E
25|$|Many regions {{have been}} {{reported}} which were originally home for P. fuscatus have slowly altered to that of P. dominula. A few possible <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the prevalence of P. dominula over P. fuscatus, specifically in settling into a territory. Some of the factors include productive colony cycle, short developmental time, aposematic coloration, a generalist diet, {{and the ability to}} colonize new environment.|$|E

25|$|After a {{hierarchy}} is established, the dominant wasp remains the sole reproducer {{in the colony}} due to the inhibition of endocrine activity within the subordinate wasps. Various <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the possibility of inhibition, which might also lead to differences in endocrine activity. If subordinates happen to lay eggs after the hierarchy is formed, the dominant foundress will eat the eggs to ensure all laid eggs are of her own genes.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> Bedouin women’s lack of {{participation}} in the labor force. A study conducted by economist Aamer Abu-Qarn determined that the most significant barriers to women’s employment are lack of education, lack of experience, and poor infrastructure in Bedouin towns. Surprisingly, factors that were not found significant by the model included the presence or number of children, the health of household members, and the level of modernity.|$|E
25|$|Climatic <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> Australia's high {{incidence}} of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. Low relative humidity, wind and lack of rain can cause a small fire, either man-made or caused naturally by lightning strikes, to spread rapidly over large distances. Low humidity, {{the heat of the}} sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why {{women are more likely}} than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have children under the age of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> them receiving less of an education than whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E
25|$|These <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the {{metamorphism}} of snow, i.e. {{the process}} of reshaping snow crystals into smaller, more rounded ice grains, which in turn consolidates and settles the snow pack. Increased density increases strength by joining of grains though sintering and freezing of melted water. New-fallen snow may have a density of 150 - 200kg/m3. Whereas a snowmobile can pack snow to a density of 300 - 350kg/m3, the densities required for recreational trails are 450kg/m3 and for racing, 500kg/m3 or higher.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the {{development}} of relatively large sea caves. The nature of the zone of weakness itself is surely a factor, although difficult to quantify. A more readily observed factor is {{the situation of the}} cave’s entrance relative to prevailing sea conditions. At Santa Cruz Island, the largest caves face into the prevailing northwest swell conditions—a factor which also makes them more difficult to survey. Caves in well-protected bays sheltered from prevailing seas and winds tend to be smaller, as are caves in areas where the seas tend to be calmer.|$|E

25|$|The Sangiovese grape is {{the most}} widely planted grape in the Montalcino region {{and is the only}} {{permitted}} grape in the Brunello di Montalcino DOCG. The particular clones of Sangiovese are unique to the Montalcino region and have developed in adaption to that area's specific terroir. The altitude and climate of the Montalcino region has provided an area where Sangiovese ripens more fully and consistently than anywhere else in Tuscany. These <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the body, color, extract and tannins commonly associated with Brunello di Montalcino. In contrast to Chianti, the other famous Sangiovese based wine of Tuscany, Brunello di Montalcinos have a more fleshy texture with common aromas and flavors of blackberry, black cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, leather and violets.|$|E
25|$|Slower {{degeneration}} of {{the distal}} segment {{than that which}} occurs in the peripheral nervous system also contributes to the inhibitory environment because inhibitory myelin and axonal debris are not cleared away as quickly. All these <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the formation {{of what is known}} as a glial scar, which axons cannot grow across. The proximal segment attempts to regenerate after injury, but its growth is hindered by the environment. It {{is important to note that}} central nervous system axons have been proven to regrow in permissive environments; therefore, the primary problem to central nervous system axonal regeneration is crossing or eliminating the inhibitory lesion site. Another problem is that the morphology and functional properties of central nervous system neurons are highly complex, for this reason a neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás' law).|$|E
25|$|Several <b>factors</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> colony growth. Temperature plays a {{major role}} in colony growth and development; colony growth ceases below 24°C and {{developmental}} time decreases from 55 days at temperatures of 24°C to 23 days at 35°C. Growth in established colonies only occurs at temperatures between 24 and 36°C. Nanitic brood also develops far quicker than minor worker brood (around 35% faster), which is beneficial for founding colonies. Colonies that have access to an unlimited amount of insect prey are known to grow substantially, but this growth is further accelerated if they are able to access plant resources colonised by hemipteran insects. In incipient monogyne colonies where diploid males are produced, colony mortality rates are significantly high and colony growth is slow. In some cases, monogyne colonies experience 100% mortality rates in the early stages of development.|$|E
