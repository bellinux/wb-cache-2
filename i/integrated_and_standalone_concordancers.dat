40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyAn {{investigation}} was undertaken to evaluate three different display presentation types of the Conflict Prediction Display System (CPDS). The CPDS application {{is designed to}} provide operators with readily actionable Level 3 SA (Endsley, 1995 a). The different display configurations were designed to evaluate the effects of information level and display format on pilot performance in order to inform future design decisions. A secondary objective was to utilize archival data to identify differences in workload <b>and</b> performance between <b>integrated</b> <b>and</b> <b>standalone</b> displays. Subject perception and objective performance data were collected from 10 participants who performed two detect-and-avoid tasks using a simulated ground control station (GCS). Each participant completed a 38 -minute trial with each of the display configurations followed by a questionnaire. Several significant differences were identified in both objective performance and subjective perception between CPDS display configuration <b>and</b> between <b>standalone</b> <b>and</b> <b>integrated</b> displays. Overall, operators were significantly faster at responding to alerts on 3 of 5 performance metrics when conflict probes were used to display self-separation and collision avoidance information. In addition, operators preferred the integration of conflict probes when displaying surrounding traffic; however there was no clear preference regarding whether or not the probes display self-separation information. Standalone versus integrated comparisons indicated operators were significantly faster on all performance metrics when using an integrated display format. Given the applied nature of the research it is important to go beyond just the statistical comparisons and look at the real-world implications of the data. The practical implications of the differences in display configurations are discussed in the framework of flight management in the national airspace (NAS) ...|$|R

The system will process botanical descriptions {{with the help of}} an OWL ontology that integrates plant structures, botanical characteristics and the cor-responding keywords.

40|$|URL] audienceScaffolding {{is often}} an {{essential}} step in a genome assembly process,in which contigs are ordered and oriented using read pairs {{from a combination of}} paired-ends libraries and longer-range mate-pair libraries. Although a simple idea, scaffolding is unfortunately hard to get right in practice. One source of problem is so-called PE-contamination in mate-pair libraries, in which a non-negligible fraction of the read pairs get the wrong orientation and a much smaller insert size than what is expected. This contamination has been discussed in previous work on integrated scaffolders in end-to-end assemblers such as Allpaths-LG and MaSuRCA but the methods relies {{on the fact that the}} orientation is observable, e. g., by finding the junction adapter sequence in the reads. This is not always the case, making orientation and insert size of a read pair stochastic. Furthermore, work on modeling PE-contamination has so far been disregarded in stand-alone scaffolders and the effect that PE-contamination has on scaffolding quality has not been examined before. We have addressed PE-contamination in an update of our scaffolder BESST. We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and use characteristics of the problem, such as contig lengths and insert size, to efficiently solve the ILP using a linear amount (with respect to the number of contigs) of Linear Programs. Our results show significant improvement over both <b>integrated</b> <b>and</b> <b>standalone</b> scaffolders. The impact of modeling PE-contamination is quantified by comparison with the previous BESST model. We also show how other scaffolders are vulnerable to PE-contaminated libraries, resulting in increased number of misassemblies, more conservative scaffolding, and inflated assembly sizes. The model is implemented in BESST. Source code and usage instructions are found at [URL] BESST can also be downloaded using PyPI...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Collaboration is an {{important}} activity that is increasingly using technology to improve the productivity of the participants. The Integrated Collaboration Object Model (ICOM) is a proposed OASIS standard for interoperation among collaboration services. ICOM is in-tended to be a framework for integrating {{a broad range of}} domain models for collaboration environments. The intention is to encourage indepen-dent software vendors and open source communities to create common collaboration clients that interoperate with <b>integrated</b> collaboration plat-forms <b>and</b> <b>standalone</b> collaboration services across enterprise boundaries. This paper provides an overview of ICOM that covers the high-level con-cepts, directory, space, access control, metadata, content management, and unified message models. ICOM is represented in several formats: the Java Persistence API, XML Schema, RDF and OWL. We also describe an example application based on ICOM...|$|R
40|$|The full {{integration}} of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS), {{a prerequisite for}} enabling {{a broad range of}} public and commercial UAS operations, presents several technical challenges to UAS developers, operators and regulators. A primary barrier is the inability for UAS pilots (situated at a ground control station, or GCS) to comply with Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations sections 91. 111 and 91. 113, which require pilots to see and avoid other aircraft in order to maintain well clear. The present study is the final in a series of human-in-the-loop experiments designed to explore and test the various display and alerting requirements being incorporated into the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) for a UAS-specific detect and avoid system that would replace the see and avoid function required of manned aircraft. Two display configurations were tested - an <b>integrated</b> display <b>and</b> a <b>standalone</b> display - <b>and</b> their impact on pilot response times and ability to maintain DAA well clear were compared. Results indicated that the current draft of the MOPS result in high-level performance and did not meaningfully differ by display configuration...|$|R
