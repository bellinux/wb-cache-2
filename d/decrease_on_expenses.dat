Using a combination of recommended parameters, significant improvements in the surface roughness of different machined parts are shown. Production costs are also reduced by <b>decreasing</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> lubricants and by optimizing the cycle time reached under the new cutting conditions, what would help the implementing company to increase its profits and adapt to a modern sustainability-demanding production industry.

40|$|Since 2001, {{researchers}} have concluded {{women may be}} less corrupt than men. Although adequate research about women and corruption was identified for this study, a gap linking women in government, corruption, and foreign direct investment (FDI) existed. This cross-sectional, nonexperimental study examined {{the effect of the}} number of women in government on FDI through corruption and national <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> healthcare. Structural equation modeling using two mediated path models was used to test relationships between observable variables. Results included statistically significant relationships between the number of women in governments and lower levels of perceived corruption, between lower levels of perceived corruption and greater <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> healthcare, and between greater <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> healthcare and increased FDI countries received. Although no statistically significant direct relationship was identified between the number of women in governments and FDI, significant study results included a fully mediated, indirect relationship between them. That is, as the number of women increased within governments, levels of perceived corruption <b>decreased,</b> national <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> healthcare increased, and FDI in turn increased. This research treated women in government as the independent variable. In other words, it treated women as vital human resources ? potential solutions for increasing FDI ? not just beneficiaries from assistances. Ultimately, this study provided empirical results on which professionals and institutions can base and financially justify investments to improve gender equity within governments. To apply this research, recommendations were made to the U. S. Agency for International Development?s Strategy on Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance. These recommendations included recognizing women as vital human resources, not merely beneficiaries of programmatic activity. This research provides empirical results on which human resource development (HRD) professionals can base practice decisions. National HRD practitioners who craft gender-specific interventions to vertically integrate human resource development may not only reduce gender inequalities, but also contribute to reducing corruption, increasing the allocation of governmental resources to healthcare, and ultimately improving FDI...|$|R

In this paper, we examine the effects that earnings management has <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. Defining small positive profits or small earnings increases as earnings management, we observe significant expense stickiness in the non-earnings-management sub-sample, compared with the earnings-management sub-sample. When we divide expenses into R&D, advertising and other general expenses, we find that managers control expenses mainly by decreasing general expenses. We further examine corporate governance’s effect <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. Using factor analysis, we extract eight main factors and find that good corporate governance reduces expense stickiness. Finally, we investigate the interaction effects of earnings management and corporate governance <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. The empirical results show that good corporate governance can further reduce cost stickiness, although its effect is not as strong as that of earnings management...|$|R

40|$|The {{result of}} {{polymeric}} nanogels and lipid vesicles interaction—lipobeads—can {{be considered as}} multipurpose containers for future therapeutic applications, such as targeted anticancer chemotherapy with superior tumor response and minimum side effects. In this work, micrometer sized lipobeads were synthesized by two methods: (i) mixing separately prepared microgels made of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) and phospholipid vesicles of micrometer or nanometer size and (ii) polymerization within the lipid vesicles. For the first time, a high vacuum scanning electron microscopy was shown to be suitable for a quick validation of the structural organization of wet lipobeads and their constituents without special sample preparation. In particular, the structural difference of microgels prepared by thermal and UV-polymerization in different solvents was revealed and three types of giant liposomes were recognized under high vacuum in conjunction with their size, composition, and method of preparation. Importantly, the substructure of the hydrogel core and multi- and unilamellar constructions of the peripheral lipid part were explicitly distinguished on the SEM images of lipobeads, justifying the spontaneous formation of a lipid bilayer {{on the surface of}} microgels and evidencing an energetically favorable structural organization of the hydrogel/lipid bilayer assembly. This key property can facilitate lipobeads’ preparation and <b>decrease</b> technological <b>expenses</b> <b>on</b> their scaled production.
