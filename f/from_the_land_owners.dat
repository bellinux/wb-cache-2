50|$|The private dirt rood {{leading from}} the highway to the springs has been chained off as of the summer of 2016. Rumors have it that a man died in the springs due to a heart attack, and the {{property}} owners became concerned about lawsuits arising from trespassers. Previously, the owners permitted free and open access to the springs without issue. A rise in partiers and garbage left behind likely has {{also contributed to the}} closure.

50|$|The ASU {{organized}} numerous demands. First, in {{the face}} of farm and mill owners' attempts to cut wages and suspend food advancements, the ASU called for the continuation of advances to sharecroppers. Secondly, the ASU demanded that sharecroppers have full autonomy and control over surplus crops to sell at market. In response to sharecroppers being required to purchase food <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>owners,</b> the ASU demanded that croppers be given individual plots to grow their own food. Additionally, the ASU demanded that sharecroppers be paid in cash instead of food advances that many times plunged the croppers further in debt. For their children, the ASU demanded education. Before it was dissolved into the Farmers Union of Alabama, in 1936, the ASU had represented nearly 10,000 workers.|$|E

30|$|This {{study showed}} that the {{barriers}} in development process faced by the Malay Reserve Land of Kg. Sg. Penchala cannot be resolved by merely proposing specific developments or attempting to resolve specific issues. These development barriers relate {{to a range of}} legal, physical, and financial issues and require effective coordination and promotion and this can only be undertaken by a dedicated body. Most importantly, policymakers must address the restriction originating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>owners</b> themselves, who perceive that the current environment of village style of living is much preferred. Thus, immediate re-development of the area is not warranted. Further studies should be conducted to seek possible solutions in developing these MRL while giving considerations to the MRL owners’ favored life style.|$|E
30|$|The {{administration}} {{and distribution of}} land {{was given to the}} peasant associations (PA) created in every village of 800 hectares of land (Daniel 2012). The information collected from informants and FGD participants reveal that in such distribution, female headed households got due attention from the government. A case in point, when all extra lands were confiscated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>owners</b> and distributed to the landless, female-headed households did not lose their rist land that was owned prior to 1975. Consequently, based on the proclamation, land was distributed based on household sizes, without differentiation of sexes. In Gojjam, all female headed households acquired equal access of land with male-headed households based on their household size, particularly in the distribution that took place between 1978 – 9. This was an indication of the government’s attempt to ensure gender equality in land related issues.|$|E

It is historical that Caliph ‘Umar has practiced this principle in connection with the case of land loot. Instead of taking the land of Syrians as loot, the Caliph ‘Umar took tax <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>owners</b> and distributed the money for military. In another chance, Caliph ‘Umar stopped giving zakah to mu’allaf group because there is no longer need to give them zakah in the current situation, different from what Prophet Muhammad and Caliph Abu Bakr have practiced. According to Sjadzali, there are a lot of Islamic legal issues to which an intensive attention and contextualization should be drawn, such as the law of inheritance, zakah for mu’allaf, bank interest, woman leadership, woman testimony, inter-religious marriage, non Muslim status, slavery, et cetera. The main idea of Sjadzali’s thought is the necessity to take social and cultural context of the society into account at comprehending, and then concluding a legal decision from, Quranic verses concerning with social life, though this will led to not apply the extrinsic meaning of those verses. </span...|$|E
