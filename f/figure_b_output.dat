30|$|From all picture (<b>b),</b> (c) of <b>Figures</b> 9, 10, and 11, all {{of which}} are {{enhanced}} by the popular contrast enhancement method-histogram equalization, we can see that no matter whether the noises are filtered in advance (all Figure (c)) or not (all <b>Figure</b> (<b>b)),</b> the <b>output</b> videos are always unacceptable, since the noises are over-enhanced in the equalization process. While our APMF considers the intensity standard deviations and treat large scale parts and details differently. From Figures 10 (c), 10 (d), 11 (c), and 11 (d), we can see that our APMF produces much better outputs than histogram equalization after the same filtering process. Our APMF great enhances the video as well as suppressing mixed noises. In addition, our APMF produces desirable outputs in all underexposed, overexposed, and mixed ill-exposed videos, owing to its ability of adaptively adjusting the mapping functions according to different videos.|$|R

40|$|Status of Stock: During 2013, the {{sea scallop}} stock was not overfished and {{overfishing}} was not occurring. Estimated biomass (40 + mm SH) was 132. 561 thousand mt meats (<b>Figure</b> <b>B</b> 1). Using the new recommended reference points, biomass was {{well above the}} BTARGET=BMSY = 96. 480 thousand mt meats, and the BTHRESHOLD=BMSY= 48. 240 thousand mt meats. The probability that the stock was overfished in 2013 is near zero based on the new SARC- 59 reference points (<b>Figure</b> <b>B</b> 8). Compared with reference points from the previous assessment (NEFSC 2010), biomass during 2013 was also above that earlier BTARGET=BMSY = 125. 358 thousand mt meats, and the BTHRESHOLD=BMSY= 62. 679 thousand mt meats. Past assessments have overestimated biomass, in particular when strong recruitment year classes have entered the population, and may continue to do so. The estimated fishing mortality rate during 2013 was F= 0. 32 (<b>Figure</b> <b>B</b> 2). Based on the new SARC- 59 overfishing threshold reference point FMSY= 0. 48, overfishing was not occurring in 2013. The probability that overfishing occurred during 2013 was about 13 % based on the recommended reference points (<b>Figure</b> <b>B</b> 8).
