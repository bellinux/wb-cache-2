5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi {{lost control of the}} rear end of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear end leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E

40|$|Interdependency among udder {{quarters}} with {{subclinical mastitis}} was evaluated on 150 farms using {{a total of}} 35, 828 udder quarters. The occurrence of high somatic cell count (SCC) (> 250, 000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred {{at a higher rate}} than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. For all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. Intramammary infection and high SCC were found less often in <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> than in rear quarters. High SCC and intramammary infection occurred more often in right <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> than in left <b>front</b> <b>quarters.</b> High SCC in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. Streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. The intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of SCC was 0. 47. Corynebacterium bovis and Strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. Analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.

25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and indicator lights on the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> panels.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} highly popular, {{due to the}} {{previous}} year's improvements, {{as well as the}} new four bolt 15" [...] with newly designed flat hubcaps, which replaced the original [...] "bowl type" [...] covers. The fuel filler neck was moved from inside the trunk to the right <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> panel, just above the fender. Inside, a matte black padded dashboard was introduced, resulting in greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.|$|E

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} was to study the effect of somatic cell count on mineral content and salt equilibria at the level of quarter milk samples. Ten Italian Friesian cows, in which two homologous <b>quarters</b> (<b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> in 1 cow, rear quarters in 6 cows and both rear and <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> in 3 cows) were characterised by a milk SCC 400, 000 cells/mL (HC-milk), respectively, were selected. Cows were milked at quarter level during the morning milking and a single sample was collected from each selected quarter, thus, 26 quarter milk samples were collected. Compared to LC-milk, HC-milk was characterised by a lower content of phosphorus and potassium and by a higher content of both sodium and chloride. The equilibrium of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium between the colloidal and soluble phase of milk and the mineralisation degree of the casein micelles, were not different between HC and LC milk...|$|R

40|$|Forty-eight Holstein cows were {{assessed}} using infrared thermography as non-invasive diagnostic tool for subclinical mastitis detection. The temperature analysis of animals negative in the California Mastitis Test has evidenced {{a difference between}} the mean temperatures in the <b>front</b> and rear <b>quarters</b> (p= 0. 001). The infrared thermography comparison between the rear quarters of animals positive and negative in the California Mastitis Test has not shown any difference (p= 0. 236), but the comparison of results of the <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> has shown difference between the mean temperature of the infrared thermography of positive (32. 35 ºC ± 2. 35) and negative CMTs (31. 00 ºC ± 2. 20 (p= 0. 025).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and analyze effects of parity, stage of lactation, milkability (3 groups of cows with differing peak flow rates), time of milking, and quarter position on milk production and milk flow measures at udder and quarter levels. Particular emphasis was put on changes to the decline phase and in duration of overmilking. More than 75, 800 quarter milk flow curves and more than 19, 300 udder milk flow curves obtained from 38 cows throughout lactation were analyzed. Stage of lactation significantly influenced all studied variables at both udder and quarter levels. At the quarter level, the duration of decline phase and the decline ratio (decline phase as a percentage of milking time) decreased from mo 1 to 2 and then gradually increased as lactation advanced. In contrast, at the udder level, duration of decline phase decreased throughout lactation but beginning at mo 2, the decline ratio increased as lactation advanced. The duration of the overmilking phase of quarters increased from mo 1 to 3 and then decreased in the course of lactation. Parity did not influence peak and average flow rates, the duration of increase phase, or the decline ratio at either udder or quarter levels. All milk flow measures were higher during morning milking except the duration of increase and decline phases at the quarter level and the duration of increase phase at the udder level. Milk yield and the duration of increase phase were not affected by milkability at either level. Quarters from udders with high milkability had longest duration of decline phase and the shortest overmilking phase. Milkability did not influence duration of the decline phase at the udder level. Quarter position influenced all measured variables of milk yield and milk flow. Rear quarters had significantly higher milk yield, longer time of milking, higher peak, and higher average flow rates than <b>front</b> <b>quarters.</b> <b>Front</b> <b>quarters</b> had shorter duration of increase and decline phases than rear quarters. The duration of the overmilking phase was almost double for <b>front</b> <b>quarters.</b> There were also differences in measured flow rates between left or right <b>quarters</b> on respective <b>front</b> or rear positions. Measured characteristics reported in this study may be important in setting default parameters in automated milking systems...|$|R

5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except <b>front</b> <b>quarters)</b> from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|R

50|$|In {{spite of}} the Christian {{inscription}} on the Projecta Casket, the iconography of the figurative decoration of the treasure is purely pagan, a common mixture in Roman metalwork from the period to about 350, when Early Christian art had not yet devised iconography for essentially secular decoration. Three sides of the Projecta Casket's lid are decorated with pagan mythological motifs - these include the deity Venus on a cockleshell, nereids (sea-nymphs) riding a ketos (a dragon-like sea monster) and a hippocamp (a monster with the <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> of a horse and {{the tail of a}} fish). The mixture of Christian and pagan inscriptions and symbols may have been a compromise reflecting the affiliations of the bride and groom's families, described in the previous section.|$|R
