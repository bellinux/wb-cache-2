For this very reason, existing tools for information work support often focus on support for the organization of information objects, but neglect the work process perspective.

Most previous research related to scheduling and resource allocation assumes that allocated resources remain consistent throughout the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> packages. This paper presents a workface planning system that allows for variable resource allocation and variable durations in <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> a <b>work</b> package, while holding logic relationships and space congestion constraints.
