40|$|On {{the base}} of {{laboratory}} results and telescopic data it is shown that the spectropolarization ratio P(sub max(sup B)) /P(sub max(sup R)) for blue and red spectral regions is a remote sensing parameter of lunar soil maturity. It correlates with value of maturity index derived from morphological or ferromagnetic methods of exposure age determination. This parameter is equal to 0. 315 for Reiner-gamma formation. So Reiner-gamma area is covered by <b>immature</b> <b>soil.</b> An extensive spectral mapping of the Reiner-gamma formation with high spatial resolution (0. 2 km/pixel) was produced. This result was obtained at the 2 -meter aperture telescope of Pic-du-Midi (France). The data sets consist in repeated runs comprising 10 selected narrow-band images (from 0. 4 to 1. 05 micron). The analysis of these data suggests that such a type of immature material includes not more than 28 % of agglutinattes. We find the model grain size of fine fraction to be 40 micrometers grain size, of more <b>immature</b> <b>soil</b> 400 - 500 micrometers, and of the formation soil 120 - 150 micrometers.

The objectives of this paper were (i) to investigate native major and trace elements of the <b>immature</b> <b>soils</b> in the Kekexili region in the Plateau; (ii) to evaluate the bioavailability of selected trace elements in the soils; (iii) {{to better understand the}} factors affecting accumulation and depletion of the elements and their bioavailability over a long history of alto-cryic pedogenesis. Cambosols and Aridosols are dominant soil types in this region while Gleyosols and Primosols are minor types. These coarse-textured soils have high soil pH and free carbonate content. The soil profile often developed a mattic or humic epipedon with high organic matter content in the topsoil. The contents of Ca, Mg, Na, and Sr in the Kekexili soils were significantly higher than the average values of Chinese soils, and also the world average, while the contents of Fe, Al, Ti, Mn, P, Co, Cr, and Ba in the former soils lower than those in the latter soils. The accumulation or depletion of elements was mainly dependent on soil carbonate content. The bioavailability of Fe, Zn, and Mn was positively related to the levels of organic matter in the surface soil.

It can be argued that the low soil respiration rates in the low parts of the slope in the evergreen forest resulted from soil properties and not from wet soil conditions.

The results were as follows. First, soil respiration had clear seasonal patterns, and significant differences existed between the control (CK) and nitrogen addition (ND) treatments (P = 0. 004). Second, soil respiration was more sensitive to soil temperature (R- 2 = 0. 988, ND; R- 2 = 0. 05, CK) than soil moisture (R- 2 = 0. 0003, ND; R- 2 = 0. 038, CK), and the relationship between soil temperature and soil respiration in ND treatment was more significant than that in CK. Third, the relationships between soil chemical properties and root biomass in CK were greater than that in ND plots, especially the relationship of root biomass with the available nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen.

Four mixed plant communities dominated by species such as: Tamarix nilotica in coastal sabkha, Saliconrnia qassimensis in coastal sand dunes, Aerva lanata in sand plains, and Bassia muricata in wadis areas were recognized. Soil types at the study area were determined to be sandy <b>immature</b> <b>soil</b> and peat lamina soil. Their horizon sequences were described as surface, subsurface and bottom layers, indicating layers of leaf litter, peat lamina and parent material, respectively. Coastal sabkha and coastal sand dunes were characterized by a relatively high calcium concentration in the soil horizons and tendency for podzolization in the volcanic deposit layer. The subsurface layers in coastal sabkha and coastal sand dunes were characterized by some peat lamina accumulation because of the high groundwater table, volcanic deposits in the soil profile and the strong influence of sea salt on the soil chemistry. The roots in the coastal sabkha and coastal sand dunes were distributed more shallowly than those in the sand plains and wadi areas, thus avoiding the high water table level as well as the influence of seawater in the soil.

Electron beam studies of space weathering have focused on space weathering effects on individual glasses and minerals from the finest size fractions of lunar soils [1] and patinas on lunar rocks [2]. We are beginning a new study of space weathering of intermediate-size individual mineral grains from lunar soils. For this initial work, we chose an <b>immature</b> <b>soil</b> (see below) in order to maximize the probability that some individual grains are relatively unweathered. The likelihood of identifying a range of relatively unweathered grains in a mature soil is low, and we plan to study grains ranging from pristine to highly weathered {{in order to determine the}} progression of space weathering.

These studies are being done concurrently with our studies of patinas on larger lunar rocks [e. g., 3]. One of our major goals is to correlate the evidence for space weathering observed in studies of the surfaces of samples with the evidence demonstrated at higher resolution (TEM) using cross-sections of samples.

Large uncertainty in paleo-CO 2 estimates made using the paleosol-carbonate CO 2 -barom-eter, however, arises primarily from their sensitivity to soil-respired CO 2 (S(z)). This parameter is poorly constrained due to a paucity of soil CO 2 measurements during carbonate formation in modern soils and a lack of widely applicable proxies of paleo-soil CO 2. Here the d 13 C values of carbonate and soil organic matter (SOM) pairs from 130 Holocene soils are applied to a two-component CO 2 -mixing equation to define soil order-specific ranges of soil CO 2 applicable for constraining S(z) in their corresponding paleosol analogs. Equilibrium carbonate–SOM pairs, characterized by D 13 Ccarb–SOM values of 12. 2 – 15. 8 &, define a mean effective fraction-ation of 14. 1 & and overall inferred total soil CO 2 contents during calcite formation of < 1000 – 10, 000 ppmv.

We measured net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification using in situ incubation both on lower and upper slope positions along three slopes in Kagoshima University Takakuma Experimental Forest located on Osumi Peninsula, southern Kyushu, Japan. The soils of the site are Volcanogenous Regosols derived from the recent eruption of the volcano, Mt. Sakurajima, in 1914. Many previous studies on black soils and brown forest soils reported that nitrogen mineralization and nitrification were different between upper and lower slope positions. However, at this study site, there were no significant differences in nitrogen mineralization between upper and lower slope positions. Soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation, soil carbon to nitrogen ratio and soil pH were significantly different between upper and lower slope positions, however the differences might be not large enough to make differences in soil nitrogen mineralization patterns. As soil formation proceeded, differences in the environmental conditions such as soil water content among slope positions may affect soil-plant interactions including nutrient uptake of forest trees, decomposition processes, organic matter accumulation pattern, composition of soil fauna and microbes, which may eventually make differences in nitrogen mineralization patterns along a slope. However, in <b>immature</b> <b>soils</b> like our study site, there were no significant differences in nitrogen mineralization patterns among slope positions probably due the early stage of soil formation.

At major distance (40. 5 km), soils present little evidence of mine waste in the profile, with sulfidic minerals in the surface horizon and an abrupt textural change between the upper and lower part of the soil profile, which shows features typical of Alfisols. Therefore, these soils could be classified as Spolic Rhodoxeralfs or as Spolic Xerorthent over Typic Rhodoxeralf. Most of the conterminous soils, not influenced by mine spoils, present features typical of the ‘‘terra rossa’’ (Typic Rhodoxeralfs). Data indicate that current pedogenic processes of mine spoils were driven by the nature and properties of the new parent material (mineralogy, chemistry, grain size, porosity), and that the rate of soil development was mainly governed by inherited factors of parental material.

A TiO 2 abundance map was constructed for the entire near-side lunar maria accurate to + or - 2 wt percent TiO 2 using CCD images obtained at the Tumamoc Hill 0. 5 m telescope in Tucson, employing bandpass filters centered at 400 and 560 nm. Highest TiO 2 regions in the maria are located in western Mare Tranquillitatis. Greater contrast differences between regions on the lunar surface can be obtained using 400 / 730 nm ratio images. The relation might well be refined to accommodate this possibly more sensitive indicator of TiO 2 content. Another potential lunar resource is solar wind-implanted He- 3 which {{may be used as}} a fuel for fusion reactors. Relative soil maturity, as determined by agglutinate content, can be estimated from 950 / 560 nm ration images. <b>Immature</b> <b>soils</b> appear darker in this ratio since such soils contain abundant pyroxene grains which cause strong absorption centered near 950 nm due Fe(2 +) crystal field transitions. A positive correlation exists between the amount of He- 3 and TiO 2 content in lunar soils, suggesting that regions high in TiO 2 should also be high in He- 3. Reflectance spectrophotometry in the region 320 to 870 nm was also obtained for several regions. Below about 340 nm, these spectra show variations in relative reflectance that are caused by as yet unassigned near-UV absorptions due to compositional differences...|$|R
40|$|The {{depth of}} the {{absorption}} feature near 1 micron in the reflectance spectra of <b>immature</b> lunar <b>soils</b> is determined primarily {{by the amount of}} pyroxene present in the soil. As a soil matures, the agglutinitic glass content increases and the Fe(2 +) glass band dominates the absorption feature. An empirical relationship between the 1 micron band depth and the percentage of magnetic agglutinates, and hence maturity, is demonstrated for mature highland soils of a given composition. A similar variation of 1 micron band depth is observed in the telescopic spectra of lunar highland craters and is positively correlated with the surface maturity as determined by the small-impact erosion model of Soderblom (1970). Knowledge of both maturity and the 1 micron band depth of a lunar surface feature allows compositional information to be derived...|$|R
40|$|Characteristic neon isotopic ratios, {{produced}} due to solar cosmic ray spallation (SCR) in lunar soils, {{are useful}} in deciphering and estimating the relative contributions of SCR and GCR spallation. To delineate these features, etched mineral grains from mature and <b>immature</b> lunar <b>soils</b> (14148 and 61221 respectively) were analyzed using mass spectrometry. The SF-Ne composition deduced in this work agrees with that obtained from earlier etched lunar pyroxene studies. The data points for mature soil 14148 define a line which significantly deviates from the 61221 tie line. This deviation is attributed {{to the presence of}} SCR spallation component. In this context, neon isotopic compositions (step-wise heating) in Pantar and Leighton dark portions were studied and compared with that of Fayetteville. The meteorite data points deviate significantly from the tie line joining SF-Ne and GCR (pyroxene) end points. This deviation is attributed to SCR-spallation in gas-rich chondrites...|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} recent (< 1 b. y.) flux of asteroids and comets forming large craters on the Earth and Moon may be accurately recorded by craters with bright rays on the Moon's farside. Many previously unknown farside rayed craters are clearly distinguished in the low-phase-angle images returned by the Clementine spacecraft. Some large rayed craters on the lunar nearside are probably significantly older than 1 Ga; rays remain visible over the maria due to compositional contrasts long after soils have reached optical maturity. Most of the farside crust {{has a more}} homogeneous composition and only immature rays are visible. The size-frequency distribution of farside rayed craters {{is similar to that}} measured for Eratosthenian craters (up to 3. 2 b. y.) at diameters larger than 15 km. The areal density of farside rayed craters matches that of a corrected tabulation of nearside Copernican craters. Hence the presence of bright rays due to <b>immature</b> <b>soils</b> around large craters provides a consistent time-stratigraphic basis for defining the base of the Copernican System. The density of large craters less than approximately 3. 2 b. y. old is approximately 3. 2 times higher than that of large farside rayed craters alone. This observation can be interpreted in two ways: (1) the average cratering rate has been constant over the past 3. 2 b. y. and the base of the Copernican is approximately 1 Ga, or (2) the cratering rate has increased in recent geologic time and the base of the Copernican is less than 1 Ga. We favor the latter interpretation because the rays of Copernicus (800 - 850 m. y. old) appear to be very close to optical maturity, suggesting that the average Copernican cratering rate was approximately 35 % higher than the average Eratosthenian rate. Other lines of evidence for an increase in the Phanerozoic (545 Ga) cratering rate are (1) the densities of small craters superimposed on Copernicus and Apollo landing sites, (2) the rates estimated from well-dated terrestrial craters (< 120 m. y.) and from present-day astronomical observations, and (3) the Proterozoic rate suggested by the crater record of Australia. The hypothesis most consistent with several key observations is that the cratering rate has increased by approximately 2 x during the past approximately 300 m. y. ...|$|R
40|$|Pyroxene and {{plagioclase}} mixtures' spectral {{characteristics are}} investigated {{with a view}} to particle size and mineral proportion effects in the cases of variously proportioned labradorite/enstatite compositional mixtures. The amount of plagioclase that will allow its band to be observed in discrete absorption is particle size-dependent; plagioclase is detectable in the flattening of the pyroxene reflectance peak that lies between the 0. 9 and 1. 9 micron absorption bands, if sufficient plagioclase is present. Attention is given to the combined effects of mineral proportions and particle size for plagioclase/pyroxene mixtures in the case of analogs of mature and <b>immature</b> lunar highland <b>soils...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mature surface fines have an {{equilibrium}} {{specific surface}} area of about 0. 6 sq m/g the equivalent mean particle size being about 3 microns. The adsorption behavior of inert gases (reversible isotherms) indicates that the particles are also nonporous in the size range of pores from 10 to 3000 A. Apparently, in mature soils there is a balance in the forces which cause fining, attrition, pore filling, and growth of lunar dust grains. <b>Immature,</b> lightly irradiated <b>soils</b> usually have coarser grains which reduce in size as aging proceeds. The specific surface area, determined by nitrogen or krypton sorption at 77 K, is a valuable index of soil maturity...|$|R
40|$|Attention is {{centered}} on the nature and intensity of geochemical fractionation accompanying agglutination of several size fractions of the <b>immature</b> Apollo- 16 <b>soil</b> sample 67460, from North Ray Crater. The soil features coarse mean grain size about 150 microns, low (20 wt. %) magnetic agglutinate content, and a bimodal grain size distribution. The magnetic fraction included both agglutinates and magnetic non-agglutinates (glass-free microbreccias with 30 - 60 micron native FeNi grains hosted in a matrix of pyroxene, ilmenite, and olivine). The separation process residue contained nonmagnetic agglutinates with compositions near pure plagioclase. The magnetic agglutinate fraction appears selectively enriched in ferromagnesian elements to the partial exclusion of plagioclase elements. Agglutinate glass chemistry based solely on magnetic separation is deprecated {{on the basis of}} the results...|$|R
