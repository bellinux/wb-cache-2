Coresidence is an appealing arrangement for both parents and children when both are economically disadvantaged. For parents, especially those who are widowed or who lack their own independent and stable income, coresidence with their children is often the only choice in order to maintain a normal life. As for the children, when they are too economically constrained to provide old-age support to their parents in other ways such as sending cash or <b>in-kind</b> <b>gifts,</b> coresidence not only is the most cost-effective way for them to provide old age support but also enables them to obtain some help in housework and childcare from their parents if their physical condition permits.

If they are in need of support for household chores or personal care, both older parents and adult children of higher socioeconomic status can afford to purchase such services from the market as a substitute for the benefits they might receive from coresidence.|$|R

We find that the majority (83 %) of recipients spends the certicates {{in the same way}} as cash. The other respondents (17 %) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80 % of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow racketing: In spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the ceriticate. Previous studies have found that both giving <b>in-kind</b> <b>gifts</b> (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Oenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10 - 30 percent when compared to giving cash.

The aims of this research project were a) to characterise DD processes in Tanzania, b) to explore the practice and perception of Tanzanian stakeholders involved in DD processes, c) to identify similarities and discrepancies between the views of Tanzanian recipients and Swiss donors and d) to develop suggestions for optimising DD processes. The project methodology employed a participatory stakeholder analysis, a triangulation of methods and qualitative research tools. The following stepwise strategy enabled {{an analysis of the}} entire DD system: a) literature review and document analysis for description of the context, b) a postal, self-administered, semi-quantitative questionnaire in Tanzania and in Switzerland for defining problems in DD processes, c) key informant interviews in which the interviewees could reflect on the results of the Tanzanian questionnaire survey within the context of public health issues and d) a workshop for elaborating practical solutions for the optimisation of DD processes in Tanzania. Data were collected from January 2000 to October 2002. Tanzania has to bridge a 30 % gap in drug supply. This study found that the acceptance of DDs to fill this gap was high. Stakeholders within the country understood that donated drugs were necessary because, due to poverty, drugs were either unavailable or not affordable. The prime concern of DD recipients was the discrepancy between their needs and the donors’ supply. DDs did not cover recipients' priority needs and their quantity was insufficient for sustainable treatment of patients. DDs given from a surplus, as gifts from individuals or as single-source DDs were perceived as problematic. However, DDs provided within the framework of DD programmes with a known public health effect were welcomed. Tanzania benefits from many such programmes. Tanzania has developed the instruments for an effective regulation of DD processes: national guidelines for drug donations and a national essential drug list. The existence of these tools, however, has not guaranteed their application. The failure to implement the guidelines for DDs was perceived as being the second most important problem in the Tanzanian DD process. Knowledge of the value of DDs is prerequisite for judging the economic impact of DDs on the drug supply, but only 27 % of recipients were able to estimate the value of donated drugs. Stakeholders pointed out, however, that estimating drug value is difficult when the drugs do not conform to accepted quality standards. This finding demonstrates the need for improved data registration, collection and dissemination within Tanzania. With respect to value, for these stakeholders, DD-related transaction costs must also be taken into consideration. Depending on the form of their involvement, recipients identified additional drawbacks associated with DDs, the focus being on structures and processes. The public sector requested more transparency in DD processes, the lack of transparency arising from weaknesses in public structures as well as a lack of information and accountability. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and religious facilities with better developed structures addressed problems such as shipment fees and insufficient infrastructure and training. These differences call for more collaboration between the private and public sectors and suggest that they could learn from each other, as recommended in the Tanzanian Health Sector Reform. Communication is crucial in the eyes of stakeholders, but was not optimal, whether between donors and recipients or among recipients themselves. An important complaint was that donors did not ask what was needed in advance and supported a supply-driven donation process. Tanzanian recipients and Swiss donors coincided in the view that the absence of sustainability and nonrelevance of donated drugs for local needs were the major problems in DD processes. Knowledge about donors’ needs was low among Swiss donor organisations. Only one-third of Swiss stakeholders knew the WHO guidelines for DDs. Both the Swiss and the Tanzanian stakeholders rated the quality of DDs as a problem of minor importance. However, donated drugs often did not comply with requested standards, even less so in Switzerland than in Tanzania. Because this study reflects the situation in 2001, directly after NGOs and PVOs stopped collecting unused drugs in Switzerland, donors in the for-profit sector did not understand that unused drugs should no longer be donated and failed to recognise that these drugs can burden a recipient. In the eyes of Tanzanian stakeholders unused DDs are obsolete. Suggestions of Tanzanian stakeholders to optimise DD processes were consistent with the core principles of the WHO guidelines for DDs: a) meeting local needs (maximum benefit for the recipients), b) participatory approach (respecting the wishes of the recipient), c) optimised DD quality (no double standard in quality) and d) effective communication between donor and recipient. The findings of this project contribute to a comprehensive understanding of DD processes in Tanzania. They show that the performance of a health system has a major impact on the quality of DD processes. Recipients in DD processes need the support that should be provided by the Tanzanian heath sector reform plans, which include continuing education of health workers and a better defined responsibility in the pharmaceutical sector to overcome problems with the structure and management of DD processes. In addition to improved implementation of DD guidelines by both donors and recipients, the main proposals arising from this project are the following: Donors should actively communicate with recipients and thereby promote a demand-driven DD process that respects Tanzanian regulations. Recipients on the other hand should a) translate the guidelines for DDs into Swahili, b) assure systematic collection of data, c) strengthen the collaboration between the public and the private sectors and d) establish an autonomous, centralised body for coordination of DDs. These findings also call for further research, which might study in more depth drug donations given within the framework of programmes, explore the means for better implementation of guidelines for DDs and investigate the mechanisms of communication between donors and recipients together with how these might be improved...|$|R

Voters in Michigan and other states found otherwise and the Court in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 572 U. S. — (2014) upheld their right to ban race-conscious admissions. Paradoxically, since the use of race as a “plus factor” by selective universities to admit a few underrepresented minority applicants makes possible a diverse learning environment that benefits all students on campus, the beneficiaries should far outnumber and outvote the few applicants who are displaced. But because those actually burdened are not known, the number of imagined victims is easily inflated in the mind of electorate. In highlighting this and other shortcomings of the Grutter regime, this article proposes that if the benefits of diversity outweigh the burdens, the universities should be able to demonstrate this favorable cost-benefit ratio by accommodating the real burden-bearers. Accommodation could {{come in the form of}} direct compensation for the displaced students or indirect burden-shifting – getting others to give up their seats. Shifting the burden to those who are more willing to bear it can lower the cost of settlement. <b>In-kind</b> benefits and <b>gifts</b> could be used instead of monetary compensation. Addressing the displacement burden would reduce much of the grievances against racial preferences in admissions, and reveal to the public how little affirmative action affects the vast majority of applicants. Of course, it would impose costs on the university, but the willingness of universities to take on these costs also demonstrates their commitment to the benefits of diversity. A skeptical Court in Fisher v. University of Texas, 570 U. S. —- (2013) remanded for lower courts to determine whether race-conscious admissions are still necessary when the university was already achieving on-campus diversity through race-neutral means. Accommodation could provide a convincing showing that the extra benefits from using the race-plus factor are indeed worth the costs. Lastly, accommodation would give universities a much stronger incentive to address the academic achievement gap across racial groups, which makes affirmative action necessary in the first place. Grutter permits the use of race in admissions for 25 years to eliminate this gap. But scant evidence of progress over the past decade raises concerns that the universities are perpetuating the gap by holding students of different racial groups to different standards. If accommodation is required, universities would find it in their interest to encourage those minority students who could be accepted with the help of the race-plus factor to improve their academic credentials further so they could be admitted without triggering the need to accommodate a displaced applicant. Only then will the gap start to narrow and lead to the realization of Grutter’s goal – achieving diversity without resorting to race-conscious means...|$|R
