The experiment was conducted in cylindrical plastic boxes (3 -cm diameter and 5 -cm height) which were filled with 15 -g autoclaved sandy soil. Based on preliminary experiments, range of the appropriate nematode concentration which causes approximately 20 to 80 % mortality was determined. Then, different nematode concentrations (i.e., 10, 20, 45, 95, and 200 infective juveniles (IJs) per larva) were added on {{to the surface of}} the wetted soil. In brief, 0.5  ml of distilled water was added to the soil; then, the nematode concentration was added in 1 -ml distilled water. One prepupa of H. armigera was placed on the soil, and the boxes were covered with ventilated lids to avoid <b>desiccation.</b> <b>Control</b> boxes received 1.5 -ml distilled water without nematode.

40|$|In {{the range}} of the water {{contents}} studied (0. 1 - 0. 4 g H 2 O g/dw), #Coffea arabica$ seeds were less sensitive to desiccation than #C. costatifructa$, #C. racemosa$ and #C. sessiliflora$ seeds. At 0. 20 g H 2 O g/dw, 53 % of #C. arabica$ seeds germined after direct immersion in LN (rapid cooling, 200 °C/min), but none of them developed into normal seedlings. By contrast, in #C. costatifructa$, #C. racemosa$ and #C. sessiliflora$, when seeds were dehydrated to the optimal water content (0. 19, 0. 28 and 0. 31 g H 2 O g/dw, respectively), the percentages of seeds which developed into normal seedlings after LN exposure were 26, 78 and 31 % of the <b>desiccation</b> <b>control,</b> respectively. Normal seedlings could be recovered from cryopreserved #C. arabica$ seeds only if they were desiccated to 0. 20 g H 2 O g/dw and precooled slowly to - 50 °C prior to immersion in LN. Precooling seeds at 2 °C/min allowed 25 % of seeds to develop into normal seedlings. The thawing rate had no effect on the survival of cryopreserved #C. arabica$ seeds. In all cryopreservation experiments, the total germination did not reflect the percentage of seeds which developed into normal seedlings. Examination of excised embryos indicated a partial explanation of this difference since only the shoot apex was destroyed in abnormal embryos, whereas the hypocotyl and radicle were normal.

40|$|Many {{laboratory}} speciation {{experiments have}} raised allopatric populations in different environments {{to determine whether}} reproductive isolation evolves as a by-product of adaptation. Few, however, have controlled {{for the effects of}} genetic drift, addressed the evolution of both pre- and postmating isolation, or investigated the conditions that promote or hamper the process. I present results of a long-term evolution experiment in which 12 replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster independently evolved for more than 57 generations under alternative <b>desiccation</b> treatments (six <b>control</b> and six desiccation-selected populations). Specifically, I demonstrate the divergence between the <b>desiccation</b> and <b>control</b> populations of cuticular hydrocarbons, key traits that have been implicated in mate choice and sexual isolation in Drosophila. Despite this divergence, there was no detectable pre- or postmating isolation between the <b>desiccation</b> and <b>control</b> populations. Novel environments are generally thought to promote the evolution of reproductive isolation. Understanding the conditions that favour or hamper this remains a key challenge for speciation research...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{report that}} leaf tensile {{strength}} (TS) of the desiccation tolerant (resurrection) grass Eragrostis nindensis {{does not change}} on drying, but increases in dried desiccation sensitive Eragrostis species. In this paper we tested whether unchanging TS on dehydration is a common feature among 4 resurrection species, Craterostigma wilmsii, Sporobolus stapfianus, Xerophyta humilis and Xerophyta schlecteri, and how this might relate to leaf structure and mechanisms of protection against mechanical stress of drying. <b>Desiccation</b> sensitive <b>controls</b> were Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana. Light and transmission electron microscopy of leaves was performed to determine lignification {{and the nature of}} subcellular mechanical stabilization. There was a positive correlation between % lignin/unit cross-sectional area and TS of hydrated leaves. Only the grass, S. stapfianus, did not change TS when naturally dried. All others increased in TS when naturally dried, but there was variation among them when flash dried. In S. stapfianus, mechanical stabilization was by both wall folding (mesophyll) and vacuole packaging (bundle sheath) as reported for E. nindensis. This combination may account, in part, for unchanging TS during drying and may be a feature of resurrection grasses. We conclude that leaf tensile properties differ among resurrection plants and are not necessarily affected by protection mechanisms associated with mechanical stress...|$|R
30|$|The {{experiments}} show, {{that both}} temperature and light intensity {{have an effect}} on chlorophyll a and carotenoid content. Especially in N. muscorum a temperature rise of 13 °C (from 17 °C to 30 °C) led to an increase of 46 % of chlorophyll a and 39 % of carotenoids. Interestingly, Leptolyngbya spec. shows a contrary effect. Chlorophyll a and carotenoids decrease by 86 % and 68 % respectively. This is due to the fact, that both organisms have different growth optima based on temperature. They can tolerate extreme temperatures [16] and have different mechanisms to <b>control</b> <b>desiccation</b> [17], but in the reported experiments they were cultivated at constant temperatures with sufficient water available to keep their metabolism active. This was done because according to first experiments their growth optima are considered to be between 20 °C and 35 °C.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} better the physiological adaption of creosotebush (Larrea divaricata Cav.) to drought conditions, its carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism after a 7 -day <b>desiccation</b> period under <b>controlled</b> conditions were studied. Although fructose was not significantly altered in the leaves of desiccated plants, as compared to those maintained under normal moisture conditions, both glucose and sucrose were significantly reduced. Total amino acids more than doubled under moisture stress, the increase being predominantly due to proline, phenylalanine, and glutamic acid. Significant increases also occurred in alanine, arginine, histidine, isoleucine, and valine. Increases or decreases in other amino acids were not significant. These stress-induced changes in certain amino acids are considered in relationship to protein hydrolysis, to accumulation of nitrogen degradation products translocated from the roots, and to the possible function of specific amino acids (e. g., proline) in NH 3 + storage...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion Induced Phase Separation (DIPS) is a {{currently}} used technique to produce porous membranes {{for a large}} variety of applications. A strong limitation {{is represented by the}} occurrence of a dense skin, which is formed during the process, highly reducing the membrane permeability. To overcome this issue, two modifications of the standard DIPS protocol were investigated: the use of coagulation baths composed by a solvent/nonsolvent mixture and the <b>desiccation</b> in a <b>controlled</b> environment, by modulating the partial pressure of nonsolvent vapor. An appropriate choice of coagulation bath composition, together with an appropriate desiccation protocol (i. e., the use of a nonsolvent vapor), will produce a skinless membrane, and offers the chance to control the morphology of both membrane surfaces. These results underline the importance of post-treatment stage in membrane preparation via phase separation, thus suggesting that membrane washing/drying stage will affect the final morphology...|$|R

The experiment was conducted under field conditions at Sinop-MT, during the 2013 / 2014 crop season, in a randomized complete blocks design with factorial scheme and four replications. The following parameter were evaluated: dry matter of cover crops and ground coverage rate, control of volunteer RR® corn present {{at the time of}} desiccation, dry matter, height and intoxication level on soybean plants caused by herbicides at 7, 14 and 28 days after emergence (DAE), control of volunteer RR® corn derived from emergence fluxes subsequent to desiccation management and soybean yield. The joint application of (glyphosate + haloxyfop-R) provided the best level of volunteer RR® corn control present at the time of <b>desiccation.</b> Satisfactory <b>control</b> (80 %) of volunteer corn was obtained with the application of (glyphosate + imazethapyr). This treatment displayed an additional residual effect of imazethapyr, which efficiently controled volunteer RR® corn derived from fluxes subsequent to desiccation management, especially in treatments performed under U. ruziziensis straw. None of the herbicides used in desiccation management caused any significant effect on dry matter, height and phytotoxicity of soybean plants at 7, 14 and 28 DAE nor on grain yield...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{development}} in canola (Brassica napus) following a mild nonlethal freeze was examined {{with respect to}} abscisic acid (ABA) levels, desiccation, and expression of LEA. 76 and isocitrate lyase (ICL) transcripts. Plants with seed of 70 and 55 % moisture contents were frozen to − 5 °C for 3 hours, and seed development followed after thawing. In addition, similar processes were compared during induction of extreme desiccation tolerance by application of ABA in Brassica microspore-derived haploid embryos in culture. A mild freeze/thaw caused a premature switch in seed developmental direction from predesiccation to desiccation as indicated by an immediate and accelerated loss of seed moisture to levels similar to the mature seed in 7 instead of 35 days, and by elevated ABA levels and induction of low levels of LEA. 76 and ICL transcripts. Similarly, addition of ABA to haploid embryos in culture resulted in the induction of desiccation tolerance {{and low levels of}} late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) but not ICL transcripts. In contrast, normal seed development and desiccation of ABA-treated (desiccation-tolerant) embryos resulted in the induction of ICL and very high levels of LEA. 76 transcripts. Similarly, <b>desiccation</b> of <b>control</b> (desiccation-sensitive) embryos resulted in very high levels of LEA. 76 transcripts. These results indicate that although LEA-type proteins have been implicated in the development of desiccation tolerance, high transcript levels of LEA. 76 were not observed in the induction of desiccation tolerance either by a hastening of the maturation process in the developing Brassica seed, or by the exogenous application of ABA to Brassica haploid embryos in culture...|$|R
40|$|ASS'tRACT: Casts of {{shrinkage}} cracks {{found within}} sedimentary sequence are frequently cited as being diagnostic of depositional environments periodically subjected to subaerial exposure. The term shrinkage cracks, however, encompasses a broad suite of sedimentary structures having various origins. Shrinkage cracks can form {{not only at}} the sediment-air interface by desiccation processes but also at the sediment-water interface or substratally by synaeresis processes. Shrinkage cracks are induced in muddy sediments by variations in the salinity of the depositing medium, sediment compaction, and temperature in the case of some desiccation mudcracks. Crack morphology is influenced by the interplay of numerous factors, such as sedimem composition, bed thickness, and bed surface configuration. Factors <b>controlling</b> <b>desiccation</b> mudcracks also include the rate of initial drying, total exposure time, depth of the groundwater table, and direction of surface drainage. Unfortunately, because of the complex interplay of these factors, no single feature of any shrinkage crack is necessarily useful in differentiating between a desiccation or synaeresis origin. Confidence in interpreting subaerial exposure from shrinkage cracks, therefore, depends on finding other associated sedimentary structures diagnostic of exposure...|$|R
2500|$|Water stress (drought {{and salt}} stress) {{is one of}} the major {{environmental}} problems causing severe losses in agriculture and in nature. Drought tolerance of plants is mediated by several mechanisms that work together, including stabilizing and protecting the plant from damage caused by <b>desiccation</b> and also <b>controlling</b> how much water plants lose through the stomatal pores during drought. A plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is produced in response to drought. A major type of ABA receptor has been identified. Future research is needed to test if these receptors can be used to engineer drought tolerance in plants. The plant hormone ABA causes the stomatal pores to close in response to drought, which reduces plant water loss via transpiration to the atmosphere and allows plants to avoid or slow down water loss during droughts. The use of drought tolerant crop plants would lead to a reduction in crop losses during droughts. [...] Since guard cells control water loss of plants, the investigation on how stomatal opening and closure are regulated could lead to the development of plants with improved avoidance or slowing of desiccation and better water use efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Drosophila melanogaster {{selected}} for resistance to desiccation (no food or water) display slower development {{and a higher}} body mass compared to fed controls due to an extended third larval instar. I hypothesize that desiccation selected D. melanogaster larvae will have a different gene expression profile compared to fed controls. Separate populations of D. melanogaster were subjected to desiccation (no food or water), starvation (no food) until 80 - 85 % mortality, for 75 generations. mRNA from the larval fat body was collected at 88 hours, 96 hours, 112 hours and 120 hours post-hatching. Four replicate samples were used for each condition and time point. Gene expression was measured using two color cDNA microarrays. I analyzed the microarray data using a two-way factorial design ANOVA implemented in R using a significance level of 0. 05 with FDR correction. The FDR adjusted results showed 43 genes differentially expressed for selection condition, 4590 genes for time, and 122 for selection by time (interaction). I then used DAVID 6. 7 to explore which biological pathways are over-represented for these genes. One biological process was shown to be over-represented for the selection genes, 67 for time, and 10 for interaction. These over-represented processes suggest <b>desiccation</b> selected and <b>control</b> populations are indeed developing differently...|$|R
40|$|The major {{programs}} of gene expression during late embryogenesis are the muturation or reserve accumulation program and, after ovule abscission, the postabscission {{program that is}} composed largely of Lea and LeaA mRNAs that probably encode desiccation protectants. There are diverse opinions about the developmental regulators of these programs. Several candidates are evaluated here by measuring, in cultured embryos, the accumulation kinetics of cloned mRNAs specifically expressed in the normal maturation, postabscission, or germination {{programs of}} cotton. Maturation-stage embryos both terminate the maturation program and induce the postabscission program after excision and culture, {{just as they do}} later in the plant after ovule abscission. However, they also induce simultaneously the germination program and are thus different from any normal stage of embryo development or germination. The developmental induction of the postabscission program in culture does not require exogenous abscisic acid, but its expression is enhanced by precocious desiccation or culture on abscisic acid or high osmoticum, probably by an environmentally responsive mechanism that normally operates during germination. Normal <b>desiccation</b> does not <b>control</b> any of these programs because the embryo acquires all of the characteristics of a mature embryo before it desiccates. These and other results suggest regulation of normal embryogenesis by a maternal maturation factor, a postabscission factor, and the postabscission program...|$|R
40|$|As an {{indeterminate}} crop, lentil {{continues its}} vegetative growth after flowering under favourable conditions {{of water and}} nitrogen (N). Such conditions may delay its maturity due to excessive growth. Furthermore, lentil is a leguminous crop; late season N 2 fixation could prolong its growth and maturity. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the role of N supply and diquat application in suppressing post-flowering growth and biomass. Two experiments were designed for two distinct soil zones of Saskatchewan during 2007 and 2008. In the first experiment, different combinations of nitrogen, phosphorus and inoculation were employed to determine their effect on growth, yield, biomass and N accumulation in lentil. In a second experiment, diquat was applied at two rates (lower than recommended) at two post-flowering stages (earlier than end-of-season <b>desiccation)</b> to <b>control</b> lentil growth. In both experiments, post-flowering vegetative growth was greater at Indian Head (IH) compared to Saskatoon (SKA). Regardless of the site features, greater N availability resulted in increased biomass production at both locations. The yield trend was, however, different. At IH, highest yield was obtained with 10 kg N ha- 1 (lowest N applied), while at SKA, yield was not significantly affected by fertility treatments. The hypothesis that greater amounts of N application may reduce post-flowering biomass accumulation by curtailing N 2 fixation is not supported by the data since biomass increased with increasing N application. In addition, both biomass and N accumulation after flowering were not affected significantly by the fertility treatments, showing that post-flowering physiology in lentils is governed more by N 2 fixation instead of N application. The overall lack of response of lentil biomass and N accumulation after flowering to the individual fertility treatments suggested that source and availability of N does not change within plant. Instead, environmental conditions were more likely to influence portioning of biomass and N to seed through remobilization from vegetative parts in mid to late-season reproductive growth. Diquat application successfully suppressed biomass and plant growth at maturity. However, a reduction in biomass was obtained at the cost of yield loss at both sites. This loss in yield was great when diquat was applied at the earlier stage (one WAF) at half rate at both sites. Early application of diquat at low rate at IH reduced biomass by 25 % compared to the control without significantly affecting yield. The same treatment, however, reduced biomass by 45 % at SKA with huge yield loss. The results suggested low rate of diquat application at earlier crop growth stage to avoid yield loss in lentil...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the effect of}} {{desiccation}} and freezing on Russian knapweed,s (Acroptilon repens) root regrowth, two experiments on basis of completely randomized design were conducted in Weed Research Department, Plant Pests and Diseases Research Institute of Tehran in 2003. To examine the effect of desiccation, the first experiment was a factorial arrangement with 4 replications. First factor (A) was <b>desiccation</b> length time (<b>control,</b> 24, 48, 96 and 192 hours), and second factor (B) was desiccation temperatures (5, 15 and 25 ˚C). To examine the effect of freezing, second experiment was also a factorial arrangement with 4 replications. First factor (A) was the freezing length time (control, 24, 48 and 96 hours) and second factor (B) was freezing temperatures (- 1, - 3 and - 5 ˚C). In the effect of desiccation experiment on root regrowth, factors A and B were significant on all of measured characters (water loss percent, shoot numbers, dry weight, leaf number and shoot length). Increasing in temperature and length time of desiccation, leads to low regrowth. The interaction effect (AB) on water loss percent, shoot number and shoot length was significant. Regrowth stopped in 5 ˚C after 96 hours desiccation and in 15 ˚C and 25 ˚C after 24 hours. In freezing experiment, factors (A), (b) and their interaction were significant on all of measured characters (shoot number, leaf number and shoot length). Decreasing in temperature and increasing of freezing length time, leads to low regrowth. Regrowth reduced in - 1 ˚C after 96, 48 and 24 hours respectively. But stopped in - 3 ˚C and - 5 ˚C after 48 and 24 hours freezing, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A small, {{diverse group}} of {{angiosperms}} known as resurrection plants display vegetative desiccation tolerance and can survive loss of up to 95 % of cellular water, a feat only seen in the seeds and pollen of other angiosperms. Xerophyta humilis is a resurrection plant native to Southern Africa {{that has been the}} target of previous transcriptomic and proteomic studies into the mechanisms of plant desiccation tolerance. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the hypothesis that vegetative desiccation tolerance is derived from the networks that <b>control</b> <b>desiccation</b> tolerance in seeds and germinating seedlings in angiosperms, particularly the epigenetically silenced seed maturation genes. Germinating seedlings of X. humilis and the related resurrection plant X. viscosa were found to be VDT from the earliest stages of germination, and exhibited the characteristic vegetative trait of poikilochlorophylly as seen in mature leaves. The X. humilis desiccation transcriptome comprising 76, 768 distinct gene clusters was successfully assembled from sequencing samples at five relative water contents (100 %, 80 %, 60 %, 40 % and 5 %) to identify the networks activated in response to water loss. Desiccation was associated with successive waves of transcription factor induction, as well as widespread down-regulation of histone modification enzymes. Many seed-specific genes, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, seed storage proteins and oleosins, were induced in vegetative tissue. LEA transcripts in particular were highly up-regulated during desiccation, and the large number of distinct LEA transcripts (over 150) suggests possible LEA gene expansion in Xerophyta compared to desiccation-sensitive plants. Components of the PYL/SnRK 2 /ABF ABA-signalling pathway were also induced, although the ABF transcription factors activated in response to desiccation were most similar to those induced by drought in A. thaliana rather than seed maturation. Of the canonical seed master regulators (such as the LEC 1 /ABI 3 /FUS 3 /LEC 2 network and ABI 5) only three ABI 3 transcripts were expressed, all of which encoded proteins lacking the seed motif-binding B 3 -domain. The results of this study suggest that vegetative desiccation tolerance in X. humilis is not associated with re-activation of seed master regulators in vegetative tissue, but may instead involve activation of seed genes by vegetative drought response regulators...|$|R
40|$|Xerophyta viscosa Baker (family Velloziaceae) {{can survive}} {{extremes}} of dehydration (desiccation), down to 5 % relative water content (RWC) and resumes full physiological activity within 80 h of rehydration. A {{thorough understanding of}} this phenomenon may provide further insight into possible mechanisms for improving drought tolerance in other plants. In this respect a comprehensive analysis of the nuclear proteome of this plant and its response to dehydration stress at 35 % RWC was carried out. The RWC at 35 % represents a distinct phase of the dehydration process where induction of late protection mechanisms is initiated and is a characteristic of desiccation tolerant species. We optimized nuclei isolation and nuclear protein extraction protocols and successfully employed these protocols to isolate highly purified nuclei and subsequently nuclear proteins from fully hydrated and dehydrated X. viscosa leaf samples. The integrity of the purified nuclei was confirmed with light and fluorescent microscopy. The nuclei were uniform spheres, approximately 5 Î¼m in size. The purity and enrichment of the nuclear proteins were confirmed by chlorophyll assay and Western blot analysis. The nuclear proteins were investigated using two-dimensional (2 D) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technologies. Using the 2 DE approach, a total of 438 proteins spots were reproducibly detected and analysed of which 18 protein spots were shown to be up-regulated in response to dehydration. These proteins contained both regulatory and functional proteins. The largest category comprised five novel protein factors and two proteins with unassigned functions. The second category comprised proteins involved in gene regulation and signal transduction. The third category comprised stress responsive proteins with chaperone type activities. Other categories include proteins involved in energy metabolism, protein degradation and translation. These results demonstrate that dehydration was controlled by multiple genes within the plant nucleus and X. viscosa may possess its own specific nuclear proteins {{that are involved in}} desiccation stress. In addition we comprehensively analyzed the nuclear proteome of X. viscosa using iTRAQ with two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to complement the data obtained from the 2 DE approach. Using iTRAQ, we reproducibly University of Cape Town identified 128 proteins with confidence ¥ 95 % (Ï < 0. 05). Sixty six percent of the identified proteins showed consistent expression levels. The remaining 34 % proteins showed significant changes in expressions. Of the latter, 23 % were shown to be up regulated in response to dehydration stress. The remaining 11 % were shown to be down regulated. The nuclear proteins of X. viscosa up-regulated in response to dehydration stress showed a coordinated response involving both regulatory and functional proteins and were implicated in diverse cellular functions. The characteristic feature of the X. viscosa nuclear proteins is the high level of stress molecules among the dehydration responsive proteins with evident functions in defense mechanisms compared to down regulated proteins and proteins showing consistent expression levels. These results demonstrate that enhanced defense capacity is crucial to desiccation tolerance and strongly support the notion that late dehydration responsive proteins are involved in protection of the cellular structures during dehydration. Proteins showing consistent expression levels during dehydration most likely maintain the minimum viability in cells under all conditions or may be indirectly associated with desiccation tolerance. Down-regulated proteins are likely important for plant survival under normal growth conditions. The proteins up-regulated in response to dehydration stress were assumed to be associated directly with the acquisition of desiccation tolerance. The up-regulated proteins were further categorized into nine functional groups to gain more insight into their roles in desiccation tolerance. The largest group was shown to be involved in gene regulation and signal transduction (36 %), which reflects the role of the nucleus in gene expression and regulation. The second group included stress responsive molecules such as antioxidants, molecular chaperones and compatible solutes (33 %). This reflects the importance of strong defense systems in preventing lipid peroxidation, protein aggregation, membrane leakage and maintaining the integrity of cellular structures during dehydration and in the dried state. The third group contained proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (10 %). This might reflect the capacity of this plant to control the movement of molecules to and from the nucleus during dehydration and the importance of this process in adaptation to dehydration stress. The fourth group contained proteins involved in protein translation (7 %). Proteins categorized to other functions, include proteins with miscellaneous and unknown functions. Proteins with unknown functions were considered to be X. viscosa nuclear-specific proteins. There was good correlation between the up-regulated proteins identified by 2 -DE and iTRAQ approaches. In conclusion, this study revealed that X. viscosa nuclear proteome was responsive to dehydration stress and desiccation tolerance is University of Cape Town genetically encoded. Secondly, X. viscosa relies on readily inducible protection to combat desiccation and <b>desiccation</b> tolerance is <b>controlled</b> by multiple genes within the plant nucleus. Thirdly, the protective mechanisms of desiccation tolerance utilized by X. viscosa appear to involve signal perception genes and modulating gene expression of appropriate genes encoding protective molecules including antioxidants, molecular chaperones, compatible solutes, proteins of translation and degradation machinery, proteins with miscellaneous functions and novel protein factors. Lastly, proteins are crucial to desiccation tolerance allowing X. viscosa to possess a unique stress tolerance with versatile and coordinated actions to provide protection for its cellular structures during desiccation and in the dried state. To our best knowledge this is the first study to provide insight into the nuclear (organellar) proteome of a desiccation tolerant plant...|$|R
