5|$|Nine {{months after}} Percy Jackson's defense of Mount Olympus in The Last Olympian, Percy finds himself alone {{and on the}} run from monsters in {{southern}} California without his memories. Under the initial guidance of Lupa, the wolf-goddess and protector of ancient Rome, he makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Camp Jupiter, the Roman demigod training camp and counterpart to the Greek demigod's Camp Half-Blood. Upon arriving, he is again attacked by several Gorgons, (Stheno and Euryale) and successfully defends a disguised goddess Juno as well as the camp {{with the help of the}} guards on duty. Because he protected her during the attack, Juno announces his arrival with her approval, identifying that Percy is a son of Neptune. She further tells him privately that he can only regain his memory by learning to be a hero again and successfully survive the challenges he encounters at camp.|$|E
25|$|Laramie County Sheriff Seth Sharpless led the posses, which {{separated}} into groups of fifty men each. In addition to this, a $1,000 reward {{was placed on}} Bogan, dead or alive. When the manhunt did not produce Bogan, Siringo, acting on information he had received from sources, went undercover {{and was able to}} gain the confidence of Hall and his cohorts. Bogan, however, was no longer riding with them, and had made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Utah. Siringo was able to produce evidence for indictments against Hall and several others for their having assisted Bogan, resulting in their arrests.|$|E
25|$|At {{the gate}} to the engine, Namgoong reveals that he plans to use the highly {{flammable}} Kronole as an explosive to blow a hatch to the outside, as he observed signs the world outside is thawing and may be hospitable. Curtis confesses to him that shortly after boarding the train, the tail passengers resorted to cannibalism to survive, and he is haunted by his part in it. He was nearly ready to kill infant Edgar when Gilliam offered his own arm instead. After years of disdain for Wilford, Curtis seeks to learn what Wilford's intentions were. Franco is revealed to have survived and makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the engine.|$|E
60|$|Weak from loss of blood, Carthoris made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>toward</b> Aaanthor, {{reaching}} its outskirts at dark.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} he kept {{steadily}} upon <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> and <b>toward</b> evening met a farmer with a wagon loaded with sacks of grain.|$|R
60|$|All within hearing {{immediately}} turned {{about and}} beheld the semblance of Mr. Hooper pacing slowly <b>his</b> meditative <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the meeting-house. With one accord they started, expressing more wonder than if some strange minister {{were coming to}} dust the cushions of Mr. Hooper's pulpit.|$|R
500|$|He then fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Airfield Number 1 and aided a Marine {{tank that}} {{was trapped in}} an enemy mine field under intense mortar and {{artillery}} barrages. He guided the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite heavy weapons fire from the Japanese. As he moved {{along the edge of}} the airfield, he was killed by Japanese mortar shrapnel.|$|E
2500|$|Nedda, {{trying to}} {{continue}} the play, admits {{that she has been}} visited by the innocent Arlecchino. Canio, furious and forgetting the play, demands the name of her lover. Nedda swears she will never tell him, and it becomes apparent that they are not acting. Beppe asks Tonio to intervene, but Tonio refrains and prevents Beppe from halting the action. Silvio begins to fight <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the stage. Canio, grabbing a knife from the table, stabs Nedda. As she dies, she calls: [...] "Help! Silvio!". Silvio attacks Canio, but Canio kills Silvio also. The horrified audience then hears the celebrated final line: ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of September 5, 1975, Fromme dressed {{completely}} in red, [...] "for the animals and earth colors", placed the Colt [...]45 pistol into a leg holster strapped to her left leg, {{and made her way}} from her apartment to the California state capitol grounds. The sky was clear and the weather prediction for Sacramento called for calm winds and a temperature around [...] At 9:26a.m., Ford had returned to the Senator Hotel at 1121 L Street (...) from his two-hour speaking engagement at the Host Breakfast. From his suite at the Senator Hotel, Ford crossed L Street, also known as Lincoln Highway, at 10:02a.m. into Capitol Park and began shaking hands with people who had gathered in a crowd on the park's pathway. Ford was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> an entrance of the state capitol building.|$|E
60|$|As the Heliumite watched he {{saw another}} green warrior push <b>his</b> <b>way</b> forward <b>toward</b> the rostrum. Beside him he dragged a captive, {{and as the}} {{surrounding}} warriors parted to let the two pass, Carthoris caught a fleeting glimpse of the prisoner.|$|R
60|$|Jane Withersteen {{waited on}} the ridge with full and {{grateful}} heart. Lassiter appeared, making <b>his</b> weary <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> her through the sage. And up on the slope Judkins rode into sight with his troop of boys. For the present, at least, the white herd would be looked after.|$|R
60|$|Once more {{he sought}} water, and after {{drinking}} deeply, took <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>toward</b> the cabin by the sea. In times of loneliness and trouble it {{had long been}} his custom to seek there the quiet and restfulness which he could find nowhere else.|$|R
2500|$|Initially Clark's {{forces and}} Lochry's forces would be {{supplied}} at Ft Pitt, resupply at Fort Henry in Wheeling and then begin the trek down the Ohio River. [...] Lochry's party {{of one hundred}} & seven mounted volunteers rendezvoused at Carnahan's Block House, eleven miles west of Hanna's town, on the July 24, 1781, but then things did not go as planned. They were delayed {{as they waited for}} supplies from Brodhead, which never materialized and so they began their march on 2 August. General Clark was already on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Forth Henry. [...] Rushing to catch up, Lochry's troops arrived on the 8th of August, only to find that Clark and all the men, boats and stores he could gather had departed just twelve hours earlier. [...] Clark left a letter for Lochry, affixed to a pole, directing Lochry to follow him to the Falls of the Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Spargo {{was elected}} to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1905 and to the {{governing}} National Executive Committee in 1909. As his biographer notes, during this period Spargo began [...] "easing <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the reformist right-wing" [...] of the SPA, giving up on the tactic of agitation among striking workers in favor of building middle class socialist educational institutions. Spargo was instrumental in helping establish the Rand School of Social Science, persuading George D. Herron and his wife Carrie Rand Herron to make a large bequest and Mrs. Herron's mother to provide seed money for the new institution. Spargo also was a co-founder of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS), an organization dedicated to the establishment of non-partisan socialist study groups on college campuses and sponsoring debates and lectures on socialist topics. Spargo would later serve on the ISS executive from 1916 to 1919.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his arrival}} in Tiberias, Assi had an {{adventure}} with a ruffian, which ended disastrously for the latter. Assi was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the baths, when he was assaulted by a [...] "scorner." [...] He did not resent the assault, except by remarking, [...] "That man's neck-band is too loose," [...] and continued on his way. It so happened that an archon was at that very hour trying a thief, and the scoffer, still laughing at the adventure with Assi, came to witness the trial just when the judge interrogated the culprit as to accomplices. The culprit, seeing the man laughing, {{thought that it was}} at his discomfiture, and to avenge himself pointed to the ruffian as his accomplice. The man was apprehended and examined. He confessed to a murder he had committed, and was sentenced to be hanged with the convicted thief. Assi, on returning from the baths, encountered the procession {{on its way to the}} execution. His assailant on seeing him exclaimed, [...] "The neck-band which was loose will soon be tightened", to which Assi replied, [...] "Thy fate has long since been foretold, for the Bible says (Isa. xxviii. 22), 'Be ye not scorners lest your bands be made strong '" [...] (Yer. Ber. ii. 5c).|$|E
50|$|The book {{contains}} 12 chapters, {{which are}} loosely connected with each other, mainly by reappearing characters. It {{is more like}} {{a collection of short stories}} - each chapter can stand on its own. A conventional encompassing plot is missing. However, there is a thread: the protagonists are forced to mature, each one in <b>his</b> own <b>way,</b> <b>toward</b> the end of the book.|$|R
60|$|Again {{and again}} he sank weakly to the floor; but each time he rose again and {{continued}} <b>his</b> pitiful <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> safety. After what seemed to him an interminable time, during which the flames had become a veritable fiery furnace {{at the far side}} of the room, the great black managed to reach the veranda, roll down the steps, and crawl off into the cool safety of some nearby shrubbery.|$|R
60|$|The new-comer {{seemed to}} turn a disapproving eye upon the rather motley {{congregation}} of native Anchurians, and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> at once <b>toward</b> Goodwin, who was the most conspicuously Anglo-Saxon figure present. Goodwin greeted him with courtesy.|$|R
2500|$|Many of the Seimeni fraternized {{with the}} enemy, leaving the pretender {{to collect his}} {{remaining}} troops, and, though continuously harassed by Transylvanian pursuers, to seek <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Brăila, in Ottoman territory. This allowed Constantin to leave Silistra and seek to join the Transylvanian–Moldavian troops, which he did at Dridov; on his way there, he intercepted and executed several Seimeni, marking {{the beginning of a}} major purge. As Filipescu writes: [...] "the Seimeni discarded their blue clothes and dressed up in messy rags, and swore that they were not soldiers, for whoever was known to be one had no more days left to live." [...] Nevertheless, resistance continued: more skirmishes were recorded outside Bucharest, Brăila, and Craiova; two months later, 2,000 cavalry regulars, or Călărași, also revolted, facing the loyalists outside Călugăreni. Xenopol describes this later revolt as another plot by the Seimeni, centered on [...] "butchering the Hungarians, and on toppling the Prince who had so gravely betrayed them." [...] They won a tactical victory against the Transylvanian regiment of János Boros (Borăș), before being put down by the Moldavians. Also on the loyalist side, the civil war involved a group of Crimean Tatars under Rüstem Mirza, who entered Wallachia in late June. These raided Orașul de Floci and killed as many as 200 inhabitants.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{began his}} lifelong kinship with Native Americans in Devils Lake. The {{first people to}} meet and greet him as he {{stepped down from the}} {{platform}} of the train were a small band of Sioux. [...] "They were a fine healthy lot; and as the travel-worn youth with his carpet-bag and lunch basket looked about for someone from whom he might ask directions, the Chief stepped up and with extended hand, said: [...] "How cola!" [...] Half in fright and with a puzzled hand-shake, the boy made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> what seemed to be the white man's town. [...] He passed by a large pile of bones, and wondered what it meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forebears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth began to think that Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.” ...|$|E
60|$|Martin nodded. The nigger-heaven bouncer {{was making}} <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the disturbance.|$|E
60|$|The {{crossing}} {{was most}} difficult, {{for he was}} very weak, but at last {{he came to the}} opposite bank and drew himself up to lie panting for a few minutes on the sloping bank. Then he crawled on again up to the top, and staggering to his feet made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> cautiously <b>toward</b> the two huts. All was quiet. He assumed that the party was asleep, and so he lay down near the rude shelter he had constructed for Barbara Harding, and fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|As on the {{previous}} day, just for the joy of it, he followed cattle-trails at haphazard and worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up <b>toward</b> the summits. Coming out on a wagon road that led upward, he followed it for several miles, emerging in a small, mountain-encircled valley, where half a dozen poor ranchers farmed the wine-grapes on the steep slopes. Beyond, the road pitched upward. Dense chaparral covered the exposed hillsides but in the creases of the canons huge spruce trees grew, and wild oats and flowers.|$|R
50|$|Lair thought Young uniquely {{qualified}} to operate solo {{in a culture}} so different from American ways. Lair had Young work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> westward <b>toward</b> the mountains where he was reared. Young's directions were to contact village headmen for recruitment, and to find airstrip locations for Lima Sites. He was also exploring a possible line of retreat for Vang Pao's army through Sainyabuli Province southward into Thailand. Young reached Sainyabuli Province in January 1962. Keeping a low profile there throughout the spring, {{he was able to}} recruit only 30 new guerrillas.|$|R
60|$|Ben pushed <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> her, {{his face}} {{set in a}} fierce frown, bitter, desperate.|$|E
60|$|Pushing through them, he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Teeka; {{but as he}} {{approached}} her the ape drew away.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Coulson went on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> {{the exit}} from the station, puffing contentedly at his big cigar.|$|E
6000|$|For on {{the island}} of Boupari it was high feast with the worshippers of their god that night. The sun had turned on the Tropic of Capricorn at noon, and was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> northward, <b>toward</b> the equator once more; and his votaries, as was their wont, had all come forth to do him honor in due season, and to pay their respects, in the inmost and sacredest grove {{on the island}}, to his incarnate representative, the living spirit of trees and fruits and vegetation, the very high god, the divine Tu-Kila-Kila! ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{the moment}} that the boat touched the shore, he and his {{followers}} rushed on board, and a dreadful scene of consternation and terror ensued. Gloucester himself made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> directly <b>toward</b> {{the figure of a}} lady, whose air, and manner, and style of dress indicated, so far as he could discern them in the darkness, that she was probably the object of his fury. He plunged his dagger into her breast. She, in an agony of terror, leaped into the river. She was buoyed up by her dress, and floated down the stream.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes lolling upon Tantor's back, {{sometimes}} {{roaming the}} jungle in solitude, Korak made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>toward</b> the West and South. He made {{but a few}} miles a day, for he had a whole lifetime before him and no place in particular to go. Possibly he would have moved more rapidly but for the thought which continually haunted him that each mile he traversed carried him further and further away from Meriem--no longer his Meriem, as of yore, it is true! but still as dear to him as ever.|$|R
60|$|He drew a {{card from}} his pocket, {{handed it to}} the officer and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the door.|$|E
60|$|This {{order was}} obeyed, {{and the boys}} knew {{by the sound of}} the Indian's voice that he was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> Jake.|$|E
6000|$|... "That can't be if she's still afloat," [...] Bob cried testily, {{and from}} {{the sound of his voice}} Jim knew he was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the rail.|$|E
5000|$|In his memoirs, Yehuda Leib Gerst {{described}} Rumkowski as {{a complex}} person: [...] "This man had sickly leanings that clashed. Toward his fellow Jews, he was an incomparable tyrant who behaved just like a Führer and cast deathly terror to anyone who dared to oppose <b>his</b> lowly <b>ways.</b> <b>Toward</b> the perpetrators, however, he was as tender as a lamb {{and there was no}} limit to his base submission to all their demands, even if their purpose was to wipe us out totally. Either way, he did not properly understand his situation and positing and their limits." ...|$|R
60|$|And a {{long time}} he sat there with the bunches of the camel-dates above him, golden as the sunlight. Then, as {{the scent of the}} lyric-flowers, {{released}} by evening, warned him of the night dropping like a flight of dark birds on the plain, he rose stiffly, and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> as usual <b>toward</b> the Vita Publica.|$|R
60|$|Seizing a cudgel {{from the}} nearest priest, he laid about him like a veritable demon as he forged <b>his</b> rapid <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> the altar. The hand of La had paused at the first noise of interruption. When she saw who the author of it was she went white. She {{had never been able}} to fathom the secret of the strange white man's escape from the dungeon in which she had locked him. She had not {{intended}} that he should ever leave Opar, for she had looked upon his giant frame and handsome face with the eyes of a woman and not those of a priestess.|$|R
