During the 1980s in South Australia, and {{possibly}} other Australian regions, Australian rockers were typically {{working class and}} <b>fairly</b> reactionary. <b>Typical</b> interests were alcohol, girls, music and cars. They were known as troublemakers and street fighters, and there were several rocker groups. It was not uncommon for rockers to fight members of other subcultures, such as surfies, mods, and skinheads.

40|$|X-ray flux densities {{measured}} with the Einstein Observatory are presented {{for a set}} of LB Lac objects with available VLBI angular sizes. The static, single-component synchrotron self-Compton formalism is used to predict the X-ray flux densities.

25|$|The general {{structure}} of human vertebrae is <b>fairly</b> <b>typical</b> of {{that found in}} mammals, reptiles, and birds. The shape of the vertebral body does, however, vary somewhat between different groups. In mammals, such as humans, it typically has flat upper and lower surfaces, while in reptiles the anterior surface commonly has a concave socket into which the expanded convex face of the next vertebral body fits. Even these patterns are only generalisations, however, {{and there may be}} variation in form of the vertebrae {{along the length of the}} spine even within a single species. Some unusual variations include the saddle-shaped sockets between the cervical vertebrae of birds and the presence of a narrow hollow canal running down the centre of the vertebral bodies of geckos and tuataras, containing a remnant of the notochord.|$|E

The forest around the creek's headwaters are composed mostly of oak and hickory.|$|E
25|$|There {{was only}} one mass-produced {{derivative}} of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a luggage boot. This was coded PS1/1, and {{was a very strong}} seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives an idea of the scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new buses and coaches few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a <b>fairly</b> <b>typical</b> sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol-engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s.|$|E

500|$|The scapulae (shoulder blades) were robust; {{the bones}} of the forelimb were short in {{relation}} to the animal's size, but broad and sturdy. The humerus was short and stout, with its ends broadly expanded and flattened—the upper side for the deltopectoral crest and muscle attachment and the lower for articulation with the radius and ulna. The radius was short, stout and straight, and the olecranon of the ulna apparently very powerful. The lower part of the ulna had a broad expansion. The hands had three fingers; the first finger bore a large claw (ungual bone) measuring about [...] along its curve, which would have been lengthened by a keratin sheath in life.

40|$|The {{effects of}} spatial scale on the {{assessment}} of soil biodiversity were investigated through a field study conducted in the Pelagian Islands, Sicilian Channel, southern Mediterranean. The oribatid mite community in this archipelago was investigated from both an ecological and a biogeographical point of view. The following hierarchically nested spatial scales were considered: 1 —archipelago (γ-diversity); 2 —island (α- and β-diversity between the islands); 3 —sites (α- and β-diversity within each island). Quantitative and semi-quantitative soil sample replicates were collected during the wet season (autumn, 1999) in Lampedusa and Linosa, the two major islands of the archipelago. Data revealed that the sample α-diversity of the two islands is similar. The density of species followed a geometrical trend (a few dominant species with the remainder <b>fairly</b> uncommon) <b>typical</b> of communities in which a single environmental factor dominates species ecology. Community structure differed significantly between the two islands. Species turnover (β-diversity) was very high at every spatial scale, from the sites to the archipelago. Biogeographical results highlighted great differences between faunas in the two islands. The formulation of hypotheses for biodiversity patterns is strongly scale dependent: the heuristic and conservation value of the biogeographical approach increases from local to regional scales, because the importance of historical factors increases while that of ecological factors decreases...|$|R

A catalog is presented of 414 diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measured between 3900 and 8100 Å in this spectrum. The central wavelengths, the widths (FWHM), and the equivalent widths of {{nearly all of the}} bands are tabulated, along with the minimum uncertainties in the latter. Among the 414 bands, 135 (or 33 %) were not reported in four previous, modern surveys of the DIBs in the spectra of various stars, including HD 183143. The principal result {{of this study is that}} the great majority of the bands in the catalog are very weak and <b>fairly</b> narrow. <b>Typical</b> equivalent widths amount to a few mÅ, and the bandwidths (FWHM) are most often near 0. 7 Å.
