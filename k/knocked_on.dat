5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp {{answered}} the door, the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E
5|$|Lace {{confessed to}} the murder on 17 September 1983. He gave a {{statement}} to police that he had stolen a rucksack and cash on 4December 1979 from the care home in Portsmouth {{where he had been}} living and then walked to Southampton. He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E

5000|$|In Iran, [...] "Bezanam be Tachte بزنم به تخته" [...] (<b>knock</b> <b>on</b> wood), {{when one}} says {{something}} good about something or somebody, he/she will <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the wood, saying [...] "bezan-am be takhteh, cheshm nakhoreh" [...] (I am <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> the wood, to prevent -it, he, or she- from being jinxed). Evil eye, and being jinxed {{is a common}} phobia and superstitious belief in Iranian culture. Iranians traditionally believe <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> the wood wards off evil spirits.|$|R
5000|$|In Croatia and Serbia {{there is}} also the habit of <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> wood when saying {{something}} positive or affirmative about someone or something and not wanting that to change. Frequently the movement of <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> nearby wood is followed by [...] "Da pokucam u drvo" [...] (да куцнем у дрво) (I will <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> wood), or sometimes by [...] "Da ne ureknem" [...] (да не урекнем) (I don't want to jinx it).|$|R
5|$|Parsons {{was anxious}} {{to learn about the}} {{condition}} of his family and property at Wappocomo; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket. Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish, he traveled west along the Northwestern Turnpike to around Pleasant Dale, then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime, when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney. Parsons stayed behind in the hollow, while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes. Knowing that the Union Army kept a 24-hour guard at the main house, Blue circled around {{to the rear of the}} mansion and <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with the Parsons family. Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front porch, and he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter, Kate, who provided Lt. Blue with a parcel for her father.|$|E
5|$|The police's {{operating}} procedure—and the {{law which}} governed their actions—meant {{they were unable}} to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.|$|E
5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite. According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> {{the door of the}} chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E

5|$|Filming for The Proposal {{initiated}} in April 2008 in Rockport, Massachusetts. In the oncoming days leading to production, {{areas of the}} town were temporarily remodeled to represent Sitka, Alaska, the setting {{of most of the}} film. Principal photography officially began on April 9 at Bearskin Neck, where it continued over a period of 24 hours. Filming continued at the Motif Number One building on Bradley Wharf (April 14–16), the Haskins Building (April 15–18), and the central business district of Rockport (April 17). Principal photography relocated to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts on April 22, where it resumed over an approximate period of two weeks. In response, city officials accommodated the producers by renting out all publicly owned parking lots. Filming for The Proposal was shortly delayed after Bullock and her husband were involved in a car accident. The wedding scene was filmed in a three-story twentieth century Victorian home; photography took place at the residence for three weeks. In an interview with the New York Times, the owners of the home stated that Nelson Coates <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> their door asking for leaves. Initially, the owners directed Coates to other residences in the area; however, they eventually gave the film's producer a tour of the house. Production occurred {{on the first floor of}} the home. Outside of the Cape Ann area, filming took place in Boston, Massachusetts at the State Street Bank Building and in Lower Manhattan in New York City. The Proposal contained 350 special effect shots, and some parts were edited using computer-generated imagery. The score to The Proposal was composed by Aaron Zigman, who recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.|$|E

5000|$|In Poland, {{as well as}} in Russia, {{there is}} a habit of <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> (unpainted) wood (which may be preceded by saying odpukać w niemalowane drewno or simply odpukać, {{literally}} meaning to <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> unpainted wood) when saying something negative - to prevent it from happening - or, more rarely, something positive - in order not to [...] "spoil it". In Czech Republic, this is often accompanied for stronger effect by <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> one's teeth, a piece of building stone, or metal, reasoning that these (as opposed to wood) survive even fire.|$|R

In the shared drainpipe was found a brownish-red wig which matched {{some of the}} hairs found on the victim's body.

Bethany's Hyundai was still out front, but it was parked at an unusual angle, with one tire flat, and noticeably dusty. This was not the condition it had been in one week earlier, when the grandparents had last driven by. No one answered when they <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> the door.|$|E

While he was in custody, a lynch mob took Stacy from the deputies and murdered him. Although the faces of his murderers {{could be seen in}} a photo taken at the lynching site, the state did not prosecute the murder.|$|E

Kelly was six weeks behind on her payments, owing 29 shillings. Shortly after 10:45a.m., Bowyer <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> her door but received no response. He reached through the crack in the window, pushed aside a coat being used as a curtain and peered inside—discovering Kelly's horribly mutilated corpse lying on the bed.|$|E
