40|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} have {{protective covers}} such as skid plates and belly pans {{that cover the}} majority of the undercarriage. Therefore, specific jack points exist on each corner of these vehicles. A jack can be placed on these points to safely lift the vehicle up without damaging any plastic covers. However, this poses a problem for the DIY mechanic. The jack point usually does not leave enough room for a jack and a <b>jack</b> <b>stand.</b> The objective of the Automotive Hub Stand Design project was to design an affordable alternative to the traditional <b>jack</b> <b>stand</b> that can be mounted directly to the hub of the vehicle using the factory lug pattern and nuts. The goal was to create a universal system that could be used on any vehicle. This was accomplished by utilizing an interchangeable Hub Plate Member that can be manufactured for specific vehicles. For the scope of this project, one hub plate member that incorporates both Subaru and Audi vehicles was manufactured. Column buckling and shear force calculations as well as material strength analysis was completed for this project. The Automotive Hub Stand was modeled using Solidworks and manufactured out of 6061 Aluminum. All of the parts were completed with the resources available at CWU’s machine and welding shops. The Hub Stand was designed to hold up 1. 5 tons and cost under $ 300. The project was a success in regards to the set requirements in cost, usability (ease of use), dimensions and load/capacity requirements...|$|E
