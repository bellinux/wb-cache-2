500|$|On 9 September 2006, BBC News {{reported}} that the Muslim boycott of Danish goods had reduced Denmark's total exports by 15.5% between February and June. This was attributed to an approximated 50% decline in exports to the Middle East. The BBC said, [...] "The cost to Danish businesses was around 134 million euros ($170m), {{when compared with the}} same period last year, the statistics showed." [...] However, The Guardian newspaper in the UK said, [...] "While Danish milk products were dumped in the Middle East, fervent right-wing Americans started buying Bang & Olufsen stereos and Lego. In the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year Denmark's exports to the US soared 17%." [...] Overall the boycott did not {{have a significant effect on}} the Danish economy.|$|E

It is as certain as anything in a man's life can be confidently postulated, that had he continued to play in English county cricket... he would have taken his place amongst the select company of England's captains." [...] The Times commented: [...] "It {{was one of the great}} disappointments of English cricket in the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century that his outstanding promise was never fully realized." [...] Hart observes that Crawford's on-field successes were many up to 1909 but after that, his career effectively stalled during his absence from English cricket. Hart notes Crawford's [...] "capacity to get on the scoreboard and up establishment noses. He could turn games around and agreements over, antagonise the powerful, endear himself to the young and those young enough at heart to care to characterise great personal performances as 'heroic'". He concludes that Crawford spent the last 40 years of his life [...] "in comparative sporting obscurity". No-one on the Surrey committee ever expressed regret at what had happened, and Leveson Gower did not mention the affair in his autobiography.|$|E

At the two-minute warning, a pass interference penalty by Giants cornerback Dave Thomas put the ball at the Giants' 10 with the Falcons needing a touchdown to tie the score. However, a sack by defensive end Michael Strahan and three incomplete passes by Kanell clinched the game for the Giants.|$|E

50|$|Until recently, Bevington has {{consistently}} been the instructor of a two-part History and Theory of Drama sequence. This course has been co-taught with actor/translator Nicholas Rudall, dramaturg Drew Dir, Director of Undergraduate Studies in Theater and Performance Studies Heidi Coleman, and actor David New. It {{is now being}} taught primarily by Professor John Muse, as Bevington has chosen to decrease his teaching hours and focus on Shakespeare-centric classes. The <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> course spans drama from Greek drama to the Renaissance. The second quarter begins with Ibsen's A Doll's House and ends with the postmodern, including Beckett's Endgame {{and the work of}} Pinter and Caryl Churchill. For midterms and finals, students either write a paper critically analyzing a play, or else perform scenes from plays relevant to the course (though not necessarily those read in class). Bevington requires, from those opting to perform, a reflection paper analyzing the challenges of staging the scene.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{anonymous}} {{allegations that}} the proposed establishment of the new zone would cause property values to increase, and that government politicians had bought large plots of land in speculation. [...] However, {{the opening of the}} airport caused property prices to fall 40-50% in an estimated 4,000 rai of land surrounding the airport from 2005 to 2006 due to increased noise levels. [...] An anonymous source had earlier informed The Nation newspaper that [...] "My friend told me that a politician's wife had bought 4,000 rai from a developer...The transaction was wrapped up in the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year [...] ". The source also noted that prominent developers like Land & Houses, Quality Houses, Property Perfect, Supalai, LPN Develop-ment, SC Asset Corp, as well as the Jungrungreangkit and Mahagitsiri families owned large tranches in the proposed zone. Several developers denied that their ownership of land was related in any way to the proposal and noted that the properties were bought years before.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{however, the}} Giants didn't {{look like a}} playoff team for the <b>first</b> three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> contest. The defense was {{particularly}} terrible, as they allowed Brett Favre to throw for 315 yards on just 15 completions, Ahman Green to run for 101 yards, and two receivers (Corey Bradford and Bill Schroeder) to have 100-yard days receiving. This defensive futility negated the 524 yards of total offense the Giants amassed during the contest.|$|R

5000|$|The opening {{contest of}} the 1917 season was against Jim Thorpe and his Canton Bulldogs. The game, {{which took place}} at Canton's Wright Field, drew a crowd of 7,000 fans.

[...] He adds that the Bulldogs won a narrow victory in a contest where [...] "the lineups read like a who's-who of {{post-graduate}} football, circa 1917." [...] As sports historian Keith McClellan writes: [...] "Although the Canton Bulldogs gained 168 yards with their rushing attack and passed for an additional eighty-two yards, they could not cross Youngstown's goal for a touchdown. The Youngstown defense was outstanding whenever Canton threatened to score. Howard 'Cub' Buck's drop kick from the fifteen-yard line {{in the first period}} produced the only points of the game. Three times, Bart Macomber tried to tie the score with a field goal but failed each attempt. Canton won 3-0." [...] McClellan adds that the game was characterized by [...] "head-to-head competition" [...] between the teams' two centers, Robert Peck (Youngstown) and Ralph [...] "Fats" [...] Waldsmith. According to McClellan, legendary Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne listed Peck [...] "as the best center for the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century." ...|$|E

In the case of sparrow problems, environmental controls are of limited application as the birds prefer the habitat modifications made by man. Protection of crops or sites relies on repellents which are generally ineffective against this particular species. The only viable population level controls are trapping or poisoning.
