40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis was aimed at developing the understanding of two regimes in vertical gas-liquid flow in tubes, namely annular flow and churn flow. In annular flow, there is a continuous gas passage at {{the centre of the}} pipe with a film of liquid travelling upwards at the wall. Part of the liquid phase in annular flow may be entrained as droplets in the core gas flow. In churn flow there is also a gas core (which the present work has shown to be continuous) and a liquid film; however, the flow direction of the liquid in this film varies with time. Thus, the liquid flows upwards in large waves {{on the surface of the}} film; between the waves, the film may change direction and flow downwards towards the next wave. Such flows are extremely complex and there are aspects of their behaviour which are poorly understood. In the work {{described in}} this thesis, several areas have been studied. <b>Disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> are of central importance in annular flows. Such waves are characterised by their large amplitudes relative to the mean film thickness, their high translation velocities relative to the mean film speed, and their circumferential coherence (i. e. their “ring-like” structure when fully developed). An important part of the present work was concerned with the existence, development and translation of <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> in upwards, gas-liquid annular flows. At very low liquid flow rates, <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> are not formed (and, as other work has shown, the entrainment of droplets from the liquid film is negligible). In the present work, multiple conductance probe units have been employed to study the growth and development of <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves.</b> From the results, it is found that <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> begin to appear and to start to achieve their circumferential coherence from lengths as short as 5 – 10 pipe diameters downstream of the liquid injection location; this coherence gradually strengthens with increasing distance from the inlet. It is further shown that the spectral content of the entire interfacial wave activity shifts to lower frequencies with increasing axial 3 distance from the inlet, with the peak frequency levelling off after approximately 20 pipe diameters. Interestingly, on the other hand, the frequency of occurrence of the <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> first increases away from the inlet as these waves form, reaches a maximum at a length between 7. 5 and 15 pipe diameters depending on the flow conditions, and then decreases again. This trend becomes increasingly evident at higher gas and/or liquid flow-rates. Both wave frequency measures increase monotonically at higher gas and/or liquid flowrates. Important evidence regarding the mechanisms of <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> and the associated droplet entrainment can be obtained by the axial view photography technique. This technique is described in Chapters 3 and 6. The technique was used to visualise the wave characteristics, in particular of the two entrainment mechanisms (bag break up and ligament break up mechanisms) proposed previously by Azzopardi (1983). The axial view photography technique provided visual evidence for the existence of the two mechanisms, although in contrast to Azzopardi’s findings, both break up mechanisms were observed to occur simultaneously. The axial view photography technique was also used in the present work to provide further insights into the inception of <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves.</b> It was found that the initiation mechanism for <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> was the occurrence of a disturbance at a given location around the tube periphery. This is consistent with the idea of a link between turbulent burst phenomena and <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves</b> first proposed by Azzopardi and Martin (1986). The initial disturbance links up with similar disturbances to ultimately form the characteristic ring-like structure characteristic of fully developed <b>disturbance</b> <b>waves.</b> In churn flow the present work concentrated on three aspects: The use of axial view photography to explore the continuity of the gas core in churn flow. The development (in collaboration with two other research students –Deng Peng and Masroor Ahmad) of a correlation for entrainment rate and hence entrained fraction in churn flow. Measurements of 4 pressure gradient and holdup in churn flow, from which an average wall shear stress can be deduced. In the first task, it was shown (it is believed for the first time) that there is a continuous path for the gas phase near the tube axis. In churn flow the behaviour of entrained fraction is extremely complex and conventional methods for measuring it are no longer valid. Barbosa etal (2002) studied entrainment in churn flow using iso-kinetic sampling probes and the correlation referred to above was based on this data. The correlation has been widely used in predicting the entrained fraction at the transition between churn and annular flow. Since the direction of flow of the liquid film near the channel wall fluctuates, it is difficult to estimate the instantaneous value of wall shear stress. However, if measurements are made of total pressure gradient and liquid holdup, then the mean value of wall shear stress can be estimated. This procedure was pursued by Govan (1990) who used mechanically operated quick-closing valves to measure holdup. In the current work, a new measurement technique was utilised, namely quick closing pinch valve which offer a great accuracy and are easy to install. Pressure gradient and hold up data were collected over a wide range of gas and liquid flowrate. An averaged wall shear stress was then calculated based on these measurements. At higher liquid mass flow rates, the results were in good qualitative agreement with those of Govan (1990) but (at lower mass fluxes) anomalies occur which need further investigation.

Level-set) combined with a scale-resolving turbulence simulation technique (Large Eddy Simulation) was employed to capture dominant turbulence and interfacial scales.

40|$|Falling film {{reactors}} are a {{very effective}} geometry in which to carry out fast exothermic gas-liquid reactions, because they allow easy removal of the heat produced. To optimise and improve falling film reactors, soundly based physical models are required. Existing models assume a flat liquid film combined with empirically-determined mass transfer coefficients, but there is growing evidence that this is unsatisfactory, since the interface is dominated by ripples and larger disturbance waves which {{have a significant effect}} on the mass and heat transfer rates through and into the film. The main objective of this study was the better understanding through experimental study of the interfacial characteristics of liquid falling films in the presence of a co-current down flow of air, with emphasis on the physical and hydrodynamic conditions encountered in current falling film reactor technology, so that the information obtained can be implemented in the enhancement of falling film reactor modelling. The liquids chosen were water, for validation of the measurement techniques through comparison with the literature, and two common falling film sulphonation reactor feedstocks; dodecylbenzene and ethoxylated alcohol. The experimental study consisted of film thickness and <b>disturbance</b> <b>wave</b> celerity measurements in a purpose built flow facility with a flat plate flow surface. A novel spatial film thickness measurement technique, the Light Absorption Imaging Technique (LAIT), was developed to give unparalleled spatial information on the interfacial characteristics of liquid films. A computer algorithm-based technique has been developed for categorisation of the spatial film data obtained by LAIT into substrate and <b>disturbance</b> <b>wave</b> regions, from which globally averaged characteristics of the interfacial structure have been obtained. <b>Disturbance</b> <b>wave</b> celerity measurements were obtained utilising the cross-correlated output signal from two light sources and a manual time-of-flight measurement technique using the images from a high-speed video camera. The study has provided a comprehensive set of data on the hydrodynamic structure of the interface, with and without the influence of a co-current down flow of air, for both water and actual sulphonation feed stocks as the liquid phase.
