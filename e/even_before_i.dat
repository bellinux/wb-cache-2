25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

It's such a balance [...] It's still young, still new and fresh, but it has the old soul groove. The energy is incredible. It's the summer anthem, I pray. I feel it. Rodney Jerkins is incredible, Jay of course is on it, he blessed the song, I'm happy with it.|$|E

The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé crafted most {{songs on}} B'Day through live {{instrumentation}} and diverse techniques. This is evident on [...] "Déjà Vu", which utilizes bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, horns and the 808 drum; it also features rap vocals by Jay-Z. In {{an interview with}} MTV, Beyoncé said, [...] "When I recorded 'Déjà Vu' [...] I knew that <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> started working on my album, I wanted to add live instruments to all of my songs..." [...] The album's second single [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] is noted {{for the use of}} a siren in its melody. It was called a song that [...] "shows a harder edge to Beyoncé'ss sound". [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is a crescendo that uses a two-note riff and galloping beats. The song [...] "advises women who have partners with straying eyes to put on sexy dresses and grind on other guys in the club to regain their affections." [...] Meanwhile, the use of the [...] "uh-huh huh huh" [...] vocals and brassy stabs in the song [...] "Green Light" [...] is a direct echo to [...] "Crazy in Love", according to Peter Robinson of The Guardian.|$|E

500|$|A {{military}} brat, Douglas MacArthur {{was born}} 26 January 1880, at Little Rock Barracks, Little Rock, Arkansas, to Arthur MacArthur, Jr., a U.S. Army captain, and his wife, Mary Pinkney Hardy MacArthur (nicknamed [...] "Pinky"). Arthur, Jr. {{was the son}} of Scottish-born jurist and politician Arthur MacArthur, Sr., Arthur would later receive the Medal of Honor for his actions with the Union Army in the Battle of Missionary Ridge during the American Civil War, and be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. Pinkney came from a prominent Norfolk, Virginia, family. Two of her brothers had fought for the South in the Civil War, and refused to attend her wedding. Arthur and Pinky had three sons, of whom Douglas was the youngest, following Arthur III, born on 1 August 1876, and Malcolm, born on 17 October 1878. The family lived on a succession of Army posts in the American Old West. Conditions were primitive, and Malcolm died of measles in 1883. In his memoir, Reminiscences, MacArthur wrote [...] "I learned to ride and shoot <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could read or write—indeed, almost before I could walk and talk." ...|$|E

60|$|All day I {{was engaged}} in my {{professional}} work, and {{it was late in}} the <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet.

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton, Ward {{spent a year}} as a teacher in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. [...] He also {{returned}} to Princeton during the fall of 1895 as an assistant coach for the Princeton football team. [...] While at Lawrenceville, he sought [...] "to impart into growing youth the mathematical idea, also the rudiments of foot-ball, and the truth of truths that there is no University in the country like Princeton." [...] He later wrote, [...] "Teaching, somehow, did not satisfy me: in fact, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> left college I had an idea that I might be a doctor some day." [...] In another piece, he noted that he [...] "tried for a year to instill Princeton ideas, along with a little knowledge into the heads of the younger generation. [...] The work was pleasant and I was associated with some fine men; but medicine is to be my vocation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{noticed that}} the new album sounds {{different}} from Zola Jesus' earlier works. [...] "I just wanted to try out new ways to produce and different ways to write. And with this new record it's a lot more stripped down and there are way more acoustic elements as opposed to no acoustic elements. [...] I just wanted more breathing room, so people could insert their own experiences into the song, their own feelings into the song, as opposed to me forcing it on them with the densest sound possible", Danilova explained. Speaking to Prefix Magazine after her performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival, {{she said she wanted}} the album to be a step forward. [...] "n doing that, there was so, so much trial and error and so much quitting music {{at the end of the}} day", she admitted. Danilova said that the title of the album (meaning [...] "moving forward" [...] in Latin) appeared before the work on it began. [...] "I had it in mind beforehand because I knew that's what I was going through <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> sat down to work on the record, I was already going through that emotional process of trying to push myself", she said.|$|E
2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in just because we think it might be a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E

My weeks in Boston had not been very many, but nevertheless there were haunts there which I knew as though my feet had trodden them for years. There were houses to which I could have gone with my eyes blindfold; doors of which the latches were familiar to my hands; faces which I knew so well that they had ceased to put on for me the fictitious smiles of courtesy. Faces, houses, doors, and haunts,--where are they now? For me they are {{as though they had}} never been. They are among the things which one would fain remember as one remembers a dream. Look back on it as a vision and it is all pleasant; but if you realize your vision and believe your dream to be a fact, all your pleasure is obliterated by regret.|$|R
