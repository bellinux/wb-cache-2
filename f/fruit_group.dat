40|$|Fruit {{has since}} long been {{advocated}} as a healthy source of many nutrients, however, the high content of sugars in fruit {{might be a}} concern. To study effects of an increased fruit intake compared with similar amount of extra calories from nuts in humans. Thirty healthy non-obese participants were randomized to either supplement the diet with fruits or nuts, each at + 7 kcal/kg bodyweight/day for two months. Major endpoints were change of hepatic fat content (HFC, by magnetic resonance imaging, MRI), basal metabolic rate (BMR, with indirect calorimetry) and cardiovascular risk markers. Weight gain was numerically similar in both groups although only statistically significant in the group randomized to nuts (fruit: from 22. 15 ± 1. 61 kg/m(2) to 22. 30 ± 1. 7 kg/m(2), p = 0. 24 nuts: from 22. 54 ± 2. 26 kg/m(2) to 22. 73 ± 2. 28 kg/m(2), p = 0. 045). On the other hand BMR increased in the nut group only (p = 0. 028). Only the nut group reported a net increase of calories (from 2519 ± 721 kcal/day to 2763 ± 595 kcal/day, p = 0. 035) according to 3 -day food registrations.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} physiological markers in superficially scalded 'Rocha' pear (Pyrus communis L 'Rocha') that would relate to chlorophyll a fluorescence (CF), allowing a non-invasive {{diagnosis of the}} disorder. Conditions chosen before shelf life provided two <b>fruit</b> <b>groups</b> with different developing patterns and severity of superficial scald: T fruit fully developed the disorder in storage, while C fruit developed it progressively throughout shelf life. Principal component analysis (PCA) of all the measured variables, and simple linear correlations among several major parameters and scald index (SI) /shelf life showed that scald and ripening/aging were concurring processes, {{and that it was}} not possible to isolate a particular variable that could deliver a direct non-invasive diagnosis of the disorder. For both <b>fruit</b> <b>groups</b> the SI resulted from the balance between the reducing power (OD 200) and the content of conjugated trienols (CTos) and alpha-farnesene (alpha-Farn) in the fruit peel. At OD 200 > 150 there was a linear relationship between CTos and OD 200, suggesting that the level of antioxidants was self-adjusted in order to compensate the CTos level. However, at OD 200 < 150 this relationship disappeared. A consistent linear relationship between dos and alpha-Farn existed throughout shelf life in both <b>fruit</b> <b>groups,</b> contrarily to the early storage stage, when those compounds do not relate linearly. The CF variables F- 0, F-v/F-m, and the colorimetric variables, L* and h degrees were used in multi-linear regressions with other physiological variables. The regressions were made on one of the <b>fruit</b> <b>groups</b> and validated through the other. Reliable regressions to alpha-Farn and CTos were obtained (R approximate to 0. 6; rmsec approximate to rmsep). Our results suggest that a model based on CF and colorimetric parameters could be used to diagnose non-invasively both the contents and the relationship between alpha-Farn and CTos and hence the stage of scald development.

30|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} few reports about {{regulatory}} genes implicated in peel color of longan. The basic genetic research of longan has been in stagnation {{for a long time}} as a lack of transcriptomic and genetic information. To predict candidate genes associated with peel color, Gene Functional Annotation and Coding Sequence prediction were used to perform functional annotation for our assembled unigenes and investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of fruitlet peels from Longli (Dimocarpus confinis). Finally, a total of 24, 044 (44.19  %) unigenes were annotated at least in one database after BLAST search to NCBI non-redundant protein sequence, NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Ortholog, manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database (Swiss-Prot), Protein family, Gene Ontology, euKaryotic Ortholog Groups databases. After searching against the KEGG-GENE protein database, a result of 6228 (11.45  %) unigenes were assigned to 245 KEGG pathways. Via comparing the distributions of expression value of all corresponding unigenes from red peel and green peel fruit, it could be intuitively concluded that high similarity was existed in the two distributions; however, on the whole, between two distributions of log RPKM expression value, some differences indicated that expression level in green-peel <b>fruit</b> <b>group</b> is slightly higher than values in red-peel <b>fruit</b> <b>group.</b> Finally, a total of 1349 unigenes were identified as DEGs after blasting the DEGs to public sequence databases, and 32 peel-color-related genes were identified in longan. Our results suggest that a number of unigenes involved in longan metabolic process, including anthocyanin biosynthesis. In addition, DRF, F 3 H, ANS, CYP 75 A 1 and C 1 may be the key ones. The study on key genes related to peel color will be contributed to revealing the molecular mechanisms of regulating peel color in woody plants.|$|E
