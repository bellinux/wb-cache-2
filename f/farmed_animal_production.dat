40|$|<b>Farmed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> has {{traditionally}} been a dispersed sector. Biosecurity actions relevant to eradicating infectious diseases are generally non-contractible, and might involve inordinately high transactions costs if they were contractible. If an endemic disease is to be eradicated within a region, synchronized actions {{need to be taken}} to reduce incidence below a critical mass so that spread can be contained. Using a global game model of coordination under public and private information concerning the critical mass required, this paper characterizes the success probability in an eradication campaign. As is standard in global games, heterogeneity in private signals can support a unique equilibrium. Partly because of strategic interactions, concentrated production is found to facilitate eradication whenever unit participation costs are decreasing. Policies to manipulate the critical mass have both a direct effect and a strategic coordination effect. Policies to manipulate information can have subtle and non-intuitive consequences. A program to keep disease out can be modeled similarly. It is shown, too, that coordination problems may lead to multiple equilibria in animal disease insurance markets, so that these markets may complicate a disease eradication program by creating opportunities for multiple inefficient equilibria. The presence of private insurance markets may facilitate coordination and, for good or ill, can seal the fate of a program. biosecurity, coordination failure, disease insurance, endemic disease, global games, market access, public information, veterinary public health. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> {{sector is}} the single largest {{anthropogenic}} user of land, contributing to many environmental problems, including global warming and climate change. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to synthesize and expand upon existing data on the contribution of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> to climate change. METHODS: We analyzed the scientific literature on <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> and documented greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as various mitigation strategies. DISCUSSIONS: An analysis of meat, egg, and milk production encompasses not only the direct rearing and slaughtering of animals, but also grain and fertilizer <b>production</b> for <b>animal</b> feed, waste storage and disposal, water use, and energy expenditures on farms and in transporting feed and finished animal products, among other key impacts of the production process as a whole.

50|$|In <b>farmed</b> <b>animals,</b> {{gut health}} has an {{additional}} dimension, as a healthy gut enables more {{efficient use of}} feed, called the feed conversion ratio. Over many decades antibiotic drugs {{have been added to}} the diet of <b>farmed</b> <b>animals</b> at non-therapeutic levels in the absence of disease, in order to enhance the feed conversion ratio, accelerate growth and protect the animal's health, therefore increasing profitability for producers. Today, however, there is a global push to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics as feed additives for <b>farm</b> <b>animals,</b> due to concerns about this practice promoting the emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. This trend has fueled interest in natural nutritional concepts.

The primary {{aim of this study}} was to explore the beliefs and attitudes of Brazilians citizens not associated with livestock <b>production</b> towards <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production.</b> A related secondary aim was to identify the specific beliefs and attitudes towards systems that are associated with restriction of movement. Each participant was shown pictures representing two of five possible major food animal industries (laying hens, beef cattle, pregnant sows, lactating sows, and poultry meat). Participants were presented a six pages survey that included demographic questions plus two sets of two pictures and a series of questions pertaining to the pictures. Each set of pictures represented a particular industry where one picture represented a housing type that is associated with behavioural restrictions and the other picture represented a system that allowed for a greater degree of movement. Participants were asked their perceptions on the prevalence of each system in Brazil, then their preference of one picture vs. the other, and the reasons justifying their preference. Immediately following, the participant repeated the same exercise with the second set of two pictures representing another industry followed by the same series of questions as described above. Quantitative data were analysed with mixed effects logistic regression, and qualitative responses were coded into themes. The proportion of participants that believed animals are reared in confinement varied by <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> type: 23 % (beef cattle), 82 % (poultry), 81 % (laying hens), and 60 % (swine). A large majority (79 %) stated that <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> are not well-treated in Brazil. Overall, participants preferred systems that were not associated with behavioural restriction. The preference for free-range or cage-free systems was justified based on the following reasons: naturalness, animals’ freedom to move, and ethics. A minority of participants indicated a preference for more restrictive systems, citing reasons associated with food security and food safety, increased productivity and hygiene. Our results suggest that the majority of our participants, preferred <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> systems that provide greater freedom of movement, which aligned with their perception that these systems are better for the animal. Our results provide some evidence that the current <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> housing practices that are associated with restriction of movement, which are gaining traction in Brazil, may not align with societal expectations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Commercial egg {{production}} {{is associated with}} various stresses decreasing productive and reproductive performance of layers. A {{growing body of evidence}} indicates that most of stresses in poultry production at the cellular level are associated with oxidative stress due to excess of free radical production or inadequate antioxidant protection. Recently, a concept of the cellular antioxidant defence has been revised with a special attention paid to cell signalling. Indeed, in animals, redox signalling pathways use reactive oxygen species (ROS) to transfer signals from different sources to the nucleus to regulate a number of various functions including growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The vitagene concept of fighting stresses emerged as a new direction in a nutritional research. Indeed, by improving the adaptive ability of animals to stress it is possible tosubstantially decrease negative consequences of various stresses in poultry and <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production.</b> The analysis of recently published data clearly showed that the anti-stress composition developed on the vitagene concept and supplied with drinking water is an effective means in fighting stresses in poultry production...|$|R
40|$|How may {{emergent}} biotechnologies {{impact upon}} {{our relations with}} other animals? To what extent are any changes indicative of new relations between society and nature? This paper critically explores which sociological tools can contribute {{to an understanding of}} the technologisation of animal bodies. By drawing upon interview data with animal scientists I argue that such technologies are being partly shaped by broader changes in agriculture. The complexity of genomics trajectories in animal science is partly fashioned through the deligitimisation of the productivist paradigm but continue to sit in tension around particular conceptions of sustainability in <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> <b>production.</b> In spite of this deligitimisation process genomics is now being framed in the context of a new productivism (termed the livestock revolution) bound up in projected global changes in animal consumption during the first half of the 21 st century. This potentially jars against both social trends that seek to re-enchant animal life and sustainability discourses which include social and environmental contexts. Nevertheless the possibility of a new productivism is supported by various interconnected trends including the emergence of a discourse of the ‘bioeconomy’ and a liberal regulatory apparatus for <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> breeding technologies. Ultimately an understanding of the possibility of emerging new bio-capitalisations on animal life should be set in a broader context of competing agricultural paradigms as well as ongoing tensions over ‘naturalness’ in human/animal relations...|$|R
