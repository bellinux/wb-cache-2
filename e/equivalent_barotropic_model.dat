40|$|An <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> tracer <b>model</b> and its adjoint {{are used}} to examine {{observed}} central European anomalies of potential vorticity (PV) in terms of advection and diabatic effects. The PV viewpoint yields a similar picture of six January anomalies to that found using a one-layer tropospheric temperature model, with {{the main component of}} the largest anomalies resulting from advection of PV present {{at the beginning of the}} month. Remote PV plays a larger role due to more rapid advection at upper levels. Anomalous diabatic effects are estimated as a residual from the tracer model itself. They are found to be of similar importance for the PV anomalies as are the (residual) source terms in the one-layer thermodynamic equation in the tropospheric temperature case. However, the spatial fields of the residual monthly averaged diabatic effects are noisier and more difficult to interpret than in the temperature case. An interpretation in terms of an estimate of the cross-isentropic mass flux at the base of the model is attempted...|$|R
40|$|Multiple equilibria of the wind-driven gyres {{have been}} found in {{idealized}} quasi- geostrophic and shallow water models. In this paper we demonstrate that multiple equilibria persist within a reduced gravity shallow water model under quite realis- tic continental geometry and windstress orcing for the North-Atlantic. Multiple mean flow patterns of the Gulf Stream exist and differ with respect to their separation behavior along the North-American coast. The origin of these equilibria is investigated by determining the structure of steady solutions within a hierarchy of <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> ocean <b>models</b> using continuation techniques. Within each model,the magnitude of lateral riction is used as a control parameter. It is shown that symmetry breaking, found in a quasi-geostrophic model for a rectan- gular ocean basin with idealized wind forcing is at the origin of two different mean states of the Gul Stream. The steady states ound become unstable only to a small number of oscillatory modes,which either have intermonthly or interannual periods. The modes of variability remain strongly related through the hierarchy of models indicating that their physics is not strongly dependent on the shape of the continents but is controlled by internal ocean dynamics...|$|R

The fitting procedure for the parameterized terms are described and the level of correspondence between the modelled and observed streamfunction tendencies {{as a function of the}} EOFs is examined.

40|$|A global, nonlinear, <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> is used {{to study}} the {{isentropic}} mixing of passive tracers by barotropic instability. Basic states are analytical zonal-mean jets representative of the zonal-mean flow in the upper stratosphere, where the observed 4 -day wave {{is thought to be}} a result of barotropic, and possibly baroclinic, instability. As is known from previous studies, the phase speed and growth rate of the unstable waves is fairly sensitive to the shape of the zonal-mean jet; and the dominant wave mode at saturation is not necessarily the fastest growing mode; but the unstable modes share many features of the observed 4 -day wave. Lagrangian trajectories computed from model winds are used to characterize the mixing by the flow. For profiles with both midlatitude and polar modes, mixing is stronger in midlatitude than inside the vortex; but there is little exchange of air across the vortex boundary. There is a minimum in the Lyapunov exponents of the flow and the particle dispersion at the jet maximum. For profiles with only polar unstable modes, there is weak mixing inside the vortex, no mixing outside the vortex, and no exchange of air across the vortex boundary. These results support the theoretical arguments that, whether wave disturbances are generated by local instability or propagate from other regions, the mixing properties of the total flow are determined by the locations of the wave critical lines and that strong gradients of potential vorticity are very resistant to mixing...|$|E
40|$|Theory and {{observations}} {{suggest that the}} Antarctic polar vortex is relatively isolated from midlatitudes, although others have interpreted the observations to indicate that there is substantial mixing from {{the interior of the}} vortex into middle latitudes. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> of Salby et al. is used to study quasi-horizontal mixing by the large-scale flow in the lower stratosphere during Southern Hemisphere spring, which is when the Antarctic ozone hole appears and disappears. The model is forced by relaxation to observed climatological monthly mean zonal-mean winds and by an idealized wave 1 or 2 forcing at the lower boundary. Mixing and transport are diagnosed primarily through Lagrangian tracer trajectories. For September, October, and November basic states, {{there is little or no}} mixing in the interior of the vortex. Mixing occurs near the critical lines for the waves: in the tropics and subtropics for a stationary wave 1, and in midlatitudes on the equatorial flank of the jet for an eastward-moving wave 2. For the December basic state, the wave 2 forcing rapidly mixes the interior of the vortex. Mixing of Lagrangian tracer particles can be significant even when the waves do not `break', as evidenced by the potential vorticity field. In the model there does not appear to be any significant transport of air out of the interior of the polar vortex prior to the vortex breakdown. The principal factor that leads to the vortex breakdown and mixing of the vortex interior is the deceleration of the jet to the point where winds in the interior of the vortex are close to the phase velocity of the wavenumber 2 forcing. The tracer transport is very similar to many aspects of the behavior of the total ozone field during the spring season...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} long-period {{variability}} of the Gulf Stream, sea level residuals {{relative to a}} 2 -year mean sea level in the Gulf Stream downstream of Cape Hatteras (between 75 deg W and 60 deg W longitude) are used. Residuals, as derived from Geosat altimetry between November 1986 and December 1988, were gridded {{in space and time}} at a temporal resolution of 10 days and spatial resolution of 1 / 4 deg. Complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analysis was applied to the data set to extract the spatially correlated signal with the original data subsampled to 1 / 2 deg. In addition to determining the space-time scales and propagation characterisitics of the different modes, wavenumber-frequency spectral techniques were used to separate the variability into propagating and stationary components. The CEOF technique applied to the data set indicated that the first four CEOF modes accounted for 60 % of the variability and were found to be above the noise leve 99 % of the time. CEOF 1 was associated with westward propagation at 5 km/d at a wavelength of 2000 km and eastward propagation at 1 - 2 km/d centered at a 500 -km wavelength. This first CEOF is in good agreement with thin-jet <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> <b>models</b> which predict westward propagation for wavelengths greater than 1130 km. A deflection of the wavelike pattern at 65 deg W also indicates a possible topographic effect. A simple scaling of the effect of topography indicates that for length scales longer than the internal Rossby radius of deformation, the topographic term is at least of the same order of magnitude as the beta effect. The second CEOF was more broadbanded in wavenumber space, with eastward propagation occurring in a wavenumber-frequency band between 300 and 1400 km and 0. 5 and 2. 0 cycles/yr. The third CEOF is similar in structure to the first, but with less energy. CEOF 4 was clearly identifiable with higher frequencies than the first three with westward propagation at 4 km/d. The spatial location of this mode along with the westward propagation indicates possible influences from eddy-stream interactions. Thus topography, Rossby wave dynamics and eddy-stream interactions all appear to have a significant role in determining the space-time scales and propagation properties of the long-period response of sea level in the Gulf Stream...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{ocean circulation}} is driven both by windstress forcing and by fluxes {{of heat and}} freshwater at the ocean-atmosphere surface. At midlatitudes, the most prominent features of the mainly wind-driven surface circulation are the large coherent circulation patterns (gyres) (chapter 1 : Fig. 1. 1). In the North Atlantic and North Pacific a relatively strong anticyclonic (subtropical) gyre is seen and a relatively weak cyclonic (subpolar) gyre. Along the western boundaries of the ocean basins strong currents exist. These currents {{are referred to as}} western boundary currents and the poleward-flowing currents carry warm water from the tropics to midlatitudes. Hence, they {{play an important role in}} the climate system. The major western boundary currents in the North Atlantic and North Pacific are called the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio, respectively. For a long time, observations have been pointing out that the Kuroshio displays bimodal meandering behavior off the southern coast of Japan (chapter 1 : Fig. 1. 4). For the Gulf Stream, weakly and strongly deflected paths near the coast of South Carolina have been observed (chapter 1 : Fig. 1. 3). This suggests that bimodal behavior may occur in the Gulf Stream as well, although less pronounced than in the Kuroshio. Apart from this bimodality, both currents show dominant variability on intermonthly timescales. Within a hierarchy of <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> <b>models</b> on a ß-plane (chapter 1), it is found that multiple mean flows are dynamically possible for the North Atlantic wind-driven circulation. Besides, the modes of intermonthly variability arising as instabilities on the mean states are closely linked within this hierarchy of models. Therefore, the two main questions addressed in this thesis (chapters 3 - 5) are: Can the observed (possible) bimodal behavior of the Kuroshio (Gulf Stream) be explained by transitions between multiple steady states? Can the observed variability of the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio on intermonthly timescales be explained by instabilities of the wind-driven ocean circulation? The approach that is followed in this thesis to answer these questions is to combine data analysis of observations and Ocean General CirculationModels, and dynamical systems analysis of intermediate complexity models. This approach is new, and therefore the connection between both types of analyses is studied in this thesis as well. The associated question is to what extent the statistical techniques are capable to extract dynamically relevant modes from the datasets. This question is addressed in both chapter 2 and chapter 6, where it is shown, in the context of intermediate ocean models with(out) additive noise, that the dominant (and/or statistically significant) statistical modes have dynamical relevance. In chapter 3 evidence is given from a high resolution simulation of the Parallel Ocean Climate Model (POCM) and from intermediate complexity models to support the hypothesis that multiple mean paths of both the Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream are dynamically possible. These paths are found as multiple steady states in a <b>barotropic</b> shallow-water <b>model</b> using techniques of numerical bifurcation theory. In POCM, transitions between similar mean paths are found, with the patterns having similarity to the ones in the observations as well. To study whether atmospheric noise can induce transitions between the multiple steady states, a stochastic component is added to the annual mean wind stress forcing in the <b>barotropic</b> shallow-water <b>model</b> and differences between the transition behavior in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio are considered. In chapter 4 dominant patterns of variability are determined using multivariate time series analyses of nonseasonal altimeter data and sea surface temperature observations of the North Atlantic, and more specific the Gulf Stream region. A statistically significant propagating mode of variability with a timescale close to 9 months is found, the latter timescale corresponding to dominant variability found in earlier studies. In addition, output from POCM is analyzed, which also displays variability on a timescale of 9 months, although not statistically significant at the 95...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} coherent vortices {{and spatial}} distributions of energy density in asymptotic states of numerically simulated, horizontally homogeneous, doubly periodic, quasi two-dimensional f-plane turbulence. With geophysical applications in mind, the paper progresses from freely decaying two-dimensional flow to freely decaying <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> flow, freely decaying two-layer quasi-geostrophic ~QG! flow, and, finally, statistically steady two-layer QG turbulence forced by a baroclinically unstable mean flow and damped by bottom Ekman friction. It is demonstrated here that, with suitable elaborations, a two-vortex state having a sinh-like potential vorticity/streamfunction (q/c) scatter plot arises {{in all of}} these systems. This extends, at least qualitatively, previous work in inviscid and freely decaying two-dimensional flows to flows having stratification, forcing, and dissipation present simultaneously. Potential vorticity steps and ribbons of kinetic energy are shown to form in freely decaying <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> flow and in the <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> limit of baroclinically unstable flow, which occurs when Ekman damping is strong. Thus, contrary to expectations, strong friction can under some circumstances create rather than hinder the formation of sharp features.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{long-term}} {{evolution of}} Gaussian eddies is studied in an <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> using both linear and nonlinear quasi-geostrophic theory {{in an attempt}} to understand westward propagating satellite altimetry tracked mesoscale eddies. By examining both individual eddies and a large basin seeded with eddies, it is shown that long term eddy coherence and the zonal wavenumber-frequency power spectral density are best matched by the nonlinear model. Individual characteristics of the eddies including amplitude decay, length decay, zonal and meridional propagation speed of a previously unrecognized quasi-stable state are examined to provide baseline properties for comparison with extended models. An analytical technique is then used for evaluating scales of motion of typical mesoscale eddies in order evaluate the success of existing models and find other more appropriate theories. Starting from the spherical shallow water equations and assuming geostrophic dominance, a potential vorticity conservation law is derived in terms of all four non-dimensional parameters inherent in the equations while retaining the spherical geometry. By retaining freedom in the parameters, the scales can be determined at which various theories remain valid. It is argued that the FP equation equation and a new extension to the FP equation are required to describe the mid-latitude mesoscale eddies. Analytical solutions to the FP equation are sought using the classical and exterior differential systems methods of group foliation. Both methods of group foliation are used to find the cnoidal solution of the Korteweg-de Vries equation, a one-dimensional form of the FP equation. An exact analytical solution is found for the radial FP equation, although it {{does not appear to be}} of direct geophysical interest, and a reduced quasi-linear hyperbolic system is derived for the two-dimensional FP equation. The forces driving the slow westward propagation of mesoscale eddies also underly a particle constrained to the surface of the earth, but are quantitatively misunderstood. Starting with a free particle and successively adding constraints, it is shown that the particle's motion is inertial, despite literature to the contrary, and that an accelerometer trapped in inertial motion would not measure an acceleration...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{waves are}} {{generally}} considered to have a baroclinic structure. However, analysis of ERA-Interim and NOAA OLR data for the period 1979 – 2010 shows that in the equatorial and Northern Hemisphere near-equatorial regions in the tropical Western Hemisphere (WH), westward- and eastward-moving transients, with zonal wavenumbers 2 – 10 and periods of 2 – 30 days, have little tilt in the vertical and {{can be said to}} be <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic.</b> The westward-moving transients in the equatorial region have large projections onto the westward mixed Rossby–gravity (WMRG) wave and those in the near-equatorial region project onto the gravest Rossby wave and also the WMRG. The eastward-moving transients have large projections onto the Doppler-shifted eastward-moving versions of these waves. To examine how such <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> structures are possible in the tropics, terms in the vorticity equation are analyzed. It is deduced that waves must have westward intrinsic phase speeds and can exist in the WH with its large westerly vertical shear. Throughout the depth, the advection of vorticity by the zonal flow and the β term are large and nearly cancel. In the upper troposphere the zonal advection by the strong westerly flow wins and the residual is partially balanced by vortex shrinking associated with divergence above a region of ascent. Below the region of ascent the β term wins and is partially balanced by vortex stretching associated with the convergence. An <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic</b> structure is therefore maintained in a similar manner to higher latitudes.

40|$|In this three-part study, {{a linear}} closure has been {{developed}} for the synoptic eddy and low-frequency flow (SELF) interaction and demonstrated that internal dynamics {{plays an important role}} in generating the leading low-frequency modes in the extratropical circulation anomalies during cold seasons. In Part III, a new linearized primitive equation system is first derived for time-mean flow anomalies. The dynamical operator of the system includes a traditional part depending on the observed climatological mean state and an additional part from the SELF feedback closure utilizing the observed climatological properties of synoptic eddy activity. The latter part relates nonlocally all the anomalous eddy-forcing terms in equations of momentum, temperature, and surface pressure to the time-mean flow anomalies. Using the observational data, the closure was validated with reasonable success, and it was found that terms of the SELF feedback in the momentum and pressure equations tend to reinforce the low-frequency modes, whereas those in the thermodynamic equation tends to damp the temperature anomalies to make the leading modes <b>equivalent</b> <b>barotropic.</b> Through singular vector analysis of the linear dynamical operator, it is highlighted that the leading modes of the system resemble the observed patterns of the Arctic Oscillation, Antarctic Oscillation, and Pacific–North American pattern, in which the SELF feedback plays an essential role, consistent with the finding of the <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> study in Part II. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study applies a {{systematic}} strategy for stochastic modeling of atmospheric low-frequency variability to a realistic <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> climate. This <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> climate has reasonable approximations of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Pacific/North America (PNA) teleconnections as its two leading principal patterns of low-frequency variability. The systematic strategy consists {{first of the}} identification of slowly evolving climate modes and faster evolving nonclimate modes by use of an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition. The low-order stochastic climate model predicts the evolution of these climate modes a priori without any regression fitting of the resolved modes. The systematic stochastic mode reduction strategy determines all correction terms and noises with minimal regression fitting of the vari-ances and correlation times of the unresolved modes. These correction terms and noises account for the neglected interactions between the resolved climate modes and the unresolved nonclimate modes. Low-order stochastic models with only four resolved modes capture the statistics of the original <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> modes quite well. A budget analysis establishes that the low-order stochastic models are dominated by linear dynamics and additive noise. The linear correction terms and the additive noise stem from the linear coupling between resolved and unresolved modes, and not from nonlinear interactions between resolved and unresolved modes as assumed in previous studies. 1...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Barotropic</b> <b>models</b> {{assume the}} {{atmosphere}} is nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. In other words, no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones).

If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the barotropic vorticity equation. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere.

Two classes of transience are considered: a monochromatic traveling wave, representative of discrete components such as the 5 - and 16 -day waves, and a second-order stochastic process representative of broadband variability.

500|$|In September 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby {{assembled}} {{an international}} group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast (i.e. routine predictions for practical use) {{based on the}} barotropic equation. Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Weather Bureau. [...] The JNWPU model was originally a three-layer <b>barotropic</b> <b>model,</b> also developed by Charney. [...] It only modeled {{the atmosphere in the}} Northern Hemisphere. [...] In 1956, the JNWPU switched to a two-layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates. The main assumption made by the thermotropic model is that while the magnitude of the thermal wind may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the baroclinicity in the atmosphere can be simulated using the [...] and [...] geopotential height surfaces and the average thermal wind between them. [...] However, due to the low skill showed by the thermotropic model, the JNWPU reverted to the single-layer <b>barotropic</b> <b>model</b> in 1958. [...] The Japanese Meteorological Agency became the third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959. [...] The first real-time forecasts made by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology in 1969 for portions of the Southern Hemisphere were also based on the single-layer <b>barotropic</b> <b>model.</b>|$|R
