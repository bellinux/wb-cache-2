40|$|We {{propose a}} new concept for {{determining}} the interior magnetic <b>field</b> vector <b>components</b> in neutron electric dipole moment experiments. If a closed three-dimensional boundary surface surrounding the fiducial volume of an experiment can be defined such that its interior encloses no currents or sources of magnetization, each of the interior vector <b>field</b> <b>components</b> and the magnetic scalar potential will satisfy a Laplace equation. Therefore, if either the vector <b>field</b> <b>components</b> or the normal derivative of the scalar potential can be measured {{on the surface of}} this boundary, thus defining a Dirichlet or Neumann boundary-value problem, respectively, the interior vector <b>field</b> <b>components</b> or the scalar potential (and, thus, the <b>field</b> <b>components</b> via the gradient of the potential) can be uniquely determined via solution of the Laplace equation. We discuss the applicability of this technique to the determination of the interior magnetic <b>field</b> <b>components</b> during the operating phase of neutron electric dipole moment experiments when it is not, in general, feasible to perform direct in situ measurements of the interior <b>field</b> <b>components.</b> We also study the specifications that a vector field probe must satisfy {{in order to determine the}} interior vector <b>field</b> <b>components</b> to a certain precision. The technique we propose here may also be applicable to experiments requiring monitoring of the vector magnetic <b>field</b> <b>components</b> within some closed boundary surface, such as searches for neutron-antineutron oscillations along a flight path or measurements in storage rings of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $g- 2 $ and the proton electric dipole moment.

40|$|Aperture based {{scanning}} {{near field}} optical microscopes are important instruments to study {{light at the}} nanoscale and to understand the optical functionality of photonic nanostructures. In general, a detected image is affected by both the transverse electric and magnetic <b>field</b> <b>components</b> of light.

Here, we develop a methodology to solve the inverse imaging problem and to retrieve the vectorial <b>field</b> <b>components</b> from polarization and phase resolved measurements. Our methodology relies on the discussion of the image formation process in aperture based scanning near field optical microscopes. On this basis, we are also able to explain how the relative contributions of the electric and magnetic <b>field</b> <b>components</b> within detected images depend on the chosen probe. We can therefore also describe the influence of geometrical and material parameters of individual probes within the image formation process.
