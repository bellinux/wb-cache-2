40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{development}} of Danish agriculture was characterised by concentration of land on fewer and larger farms and consequently increasing farm sizes. On basis of three case studies supplemented by national data we explore relationships between farm size change and farmland nature {{in terms of}} field sizes and hedgerow densities.

40|$|In Western Europe {{the fate}} of {{biodiversity}} is intimately linked to agricultural land use. A driving force behind biodiversity decline is the gradual conversion of Europe’s traditional integrated rural landscapes of nature and agriculture into monofunctional units of production. With these developments, semi-natural landscape elements have increasingly disappeared from agricultural landscapes. A growing body of research, however, underlines the importance of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes for biodiversity conservation, habitat connectivity, and ecosystem services. On the local scale, considerable variation between the relative area of landscape elements on individual farms can be observed. Farm management decisions are presumed to be important determinants for the composition of agricultural landscapes and the services provided to society.   By bringing together data from farmer interviews and aerial photographic imagery, this paper analyzes the predictive validity of farm management characteristics to understand the distribution of landscape elements on farmland parcels. The farm management parameters {{included in the study}} are relevant to current dominant trends in the Dutch agricultural sector; intensification, <b>scale</b> <b>enlargement,</b> diversification, and gradual termination of farming activities. <b>Scale</b> <b>enlargement</b> and migratory processes are found to be important predictors. The results of the Dutch case study provide insights in the threats and opportunities for the conservation of semi-natural habitat in agricultural landscapes. The findings present an empirical contribution to the debate on sustainable management of agriculture’s green infrastructure and, in broader perspective, the objective to reconcile agricultural production with the urging need of biodiversity conservation in Europe’s spatially contested countryside...|$|R

We inquire why such a phenomenon is so prominent based on a Keynesian growth model entirely compatible with a standard neoclassical microeconomics. The cost-minimizing investment plays a key role. Whenever the demand that each firm faces is constrain ed by the effective demand (such case includes the situation of monopolistic competition), a firm strives to raise the productivity of labor and save its production cost. Such a process incessantly continues even if the effective demand is kept intact. It also implies that the unemployment would tend to be unbounded because the labor productivity improves under the constant effective demand. As such, a ceaseless expansionary aggregate demand policy is inevitably required for sustaining explosive potentials of production. </p...|$|R
40|$|Improvement in {{government}} is often rooted in decentralised layers of government. In this article the authors discuss {{the recent history}} of innovations in sub-national government in Europe. They focus on two general trends and developments. Cases of interesting practices and developments illustrate the general trends. For each general trend a distinction is made between two kinds of innovations: structural reforms and new ways of working within existing institutional settings. The first trend concerns changing relations between government, civil society and citizens, in response to the increased contestation of the nature of traditional representative democracy. Examples of structural reforms are: increased citizen participation, the expanded use of referenda and the introduction of the directly elected mayor. New ways of working are: forms of coproduction between the public sector and the third sector. The second trend described in this article is change with{{in government}} itself, mainly the rise of ‘governance’ and changing administrative scales. Structural reforms take several forms: <b>scale</b> <b>enlargement</b> to enhance system capacity, scale reduction to enhance system capacity, <b>scale</b> <b>enlargement</b> to enhance citizen effectiveness, and scale reduction to enhance citizen effectiveness. Next to them, new ways of working can be observed within governments: cross-boarder co-operations, inter-municipal co-operations, and new forms of performance assessment and fiscal management. The authors conclude the article with a few challenges to both academics and governments. La mejora del gobierno se encuentra arraigada con frecuencia en los niveles descentralizados. En este artículo es el cambio dentro del gobierno mismo, principalmente la emergencia de la “gobernanza” y el cambio en el tamaño administrativo.
