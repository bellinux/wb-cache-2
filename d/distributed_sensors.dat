50|$|Originally {{intended}} {{to provide a more}} efficient mechanism for controlling industrial operations, the development of digital control systems allowed for flexibility in integrating <b>distributed</b> <b>sensors</b> and operating logic while maintaining a centralized interface for human monitoring and interaction. This ease of readily adding sensors and logic through software, which was once done with relays and isolated analog instruments, has led to wide acceptance and integration of these systems in all industries. However, these digital control systems have often been integrated in phases to cover different aspects of an industrial operation, connected over a network, and leading to a complex interconnected and interdependent system. While the control theory applied is often nothing more than a digital version of their analog counterparts, the dependence of digital control systems upon the communications networks, has precipitated the need for cybersecurity due to potential effects on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. To achieve resilience in the next generation of control systems, therefore, addressing the complex control system interdependencies, including the human systems interaction and cyber security, will be a recognized challenge.|$|E

The term future <b>distributed</b> <b>sensor</b> system {{refers to a system}} based on several sensors that will be developed within a period of five to ten years. Since researchers have not agreed on a more precise definition of intelligent agents, we first examined what constitutes an intelligent agent and made a definition suited for our application domain. We used our definition as a base for investigating if and how intelligent agents can be used in future <b>distributed</b> <b>sensor</b> systems. We argue that it is not interesting {{to come up with a}} general agent definition applicable to every agent, instead one should make a foundation for a definition. When this is done we can decide on more specific features depending on the task the agent will perform and in what domain the agent will work in. Finally we conclude that it is possible to use the agent technology in sensor systems and present four different agent types applicable to future <b>distributed</b> <b>sensor</b> systems...|$|R
