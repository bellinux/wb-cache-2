5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be <b>italicized</b> or underlined.|$|E

When {{referring to}} the gene product or phenotype, the mnemonic is first-letter capitalised and not <b>italicized</b> (e.g. DnaA – the protein produced by the dnaA gene; LeuA− – the phenotype of a leuA mutant; AmpR – the ampicillin-resistance phenotype of the β-lactamase gene bla).|$|E

5000|$|In Swedish Braille, [...] {{is used to}} {{capitalize}} an entire word, and [...] {{to capitalize}} several words.

60|$|But {{the teller}} {{of the comic}} story does not slur the nub; he shouts it at you--every time. And when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, and Italy, he <b>italicizes</b> it, puts some {{whooping}} exclamation-points after it, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis. All of which is very depressing, and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life.|$|R

5000|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with IPA symbols, {{it may be}} desirable to specify when native orthography is being used, so that, for example, the English word jet is not read as [...] "yet". This is done with angle brackets or chevrons: [...] It is also common to <b>italicize</b> such words, but the chevrons indicate specifically {{that they are in}} the original language's orthography, and not in English transliteration.|$|R
50|$|Capital letters {{should not}} be used to {{accentuate}} words on a form or document; it is too distracting and disrupts the look of the form or document. When capital letters are absolutely necessary, say {{in the case of an}} acronym or abbreviation, small caps should be used, with or without initial caps. When capital letters are not absolutely necessary, the technical communicator should evaluate the effectiveness of <b>italicizing</b> the word or phrase for emphasis.|$|R
50|$|Italics {{describe}} the sloping of letters setting it apart from non-italicized words (or vice versa). Using italics {{on a map}} also slightly decreases {{the size of the}} font as it shapely squeezes it around features. When introduced, the idea was to condense the text by <b>italicizing</b> it, thus creating more text on the pages. The slope in the font was created to mimic the flow of cursive handwriting and thus, the angles of italic letters range anywhere from 11 to 30 degree and consequently, serifs are absent.|$|R

5000|$|The Mad logo has {{remained}} largely unchanged since 1955, {{save for the}} decision to <b>italicize</b> the lettering beginning in 1997. For many years, the mysterious letters [...] "IND" [...] appeared in small type within the logo, between the M and the A. Sometimes the Mad logo included cavorting centaurs within the lettering, one of whom would be pointing directly at the IND. Though some fans speculated about the secret meaning of the [...] "M-IND" [...] message, the truth was more prosaic: from 1957 on, the magazine was handled by Independent News Distribution.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside {{the royal}} {{typographer}} Jacques Jaugeon, Truchet studied {{the proportions of}} typefaces using the French line ( [...] French inch), a measurement derived from silversmithing. The commission then invented the first typographic point, using minute fractions of the line to create a bitmap {{that could be used}} to mathematically describe and <b>italicize</b> metal type. Their system had unnecessarily great precision relative to the accuracy with which fonts could actually be cut. Further, it did not match the sizes of the fonts then in use. Fournier subsequently corrected these failings, using a larger point with greater compatibility with existing forms of type.|$|R
5000|$|... (6) From the {{dramatic}} {{point of view}} there is much dialogue and much play-acting. Play-acting is {{a key component of}} this prevalent use of dialogue. Troubert’s encounter with Mme de Listomère epitomizes one of Balzac’s recurrent preoccupations, that play-acting is the be-all and end-all of social life, that people say one thing whilst meaning another and that in social life a mask must be worn at all times. In Le Curé de Tours, as nowhere else in La Comédie humaine, Balzac <b>italicizes</b> within brackets what Troubert and Mme de Listomère each mean when they appear to be saying the opposite to one another.|$|R
