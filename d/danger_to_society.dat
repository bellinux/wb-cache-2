5|$|Seventeen {{days after}} his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a {{shooting}} spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, {{that he had not}} been sane {{at the time of the}} incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>society.</b> The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, Hindley {{admitted}} that the plea for parole she had submitted to the Home Secretary eight years earlier was [...] "on the whole... a pack of lies", and to some reporters her co-operation in the searches on Saddleworth Moor [...] "appeared a cynical gesture aimed at ingratiating herself to the parole authorities". Then Home Secretary David Waddington imposed a whole life tariff on Hindley in July 1990, after she confessed to having been {{more involved in the}} murders than she had admitted. Hindley was not informed of the decision until 1994, when a Law Lords ruling obliged the Prison Service to inform all life sentence prisoners of the minimum period they must serve in prison before being considered for parole. In 1997, the Parole Board ruled that Hindley was low risk and should be moved to an open prison. She rejected the idea and was moved to a medium-security prison; the House of Lords ruling left open the possibility of later freedom. Between December 1997 and March 2000, Hindley made three separate appeals against her life tariff, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>society,</b> but each was rejected by the courts.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{explores the}} social life of sex workers in Addis Ababa, {{the capital of}} Ethiopia. It focuses on the social ties between sex workers {{and a variety of}} other people, such as their family members, relatives, roommates, neighbors, coworkers, and clients. It explores these social ties in terms of the way they are (1) affirmed and reinforced, (2) {{strained}} and broken, and (3) initiated and cultivated by the women as a result of their engagement in sex work. The main thesis of the work is that sex workers share the same social milieu and value system with non-sex workers and that, despite severe constraints put on them by poverty and very difficult working conditions, they struggle on a daily basis to have a social life and social relevance. The work critiques the very common castigation of sex workers as social misfits who pose <b>dangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>society</b> and proposes a humane approach towards them and their dependents, an approach that should begin by making a clear distinction between the institu-tion of commercial sex and the women who practice it...|$|R
