Alpha-HMX and the hydrated Gamma-phase are obtained under special crystallisation conditions, whereas Delta is the high temperature phase. The following stability ranges are reported. Beta to 163 degree C, Alpha 104 - 162 degree C, Gamma ca. 156 degree C, Delta 156 - 279 degree C.

Curve fitting and deconvolution showed the necessity, for annealing temperatures above 120 degrees C, of adding a third component at 940 cm(- 1) to peaks at 934 and 943 cm(- 1). The 934 and 943 cm(- 1) peaks behave as a doublet, primarily due to the <b>delta</b> <b>phase,</b> with the splitting increasing on annealing. The 940 cm(- 1) peak is solely due to the gamma phase helix. Importantly, these assignments provide the opportunity for using these bands for further studies of complexation/decomplexation in such systems. The reduction in absorbance of 934 and 943 cm(- 1) peaks occurs at a lower temperature than the rise in the 940 cm(- 1) absorbance, and this is attributed to disordering of the <b>delta</b> <b>phase</b> helices prior to reformation as gamma phase helices. Similar measurements using deuterated syndiotactic polystyrene also showed helix and zigzag bands, but without a predominantly <b>delta</b> <b>phase</b> helix peak. Solvent peaks in the deuterated syndiotactic polystyrene/ethylbenzene system were used to monitor the delta to gamma phase transition.

The short Bi-O bonds of similar to 2. 1 - 2. 2 A degrees and the broad peak in the O-Bi-O angular distribution function at similar to 70 degrees of delta-Bi 2 O 3 are in good agreement with those from neutron diffraction, locally resembling the distorted structures of many fully ordered oxides of bismuth under ambient conditions. This places some doubt on structural models where the oxygen vacancies are either distributed at random over a set of "ideal" anion lattice sites or preferentially aligned in pairs at these positions. The irregular local structure of delta-Bi 2 O 3 is intimately connected to the pronounced electron density around bismuth, providing evidence for the presence of a sterochemically active "lone pair. " The dominant influence of the anion 2 p orbital on this asymmetry mirrors recent findings for many ordered post-transition-metal oxides and contrasts that of the conventional "ns(2) lone-pair model.

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of EEGs to measure the large-scale dynamics of the human brain, little is known on how the dynamics of EEGs relates to that of the underlying spike rates of cortical neurons. However, progress was made by recent neurophysiological experiments reporting that EEG delta-band phase and gamma-band amplitude reliably predict some complementary aspects of the time course of spikes of visual cortical neurons. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings, here we hypothesize that the EEG <b>delta</b> <b>phase</b> reflects shifts of local cortical excitability arising from slow fluctuations in the network input due to entrainment to sensory stimuli or to fluctuations in ongoing activity, and that the resulting local excitability fluctuations modulate both the spike rate and the engagement of excitatoryinhibitory loops producing gamma-band oscillations. We quantitatively tested these hypotheses by simulating a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons stimulated with dynamic inputs prese nting temporal regularities similar to that of thalamic responses during naturalistic visual stimulation and during spontaneous activity. The network model reproduced in detail the experimental relationships between spike rate and EEGs, and suggested that the complementariness of the prediction of spike rates obtained from EEG <b>delta</b> <b>phase</b> or gamma amplitude arises from nonlinearities in the engagement of excitatoryinhibitory loops and from temporal modulations in the amplitude of the network input, which respectively limit the predictability of spike rates from gamma amplitude or <b>delta</b> <b>phase</b> alone.
