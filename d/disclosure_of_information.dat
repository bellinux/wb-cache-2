40|$|This study {{measures}} the economic consequences <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security activities, in general, {{and more specifically}} the market value <b>of</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security activities. Since information security activities are primarily non-revenue generating, management tends to view them as the cost-of-doing-business, with no impact on firm value. Furthermore, managers are reluctant to share the details, because {{that they do not}} want to attract the attention of hackers. However, voluntary <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security can help reduce information asymmetry, which leads to belief revisions by investors, and hence corrects the misspecifications (if any) of the firm’s market value. In other words, voluntary <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> security activities are signaling mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security activities, and empirically test the value relevance <b>of</b> such <b>disclosures.</b> Based on a sample of 1, 637 disclosing firms, the empirical results provide support for the argument that voluntary <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> security activities are value-relevant. Industry-wide analyses support the disclosure taxonomy developed, and highlight that firms which are technology an...|$|R

25|$|The state secrets {{privilege}} {{serves a}} vital function {{by ensuring that}} private litigants cannot use litigation to force the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that, if made public, would directly harm the national security of the United States. The privilege has a long-standing history and has been invoked to protect such information. The privilege is firmly rooted in the constitutional authorities and obligations assigned to the President under Article II to protect the national security of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Large {{negative}} earnings surprises {{may have}} legal and reputational costs to managers. Firstly, managers {{can be held}} personally liable if shareholders sue the firm for failing to disclose negative earnings news promptly. Secondly, money managers may choose not to hold, and analysts may choose not to follow, the stocks of firms whose managers have reputations for withholding bad news. This may contribute to managers' voluntary <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> related to negative earnings surprises: quarterly earnings announcements containing large negative earnings surprises are preempted by voluntary disclosures more frequently than are other earnings announcements.|$|E

25|$|In January 2009 Harriet Harman, Leader of the House of Commons, tabled {{a motion}} which would exempt MPs' {{expenses}} from being disclosed under a Freedom of Information request, {{in order to}} prevent any further <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Labour MPs were placed under a three line whip in order to force the motion through the Commons. However, opposition parties stated they would vote against the proposals, and large-scale public opposition emerged. The proposals were ultimately dropped on 21 January 2009. The Commons authorities announced that full disclosure of all MPs’ expenses would be published on 1 July 2009.|$|E
25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005 the Freedom of Information Act 2000 {{came into}} force, {{allowing}} {{members of the}} public to request <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from public bodies. One early request came from the journalist Jon Ungoed-Thomas. Another request came from journalist and freedom of information campaigner Heather Brooke. Both asked for details of the expenses claimed by certain MPs to be released. The requests were subsequently passed over to the Information Commissioner, who joined the journalists' cases together and ordered the release of some information on 15 June 2007. House of Commons authorities objected to this order in June 2007 and MPs had, in May 2007, voted in favour of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill which sought to exempt MPs from the 2000 act. The House of Commons voted 96 to 25 in favour of the Exemption of the House of Commons amendment but the bill was ultimately withdrawn prior to second reading in the House of Lords because peers were unwilling to sponsor the bill.|$|E

25|$|Free Information Act – He {{has filed}} Senate Bill No. 109 (Free Information Act) to {{implement}} the Constitutional guarantee to free access by the people to official information, except when the disclosure of such information would jeopardize other prerogatives of the government, namely, {{the protection of the}} privacy of individuals, trade secrets, national security, public order and safety, and foreign diplomatic relations. The bill also proposes the adoption by all government bodies a mechanism wherein all written requests for information shall be responded to within two days, unless proper justification is given by the government body, subject only to the payment of reasonable fees for the viewing or reproduction of such information. To compel <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> in case a government body refuses access to such information on whatever grounds, the Office of the Ombudsman would be tapped to hear any citizens' complaints of not being properly assisted by the pertinent government body. Penalties will be levied to officials or employees who knowingly and unjustly refuse to provide access to information, or who consciously release false or misleading information.|$|E

In 2003, the commission commented that it [...] "has deployed a disproportionate percentage of its resources to the regulation of this sector, which represents {{only a minority of}} funds under management". In 2010 it commenced revision of disclosure rules, prompted by [...] "recent turmoil in the agribusiness scheme sector".|$|E
500|$|Section 1 of the Act inserts {{sections}} 43A to L {{into the}} Employment Rights Act 1996, titled [...] "Protected Disclosures". It provides that a disclosure which the whistleblower makes to their employer, a [...] "prescribed person", {{in the course}} of seeking legal advice, Ministers of the Crown, individuals appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose, or, in limited circumstances, [...] "any other person", is protected. In addition, the disclosure must be one which the whistleblower [...] "reasonably believes" [...] shows a criminal offence, a failure to comply with legal obligations, a miscarriage of justice, danger to {{the health and safety of}} employees, damage to the environment, or the hiding of information which would show any of the above actions. These disclosures do not have to be of confidential information, and this section does not abolish the public interest defence; in addition, it can be the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about actions which have already occurred, are occurring, or could occur in the future. In Miklaszewicz v Stolt Offshore Ltd, the Employment Appeal Tribunal confirmed that the disclosure does not have to have been made after the Act came into force; it is sufficient for the dismissal or other persecution by the employer to have happened after that time.|$|E

2500|$|Statutes {{governing}} the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> contained in welfare records exist in many jurisdictions. [...] The {{rationale for the}} existence of these regulations is to encourage full and frank disclosure by the welfare recipient of his situation and the protection of the recipient from the embarrassment likely to result from the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> contained in such records. [...] In some states, records can be disclosed at the discretion of the state director of welfare. [...] In general, welfare records are not public records, and should not be considered to be such. [...] <b>Disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is usually limited to purposes directly connected with the administration of welfare benefits. The investigation of costs of welfare programs have been held to be sufficiently related to the matters in question to justify disclosure.

The background of this research is based on the low level of compliance of local government in disclosing financial information through a website. This research employs multiple linear regression to analyze data. The population in this research is local governments in Indonesia that consists of 456 local governments. Sample procedure of this research is purposive sampling producing 187 local governments. Data type of this research is secondary data. Empirical results show that the size and wealth have a positive and significant influence on the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>information</b> through the website. In contrast, press visibility has a negative and significant effect on the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>information</b> through the website. Meanwhile, leverage, audit opinion, liquidity indicates insignificant effect on the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>information</b> through the website. The implications of this research is that the Ministry of Home Affairs should develop a system of reward and punishment in order to motivate local governments to disclose <b>of</b> financial <b>information</b> through the website.
