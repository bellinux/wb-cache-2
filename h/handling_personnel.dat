[...] At the Office of Personnel, Harrop was initially a placement officer and later deputy director of the Office of Washington Assignments. Around 1961, Harrop left Personnel and moved to the regional affairs office of the Bureau of European Affairs, where he replaced Arthur A. Hartman as a desk officer focused on EURATOM.|$|E

40|$|In {{health care}} policies, {{the right to}} {{complain}} {{is presented as a}} key patient right. Complaints are also seen as a potential vehicle for quality improvement. However, in long-term care facilities for older persons in the Netherlands, relatively few complaints are registered. An explorative qualitative study was performed at three long-term care facilities to examine the ways in which different relevant actors define and relate to complaints. We conducted observations and semi-structured interviews with 76 persons: residents, their family members, nurses, volunteers, middle (facility) and upper (institutional) managers and complaint <b>handling</b> <b>personnel.</b> Long-term care facilities are social contexts obeying complex social and cultural norms. There are great differences in how complaining and complaints are perceived. For most residents, 'complaining' had strong negative connotations: they expected it would lead to undesirable social consequences that could not outweigh possible advantages. To nurses it was important to hear of residents' dissatisfactions but communicative aspects were challenging. Institutional managers saw complaints as 'free advice' they wished to use to enhance the quality of the care provision. Complaint managers underlined the procedural aspects to complaints. A more appropriate and productive policy on complaints in this health care sector should take these differences into account...|$|E
40|$|Complaint {{handling}} encounters represent useful {{opportunities for}} retailers to rectify problems, salvage {{the relationship between}} the retailer and the customer, and increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Service recovery (complaint handling) therefore becomes critical “moments of truth” for organisations in their efforts to satisfy and retain customers. The purpose of the research was to explore and describe complainants’ evaluations of appliance retailers’ complaint handling procedures in terms of their perceptions of justice. In addition, the relationships between perceived justice and emotions and perceive justice and post-complaint behavioural intentions were explored. The unit of analysis was consumers who had encountered an appliance failure and had sought redress from the appliance retailer where the appliance was originally purchased (within a oneyear recall period). This study used a cross-sectional survey approach to capture real perceptions of justice, emotions and behavioural intentions. Convenience sampling was employed in Tshwane, a major metropolitan area of South Africa. Data was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 198 usable questionnaires were collected. The results of the exploratory factor analysis showed that respondents had specific expectations about retailers’ complaint handling. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the respondents indeed judged complaint handling in terms of procedural, interactional and distributive justice. They experienced procedural justice when complaint <b>handling</b> <b>personnel</b> followed company policy and the correct procedures in handling their complaints, when the employees were competent, when they resolved complaints in a timely manner and made it easy for the dissatisfied consumers to voice their complaints. The respondents experienced interactional justice when complaint <b>handling</b> <b>personnel</b> treated them with respect (were polite), made it easy for them to determine where to lodge their complaints (i. e. to whom they should complain in the company), communicated clearly (with adequate use of language), were appropriately concerned about the problem, took great effort in resolving the complaint, and provided them with an appropriate explanation as to why the appliance has failed. Verbal communication about where to complain forms part of respondents’ perception of the fairness of the interpersonal communications used in settling complaints factor, rather than the procedural justice factor. The respondents experienced distributive justice when they perceived that the redress (i. e. compensation: free repairs, product exchange, refund, voucher etc.) offered by the retailers was more they expected, was fair, was what they deserved or was what they needed. Respondents perceived that retailers’ were fair concerning procedural justice and distributive justice, but unfair concerning interactional justice. The strongest positive emotions that respondents experienced were gratitude, happiness, being valued and joyfulness, while lower levels of warm feelings and pride were experienced. The strongest negative emotions that respondents experienced were anger, annoyance, being upset and being in a bad mood, while lower levels of guilt and sadness were experienced. Relationships exist between respondents’ perceptions of justice and their emotions, and between their emotions and post-complaint behavioural intentions (repurchase intentions, word-of-mouth intentions and third-party complaint intentions).

40|$|In {{distribution}} networks {{a supplier}} transports goods from a distribution center to customers {{by means of}} vehicles with limited capacity. Drivers will drive routes on which they visit multiple customers to make deliveries. Typically, deliveries are made regularly and a fixed schedule is maintained. A fixed schedule is beneficial for many operational purposes, as it for instance allows for easy planning of the packing of the vehicles at the distribution center, or it allows the customer to roster the delivery <b>handling</b> <b>personnel.</b> A fixed schedule is often reused to make weekly deliveries {{for a period of}} a year or longer. However, at the moment of designing a schedule, the demand of the customers is usually unknown. Moreover, in most cases, demand of a customer will be different for each delivery. Therefore, {{it will be necessary to}} construct or adapt vehicle routes for each day of delivery, without deviating too much from the fixed schedule. In this thesis several different views on a fixed schedule are explored. It addresses the need from practice to incorporate the uncertainty of demand in transportation models to increase the efficiency of transport. Innovative vehicle routing models are presented taking uncertain or varying demand into account. New algorithms using state-of-the-art methods are presented based on these models, to construct fixed schedules and vehicle routes. The algorithms make use of recent scientific advances in mathematical programming, specifically in the domain of vehicle routing...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} impact of emissions from airports on human health and air quality has become a significant issue. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the dispersion behind an aircraft engine during idle-engine operations at airports. When these operations are conducted on the apron, jet engine emissions worsen the air quality where ground <b>handling</b> <b>personnel</b> works and passengers embark or disembark. Ground operations at airports are designed according to the International Civil Aviation Organization jet blast definition that indicates the exhaust gas velocity of 56 km/h as the threshold limit for the comfort of operations behind an aircraft, without considering the pollutants' dispersion and concentration levels. In this paper, carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH 2 O), and acrolein (C 3 H 4 O) dispersion behind a twin engine jet aircraft during idling is investigated using a computational fluid dynamic tool. The complete geometry of a Boeing 737 - 500 is used as reference. The steady-state simulation of turbulent jet flow is carried out using a realizable k − ε model. Three different scenarios are investigated at standard day conditions— 101, 325 Pa and 288 K, with no wind, and the plume concentrations are presented and discussed. CO, CH 2 O, and C 3 H 4 O concentration curves are drawn and compared with the exposure threshold limit defined by scientific international communities to guarantee human health. The information provided from this study represents a first step in understanding apron air quality issues during idle-engine operation...|$|E

40|$|The {{are many}} {{indicators}} {{used in industry}} to measure {{the performance of the}} work force. However, {{there is a lack of}} theoretical foundation and detailed descriptions of what measures to include and how to measure. Overall Worker Efficiency (OWE) is suggested in this article as a standard indicator to be applicable in all sorts of industries and levels of automation. The name OWE indicates its similarities to OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness). The theoretical design is similar, it is the ratio of “value adding” time to the total planned working time. However, there are many difficulties to define what value adding time is and what to include in the planned working time. Several variants of OWE are presented in this article. The selection of variant to be applied for a company should be based on the purpose for the measure. OWE can be used to follow up losses on station or line level, it can be used during a ramp-up phase to follow the number of extra personnel needed, or it can for example be used to monitor the need for support staff such as maintenance or material <b>handling</b> <b>personnel.</b> The OWE measure has been applied and tested at Volvo Cars engine plant in Skövde. That is a suitable test case since the company has a good control of their time bases. OWE requires that the intended cycle time or ideal working time is known and set by an objective method such as a pre-determined time system. In Volvo’s case MTM-SAM (Method Time Measurement – Sequenced-based Analysis Method). Data from the final assembly line was used for the test purpose and a practical work procedure was developed for Volvo. The OWE measure has the potential to be applied in all kinds of manual or semi-automatic production. The precondition is that the available time data has a good quality. The OWE measure can be used together with OEE in semi-automatic work and there will be a trade-off between them in practice where the decision of which one to maximize will depend on the bottle-necks and whether for example total cost or minimum lead-time is most important...|$|E
