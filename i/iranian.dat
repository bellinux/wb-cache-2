5|$|On 1 November 2012, two <b>Iranian</b> Su-25s fired cannon bursts at a USAF MQ-1 Predator drone 16 {{nautical}} {{miles off the}} <b>Iranian</b> coast. The <b>Iranian</b> government has claimed that the drone violated its airspace.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Iranian</b> Constitutional Revolution in 1905 {{triggered}} the <b>Iranian</b> women's movement, which aimed to achieve women's equality in education, marriage, careers, and legal rights. However, during the <b>Iranian</b> revolution of 1979, {{many of the}} rights that women had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the Family Protection Law.|$|E
50|$|Facing declining {{morale and}} with the Shatt-al-Arab {{waterway}} still blocked by the besieged <b>Iranians,</b> Saddam ordered the Iraqi troops to attack in June, 1981. The <b>Iranians</b> had reinforced the garrison with 15,000 troops, including the Pasdaran, regular army, and local Khuzestani Arab fighters. Iraq unleashed an offensive against the city, using 60,000 troops and tanks, outnumbering the <b>Iranians</b> 4-1. Despite that, the <b>Iranians</b> defeated the Iraqi assaults. The <b>Iranians</b> used their Chieftain tanks to help defeat the Iraqis.|$|R
25|$|Iraqis share {{religious}} and certain cultural ties <b>Iranians.</b> The majority of <b>Iranians</b> are Twelver Shia (an Islamic sect established in Iraq), {{although the majority}} of <b>Iranians</b> were Sunni Muslims and did not convert to Shia until the Safavids forced Shi'ism in Iran.|$|R

5|$|According to {{the private}} American {{intelligence}} agency Stratfor,a fifth <b>Iranian</b> scientist was poisoned by Mossad in 2007. However, in 2014 the scientist's sister accused the <b>Iranian</b> government of involvement in her brothers killing.|$|E
5|$|Before Arsaces I of Parthia {{founded the}} Arsacid Dynasty, he was {{chieftain}} of the Parni, an ancient Central-Asian tribe of <b>Iranian</b> peoples {{and one of}} several nomadic tribes within the confederation of the Dahae. The Parni most likely spoke an eastern <b>Iranian</b> language, {{in contrast to the}} northwestern <b>Iranian</b> language spoken at the time in Parthia. The latter was a northeastern province, first under the Achaemenid, and then the Seleucid empires. After conquering the region, the Parni adopted Parthian as the official court language, speaking it alongside Middle Persian, Aramaic, Greek, Babylonian, Sogdian and other languages in the multilingual territories they would conquer.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{government}} of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An <b>Iranian</b> judoka, Arash Miresmaeili, did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the <b>Iranian</b> government, an amount paid to all <b>Iranian</b> gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.|$|E
50|$|According to Moaddel and Azadarmaki (2003), {{fewer than}} 5% of <b>Iranians</b> {{do not believe}} in God. A 2009 Gallup poll showed that 83% of <b>Iranians</b> said {{religion}} {{is an important part of}} their daily life. Non-religious <b>Iranians</b> are officially unrecognized by the government. The irreligiosity figures in the diaspora are higher, notably among Iranian-Americans.|$|R
50|$|With such static defenses, the Iraqis had {{effectively}} made frontal assault {{through the}} flat lands {{virtually impossible for}} the <b>Iranians.</b> Thus the <b>Iranians</b> would launch their amphibious attacks.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 23 May 1982, the <b>Iranians</b> began the drive towards Khorramshahr across the Karun River. This part of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas was spearheaded by the 77th Khorasan {{division}} with tanks along with the Revolutionary Guard and Basij. The <b>Iranians</b> hit the Iraqis with destructive air strikes and massive artillery barrages, crossed the Karun River, captured bridgeheads, and launched human wave attacks towards the city. Saddam's defensive barricade collapsed; in less than 48 hours of fighting, the city fell and 19,000 Iraqis surrendered to the <b>Iranians.</b> A total of 10,000 Iraqis were killed or wounded in Khorramshahr, while the <b>Iranians</b> suffered 30,000 casualties. During the whole of Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas, 33,000 Iraqi soldiers were captured by the <b>Iranians.</b>|$|R
5|$|On January 12, 2016, <b>Iranian</b> {{armed forces}} {{captured}} United States Navy personnel when their boats entered <b>Iranian</b> territorial waters {{off the coast}} of Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf.

5|$|The <b>Iranian</b> Embassy siege {{took place}} from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after {{a group of}} six armed men stormed the <b>Iranian</b> embassy in South Kensington, London. The gunmen, members of an <b>Iranian</b> Arab group campaigning for Arab {{national}} sovereignty in the southern <b>Iranian</b> region of Khuzestan Province, took 26 people hostage—mostly embassy staff, but also several visitors {{as well as a}} police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of Arab prisoners from prisons in Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom. Margaret Thatcher's government quickly resolved that safe passage would not be granted, and a siege ensued. Over the following days, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Iranian</b> {{government}} accused Israel of {{complicity in}} the killings. In 2011 and 2012, <b>Iranian</b> authorities arrested a number of Iranians alleged to have carried out the assassination campaign on behalf of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence service). Western intelligence services and U.S officials reportedly confirmed the Israeli connection. In June 2012, the <b>Iranian</b> government was confident that it had arrested all the assassins.|$|E
50|$|The {{battle of}} Khorramshahr {{was the first}} major {{engagement}} between Iraqi and <b>Iranians</b> forces in the war. After occupying the city on October 26, the city remained in Iraqi hands until April 1982, when the <b>Iranians</b> launched Operation Beit ol-Moqaddas (Persian: بیت المقدس) to recapture the Khuzestan province. The first attack (April 30 to May 12) consisted of 70,000 Revolutionary Guard troops and succeeded in pushing the Iraqis out of the Ahvaz-Susangerd area. The Iraqis withdrew back to Khorramshahr and, on May 20, launched a large counter-attack against the <b>Iranians,</b> which was repulsed. The <b>Iranians</b> then launched an all-out assault on Khorramshahr, capturing two of the defense lines in the Pol-e No and Shalamcheh region. The <b>Iranians</b> gathered near the Shatt al-Arab (known as Arvand Rud in Iran) waterway, surrounding the city and, thus, beginning the second siege. The <b>Iranians</b> finally recaptured the city on May 24 after two days of bitter fighting and heavy losses, capturing 19,000 soldiers from a demoralized Iraqi Army after the fighting was over.. As a result, the Iraqis now know May 24 as “bad lucky Day”, although the <b>Iranians</b> celebrate the day as the Liberation of Khorramshahr.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} decades, global {{migration}} has increased and many immigrant groups {{have a higher}} prevalence than the native born population of several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including poor dietary habits. However, it is uncertain if dietary habits in immigrant populations reflect dietary habits in {{their country of origin}} or if the current diet is a consequence of the migration and possible change of dietary habits. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine possible dietary differences between elderly <b>Iranians</b> living in Stockholm, Sweden with elderly <b>Iranians</b> living in Tehran, Iran, taking into account sex, age, marital status, and education. Methods Dietary intakes were assessed by semi - quantitative food frequency questionnaire in a cross-sectional study of 121 <b>Iranians</b> living in Stockholm and 52 <b>Iranians</b> living in Tehran, aged 60 - 80. Differences in dietary habits between the two groups was analysed by bootstrapped regression analyses with 1000 replications. Results <b>Iranians</b> living in Sweden had significantly higher intake of protein, total fat, fiber than <b>Iranians</b> living in Iran, but lower consumption of carbohydrates. The observed differences in intake of macronutrients were reflected in consumed amount of all food items, which were higher among <b>Iranians</b> living in Iran with the exception of bread and grain consumption which was lower. Conclusions There are general differences in dietary habits between <b>Iranians</b> living in Iran and <b>Iranians</b> living in Sweden. Parts of observed differences in dietary habits may reflect a favourable adoption process to the Swedish dietary habits after migration. Meanwhile other differences are point of concern in light of the high prevalence of overweight, among <b>Iranians</b> living in Sweden and can have unfavourable impact in particular in the context of cardiovascular health. </p...|$|R

5|$|The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Phantoms saw heavy {{action in}} the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s and are kept {{operational}} by overhaul and servicing from Iran's aerospace industry. Notable operations of <b>Iranian</b> F-4s during the war included Operation Scorch Sword, an attack by two F-4s against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor site near Baghdad on 30 September 1980, and the attack on H3, a 4 April 1981 strike by eight <b>Iranian</b> F-4s against the H-3 complex of air bases in the far west of Iraq, which resulted in many Iraqi aircraft being destroyed or damaged for no <b>Iranian</b> losses.|$|E
5|$|The Scythians were a {{group of}} north <b>Iranian</b> nomadic tribes, {{speaking}} an <b>Iranian</b> language (Scythian languages) who had invaded Media, killed Cyrus in battle, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and {{the shores of the}} Black Sea as they lived between the Danube River, River Don and the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|The embassy {{building}} was severely damaged by fire. It {{was more than}} a decade before the British and <b>Iranian</b> governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the British embassy in Tehran, which had been damaged during the 1979 <b>Iranian</b> Revolution. <b>Iranian</b> diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iranians</b> {{attacked}} the vital oil-producing Majnoon Island by landing troops by helicopters onto the islands and severed the communication lines between Amarah and Basra. The <b>Iranians</b> continued theattack towards Qurna.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Iranians</b> {{launched}} their {{assault on the}} peninsula at night, their men arriving on rubber boats. After taking the Faw, the <b>Iranians</b> built a pontoon bridge and began to dig in.|$|R
50|$|Thus the <b>Iranians</b> were {{eventually}} {{driven out of}} their positions, and the highway retaken by the Iraqis; however, the latter sustained massive losses {{in the air as}} a result. Operation Badr resulted in 10,000 casualties for Iraq and 15,000 casualties for Iran and the Iraqi counterattacks were able to force the <b>Iranians</b> back to their previous lines, sustaining almost as heavy casualties as the <b>Iranians.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ethnogenesis of Croats is {{uncertain}} {{and there are}} several competing theories, Slavic and <b>Iranian</b> being the most frequently put forward. The most widely accepted of these, the Slavic theory, proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period. Conversely, the <b>Iranian</b> theory proposes <b>Iranian</b> origin, based on Tanais Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names Χορούαθ, Χοροάθος, and Χορόαθος (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as anthroponyms of Croatian people.|$|E
