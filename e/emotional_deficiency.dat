To assess the specificity of the <b>emotional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in psychopathy, we examined the effects of self-reported psychopathy on the emotional modulation of the startle blink reflex during distinct emotional events (erotic, thrill, love, threat, victim, disgust, anger, and sad) in both non-{{criminal and}} criminal populations. It was expected that psychopathic traits would be related to a deviant startle reflex modulation. However, no solid evidence for a deviant startle modulation was found in any of these studies. Only distinct associations between self-report ratings and psychopathic traits were established.

40|$|Peculiarities of {{development}} and signs of emotional burnout syndrome among teaching staff of theoretical departments at Higher State Educational Establishment of Ukraine “Bukovinian State Medical University” have been examined. To diagnose the degree of emotional burnout adapted V. V. Boyko’s method was applied according to which not only signs of emotional burnout, degree of formation and stages {{of development}} of emotional burnout syndrome can be detected, but availability of psychosomatic and psycho-vegetative disorders as well. Formation of emotional burnout syndrome among educators is considered to have three stages: exertion, resistance and exhaustion. Exertion stage is predominantly characterized by excessive worries caused by psychological traumatic experience, anxiety and depression. Resistance stage is manifested by emotional thriftiness and emotional-moral disorientation. Exhaustion stage is characterized by <b>emotional</b> <b>deficiency,</b> psychosomatic and psycho-vegetative disorders. Two teachers {{in the study were}} found to develop two stages of emotional burnout – exertion and resistance. Their main symptoms are sensations of being cornered which is indicative of the development of intellectual-emotional block condition, desire to finish working day quickly, feelings of anxiety and depression with simultaneous formation of professional duty reduction symptom. Resistance stage was found in six teachers with its dominating signs like reduction of professional duties, low interest to work and deterioration of professional activity. Resistance and exhaustion stages were found in four teachers. Their most pronounced symptoms were wider emotional thriftiness, which is indicative of a limited communication with the audience, decreased interest in work and <b>emotional</b> <b>deficiency,</b> when people lose their professional abilities changing positive emotions into negative ones, become rude in communication. Four teachers, women mostly, were found to develop all the three stages of emotional burnout syndrome. Their dominating signs were worries concerning psychological traumatic circumstances characterized by intensified irritation and lack of confidence to people, accumulated dissatisfaction of the situation. At the same time, the most pronounced sign was wide emotional thriftiness which is indicative of lack of desire to communicate with the audience and decreased interest in work. It was proved that the signs of emotional burnout syndrome were not found among teachers depending on an educational subject, although emotional burnout develops more frequently while working with English-speaking students...|$|E

40|$|Psychopathy is a {{disorder}} that {{is characterized by}} marked <b>emotional</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Because previous studies suggest that an individual's sensitivity to bodily signals [...] or "interoceptive awareness" [...] is associated with various components of emotional functioning, the authors expected this capacity to be reduced in psychopathic individuals. Therefore, the current study {{examined the relationship between}} psychopathy and interoceptive awareness by assessing heartbeat detection abilities in a group of 75 male personality disordered offenders, varying in their degree of psychopathy, as assessed with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 2003). Regression analyses revealed that PCL-R Facet 4, which reflects antisocial behavior, was predictive of reduced interoceptive awareness. These findings suggest that the expression of psychopathic behavior might be influenced by an attenuated sensitivity to one's own bodily signals...|$|R

Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in identifying pleasant and disgusting smells. Methods: Participants were 55 OCD patients and 80 healthy controls, also matched for history of cigarette smoking. They were administered a smell identification test consisting of a subsample of 13 smells from the Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) in addition to two new smells. Participants were exposed to smells from liquids in glass bottles. Results: The OCD patients were significantly impaired compared to the healthy controls in identifying the smells. When controlling for anxiety, this group difference remained stable only for disgusting but not pleasant smells. An effect of patients in different symptom dimensions on smell identification was also found. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in OCD, a specific dysfunction related to emotional appraisal of sensory stimuli, {{in the absence of}} a sensory deficit, may be apparent.

40|$|Psychopathic {{individuals}} {{identified through}} contemporary instruments vary considerably in personality and etiological background, which creates confusion {{in practice and}} inconsistency in data. The goal {{of this paper is}} to clarify this heterogeneity and introduce a new typology to narrow down psychopathic subcategories. Towards this end, we will discuss the conceptual history of psychopathy, compare the construct-validity of different psychopathy measures (DSM, PCL-R, PPI-R, and TriPM), and review cluster-analytic studies to identify more homogenous categories. In line with the existing literature, the psychopathic population is broadly divided into a primary and secondary category which diverge crucially in personality (reward/punishment sensitivity, neuroticism, impulsivity, hostility) and etiology (genetic contributions, fronto-limbic circuitry, serotonergic functioning, and testosterone/cortisol endocrinology). Secondary psychopathy may be situated on a continuum with the antisocial or borderline personality disorder because it represents a more severe but not qualitatively different form of environment-contingent emotional disturbance (e. g., prefrontal cortex malfunctioning, serotonin deficiency, impaired predictive allostasis), whereas primary psychopathy is a unique condition that is strongly rooted in a constitutionally defined <b>emotional</b> <b>deficiency</b> (e. g., limbic hyporesponsivity, serotonin hyperstability, dampened reactive allostasis). However, both primary and secondary psychopathic samples show high levels of withingroup heterogeneity and may be placed on their own continuum of, respectively, self-control and affect instability. Concluding, we will introduce a new continuum of primary psychopathy (controlled to disinhibited) and secondary psychopathy (detached to unstable) and discuss how these subtypes may differ on a number of psychopathy measures, personality profiles, and endophenotypic pathways. Finally, future directions for resolving conceptual issues are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) and Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) are {{primarily}} women’s syndromes. Both syndromes are highly contested within the biomedical and scientific communities {{and within the}} general population. Because there is no apparent cause for the syndromes and no available treatment, women living with FMS and/or CFIDS must live with difficult and disabling symptoms. This research also analyzes the metaphors used in the scientific and biomedical literature to describe the same symptoms as listed above. A comparison is drawn between this analysis and {{that focused on the}} women’s use of metaphors. It is found that although many of the metaphors are the same, they differ in discursive employment. Environmental metaphors, along with metaphors of fracture, harm and productivity are used by the research participants with a very different intent than how the same metaphors are used in the biomedical literature. The women used the metaphors to reveal the ways in which their symptoms are influenced by the social and cultural forces in their everyday lives.

40|$|Despite similar <b>emotional</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> primary psychopathic {{individuals}} can be situated {{on a continuum}} that spans from controlled to disinhibited. The constructs on which primary psychopaths are found to diverge, such as self-control, cognitive flexibility, and executive functioning, are crucially regulated by dopamine (DA). As such, {{the goal of this}} review is to examine which specific alterations in the meso-cortico-limbic DA system and corresponding genes (e. g., TH, DAT, COMT, DRD 2, DRD 4) might bias development towards a more controlled or disinhibited expression of primary psychopathy. Based on empirical data, it is argued that primary psychopathy is generally related to a higher tonic and population activity of striatal DA neurons and lower levels of D 2 -type DA receptors in meso-cortico-limbic projections, which may boost motivational drive towards incentive-laden goals, dampen punishment sensitivity, and increase future reward-expectancy. However, increasingly higher levels of DA activity in the striatum (moderate versus pathological elevations), lower levels of DA functionality in the prefrontal cortex, and higher D 1 -to-D 2 -type receptor ratios in meso-cortico-limbic projections may lead to increasingly disinhibited and impetuous phenotypes of primary psychopathy. Finally, in order to provide a more coherent view on etiological mechanisms, we discuss interactions between DA and serotonin that are relevant for primary psychopathy...|$|R
40|$|According to {{developmental}} psychology childhood {{is the time}} when the child develops, both the personality as well as the whole body. All the factors influencing the child from the very begining have a fundamental meaning for the shaping of the young human. All the deficiencies that a child experiences during early childhood have great repercussions in the later stages of development of their life. <b>Emotional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> cause disorders in this field. Excessive care can also bring serious consequences. The most important role in this process is played by the child’s parents (caregivers), closely and distantly related family environment, peers, educational institutions supporting parents in upbringing along with teachers. The way in which education is achieved decides the whole existence of the young human. The participation of children in the process of education is extremely important. Parents should strive to create such learning situations in which pupils may be active in gaining information about the surrounding natural and social world. Their cognitive awareness should be addressed by situations attractive to them. Children in the family should feel unselfish joy of meeting new people, things and phenomena. In this way the first social contacts connected with learning trigger positive attitudes to the social world. It will encourage the child to research new information. It will naturally shape their subjective attitude to themselves, other people and the culture in which they she lives...|$|R
30|$|The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning was {{recently}} established {{to promote the}} integration of social-emotional skills in general school education in the U.S. (Oberle et al. 2016). The Collaborative underscored {{the importance of social}} competence and social-emotional well-being in the on-going development of children and adolescents, particularly during early childhood (Oberle et al. 2016). A growing wealth of literature in recent years has reflected the significant association between social-emotional development and health as well as social-emotional well-being. Children who are socially competent and social-emotionally well-developed will have a higher chance of enjoying success in education, acquiring future employment, and establishing secure and stable social relationships (Jones et al. 2015). They {{are less likely to be}} involved in criminal activities, substance use and abuse, and mental health problems (Public Health England 2014). It has also been established that social and <b>emotional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are major obstacles for children to be well-adapted in schooling and result in many behavioural problems such as disruptive behaviours, aggression, oppositional, and non-compliant behaviours (Domitrovich et al. 2007). However, good social and emotional development provides a foundation for good adjustment in schools and, in turn, enhances the sense of belonging, which has been reported to be correlated with positive affect, academic self-efficacy, and academic achievement (Duckworth and Seligman 2005; Goodenow 1993; Mouratidis and Sideridis 2009; Nix et al. 2013; Ray and Smith 2010). These have strengthened the argument for the need of early childhood intervention programmes to support later positive learning outcomes in all domains, by maintaining a focus on the promotion of healthy social-emotional development (Taylor et al. 2013; Yurgelun-Todd 2007).|$|R

Methods: We conducted the study using the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF) and the Cloninger’s Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) in 122 university students from different schools. Results and Conclusion : Results demonstrated that there are high level of positive as well as negative correlations between most of TCI items and some of the sub-scales of the YSQ, including vulnerability, social isolation and defectiveness. In consistent with the Halvorsen et al. ’s findings, our study demonstrated that harm avoidance had a positive relationship with several EMSs, including <b>emotional</b> deprivation, <b>deficiency,</b> dependence, failure, subjugation and selfsacrifice.

40|$|Abstract Background Narcolepsy causes {{dramatic}} behavioral {{alterations in}} both humans and dogs, with excessive sleepiness and cataplexy triggered by <b>emotional</b> stimuli. <b>Deficiencies</b> in the hypocretin system are well established as {{the origin of}} the condition; both from studies in humans who lack the hypocretin ligand (HCRT) and in dogs with a mutation in hypocretin receptor 2 (HCRTR 2). However, little is known about molecular alterations downstream of the hypocretin signals. Results By using microarray technology we have screened the expression of 29760 genes in the brains of Doberman dogs with a heritable form of narcolepsy (homozygous for the canarc- 1 [HCRTR- 2 - 2] mutation), and their unaffected heterozygous siblings. We identified two neuropeptide precursor molecules, Tachykinin precursor 1 (TAC 1) and Proenkephalin (PENK), that together with Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS 2), showed reduced expression in narcoleptic brains. The difference was particularly pronounced in the amygdala, where mRNA levels of PENK were 6. 2 fold lower in narcoleptic dogs than in heterozygous siblings, and TAC 1 and SOCS 2 showed 4. 4 fold and 2. 8 fold decrease in expression, respectively. The results obtained from microarray experiments were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Interestingly, it was previously shown that a single dose of amphetamine-like stimulants able to increase wakefulness in the dogs, also produce an increase in the expression of both TAC 1 and PENK in mice. Conclusion These results suggest that TAC 1, PENK and SOCS 2 might be intimately connected with the excessive daytime sleepiness not only in dogs, but also in other species, possibly including humans. </p...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of EnglishE. M. Forster's fiction, {{conservative}} in form, {{is in the}} English tradition of the novel of manners. He explores the <b>emotional</b> and sensual <b>deficiencies</b> of the English middle class, developing his themes by means of irony, wit, and symbolism. A Passage to India (1924) treats the relations between a group of British colonials and native Indians and considers the difficulty of forming human relationships, of “connecting”. In 1971, Maurice, a novel Forster had written in 1913 – 14, was published posthumously. A homosexual, Forster had refrained from publishing it during his lifetime because of the work’s sympathetic treatment of homosexuality. The {{story of a young}} man's self awakening, Maurice treats a familiar Forster theme, the difficulty of human connection. This thesis examines Forster’s life and the two major novels, A Passage to India and Maurice, and shows how Forster “connected” to others while helping to revitalize and perpetuate the nearly dead form of the novel of manners, a form of the novel that continued throughout the 20 th century alongside the more institutionally celebrated traditions of modernism and post-modernism...|$|R

Assessments included evaluation of somatic and psychological complaints, depression, fatigue, vigor, tension, state and trait anxiety, iconic memory, short-term memory, long-term memory and perceptual-motor skill. The control group consisted of 41 healthy men, matched for age. Growth hormone secretion was more severely impaired in MPHD than in IGHD patients. Despite oral replacement therapy, MPHD patients also had lower serum testosterone levels than IGHD subjects. The MPHD patients {{were found to have}} lower vigor scores, higher state anxiety scores, worse perceptual-motor skill and worse memory performance than controls. In contrast, IGHD patients only showed subnormal memory performance. It was concluded, therefore, that the cognitive impairment in both MPHD and IGHD was related to GH deficiency. The subnormal vigor scores in MPHD patients were attributed to the reduced testosterone levels. The worse perceptual-motor skill in MPHD patients might be related specifically to ACTH deficiency. Finally, the higher state anxiety in MPHD was attributed to a low self-esteem, which may be the psychological consequence of the hypogonadal appearance these patients have. We conclude that, from a psychological point of view, MPHD and IGHD adult patients are quite distinct groups...|$|R
5000|$|Flourishing, in {{positive}} psychology, refers to optimal human functioning. It comprises four parts: goodness, generativity, growth, and resilience (Fredrickson, 2005). According to Fredrickson (2005), goodness {{is made up}} of: happiness, contentment, and effective performance; generativity is about making life better for future generations, and is defined by “broadened thought-action repertoires and behavioral flexibility”; growth {{involves the use of}} personal and social assets; and resilience reflects survival and growth after enduring a hardship (p. 685). A flourishing life stems from mastering all four of these parts. Two contrasting ideologies are languishing and psychopathology. On the mental health continuum, these are considered intermediate mental health disorders, reflecting someone living an unfulfilled and perhaps meaningless life.

Although Fredrickson claims that her experimental results are still valid, these experimental results have also been questioned due to poor statistical methodology, and Alan Sokal has pointed out that [...] "given and Losada's experimental design and method of data analysis, no data whatsoever could possibly give any evidence of any nonlinearity in the relationship between [...] "flourishing" [...] and the positivity ratio — much less evidence for a sharp discontinuity." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{percent of}} young {{children}} with dental caries in the United States has increased to levels that make it a major public health problem. Approximately a quarter of {{children between the ages}} of 2 and 5 years old have experienced dental caries in the United States, but these numbers vary greatly among groups, especially among those who are of a low socioeconomic status or in a minority. Dental pain as a result from dental caries has impacts on the child’s quality of life. They may have physical problems, e. g. failure to thrive or vitamin <b>deficiencies,</b> <b>emotional</b> problems, e. g. easily irritated, or social problems, e. g. missing school or day care. Dental caries can be caused by many environmental and biological factors working together, such as diet, oral health behaviors, microorganisms of the oral cavity, and genetic predisposition, and ongoing research is beginning to reveal the possible mechanisms underlying some of these relationships. Treatment can be costly and is not readily available in all areas. If caries are not prevented and treatment is not procured, the financial burden increases and the child’s long term health outcome worsens. Prevention techniques can be started in the home by practicing good oral health and avoiding sugary foods and beverages, especially before bed or during the night. Topical applications to improve the strength of the enamel, such as fluoride, reduce risk. Regular evaluations of oral health are important, but due to a lack of dental professionals that are trained to work with children, this is not always available. Some programs are training and incentivizing professionals to work with this population to increase coverage. With better accessibility to dental care and more research into the causes behind tooth decay in young children, the public health problem of early childhood caries can be alleviated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{topic of}} my bachelors thesis, {{entitled}} "Suicidal Behaviour in Children and Adolescents is swathed {{in a certain}} mystery. Even though {{it is the second}} most common cause of death in young people, it is rarely discussed and often overlooked. Perhaps all of us once in our lives, especially during adolescence, have wondered thought what would happen if we were no longer be here, if we were to leave this world voluntarily. But of course it is a very big step from having the idea to actually putting it into practice. This work focuses specifically on those children and adolescents who went so far that they tried to cross the boundary dividing life and death. The theoretical part covers suicidal behaviour in general and explains some of the terms associated with this subject. This section also discusses the different forms and methods involved in suicidal behaviour. Another important part comprises the risk factors or developmental aspects of suicidal behaviour and the concept of death. Also worth mentioning is self-harming, which is closely connected with suicidal activities. The last chapter is devoted to prevention, which is this case is indispensable. The aim of my work is to describe the disorder of the self-preservation instinct and to assess the characteristics shared by a sample of children and adolescents with a case history of suicidal behaviour. Based on the information available I decided to carry out a qualitative survey. The documents analysis method was used for this. More specifically, this was documentation available concerning children and adolescents who had been observed as having a disorder of the self-preservation instinct. The research sample consisted of fifteen boys with a case history of suicidal behaviour and who were hospitalized in a mental institution. As this was a small, monothematic sample group, I opted for the qualitative form of work. The most crucial result of the research was the finding that children with suicidal habits come from a background with a low level of emotion and inadequate <b>emotional</b> support. These <b>deficiencies</b> then make it harder for the person to adapt and unable to deal with conflict situations...|$|R
40|$|Background: International {{research}} has shown that language delay (LD) is associated with social, cognitive, <b>emotional</b> and/or behavioural <b>deficiencies,</b> but there is still a need for extended knowledge about LD at early age and its relationship with long-term language impairment and neuropsychiatric disorders in Swedish children. Aims: To study (a) if children with a positive screening result or a negative screening result at 2 ½ years of age showed persistent or transient language difficulties at 6 years of age and, (b) whether or not children identified by language screening at 2 ½ years of age were diagnosed with language, neurodevelopmental and/or neuropsychiatric impairments at school age. Materials and methods: At the 2 ½-year screening 25 children with LD and 80 screening-negative children constituted the study population, i. e. in all 105 children (Study I). At the 6 -year examination the follow-up group consisted of 99 children – 22 children from the LD group and 77 children from the screening-negative group (Study II). The 7 - 8 -year-old follow-up (study III and IV) included 21 of the 22 children with LD who participated in study II. Screening results from nurses were re-classified blindly (study I) by the use of Reynell Developmental Language Scale. Study II included tests that examined both reception and production in different areas of speech and language as well as linguistic awareness. Study III and IV consisted of a multidisciplinary in-dept examination of language, intellectual functions and the presence of neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders. Results: The sensitivity of the screening tool was 0. 69, and the specificity was 0. 93 (study I). The 6 -year examination showed that there was still a highly persistent and significant difference between the children with and without LD on almost every variable tested (study II). In studies III-IV it was found that 62 % of the LD children also had received a neuropsychiatric diagnosis at age 7 - 8 years: eight children were diagnosed with ADHD and five children with ASD. Half of the 21 children with LD had marked problems with performance on narrative tasks according to the Bus Story test and the NEPSY Narrative Memory Subtest independently of co-occurrence of neuropsychiatric disorder. The only difference between the children with LD pure and those who had LD+AD/HD or LD+ASD was on Freedom from Distractibility, where children with AD/HD and ASD scored low. In addition, children with ASD had a much lower overall cognitive level (FSIQ) and poorer results on tasks assessing Processing Speed. Conclusion: It is possible to identify children with LD at 2 ½ years of age. All children identified with LD at 2 ½ years of age also appeared to be at later risk of complex neurodevelopmental/ neuropsychiatric disorders. Remaining language problems at 6 years of age strongly predicted the presence of neuropsychiatric/ neurodevelopmental disorders at age 7 - 8 years. The observed difficulties, including narrative problems, in the LD children indicate that these children are at high risk of persistent language impairment and future problems concerning reading and writing. Clinical implications: Children identified with late developing language at 2 ½ years of age need to be followed carefully for several years. Follow-up should include neuropsychiatric as well as speech-language assessments, and the multidisciplinary team should be particularly prepared to diagnose ASD, AD/HD, and various kinds of learning disorders. Assessment of non-word repetition, semantic and narrative skills at the follow-up occasions may be a useful clinical tool for identifying children with more persistent subtle language problems who are at risk of academic failure...|$|R
