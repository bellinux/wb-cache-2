5|$|At {{the time}} of {{discovery}} in 2001, 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris b. Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another periodicity in the data unaccounted for by the first planet. This periodicity could be <b>explained</b> by assuming that a second planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris c, existed in the system with an orbital period close to 7 years. Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the periodicity could not be <b>explained</b> by stellar activity, making the planet interpretation more likely. The planet was announced in 2002.|$|E

40|$|It is “easy” to <b>explain</b> doing, “hard” to <b>explain</b> feeling. Turing has set {{the agenda}} for the easy {{explanation}} (though {{it will be a long}} time coming). I will try to <b>explain</b> why and how <b>explaining</b> feeling will not only be hard, but impossible. <b>Explaining</b> meaning will prove almost as hard because meaning is a hybrid of know-how and what it feels like to know how...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated whether {{studying a}} text with an "explanation intention" and then actually <b>explaining</b> it to (fictitious) {{other students in}} writing, would yield the same benefits as previously found for <b>explaining</b> on video. Experiment 1 had participants first studying a text either with the intention to <b>explain</b> it to others or to complete a test, and subsequently restudying vs. <b>explaining</b> in writing. Neither study intention nor <b>explaining</b> affected learning outcomes. Experiment 2 directly compared <b>explaining</b> in writing and on video. Participants studied a text with a test intention followed by restudy, or study with an explanation intention followed by either <b>explaining</b> in writing or on video. <b>Explaining</b> on video, but not in writing, enhanced learning more than restudy. These {{findings suggest that the}} benefits of <b>explaining</b> on video are not a result of engaging in explanation per se. Results are discussed in light of feelings of social presence...|$|R

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now <b>explained,</b> by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} <b>explained</b> if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E

40|$|What {{is it to}} <b>explain</b> away an intuition? Philosophers {{regularly}} {{attempt to}} <b>explain</b> intuitions away, but it is often unclear what the success conditions for their project consist in. I attempt to articulate some of these conditions, taking philosophical case studies as guides, and arguing that many attempts to <b>explain</b> away intuitions underestimate the challenge the project of <b>explaining</b> away involves. I will conclude, therefore, that <b>explaining</b> away intuitions is a more difficult task than has sometimes been appreciated; I also suggest, however, {{that the importance of}} <b>explaining</b> away intuitions has often been exaggerated...|$|R

5|$|Helmholtz <b>explained</b> why the {{oscillation}} decayed {{but he had}} not <b>explained</b> why {{it occurred}} in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E
