40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} an overview of the b-dominance order over the natural numbers, N, using the base b expansion of natural numbers. The b-dominance order is an accessible partially-ordered set that is less complex than the <b>divisor</b> <b>relation</b> but more complex than ≤; thus, it supplies a good medium through which an undergraduate can be exposed to the subject of order theory. Here we discuss many ideas in order theory, including the Poincaré polynomial and the Möbius function. Acknowledgements: The authors thank the M. J.

40|$|Relational division, {{also known}} as small divide, is a derived {{operator}} of the relational algebra that realizes a many-to-one set containment test, where a set is represented {{as a group of}} tuples: Small divide discovers which sets in a dividend relation contain all elements of the set stored in a <b>divisor</b> <b>relation.</b> The great divide operator extends small divide by realizing many-to-many set containment tests. It is also similar to the set containment join operator for schemas that are not in first normal form. Neither small nor great divide has been implemented in commercial relational database systems although the operators solve important problems and many efficient algorithms for them exist. We present algebraic laws that allow rewriting expressions containing small or great divide, illustrate their importance for query optimization, and discuss the use of great divide for frequent itemset discovery, an important data mining primitive. A recent theoretic result shows that small divide must be implemented by special purpose algorithms and not be simulated by pure relational algebra expressions to achieve efficiency. Consequently, an efficient implementation requires that the optimizer treats small divide as a first-class operator and possesses powerful algebraic laws for query rewriting. ...|$|E

40|$|For {{a complex}} {{polynomial}} D(t) of even degree, one may define the continued fraction of √(D(t)). This was found relevant already by Abel in 1826, {{and later by}} Chebyshev, concerning integration of (hyperelliptic) differentials; they realized that, contrary to the classical case of square roots of positive integers treated by Lagrange and Galois, we do not always have pre-periodicity of the partial quotients. In this paper we shall prove that, however, a correct analogue of Lagrange's theorem still exists in full generality: pre-periodicity of the degrees of the partial quotients always holds. Apparently, this fact was never noted before. This also yields a corresponding formula for the degrees of the convergents, for which we shall prove new bounds which are generally best possible (halving the known ones). We shall further study {{other aspects of the}} continued fraction, like the growth of the heights of partial quotients. Throughout, some striking phenomena appear, related to the geometry of (generalized) Hyperelliptic Jacobians. Another conclusion central in this paper concerns the poles of the convergents: there can be only finitely many rational ones which occur infinitely many times. (This is crucial for applications to a function field version of a question of McMullen.) Our methods rely, among other things, on linking Padé approximants and convergents with <b>divisor</b> <b>relations</b> in generalized Jacobians; this shall allow an application of a version for algebraic groups, proved in this paper, of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem.

40|$|Abstract. Some <b>divisor</b> class <b>relations</b> for genus 0 curves are proved {{and used}} to compute the Cartier divisor class of the virtual {{canonical}} bundle for genus 0 maps to a smooth target. Many results here first appeared in [6] and [5]; our proofs use a completely different method. 1. Statement of results Let X be a smooth, projective variety over a characteristic 0 field k, and denote by M 0,r(X, β) the Kontsevich moduli space of genus 0, r-pointed stable maps to X of class β. Behrend and Fantechi defined a perfect obstruction theory for M 0,r(X, β), i. e., a complex E • perfect of amplitude [− 1, 0] together with a map to the cotangent complex φ: E • → L • M 0,r(X,β) such that h 0 (φ) is an isomorphism and h − 1 (φ) is surjective. In many cases φ is a quasi-isomorphism, and then the dualizing sheaf on M 0,r(X, β) is the determinant det(E •). For this reason det(E •) is called the virtual canonical bundle. This paper gives a formula, Proposition 7. 2, for the virtual canonical bundle in terms of tautological divisor classes on X, modulo torsion...|$|R
40|$|We obtain {{several new}} {{characterizations}} of splayedness for divisors: a Leibniz property for ideals of singularity subschemes, the vanishing of a `splayedness' module, and the requirements that certain natural morphisms of modules and sheaves of logarithmic derivations and logarithmic differentials be isomorphisms. We {{also consider the}} effect of splayedness on the Chern classes of sheaves of differential forms with logarithmic poles along splayed divisors, {{as well as on}} the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of the complements of these <b>divisors.</b> A postulated <b>relation</b> between these different notions of Chern class leads to a conjectural identity for Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of splayed divisors and subvarieties, which we are able to verify in several template situations.

40|$|We {{initiate}} {{the study of}} wall crossing phenomena in orientifolds of local toric Calabi-Yau 3 -folds from a topological string perspective. For this purpose, we define a notion of real Donaldson-Thomas partition function at the large volume, orbifold and non-commutative point in Kaehler moduli space. As a byproduct, we refine the constant map contribution to the partition function of the real topological string on a local toric background. We conjecture the general relation between the real large volume and real non-commutative/orbifold Donaldson-Thomas partition function of orientifolds of local toric Calabi-Yau 3 -folds without compact <b>divisors.</b> The conjectured <b>relation</b> is confirmed at hand of the conifold and local A_n singularity, for which we explicitly derive the real non-commutative/orbifold Donaldson-Thomas partition function combinatorially.

40|$|Arithmetic {{conditions}} relating particle masses can {{be defined}} {{on the basis of}} (1) the supersymmetric conservation of congruence and (2) the observed characteristics of particle reactions and stabilities. Stated in the form of common <b>divisors,</b> these <b>relations</b> can be interpreted as expressions of genetic elements that represent specific particle characteristics. In order to illustrate this concept, it is shown that the pion triplet ({pi}{sup {+-}}, {pi}{sup 0 }) can be associated with the existence of a greatest common divisor d{sub 0 {+-}} in a way that can account for both the highly similar physical properties of these particles and the observed {pi}{sup {+-}}/{pi}{sup 0 } mass splitting. These results support the conclusion that a corresponding statement holds generally for all particle multiplets. Classification of the respective physical states is achieved by assignment of the common divisors to residue classes in a finite field F{sub P{sub {alpha}}} and the existence of the multiplicative group of units F{sub P{sub {alpha}}} enables the corresponding mass parameters to be associated with a rich subgroup structure. The existence of inverse states in F{sub P{sub {alpha}}} allows relationships connecting particle mass values to be conveniently expressed in a form in which the genetic divisor structure is prominent. An example is given in which the masses of two neutral mesons (K{degree} {r_arrow} {pi}{degree}) are related to the properties of the electron (e), a charged lepton. Physically, since this relationship reflects the cascade decay K{degree} {r_arrow} {pi}{degree} + {pi}{degree}/{pi}{degree} {r_arrow} e{sup +} + e{sup {minus}}, in which a neutral kaon is converted into four charged leptons, it enables the genetic divisor concept, through the intrinsic algebraic structure of the field, to provide a theoretical basis for the conservation of both electric charge and lepton number. It is further shown that the fundamental source of supersymmetry can be expressed in terms of hierarchical relationships between odd and even order subgroups of F{sub P{sub {alpha}}}, an outcome that automatically reflects itself in the phenomenon of fermion/boson pairing of individual particle systems. Accordingly, supersymmetry is best represented as a group rather than a particle property. The status of the Higgs subgroup of order 4 is singular; it is isolated from the hierarchical pattern and communicates globally to the mass scale through the seesaw congruence by (1) fusing the concepts of mass and space and (2) specifying the generators of the physical masses...|$|R
