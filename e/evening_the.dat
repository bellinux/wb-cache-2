5|$|The system {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September 21. The wave was not well-organized with only scattered thunderstorm activity and large area of low pressure.

Early on September 23, Dvorak classification estimates were introduced. Little change in organization took place until the evening of September 24. That <b>evening,</b> <b>the</b> low-level circulation and banding features became better defined as the system tracked west-northwest.
