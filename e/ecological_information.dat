25|$|In 2007 Smith et al. {{expanded}} {{on these}} results by barcoding 2,134 flies belonging to {{what appeared to}} be the 16 most generalist of the ACG tachinid morphospecies. They encountered 73 mitochondrial lineages separated by an average of 4% sequence divergence and, as these lineages are supported by collateral <b>ecological</b> <b>information,</b> and, where tested, by independent nuclear markers (28S and ITS1), the authors therefore viewed these lineages as provisional species. Each of the 16 initially apparent generalist species were categorized into one of four patterns: (i) a single generalist species, (ii) a pair of morphologically cryptic generalist species, (iii) a complex of specialist species plus a generalist, or (iv) a complex of specialists with no remaining generalist. In sum, there remained 9 generalist species classified among the 73 mitochondrial lineages analyzed.|$|E
