25|$|In 1947 Dunner {{was brought}} by Schonfeld to Stamford Hill in north London, and <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{spend the rest}} of his life. In London, with the help of Rabbi Schonfeld, Dunner set up the London Beis Yaakov Seminary for girls of {{post-school}} age, one of the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. Previously, it had been possible for the daughters of Orthodox Jewish families in London to be sent to the Continent to complete their studies, but this was no longer an option after the Holocaust.|$|E
500|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} at the time two U.S. officials as stating the operation was [...] "a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S. doesn't kill unarmed people trying to surrender", but that [...] "it {{was clear from the}} beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering". White House counterterrorism advisor John O. Brennan said after the raid: [...] "If we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive, if he didn't present any threat, the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that." [...] CIA Director Leon Panetta said on PBS NewsHour: [...] "The authority <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> kill bin Laden.... Obviously under the rules of engagement, if he in fact had thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him. But, they had full authority to kill him." ...|$|E
500|$|Use of {{the steam}} engine {{also began to}} make the horse {{redundant}} in farm work. In a letter to The Farmer's Magazine in 1849, Alderman Kell of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, commented that [...] " ... has been said, although perhaps not mathematically correct, to show that horses are kept at vast expense in comparison with a steam engine that eats only when it works." [...] With {{the invention of the}} portable steam engine in the 1840s, which was promoted by the Royal Agricultural Society, steam-powered machines could be used on small farms. One man could invest in a portable machine, and recoup the cost by hiring it out for haymaking and harvest; the only use for horses <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> move the machine from one place to another. [...] There were about 3.3million horses in late Victorian Britain. In 1900 about a million of these were working horses, but by 1914 this number had dropped to between 20,000 and 25,000.|$|E

500|$|Mike Johnson, from PWInsider, {{said that}} the main event was [...] "Really good, hard hitting, well told story here. [...] Easily the best thing {{on the show and}} a really good main event." [...] However, he criticized the Magnus-Sting due to [...] "The idea <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make Magnus by having Sting lose clean in a back and forth contest. [...] On paper, it made sense but the match didn't feel like it had the spark needed for that sort of moment". Also, {{described}} Ethan's debut as [...] "pitch-perfect". He described the entire show as [...] "It was just a show - some good, some eh, but Bound for Glory should never be just a show, it's their Wrestlemania, except this year, it wasn't. Pat McNeill, from PWTorch, said Bound for Glory [...] "Wasn't a great event". Bob Kapur, from CANOE Slam, said that he enjoyed the event overall. Also, Matthew Asher, from CANOE too, enjoyed the PPV but said the ultimate success of this Bound for Glory rests on the future storylines this event sets up.|$|E
2500|$|Claymoor is {{more famous}} as {{the target of}} satires by Caragiale, in his Momente și schițe series—one of his {{favorite}} techniques <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> pastiche Claymoor's [...] "pirouettes-and-colored-ribbons" [...] prose. Caragiale's sketch [...] "High-life", first published on Christmas Eve 1899, is entirely dedicated to Claymoor, who appears as [...] "Edgar Bostandaki" [...] or [...] "Turturel" [...] ("Turtledove"), chronicler for the fictional Voice of the Aurochs. A licentious typo subverts his description of a high-society dame as an [...] "indefatigable sylphid", {{and he has to}} deal with her husband's wrath (readers were left unsure as to what the hinted typo was).|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Lim of The New York Times {{stressed}} that [...] "there {{is virtually no}} music on the soundtrack of this tense, methodical thriller. Long passages are entirely wordless. In {{some of the most}} gripping sequences what you hear mostly is a suffocating silence." [...] Skip Lievsay, the film's sound editor called this approach [...] "quite a remarkable experiment," [...] and added that [...] "suspense thrillers in Hollywood are traditionally done almost entirely with music. The idea <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> remove the safety net that lets the audience feel like they know what's going to happen. I think it makes the movie much more suspenseful. You're not guided by the score and so you lose that comfort zone." ...|$|E

2500|$|To try {{and create}} a more pleasurable {{travelling}} experience, CrossCountry [...] has designated four stations as alternative changeover stations. Cheltenham Spa, Derby, Leamington [...] Spa and Wolverhampton were selected. The aim <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make connection times shorter - with the stations selected being much smaller. For example, meaning that passengers travelling from Cardiff [...] to Edinburgh could change at Cheltenham Spa instead of Birmingham New Street reducing transfer times - at Cheltenham [...] Spa [...] both trains would arrive and depart from the same platform. This avoids having to change trains at Birmingham New Street, which is a larger, more complex station. These four stations are marked on the CrossCountry route map, in yellow.|$|E
2500|$|Emunoth ve-Deoth (Kitāb al-amānāt wa-al-iʿatiqādāt), the Book of Beliefs and Opinions: This work is {{considered}} to be the first systematic attempt to synthesize the Jewish tradition with philosophical teachings. Prior to Saadia, the only other Jew to attempt any such [...] fusion was Philo [...] Saadia's objective <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> show the parallelism between the truths delivered to the people of Israel by Divine revelation, on the one side, and the necessary conclusions that can also be reached by way of rational observation, on the other. The effect of these ideas expressed in his philosophical books are clearly reflected in Saadia's story of creation, especially when he comes to deal with the theological problems, such as in the verse of Deuteronomy 4:24: “For the LORD your God is a devouring fire,” which constitutes an example of a verse that cannot be understood in its plain context, but should rather be understood {{in such a way as}} not to contradict one's definite knowledge that God does not change, nor can anything corporeal be associated with him.|$|E
2500|$|Titans {{running backs}} coach Earnest Byner said of Ringer “You {{can see the}} running skills, {{the things that we}} saw when we watched him at Michigan State, Good patience, good body lean, the ability to set the inside zones, acceleration, vision. Can he go in and compete on offense? Yes he can. With the way things are progressing, with the {{competition}} … that competition is going to make that third position much better." [...] When describing the role of the 3rd string running back, Jeff Fisher said [...] "The rotation is, for the most part, like it was last year, So the third running back will be called upon if the second back can’t play, and to be a good player on special teams." [...] Ringer commented on the role, saying [...] "Special teams can help you win or lose a game. My goal coming in <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be a productive player anyway possible. If special teams is it then that will be it. I know that’s {{going to be a big}} deal. I know I’ll get my chance sooner or later.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Hosking's clients, {{led by the}} Abney Park Cemetery's {{founder and}} indefatigable company {{secretary}} George Collison II, worked with him to prepare a unique design for the Stoke Newington cemetery. Collison increasingly came {{to the view that}} Hosking's layout and architectural styles should meet a brief of being symbolic of the cemetery's founding ideals; to reflect the fact that <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be the first nineteenth-century garden cemetery to be neither consecrated, nor set out by Act of Parliament, giving it both a non-denominational character and also permitting inclusion of spaces and designs for wider educational and public access purposes. Hosking's buildings must also respect the landscape, for here, unlike other cemeteries of its period, use of the land for interment was partly viewed as a convenient means to achieve other common purposes; all of the original founders were Congregationalists who shared an underlying motivation to preserve and encourage interest and appreciation in the landscape of Abney Park that [...] "spoke to them" [...] of the memory of Isaac Watts and Lady Mary Abney. The promoters hoped that the burial fees would provide the revenue to meet this romantic objective.|$|E
2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I am grateful for the tidal wave that came down on me. The activism that goes on online is [...] important." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Sting {{eventually}} won the tournament, Luger was {{the only}} participant to go undefeated (Sting got pinfall victories over Muta and Flair, giving him the most points to win the tournament). This elevated Sting {{to the status of}} No.1 contender for Flair's world title. With Sting and Flair set to square off at WrestleWar in February, Luger was booked to defend the U.S. Title against [...] "Dr. Death" [...] Steve Williams on the card. A legitimate injury to Sting, however, caused the entire booking of the card to get changed. Luger was elevated to face Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. An injured Sting appeared in Luger's corner during the match, eventually being attacked by Ole and Arn Anderson. When Luger left the ring to help Sting he was counted out, giving the match to Flair. The idea <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build Luger up as a [...] "changed man" [...] that had [...] "gained self-respect" [...] by saving Sting. In the final match of the feud, a few months later at the Capital Combat event in Washington, DC, Luger won by disqualification against Flair in a steel cage match when the cage rose up from the ground and outside interference marred the match.|$|E
