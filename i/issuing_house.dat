40|$|Using {{the records}} of several leading 19 th century <b>issuing</b> <b>houses,</b> this paper {{analyses}} the transformation of underwriting practices in London's primary sovereign bond market from 1870 to 1914. It shows how underwriting risk developed from being a liability, which market intermediaries sought to avoid, to becoming a valuable financial commodity. The impetus for this development was increased competition in the loan business from the 1880 s onwards, which weakened the negotiating position of <b>issuing</b> <b>houses</b> and forced them to shoulder an increasing share of the underwriting risk. <b>Issuing</b> <b>houses</b> had to find methods {{to deal with this}} risk, but they were initially hamstrung by public perception of underwriting as detrimental to the interests of ordinary investors. Firms began to adopt informal underwriting arrangements, with limited scope, but these only allowed for a relatively limited distribution of underwriting risk to third parties, the danger of which was exposed during the Baring crisis. Consequently formal underwriting syndicates were developed, allowing for a greater dissemination of underwriting risk. This meant that the risk associated with issuing loans could be broken down into sufficiently small tranches so that no underwriter had to shoulder a risk greater than what he desired. As a result underwriting risk came {{to be seen as a}} profitable investment opportunity, a financial commodity in its own right, and a means of patronage for <b>issuing</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{the incidence of}} initial public offerings (IPOs) issued by UK companies with existing venture capital investors and sponsored (and underwritten) by issuing houses that are parents or affiliates of the venture capital backers. The effects {{on the performance of}} the stock offering of the resulting conflicts of interest between the venture capitalist-affiliated sponsors and the investors taking up the stock is examined. Contrary to the conflicts-of-interest hypothesis, IPOs underwritten by VC affiliates perform better in the long-term than other IPOs. We also examine the role of the reputation of the financial firms involved in the IPO. The long-term performance of UK IPOs is found to be positively related to the reputation of the venture capital backers. In the short-term, IPO returns appear {{to be related to the}} prestige of the sponsor rather than the venture capitalist in that top 15 underwriters are associated with lower short-term returns. Although there is evidence of higher initial returns in IPOs where the sponsor and venture capitalist are affiliated, this is offset by an approximately equal reduction in initial returns if the venture capitalist is associated with an <b>issuing</b> <b>house</b> which may or may not act as the actual IPO sponsor. Thus, the net effect is that backing by venture capitalists with links to issuing houses reduces initial returns but only if those affiliates are in fact not employed as the actual sponsors to the offerings...|$|E
40|$|The IPO market {{provides}} {{owners of}} firms and entrepreneurs with an exit for their equity investments {{and the opportunity}} to raise new capital. One empirical measure of how good a job the stock market has done for issuing firms over time is IPO underpricing. Yet, nothing is known about underpricing in Britain, nor, with one exception, about underpricing anywhere else before 1959. This thesis presents a new long-run IPO data set and analyses the change in underpricing over time. Contrary to my prior expectation and despite improvements in the regulation, disclosure, investor protection and underwriting of IPOs, underpricing rises {{in the second half of}} the century compared to the interwar years. This rise cannot be explained by any composition effect in the IPO sample or change in issue method. Plausible explanations for this puzzle include the rise of <b>issuing</b> <b>house</b> monopsonistic power, provincial competition, the exacerbation of a winner's curse and the resort to underpricing as an anti-takeover strategy in the second half of the last century. The thesis looks at the first of these possibilities and concludes that whilst reputable issuing houses appeared to neither lower nor exacerbate underpricing, they collectively failed to recommend the highly effective method of the tender offer to their corporate clients. The remaining hypotheses are to be researched in post-doctoral work. The thesis also examines how IPO underpricing and survival behaved during the two episodes of investor exuberance about technology stocks in Britain in the last century, the 1920 s and 1990 s. The jump in underpricing of "technology" IPOs in 1928 - 29 was as nothing to that witnessed in 1999 - 2000. On the other hand, survival of the 1999 - 2000 IPOs was much improved compared to the earlier period. Whilst the underpricing findings suggest that industry was not at all badly treated by the London stock market in the interwar years and was leaving small amounts of "money on the table" compared to thereafter, the survival evidence indicates the opposite to be true. A market such as that in 1928 - 29 where IPOs had less than a 50 % chance of surviving to their fifth birthday as a quoted company was unacceptable...|$|E
