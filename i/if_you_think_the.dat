500|$|Although Speed {{would play}} several gigs at the Green Man pub in Plumstead, the band {{did not last}} long, but it {{encouraged}} Dickinson {{to continue to work}} towards being a musician. Dickinson spotted an advertisement in Melody Maker with the caption [...] "Singer wanted for recording project" [...] and replied immediately. He recorded a demo tape and sent it with a note which read: [...] "By the way, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> singing's crap, there's some John Cleese stuff recorded on the other side you might find amusing." [...] They liked what they heard and invited Dickinson down to the studio to make [...] "Dracula", the first song he would ever record, with a band called [...] "Shots", formed by two brothers, Phil and Doug Siviter. The song would later appear on the second disc of The Best of Bruce Dickinson compilation. [...] The brothers were impressed with Dickinson's vocal abilities and asked him to join their group.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{months of}} its debut, the record found a {{following}} among many of popular music's inner circle. Extensive touring in the US and Canada and rave reviews and industry/musician buzz led to opening slots on tours with Suzanne Vega, Glen Phillips, Rufus Wainwright, Aimee Mann, and John Mayer. John Mayer later described the album in his Esquire magazine article: [...] "it {{may be one}} of the best albums to come around in the last five years...Music like this is jet fuel on the fire of a broken heart. Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> flame has died, there's at least one lyric that'll hit that last hot spot, and then you'll find yourself as fucked as you were the day you lied and said you never wanted to see her again. Enjoy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Global Warming Unmasked: The Hidden Agenda", Voris {{claimed that}} [...] "Catholic leaders must {{recognize}} global warming {{for what it}} is. It is a government power grab via population reduction. It is a pseudoscience and hyper-sensationalism. These things {{are being used to}} promote the global warming agenda, just {{as they were in the}} early 20th century eugenics movement... In fact, global warming is the evolution, the natural evolution, of that early eugenics program." [...] Voris said, [...] "Hitler adopted the American eugenic ideals and implemented them throughout his Nazi regime. Hitler did not originate the idea of eugenics and creating a superior Aryan race. It was indeed an American concept. He saw this happening in America, and went 'Ah-ha' and grabbed it and incorporated it into his whole Nazi philosophy." [...] Voris held that governments accepting the concept of global warming might limit availability of energy, cutting off those who [...] "exceed what Washington says is your limit [...] you can either be charged an exorbitant fine or perhaps have your energy supply limited or even cut off. ...<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> government interfering in private lives to this extent based on junk science and the hysteria surrounding it just isn't possible... think back to the tens of thousands of citizens who were sterilized against their will by the government in state after state after state. ...And remember the only thing that brought the eugenics movement to an end was the horror of the Nazi death camps. If that had not happened, sterilization would just be a normal thing. It was so revolting that finally people said, 'this whole theory is wrong.' Government leaders were quite happy to just roll along exercising power without limit over their citizens." ...|$|E

The Maker of the world telling his creatures that he is their God! What might he not have said at such a moment? What might we not fancy his saying?
