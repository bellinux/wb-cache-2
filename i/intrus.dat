[...] Originally {{trained as a}} painter in Iowa, since showing at Pacific Northwest College of Art in 2000 Fritz has been practicing as an installation artist utilizing custom furniture, cast forms, light and space. Though she's been hailed as one of [...] "the most exciting video artists in the country" [...] {{in the company of}} other noted Portland residents Miranda July, Matt McCormick and Harrell Fletcher, Fritz's work differs as she creates video objects like Transposition (2005) or installations like http://www.qpca.com/exhibitions/2008_2c Interspace (2008), both of which featured the shadows of animals that appear to inhabit a constructed, minimalist space. Other exhibitions like <b>Intrus</b> (2010) and Caseworks 13 (2007) at Reed College drew critical attention without video, instead using light like a material for sculpture. In 2007, Fritz was awarded one of the coveted NAAU stipend shows,. [...] The resulting show Evident (2009) received much praise amongst critics. [...] In an expose on the surge in the Portland art scene's recent rise in prominence Peter Plagens singled her work out as, [...] "Ms. Fritz's 'Entorus' comprises mostly abstract—and, at first, barely perceptible—images projected on the walls and floor of a darkened room temporarily set aside in an office-building basement. It was one of two truly memorable artworks I saw during my brief tour. If you think that's skimpy, remember that these days a stroll through New York's Chelsea gallery district probably wouldn't yield much more." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper 1 {{describes}} the simulation {{of an attack}} recognition system in a distributed environment. The underlying technique of attack recognition is based on assertion checking. An auxiliary process called watchdog queries the users for a scope-file, from which an assertable plan called Sprint plan is generated. The sprint plan consists of carefully derived assertions, which forms the basis for attack monitoring. Two environments are simulated {{for the purpose of}} testing and evaluation of the intrusion detection system. First, a general academic environment with limited security restrictions is simulated. Second, a virtual banking environment with stringent security requirements is simulated. Different attack scenarios are simulated for the purpose of testing the recognition system. 1 INTRODUCTION As today's commercial applications {{are becoming more and more}} distributed, they also become vulnerable to attacks across the network. This difficulty raises the need for concurrent <b>intrus</b> [...] ...|$|E

Cheetah is {{accepted as a}} first round candidate of SHA- 3 competition hosted by NIST 1, {{but it is not}} in the second round. First, we discuss relation between degrees of freedom injected from round message blocks and round number of a pseudo-collision attack on hash functions with S boxes and MDS diffusion. A pseudo-collision attack on 8 -round Cheetah- 256 can be derived by trivially applying original rebound techniques. Then, we propose a rebound differential path for semi-free start collision attack on 12 -round Cheetah- 256 and an observation of the neutral bytes influence on state values. Based on this observation, algebraic message modifications are designed using the neutral bytes and total complexity is reduced to 2 (24). This is a practical rebound attack...|$|E

These side channel attacks help adversaries to get, some {{information}} about secret values (such like internal states) in MA-schemes, which is beyond the original models consider about, so the provable security completely lose. To fix this problem, we extend the original models for message authentication. taking the information about secret values in MA-schemes into account. The extended models can not only provide a framework under which one can discuss security of MA-schemes facing side channel attacks, but also give us an insight view of MA-schemes. As an example, we consider the security of f 9 (a MA-scheme in 3 GPP) and its variants in an extended model. The. result helps us to know f 9 better, e. g. how to use it, safely and what measures need to be taken in case of potential attacks...|$|E
40|$|Network {{intrusions}} {{have been}} {{a fact of life}} in the Internet for many years. However, {{as is the case with}} many other types of Internet-wide phenomena, gaining insight into the global characteristics of intrusions is challenging. In this paper we address this problem by systematically analyzing a set of firewall logs collected over four months from over 1600 different networks world wide. The first part of our study is a general analysis focused on the issues of distribution, categorization and prevalence of intrusions. Our data shows both a large quantity and wide variety of intrusion attempts on a daily basis. We also find that worms like CodeRed, Nimda and SQL Snake persist long after their original release. By projecting intrusion activity as seen in our data sets to the entire Internet we determine that there are typically on the order of 25 B intrusion attempts per day and that there is an increasing trend over our measurement period. We further find that sources of intrusions are uniformly spread across the Autonomous System space. However, deeper investigation reveals that a very small collection of sources are responsible for a significant fraction of intrusion attempts in any given month and their on/off patterns exhibit cliques of correlated behavior. We show that the distribution of source IP addresses of the non-worm intrusions as a function of the number of attempts follows Zipf's law. We also find that at daily timescales, intrusion targets often depict significant spatial trends that blur patterns observed from individual "IP telescopes"; this underscores the necessity for a more global approach to intrusion detection. Finally, we investigate the benefits of shared information, and the potential for using this as a foundation for an automated, global <b>intrus</b> [...] ...|$|E
