60|$|But he had yielded in {{the main}} when he allowed himself to base his {{opposition}} on one <b>immaterial</b> <b>detail.</b> The breakfast was to be given at the King's Head, and, though it was acknowledged on all sides that no authority could be found for such a practice, it was known that the bill was to be paid by the bridegroom. Nor would Mr Ruggles pay the five hundred pounds down as in early days he had promised to do. He was very clear in his mind that his undertaking on that head was altogether cancelled by Ruby's departure from Sheep's Acre. When he was reminded that he had nearly pulled his granddaughter's {{hair out of her}} head, and had thus justified her act of rebellion, he did not contradict the assertion, but implied that if Ruby did not choose to earn her fortune on such terms as those, that was her fault. It was not to be supposed that he was to give a girl, who was after all as much a Pipkin as a Ruggles, five hundred pounds for nothing. But, in return for that night's somewhat harsh treatment of Ruby, he did at last consent to have the money settled upon John Crumb at his death,-- an arrangement which both the lawyer and Joe Mixet thought to be almost as good as a free gift, being both of them aware that the consumption of gin and water was on the increase. And he, moreover, was persuaded to receive Mrs Pipkin and Ruby at the farm for the night previous to the marriage. This very necessary arrangement was made by Mr Mixet's mother, a most respectable old lady, who went out in a fly from the inn attired in her best black silk gown and an overpowering bonnet, an old lady from whom her son had inherited his eloquence, who absolutely shamed the old man into compliance,--not, however, till she had promised to send out the tea and white sugar and box of biscuits which were thought to be necessary for Mrs Pipkin on the evening preceding the marriage. A private sitting-room at the inn was secured for the special accommodation of Mrs Hurtle,--who {{was supposed to be a}} lady of too high standing to be properly entertained at Sheep's Acre Farm.|$|E
5000|$|Michigan {{supporters}} denied Whitney's charges and, {{as proof}} that Whitney's account was wild and unreliable, noted that he had erroneously identified Sherman as Michigan's manager. Whitney stood his ground and explained:"As to Stevenson, I have charged he was offered $600 by Roger Sherman, as manager of the Michigan team, to play with that eleven. I erred in an <b>immaterial</b> <b>detail,</b> which Michigan men have seized upon in order to dodge the issue. They deny that he made such an offer, or that he was manager of the eleven. The facts are as follows: Sherman managed the summer trip and training of the team at Omena, a summer resort on Traverse Bay, Michigan. Charles Baird was the regular manager, and {{was the one who}} originally conducted the negotiations with Stevenson, which Sherman knew about and talked over with Stevenson in the Chicago cable car Oct. 5, 1895. Mr. Sherman admitted this to me before a witness in Chicago Dec. 17, 1895. Mr. Sherman is a young lawyer of excellent repute and will not deny this statement. Besides, Stevenson has admitted it." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{regards to}} the memory image, both Bartlett (1921, 1932) [...] and Allport (1924, 1928) speak to how it is a {{structured}} representation where <b>immaterial</b> <b>details</b> obscure and important features are made prominent for speedy and decisive reaction. “This particular function of the MI, according to Bartlett, is to manifest itself when the reaction is hesitating, and {{to lead to a}} response which is decisive”. The MI and EI are differentiated by the MI’s urgency and decisiveness that often causes a structural error in its hasty response while the eidetic appears on its own timeframe without urgency or error. When the original eidetic appears and is given slow attention, Allport noted how an individual “upon the evidence of his EI corrects spontaneously misstatements which he made in his previous account ‘from memory.’” ...|$|R
