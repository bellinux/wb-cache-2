40|$|BackgroundThe right {{ventricle}} is {{a complex}} structure that is challenging to quantify by two-dimensional (2 D) echocardiography. Unlike disk summation three-dimensional (3 D) echocardiography (3 DE), single-beat 3 DE can acquire large volumes at high volume rates in one cardiac cycle, avoiding stitching artifacts or long breath-holds. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the accuracy and test-retest reproducibility of single-beat 3 DE for quantifying right ventricular (RV) volumes in adult populations of acquired RV pressure or volume overload, namely, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and carcinoid heart disease, respectively. Three-dimensional and 2 D <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> also <b>compared</b> for identifying RV dysfunction in PH. MethodsA prospective cross-sectional study was performed in 100 individuals who underwent 2 D echocardiography, 3 DE, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: 49 patients with PH, 20 with carcinoid heart disease, 11 with metastatic carcinoid tumors without cardiac involvement, and 20 healthy volunteers. Two operators performed test-retest acquisition and postprocessing for inter- and intraobserver reproducibility in 20 subjects. Results:RV single-beat 3 DE was attainable in 96 % of cases, with mean volume rates of 32 to 45 volumes/sec. Bland-Altman analysis of all subjects (presented as mean bias ± 95 % limits of agreement) revealed good agreement for end-diastolic volume (− 2. 3  ±  27. 4  mL) and end-systolic volume (5. 2  ±  19. 0  mL) measured by 3 DE and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, with a tendency to underestimate stroke volume (− 7. 5  ±  23. 6  mL) and ejection fraction (− 4. 6 ± 13. 8 %) by 3 DE. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a greater bias for volumetric underestimation, particularly in healthy volunteers (end-diastolic volume, − 11. 9  ±  18. 0  mL; stroke volume, − 11. 2  ±  20. 2  mL). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that 3 DE-derived ejection fraction was significantly superior to 2 D echocardiographic parameters for identifying RV dysfunction in PH (sensitivity, 94 %; specificity, 88 %; area under the curve, 0. 95; P = . 031). There was significant interobserver test-retest bias for RV volume underestimation (end-diastolic volume, − 12. 5  ±  28. 1  mL; stroke volume, − 10. 6  ±  23. 2  mL). ConclusionsSingle-beat 3 DE is feasible and clinically applicable for volumetric quantification in acquired RV pressure or volume overload. It has improved limits of agreement compared with previous disk summation 3 D echocardiographic studies and has incremental value over standard 2 D echocardiographic measures for identifying RV dysfunction. Despite the ability to obtain and postprocess a full-volume 3 D echocardiographic RV data set, the quality of the raw data did influence the accuracy of the data obtained. The technique performs better with dilated rather than nondilated RV cavities, with a learning curve that might affect the test-retest reproducibility for serial RV studies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) due to left {{ventricular}} (LV) systolic dysfunction has lesser survival than diastolic HF. We examined {{the correlation of}} two new angles(α and β) of QRS complex in the electrocardiogram (ECG) with indices including {{left ventricular}} ejection fraction (LVEF),left ventricular end systolic dimension (LVESD) and left ventricular end diastolic di-mension (LVEDD) for predicting LVEF. METHODS: In this cross–sectional study, 159 subjects with clinical signs of LV systolic dysfunc-tion who presented to the Al-Zahra hospital in Isfahan, Iran, underwent echocardiography. First,on the ECG,two new angles defined and then these two angles compared manually and with computerized analysis by two different observers blinded to the another data. After confir-mation of excellent correlation between these two forms, then two angles measured manually with protractor in 159 patients (wide QRS complex in 59 and normal in 100 patients). Then, cor-relation between these angles and <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> assessed.

40|$|Background: The pulsatility index (PI) shows {{continuous}} {{blood flow}} to the end organs and is a significant factor believed to decrease in aortic coarctation. Correction of this factor is of great importance in the treatment of stenotic lesions of the aorta. However, there are minimal data regarding the trend of changes in the PI after stent implantation. Furthermore, the association between the PI and other <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> in patients undergoing stent implantation is unclear. This study was designed to evaluate changes in the PI following stenting and its correlation with other <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices.</b> Methods: Twenty-three patients with a diagnosis of aortic coarctation consecutively underwent two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic imaging modalities twice (before and after stenting). The patients were divided into two groups based on the percentage of increase in the PI after stenting (< 50 % or ≥ 50 %). The relation between the post-stenting PI and the baseline <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>was</b> assessed. Results: The PI was increased from 0. 89 (SD = 0. 30) to 1. 75 (SD = 0. 51) after stenting (p value < 0. 001). Baseline diastolic/systolic velocity (D/S velocity) ratio of the abdominal aorta (p value = 0. 013), mean velocity (p value = 0. 033), and peak gradient of the descending aorta (p value = 0. 033) were significantly higher in the patients with ≥ 50 % increase in the PI after stenting...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine predicting factors of tolerance to carvedilol in systolic heart failure. Patients and MethodsCarvedilol has been introduced in 100 consecutive patients hospitalized with systolic heart failure. Clinical parameters, the BNP levels and <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> measured blind to admission to the first and second week. ResultsThe average age of patients was 66 ± 1 year. The FE: 31 ± 1 %, the NYHA 2. 8 ± 0. 1, BNP 620 ± 48 pg/mL, E/A: 1 8 ± 0. 3, TDE 160 ± 7, E/E’, 9. 1 ± 0. 3, PAPS: 36 ± 0. 4, VCI: 15 + 1 mm. An acute decompensation episode occurred in 21 patients and b blocker was arrested at 9 of them without the possibility of reintroduction. In univariate analysis, the values on admission NYHA stage, the plasma level of BNP, the TDE and reports E/A and E/E’ predicted the occurrence of acute decompensation. The combination of NYHA class 4 to a BNP level greater than 410 pg/mL or at elevated filling pressures predicted the occurrence of decompensation in 100 % of cases.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} by echocardiography {{the cardiac}} {{structure and function}} in patients with primary adrenocortical insufficiency. Design and Methods: Two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiograms and spectral Doppler studies were performed in seven consecutive patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune primary adrenal failure before and 4 – 8 months after an adequate regimen of steroid substitution. Echocardiographic parameters were also studied in ten healthy controls. Results: In the cases with untreated Addison’s disease, both left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions were significantly reduced in comparison with those in controls (P < 0. 01). Four patients had echocardiographic signs of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) at the anterior leaflet, with no evidence of mitral regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography. Systolic clicks characteristic of MVP were present on auscultation in two of these cases. Left ventricular chamber size normalized, i. e. significantly increased (P < 0. 01), and both echocardiographic and physical signs of MVP resolved after steroid substitution in all patients. All other <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> normal before and after treatment. Conclusions: Patients with untreated Addison’s disease have cardiac abnormalities which regress after steroid substitution. A valvular-ventricular disproportion due to the hypovolemic state could explain these findings. European Journal of Endocrinology 140 425 – 42...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this article}} is to examine whether cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) induces improvements in the neurohumoral system. Methods and Results: Thirteen patients with HF (left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction < 35 %) were included. Before and after 6 months of CRT, myocardial I- 123 -metaiodobenzylguanidine (I- 123 -MIBG) uptake indices, used as an index of neural norepinephrine reuptake and retention, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, used as an index of LV end-diastolic pressure, NYHA classification and <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> assessed. Six months of CRT resulted in significant improvement in (1) NYHA classification and reduction in QRS width (P < 0. 001), (2) decrease of LV end-diastolic diameter (P = 0. 005), LV end-systolic diameter (P = 0. 005), septal to lateral delay (P = 0. 01) and mitral regurgitation (MR, P = 0. 04), (3) delayed I- 123 -MIBG heart/mediastinum ratios improved (P = 0. 03) and I- 123 -MIBG washout decreased (P = 0. 001), and (4) BNP levels decreased (P = 0. 001).

40|$|The {{influence}} of a pure afterload reduction on systolic time intervals and various <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>was</b> assessed in six healthy volunteers, who underwent a single blind placebo controlled trial of three regimens of intravenous dihydralazine (6. 25, 12. 5, and 25. 0 mg). Subsequently autonomic blockade (propranolol and atropine) was used to eliminate the {{influence of}} the autonomic reflex action during dosage with dihydralazine 6. 25 mg. Dihydralazine increased heart rate to an extent depending on dose, decreased diastolic blood pressure, end systolic diameter, and end systolic wall stress, and enhanced fractional shortening and cardiac output. Heart rate corrected pre-ejection period was shortened and left ventricular ejection time was prolonged, whereas electromechanical systole remained virtually unchanged. Autonomic blockade eliminated dihydralazine's effect on heart rate and cardiac output; blood pressure and systolic wall stress fell appreciably, whereas dihydralazine-induced changes in the systolic time intervals were virtually unaffected. Thus the present study indicates that regardless of the autonomic reflexes heart rate corrected pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection time, but not electromechanical systole, are highly dependent on afterload, and this effect should be considered when systolic time intervals are evaluated...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (1) to {{evaluate}} the relationship between novel two-dimensional transthoracic indices of left atrial (LA) mechanical function (speckle-tracking- and tissue Doppler-derived parameters), conventional indices (A-wave peak velocity and velocity-time integral, and A' velocity), and transoesophageal echocardiographic parameters (LA appendage emptying velocity and spontaneous echocardiographic contrast); and (2) to assess to clinical feasibility of these novel transthoracic <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices.</b> Transthoracic echocardiography <b>was</b> performed immediately prior to or following clinically indicated transoesophageal echocardiography in 100 individuals. Longitudinal reservoir LA strain, and reservoir, conduit, and atrial contractile strain rate were measured by both speckle-tracking and tissue Doppler approaches. Inter- and intra-observer variability in 20 randomly selected cases was evaluated by the Bland-Altman technique. The time required per analysis for these novel transthoracic <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>was</b> recorded. In relation to LA appendage emptying velocity, the respective absolute r-values for speckle-tracking reservoir strain, and reservoir, conduit, and atrial contractile strain rate were 0. 53 (P < 0. 001), 0. 40 (P < 0. 001), 0. 21 (P = 0. 05), and 0. 61 (P < 0. 001). The absolute r-values for tissue Doppler reservoir strain, and reservoir, conduit, and atrial contractile strain rate were 0. 57 (P < 0. 005), 0. 53 (P < 0. 001), 0. 022 (P = 0. 8), and 0. 46 (P < 0. 001), respectively. In contrast, the r-values for A-wave peak velocity and velocity-time integral, and A' velocity were 0. 20 (P = 0. 01), 0. 26 (P = 0. 05), and 0. 35 (P = 0. 007), respectively. Speckle-tracking-derived parameters achieved the greatest area-under-the-receiver-operating characteristic curve in the identification of moderate-severe LA spontaneous echocardigraphic contrast and were more rapidly measured (P < 0. 001), while exhibiting similar reproducibility to tissue Doppler-derived measures. Assessment of LA mechanical function using speckle-tracking echocardiography is a valid approach compared with transoesophageal echocardiography, and is clinically feasible. Darryl P.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} a number of magnetocardiographic (MCG) indices in their predictive ability for left ventricular (LV) concentric remodeling. Twenty-five male patients affected by essential hypertension for no longer than 15 months and presenting signs of LV remodeling participated in the study; 25 normal male volunteers of comparable age were evaluated as controls. All participants underwent Echocardiography (ECHO), Electrocardiography (ECG) and Magnetocardiography (MCG). Several MCG based <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> evaluated, namely the QRS integral, T integral, QRS-T integral, T/QRS integral, RS index and the variations of the Electrical Cardiac Axis (ECA) orientation. MCG <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> <b>compared</b> with ECHO parameters, i. e. Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) and Relative Wall Thickness (RWT), and with ECG parameters, i. e. 12 -lead standard ECG LVH Sokolow-Lyon and Cornell voltages. QRS integral values for patients and controls were significantly different (P = 0. 03), whereas T Integral values showed only a tendency to differentiate between patients and controls (P = 0. 15). No significant correlation between MCG and <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> in patients <b>was</b> found; RWT showed a tendency to correlate with QRS integral (r = 0. 34, P = 0. 17) and with RS index (r = 0. 49, P = 0. 15), and LVMI showed a tendency to correlate with the variations of the ECA orientation (r = 0. 38, P = 0. 10).

40|$|Introduction: Atrial arrhythmias in {{patients}} with sarcoidosis (Sar) are not unusual and can occur due to either atrial myocardial fibrosis and/or due to autonomic nervous system imbalance. Electrocardiographic markers (ECG), like maximum and minimum P wave duration and P wave dispersion {P dis = P max ﹣ P min } reflect atrial depolarization inhomogeneity and can indicate patients prone to develop atrial arrhythmias while standard deviation of RR interval (SDNN) <b>is</b> an <b>index</b> of heart rate variability, reflecting autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Methods : 90 patients with sarcoidosis (41 males/ 49 females) enrolled in this multicenter prospective study underwent digital electrocardiography, echocardiography and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Diastolic and systolic indices of right and left ventricle were measured echocardiographically including Doppler parameters while P max, P min, P dis and SDNN were measured in a 5 -minute duration digital electrocardiogram. All consecutive patients <b>were</b> <b>compared</b> to 65 healthy volunteers (30 males/ 35 females). Results : Although heart rate and the <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> similar among the two groups, the electrocardiographic <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> significantly prolonged in the patient group compared to controls. Maximum P wave duration was correlated with SDNN (p dis was correlated with SDNN (p max and P dis were independently correlated with SDNN.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine differences in LV morphology and function in obese and normal-weight adolescents. Furthermore, relationships between LV outcomes, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and adiposity were explored. METHODS: LV morphology was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 20 adolescents (11 normal-weight [BMI equivalent to 18 kg/m(2) - 25 kg/m(2) ] and 9 obese [BMI equivalent to ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ]); 13. 3 ± 1. 1 years, 45 % female, Tanner puberty stage 3 [2 - 4]) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Global longitudinal strain (GLS), strain rate (SR) and traditional <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> <b>were</b> used to assess LV function. CRF (peak oxygen consumption), percent body fat (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), abdominal adipose tissue (MRI), and blood biochemistry markers were also evaluated. RESULTS: Adolescents with obesity showed significantly poorer LV function compared to normal-weight adolescents (P 0. 05). Moderate to strong associations between myocardial contractility and relaxation, adiposity, arterial blood pressure and cardiorespiratory fitness were noted (r= 0. 49 - 0. 71, P< 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} worldwide. S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC), a novel modulator of endogenous hydrogen sulfide, is proved to be able to protect against acute myocardial ischemia. In order to produce more stable and sustainable hydrogen sulfide, we used controlled release formulation of SPRC (CR-SPRC) to elucidate possible cardioprotective effects on HF rats and investigate involved mechanisms on apoptosis and oxidation. METHODS: Left coronary artery was occluded to induce HF model of rat. The survival rats were randomly divided into 7 groups after 24 hours and treated with drugs for 6 weeks. <b>Echocardiographic</b> <b>indexes</b> <b>were</b> recorded to determine cardiac function. TTC staining was performed to determine infarct size. Plasmatic level of hydrogen sulfide was detected by modified sulfide electrode. Activity of enzyme and expression of protein were determined by colorimetry and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: The cardioprotective effects of CR-SPRC on HF rats were confirmed by significant reduction of infarct size and improvement of cardiac function, with better effects compared to normal SPRC. CR-SPRC modulated antioxidant defenses by preserving levels of GSH, CAT and SOD and reducing CK leakage. In addition, CR-SPRC elevated ratio of Bcl- 2 /Bax and inhibited activity of caspases to protect against myocardial apoptosis. The cardioprotective effects of CR-SPRC were mediated by hydrogen sulfide. CONCLUSIONS: All experiment data indicated cardioprotective effects of CR-SPRC on HF rats. More importantly, CR-SPRC exerted better effects than normal SPRC in all respects, providing a new perspective on hydrogen sulfide-mediated drug therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was an {{assessment}} of left ventricular diastolic function in children after the successful repair of aortic coarctation (CoA). The prospective study concerned 32 pediatric patients after the CoA surgery. Tissue Doppler imaging parameters including strain and strain rate and the conventional <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indexes</b> <b>were</b> analyzed in patients and healthy controls. Analysis of mitral annulus velocities, E–E′ ratio, strain, and strain rate of left ventricular mid-cavity segments and conventional indexes of mitral inflow showed the worsening of left ventricular diastolic mechanics in the study group compared to healthy controls. The E/E′ ratio was significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group (8. 30  ±  3. 24 vs. 6. 95  ±  1. 36; p <  0. 05). The early diastolic strain rate to late diastolic strain rate ratio as well as early to late diastolic strain ratio of the left ventricular mid-cavity segments were significantly lower in the study group compared to healthy controls (1. 81  ±  0. 63 vs. 3. 74  ±  1. 53; p <  0. 001 and 1. 20  ±  0. 49 vs. 3. 41  ±  1. 26; p <  0. 001). No differences of the pulmonary venous flow parameters between those two groups were observed. The left ventricular diastolic mechanics in hypertensive patients after CoA repair did not differ from normotensive subjects. Hypertensive and normotensive children after surgical repair of CoA are found to have worsening of the left ventricular diastolic mechanics suggesting the impairment of the active myocardial relaxation...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalization}} {{of the electricity}} markets causes power systems to work {{closer and closer to}} their limits. The online assessment of system security becomes a topic of paramount importance in control centers. In this context fast indices to quickly assess system security are fundamental in an on-line DSA session. This paper considers three voltage stability indices recently proposed in literature and carries out some comparisons. In the first part the authors briefly describe the theoretical background of each index. The second part is devoted to two comparisons: at first, the three <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> <b>compared</b> by using an IEEE test system. Secondly, the FVSI (Fast Voltage Stability Index) and the VCI (Voltage Collapse <b>Index)</b> <b>are</b> <b>compared</b> by adopting a model of the Italian HV transmission grid. The comparisons will show the peculiar information provided by each of the considered indices and will assess the performance of these indices also on a realistic power system. Final remarks are reported and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study <b>was</b> to <b>compare</b> right {{ventricular}} (RV) myocardial wall velocities (tissue Doppler imaging) and strain rate imaging (SRI) parameters with conventional <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> evaluating RV function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. In total, 39 patients with COPD and 22 healthy subjects were included in the current study. Seventeen patients had pulmonary artery pressure 35 ?mmHg (group II). Tissue Doppler imaging, strain and strain rate (SR) values were obtained from RV free wall (FW) and interventricular septum. Respiratory function tests were performed (forced expiratory volume in one second/vital capacity (FEV 1 /VC) and carbon monoxide diffusion lung capacity per unit of alveolar volume (DL,CO/VA)). Strain/SR values were reduced in all segments of group II patients compared with group I patients and controls with lowest values at basal FW site. A significant relationship was shown between peak systolic SR at basal FW site and radionuclide RV ejection fraction. A significant relationship was shown between peak systolic SR at basal FW site and DL,CO/VA and FEV 1 /VC. In conclusion, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, strain rate imaging parameters can determine right ventricular dysfunction that is complementary to conventional <b>echocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> and <b>is</b> correlated with pulmonary hypertension and respiratory function tests...|$|R
