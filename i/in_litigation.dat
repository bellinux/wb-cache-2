Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. <b>In</b> <b>litigation</b> before the US Court of Appeals, in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison.

5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly <b>in</b> <b>litigation.</b> In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{record as}} CEO {{was subject to}} some dispute among Wall Street analysts.

In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue <b>in</b> <b>litigation.</b> Cheney was named in a December 2010 corruption complaint filed by the Nigerian government against Halliburton, which the company settled for $250 million.|$|E

40|$|Perceptions of {{injuries}} are culturally mediated, mutable, plastic. <b>In</b> tort <b>litigation,</b> however, the cultural plasticity {{with which we}} perceive and experience injuries is often ignored. This Article explores the cultural plasticity with which we perceive injuries {{through the lens of}} plastic surgery litigation. It argues that determinations of injury <b>in</b> plastic surgery <b>litigation</b> turn on the culturally biased — and highly mutable — perceptions of medical professionals. More broadly, the Article argues that culture shapes perceptions {{of injuries}} <b>in</b> tort <b>litigation</b> as a whole. To make these points, the Article examines a prototypical plastic surgery case and surveys a range of historical and empirical analyses of injuries <b>in</b> tort <b>litigation,</b> which illustrate the cultural plasticity of injuries in tort practice. The Article recommends adopting a more complex approach to injuries that takes cultural biases into account. It expresses particular concern about the privileged role of doctors <b>in</b> tort <b>litigation</b> because they {{play a key role in}} shaping cultural perceptions of injuries. While this is problematic in many tort cases, it is particularly problematic <b>in</b> plastic surgery <b>litigation</b> where plastic surgeons act as both purveyors of the cultural demand for plastic surgery, and arbiters of any injuries that may result...|$|R
