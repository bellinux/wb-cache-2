5|$|Ethnic Cleansing was {{developed}} {{by members of the}} National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication is the {{transmission}} of signs, signals, messages, words, writings, <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> or information of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology. It is transmitted either electrically over physical media, such as cables, or via electromagnetic radiation. Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E

25|$|The two central {{characters}} are the Americans Bremen and Gail. Both are telepaths, {{the only other}} telepaths that either has ever known. Inevitably, they fall in love. When Gail dies of illness, Bremen is devastated. He gives up his career in mathematics and becomes a drifter. At the commencement of the action, he has ended up at a facility for retarded and otherwise disabled minors. He becomes sort of fond of one named Robby, who had been blinded and mentally crippled before birth by his mother's drug abuse habits, and resolves that before he leaves the facility (for he feels he has been there too long), he will use his telepathic power to give Robby a gift of sorts: <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> of the outside world.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{generally}} diurnal. The average sleep requirement is between seven and nine {{hours per day}} for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though sleep deprivation can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day {{has been shown to}} correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort. During sleep humans dream. In dreaming humans experience sensory <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds,</b> in a sequence which the dreamer usually perceives more as an apparent participant than as an observer. Dreaming is stimulated by the pons and mostly occurs during the REM phase of sleep.|$|E
25|$|If {{surviving}} medieval folk {{rock bands}} shifted towards more mainstream progressive rock, progressive rock bands often included early music among their influences. Despite {{emerging from the}} British blues boom, the vocal style of Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull was often compared with a medieval troubadour, while the signature sound of his flute, later combined with the keyboard and stringed instrumental skills of the band, lent itself to a medieval element of the music. This emerged most clearly with the album Minstrel in the Gallery (1975) {{and later in the}} folk inspired Songs from the Wood (1977). Medieval <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> are so prominent in the band's career that they have occasionally been classified as 'medieval progressive rock'. Yes took occasional flights into medievalism, perhaps because of their highly talented keyboard player Rick Wakeman, who in 1975 produced the rock opera album The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.|$|E

This stage is marked by responses to familiar <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> (including parent's face) and anticipatory responses to familiar events (such as opening the mouth for a spoon). The infant's actions become less reflexive and intentionality emerges.|$|E
500|$|Holly & Ivy {{received}} several comparisons to other albums. David Browne felt that Cole's approach to Holly & Ivy {{may have been}} influenced from her appearance on Frank Sinatra's Duets (1993). Browne also praised Cole's decision {{to stay away from}} traditionally Christmas <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds,</b> instead [...] "opt for a simple black evening dress on the cover" [...] in comparison to Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas, released in the same year. Robert Taylor gave the album three stars out of five, writing that it [...] "does not have the same 'classic' quality of her dad's 'The Christmas Album'".|$|E
500|$|In Part I, this meditative poem {{begins with}} the narrator {{trying to focus on}} the present moment while walking through a garden, {{focusing}} on <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. In Part II, the narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach [...] "the still point" [...] in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing [...] "a grace of sense." [...] In Part III, the meditation experience becomes darker as night comes on, and by Part IV, it is night and [...] "Time and the bell have buried the day." [...] In Part V, the narrator reaches a contemplative end to his/her meditation, initially contemplating the arts ("Words" [...] and [...] "music") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating [...] "Words [...] strain,/Crack and sometimes break, under the burden , under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [...] will not stay in place, /Will not stay still." [...] By comparison, the narrator concludes that [...] "Love is itself unmoving,/Only the cause and end of movement,/Timeless, and undesiring." [...] For this reason, this spiritual experience of [...] "Love" [...] is the form of consciousness that most interests the narrator (presumably more than the creative act of writing poetry).|$|E

500|$|At {{the hinge}} {{of the film}} is a scene in an unusual late night theater called Club Silencio where a {{performer}} announces [...] "No hay banda (there is no band)... but yet we hear a band", variated between English, Spanish and French. Described as [...] "the most original and stunning sequence in an original and stunning film", Rebekah del Rio's Spanish a cappella rendition of [...] "Crying", named [...] "Llorando", is praised as [...] "show-stopping... except that there's no show to stop" [...] in the sparsely attended Club Silencio. Lynch wanted to use Roy Orbison's version of [...] "Crying" [...] in Blue Velvet, but changed his mind when he heard Orbison's [...] "In Dreams". Del Rio, who popularized the Spanish version and who received her first recording contract {{on the basis of the}} song, stated that Lynch flew to Nashville where she was living, and she sang the song for him once and did not know he was recording her. Lynch wrote a part for her in the film and used the version she sang for him in Nashville. The song tragically serenades the lovers Betty and Rita, who sit spellbound and weeping, moments before their relationship disappears and is replaced by Diane and Camilla's dysfunction. According to one film scholar, the song and the entire theater scene marks the disintegration of Betty's and Rita's personalities, as well as their relationship. With the use of multiple languages and a song to portray such primal emotions, one film analyst states that Lynch exhibits his distrust of intellectual discourse and chooses to make sense through <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds.</b> The disorienting effect of the music playing although del Rio is no longer there is described as [...] "the musical version of Magritte's painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe".|$|E
500|$|... "Moonshine" [...] {{opened the}} set with Mars {{and his band}} [...] "executing a series of slick {{synchronized}} steps". During {{the performance of the}} first segment and its follow up, [...] "Natalie", which was a [...] "hyperkinetically catchy" [...] "booty-shaker", a giant screen behind Mars displayed flashed <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> of wild animals such as panthers, gorillas and parrots, who flapped their wings in slow motion. Taking a moment to invite the audience to dance and sing along with him to the Motown and soul-funk [...] "Treasure", a giant disco ball descended from the roof reflecting dozens of bright gold lights and multi-colored laser lights flashed. The crowd responded enthusiastically to the music. The show also included several covers of songs by other artists mashed up with Mars' tracks. A cover of [...] "Money (That's What I Want)" [...] was mashed up with [...] "Billionaire" [...] and [...] "I Need a Dollar" [...] as Mars and his band [...] "gyrating" [...] with the fans. Afterwards, the stage would be colored with red, yellow and green lights during the [...] "reggae jam" [...] performance of [...] "Show Me". He then performed a [...] "90's-R homage" [...] along with [...] "demure sexual come-ons" [...] by covering Soul For Real's [...] "Candy Rain" [...] and Ginuwine's [...] "Pony". The latter was blended into the singer's [...] "Our First Time". In the latter's medleys, Mars would sing R. Kelly's [...] "Ignition (Remix)" [...] and Sister Nancy's [...] "Bam Bam". These covers would vary upon concert and could also include Ghost Town DJs’ [...] "My Boo, Aaliyah’s [...] "Rock the Boat", [...] "Every Little Step" [...] by Bobby Brown, Mad Cobra's [...] "Flex" [...] and Lloyd’s [...] "Secret Admirer". [...] "Marry You", the following track on the setlist, showed [...] "the pleading doo-wop accents". In some venues it was preceded by The Desires' [...] "Let It Please Be You".|$|E

[...] As part of the deal, CBC sub-licensed a package of games from Rogers, allowing the network to continue airing Hockey Night in Canada at least the first four seasons of the agreement (2014–15 thru 2017–18). The last CBC-produced Hockey Night broadcast aired on June 13, 2014, when the Los Angeles Kings clinched the Stanley Cup in a four-games-to-one Final series over the New York Rangers; the broadcast closed with a season-ending montage, set to Queen's [...] "The Show Must Go On" [...] that included highlights from the season and playoffs interspersed with <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> from CBC's six decades of NHL coverage.|$|E
6000|$|Instantly {{the spirit}} of hell awoke in me and raged. With a {{transport}} of glee I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow: {{and it was not}} till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot, I saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my father's hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous <b>images</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and oh how I rejoiced to think it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel! ...|$|E
