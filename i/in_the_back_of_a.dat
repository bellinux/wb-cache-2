This separation meant that the group had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location to compose their music.

5|$|The unlockable vortigaunt mission {{provides}} {{background information}} explaining how the orange crystals {{used by the}} rift-sealing machine in Half Life: Decay are acquired and used by the Nihilanth during the final boss battle in Half Life. The two player-controlled vortigaunts battle through Marines and Black Ops in the underground Black Mesa complex to find the orange crystals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military van. At this point the screen fades and the mission is declared a success; it is presumed that the Nihilanth warps them back to Xen and installs the crystals in his cave.|$|E
5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances to her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes {{through the back}} door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently shatterproof glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E

5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} {{on the world stage}} at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> van when {{he was supposed to be}} preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.|$|E

5|$|Later drafts see vice made {{central to}} the plot, with the Le Chiffre {{character}} becoming head {{of a network of}} brothels (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then blackmailed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through Hamburg's red light district that results in Bond escaping whilst disguised as a female mud wrestler. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel madam and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.|$|E
5|$|The men torment the {{bound and}} gagged Sally while Leatherface, now {{dressed as a}} woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the {{hitchhiker}} bring down Grandpa (John Dugan), one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer but is too weak. In the ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck when the driver stops to help; the driver knocks down Leatherface with a pipe wrench, causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passing pickup truck as Leatherface dances maniacally in the road with his chainsaw.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to Whitney, Chad {{previously}} began {{a sexual}} relationship with the tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson at an unspecified time around the Vendetta plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is intersex, and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald and Noah Bennett, Chad repeatedly insists that he is not gay, and that his relationship with Vincent is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gay bar; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from Vincent. The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and Ethan Winthrop reunite, but that possibility is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's Tommy Edwards fielded {{the opening}} kickoff, which was {{returned}} to the Tech 29-yard line, where the Hokies' offense began the first play of the game, an incomplete pass by Virginia Tech quarterback Maurice DeShazo. On the second play of the game, DeShazo again attempted a forward pass. This time, however, the ball was intercepted by Tennessee linebacker Tyrone Hines. Hines returned {{the ball to the}} Tech 28-yard line, allowing the Volunteers' offense to begin the game already in scoring position. Tennessee's first play was a run up the middle by James Stewart, who gained three yards. On the second play, Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning completed a nine-yard pass to wide receiver Nilo Silvan. During the play, Silvan suffered a broken ankle and did not return to the game. Now at the 16-yard line, Tennessee continued its drive with a rush by Stewart, who wasn't able to advance the ball. On the next play, the Volunteers were penalized 10 yards for a block <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Virginia Tech player. Despite the penalty and an incomplete pass on a subsequent play, Tennessee was able to gain a first down to the five-yard line with a pass from Manning to Joey Kent. Two plays later, the Volunteers scored on a one-yard touchdown run by Stewart. The extra point kick was successful, and Tennessee took a 70 lead with 11:41 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

In Oarsman in a Top Hat (1877), he effectively manages the perspective of a passenger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> row boat facing his rowing companion and the stream ahead, in a manner much more realistic and involving than Manet's Boating (1874).|$|E
