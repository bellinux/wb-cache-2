50|$|This early method soon proved {{inadequate}} {{as additional}} networks developed that were {{independent of the}} existing networks already designated by a network number.

5000|$|Conceptually, an <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> {{consists}} of a netid and a hostid. The netid identifies a network and the hostid identifies a host. The term host is misleading in that an individual computer can have multiple network interfaces each having its own <b>Internet</b> <b>address.</b> An <b>Internet</b> <b>Address</b> identifies {{a connection to the}} network, not an individual computer. The netid is used by routers to decide where to send a packet.|$|R

50|$|The root domain {{contains}} all top-level domains of the Internet. , it contains 1058 TLDs, including 730 generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and 301 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) in the root domain. In addition, the ARPA domain {{is used for}} technical name spaces {{in the management of}} <b>Internet</b> <b>addressing</b> and other resources. A TEST domain is used for testing internationalized domain names.|$|E
50|$|Conceptually, an i-number {{is similar}} to an IP address, except i-numbers operate {{at a much higher}} level of {{abstraction}} in <b>Internet</b> <b>addressing</b> architecture. The other key difference is that i-numbers are persistent, i.e., once they are assigned to a resource, they are never reassigned. By contrast, IP addresses are constantly reassigned, e.g., your computer may have a different IP address every time it connects to the Internet.|$|E

50|$|Telephone number mapping is {{a system}} of unifying the {{international}} telephone number system of the {{public switched telephone network}} with the <b>Internet</b> <b>addressing</b> and identification name spaces. Internationally, telephone numbers are systematically organized by the E.164 standard, while the Internet uses the Domain Name System (DNS) for linking domain names to IP addresses and other resource information. Telephone number mapping systems provide facilities to determine applicable Internet communications servers responsible for servicing a given telephone number using DNS queries.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>Internet</b> <b>addressing</b> architecture, {{a private}} network is {{a network that}} uses private IP address space, {{following}} the standards set by RFC 1918 for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), and RFC 4193 for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). These addresses are commonly used for home, office, and enterprise local area networks (LANs). Private IP address spaces were originally defined {{in an effort to}} delay IPv4 address exhaustion, but they are also a feature of IPv6 where exhaustion is not an issue.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, {{reputation}} management involves the {{monitoring of the}} reputation of an individual or a brand on the <b>internet,</b> <b>addressing</b> content which is potentially damaging to it, and using customer feedback {{to try to solve}} problems before they damage the individual's or brand's reputation. A major part of {{reputation management}} involves suppressing negative search results, while highlighting positive ones. For businesses, reputation management usually involves an attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} how a company perceives itself and how others view it.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years the Internet {{has been based}} on Version 4 of the Internet Protocol (IPv 4). IPv 4 was {{designed}} to accommodate approximately four billion potential <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> using 32 -bits each, which seemed more than adequate back in the 1980 s. 1 As the Internet grew, blocks of <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> were assigned to various organizations and countries. However, by 1995 and 2000 about one-quarter and one-half of all potential <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> were taken, respectively. With the fast {{growth in the number of}} Internet devices, it looked as if IPv 4 addresses would be exhausted. However, researchers and technologists in the Internet standards organizations anticipated this problem in the early 1990 s and developed methods to extend the life of IPv 4. Meanwhile, they also initiated the development of the “next generation ” of IP, an effort that led to the development and standardization of IPv 6 (version 6 of the Internet Protocol) ...|$|R

In September 1993, the IETF created a temporary, ad-hoc IP Next Generation (IPng) area to deal specifically with such issues. The new area was led by Allison Mankin and Scott Bradner, and had a directorate with 15 engineers from diverse backgrounds for direction-setting and preliminary document review: The working-group members were J.

40|$|Abstract—Sharing {{computing}} resources over the Internet {{has become a}} popular approach for creating innovative network services. This emerging model of using networked computers is called “slice computing”. The term “slice ” refers to an intuitive description for the collection of isolated resources. Isolation in namespace, security and performance {{is the key to}} preventing interference among users sharing the same slice computing environment. Observing that the network identifier is the most essential resource to be isolated, we try to add a minimal change on top of the OS built-in features to enable network namespace isolation. The idea is assigning network addresses to user identifiers within a native OS. It is different from the traditional <b>Internet</b> <b>addressing</b> architecture where IP addresses are assigned to network interfaces and shared by all users. Accordingly, we call it User-oriented Addressing, or UOA in short. Case studies illustrate that UOA can be also applied to facilitating innovation in routing architectures.
