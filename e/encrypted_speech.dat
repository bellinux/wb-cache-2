30|$|The {{sensitivity}} test is performed {{in view of}} security analysis to evaluate {{the protection of the}} proposed cryptosystem against various attacks [24]. To ensure the sensitivity of <b>encrypted</b> <b>speech,</b> the input speech signal is permuted for multiple levels using multiple chaotic maps to change the position of sampled values as the chaotic generators generate a voluminous random numbers. For testing the sensitivity of the proposed cryptosystem, the encrypted signal is decrypted with the reverse process of encryption method using the corresponding chaotic maps at the same four levels and resulting good quality speech recovered.|$|E

The cryptanalysis {{relies on the}} availability of the scrambled speech only and makes use of the characteristics of speech. It is shown that some of the currently available time and frequency domain scramblers, based on a fixed permutation, can be cryp. tanalysed. For systems where the permutation is changed with time, methods for partial recovery of the <b>encrypted</b> <b>speech</b> for several existing systems are given. In the case of the frequency domain scramblers a novel method of attack using a codebook is presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Different {{pseudo-random}} or pseudo-noise (PN) {{as well as}} orthogonal sequences {{that can}} be used as spreading codes for code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular networks or can be used for <b>encrypting</b> <b>speech</b> signals to reduce the residual intelligence are investigated. We briefly review the theoretical background for direct sequence CDMA systems and describe the main characteristics of the maximal length, Gold, Barker, and Kasami sequences. We also discuss about variable- and fixed-length orthogonal codes like Walsh-Hadamard codes. The equivalence of PN and orthogonal codes are also derived. Finally, a new PN sequence is proposed which is shown to have certain better properties than the existing codes.

40|$|Abstract––Speech {{scrambling}} {{techniques are}} used to scramble clear speech into unintelligible signal {{in order to avoid}} eavesdropping. Analog scramblers are intended in applications where the degree of security is not too critical and hardware modifications are prohibitive due to its high cost. In this paper we discuss about the various techniques used for the encryption of the speech signal. PN sequences have random like properties, which helps in reducing the correlation among speech samples. The <b>encrypted</b> <b>speech</b> signal using different PN sequences is compared by informal listening tests and signal inspection methods in time and frequency domains.

40|$|In {{digital speech}} {{security}} system (DSSS), the analog signal is converted into pulse code modulated (PCM) digital form using an analog-to-digital converter and encrypted before transmission {{by a special}} technique. The desired party can decipher the message by treating the received encrypted data with the same technique. Thus conversation {{can be carried out}} without interception. The digital signal is combined directly with the output from a pseudorandom number generator (noise generator) to obtain an <b>encrypted</b> <b>speech</b> before transmission. Such a system has the property that for the interceptor, the received message appears like noise and thus prevents him from eavesdropping. However, the desired party can decipher the message by once again mixing the received enciphered message with the local replica of the pseudorandom noise (PN) available with him. 1...|$|E
40|$|Online blind source {{separation}} (BSS) {{is proposed}} {{to overcome the}} high computational cost problem, which limits the practical applications of traditional batch BSS algorithms. However, the existing online BSS methods are mainly used to separate independent or uncorrelated sources. Recently, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) shows great potential to separate the correlative sources, where some constraints are often imposed to overcome the non-uniqueness of the factorization. In this paper, an incremental NMF with volume constraint is derived and utilized for solving online BSS. The volume constraint to the mixing matrix enhances the identifiability of the sources, while the incremental learning mode reduces the computational cost. The proposed method {{takes advantage of the}} natural gradient based multiplication updating rule, and it performs especially well in the recovery of dependent sources. Simulations in BSS for dual-energy X-ray images, online <b>encrypted</b> <b>speech</b> signals, and high correlative face images show the validity of the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} {{effectivity}} of different pseudo noise (PN) and orthogonal sequences for <b>encrypting</b> <b>speech</b> signals {{in terms of}} perceptual intelligence. Speech signal {{can be viewed as}} sequence of correlated samples and each sample as sequence of bits. The residual intelligibility of the speech signal can be reduced by removing the correlation among the speech samples. PN sequences have random like properties that help in reducing the correlation among speech samples. The mean square aperiodic auto-correlation (MSAAC) and the mean square aperiodic cross-correlation (MSACC) measures are used to test the randomness of the PN sequences. Results of the investigation show the effectivity of large Kasami sequences for this purpose among many PN sequences.

40|$|The {{technique}} of embedding secret information into cover media, like image, video, audio and text called Steganography, {{so that only}} the sender and the authorized recipient who have a key can detect the presence of secret information. In this paper Steganography and Cryptography techniques of speech present with Chaos. Fractional order Lorenz and Chua systems that provides an expanded in key space are used to <b>encrypt</b> <b>speech</b> message. The large key space addition to all properties of randomness and nonlinearity which are possessed these chaotic systems ensure a highly robustness and security for cryptography process. As well as Modified Android Cat Map (MACM) offers additional space and security for steganography process. The irregular outputs of the MACM are used in this paper to embed a secret message in a digital cover image. The results show a large key sensitivity to a small change in the secret key or parameters of MACM. Therefore, highly security hiding for speech will be guaranteed by using this syste...|$|R
30|$|To be specific, the {{presented}} scheme {{contains two}} stages: encryption and decryption. At the encryption stage, we compress and <b>encrypt</b> the <b>speech.</b> The original signal is separated into two independent parts and sparsely {{represented by the}} corresponding K–L incoherent dictionaries. Next, the sparse vectors of the two parts are measured by stochastic matrices. Afterwards, these low-dimensional measurements are mixed and scrambled by the scrambling matrix, which is constructed from the null space basis (NSB) of the aligned sensing matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD). At the decryption stage, the inverse operator is constructed to eliminate each aliased measurements part individually. At last, the separated speech parts are reconstructed using the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [22], and assembled to recover the speech. Experimental results demonstrate that the encrypted signal of proposed scheme has low transmission cost and low residual intelligibility. It provides immense cryptogram immunity and exhibits notable attack resistance.|$|R
40|$|Pre-processing of Speech Signal serves various {{purposes}} in any speech processing application. It includes Noise Removal, Endpoint Detection, Pre-emphasis, Framing, Windowing, Echo Canceling etc. Out of these, silence portion removal along with endpoint detection {{is the fundamental}} step for applications like Speech and Speaker Recognition. The proposed method uses multi-layer perceptron along with hierarchal mixture model for classification of voiced part of a speech from silence/unvoiced part. The work shows better end point detection as well as silence removal. The study is based on timing-based traffic analysis attacks {{that can be used}} to reconstruct the communication on end-to-end voipsystems by taking advantage of the reduction or suppression of the generation of traffic whenever the sender detects avoice inactivity. Removal of the silence in between the inter packet time in order to obtain a clear communication. The proposed attacks can detect speakers of <b>encrypted</b> <b>speech</b> communications with high probabilities. With the help of different codecs we are going to detect speakers of speech communications In comparison with traditional traffic analysis attacks, the proposed traffic analysis attacks do not require simultaneous accesses to one traffic flow of interest at both sides...|$|E
40|$|The reiterative epenthesis of a {{meaningless}} syllable or segment {{known as a}} crypteme is the mechanism that drives the Mexican ludling known as hablando con/por la ‘f’. The epenthetic material allows the speakers of the ludling to obscure ordinary Spanish by interrupting {{the continuity of the}} segmental material, but the suprasegmental material—specifically word stress—is also interrupted. Using phonetic analysis of the ludling, this study has demonstrated that ludlings do not maintain primary or secondary stress placement from ordinary Spanish to ludling-encrypted Spanish. Moreover, the three phonetic qualities of word stress (pitch, intensity, and duration) are not used in the same way within the ludling as they are used in ordinary Spanish. In particular, pitch, which linguists such as Monroy (1980) and Alcoba and Murillo (1998) believed to be the stress-producing mechanism in Spanish, is used to demarcate the boundary of the crypteme and can therefore be used to help ludling speakers to filter out the confounding material. Other linguists, like Navarro (1944 and 1957), have instead argued that intensity is phonetically responsible for marking stress, but in the present study, no evidence was found to support that claim, neither in the ludling data nor in the unencrypted Spanish control data. Finally, this thesis provides an evaluation of two contrasting theories on ludlings similar to the one studied. The work of Piñeros and of Botne and Davis offer differing hypotheses of how epenthetic ludling speakers produce <b>encrypted</b> <b>speech,</b> and using spectrographic analysis, the implications of each hypothesis are tested. ...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{scrambling}} {{methods are}} widely used for copyright protection and <b>encrypting</b> digital <b>speech</b> signals in order to guarantee the confidentiality of the original signals. They are very important methods for preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized copying. However, {{it seems to be}} impossible to completely recover a scrambled speech signal into the original signal. Moreover, nobody can comprehend the partial speech content from speech signals scrambled with these methods. In this paper, we propose a semi-scramble method for speech signals based on phonemic restoration. By using a speech scrambling method based on the random-bit shift of quantization bits, speech signals are converted to scrambled signals in partial intervals. We evaluated the confidentiality and efficiency of the proposed method by using two objective measures, signal-to-error ratio (SER) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). As a result, we confirmed that the proposed method can play a role in copyright protection for an original signal and recover a semi-scrambled speech signal into the original one. Finally, we indicated that the acoustic characteristics of signal semi-scrambled with the proposed method enable the listener to understand the speech information...|$|R
40|$|The secure {{transmission}} of speech information {{is a significant}} issue faced by many security professionals and individuals. By applying voice-encryption technique any kind of <b>encrypted</b> sensitive <b>speech</b> data such as password can be transmitted. But this has the serious disadvantage that by means of cryptanalysis attack encrypted data can be compromised. Increasing the strength of encryption/decryption results in an associated increased in the cost. Additional techniques like stenography and digital watermarking {{can be used to}} conceal information in an undetectable way in audio data. However this watermarked audio data has to be send through unreliable media and an eavesdropper might get hold of secret message and can also determine the identity of a speaker who is sending the information since human voice contains information based on its characteristics such as frequency, pitch, and energy. This paper proposes Normalized Speech Watermarking technique. Speech signal is normalized to hide the identity of the speaker who is sending the information and then speech watermarking technique is applied on this normalized signal that contains the message (password) so that what information is transmitted should not be unauthorizedly revealed.

40|$|Abstract. In chaotic {{speech signal}} encryption, masking {{is the most}} direct and {{convenient}} method. But the chaotic signals usually have a narrow spectral range in low frequency region. In order to overcome the disadvantage that the higher frequency signals can not be completely covered up, UPT is used to conduct a nonlinear transformation to chaotic signal. After UPT, chaotic types are increased, chaotic characteristics are improved and spectral range is widened. Simulation experiments are done respectively from frequency domain and spectrogram perspectives. The chaos before and after transformation are used to mask speech signal. Decoding experiment is taken on the <b>speech</b> <b>encrypted</b> by transformed chaos. Experiment results show that, after UPT, the encryption effect of speech signal is improved obviously. This method has a high security and a strong anti-attack ability...|$|R
40|$|The use of FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and {{configurable}} processors is {{an interesting}} new phenomenon in embedded development. FPGAs offer all of the features needed to implement most complex designs. Clock management is facilitated by on-chip PLL (phase-locked loop) or DLL (delay-locked loop) circuitry. Dedicated memory blocks can be configured as basic single-port RAMs, ROMs, FIFOs, or CAMs. Data processing, as embodied in the devices’ logic fabric, varies widely. The ability to link the FPGA with backplanes, high-speed buses, and memories is afforded by support for various single ended and differential I/O standards. Also found on today’s FPGAs are system-building resources such as high speed serial I/Os, arithmetic modules, embedded processors, and large amounts of memory. Here in our project {{we have tried to}} implement such powerful FPGAs in the design of possible embedded systems that can be designed, burned and deployed at the site of operation for handling of many kinds of applications. In our project we have basically dealt with two of such applications –one the prioritized traffic light controller and other a <b>speech</b> <b>encrypting</b> and decrypting system...|$|R
