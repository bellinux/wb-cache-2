5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, S.pungens {{forms an}} {{intimate}} mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium {{and the young}} roots of the associated host tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> role of S.pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, {{it is not a}} dominant root colonizer, and occupies {{only a small percentage of}} ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.|$|E
5|$|Various studies <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> use of anticoagulation to {{suppress}} blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been}} a concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E

25|$|Carbon dioxide, while {{vital for}} photosynthesis, is {{sometimes}} referred to as pollution, because raised levels of the gas in the atmosphere are affecting the Earth's climate. Disruption of the environment can also highlight the connection between areas of pollution that would normally be classified separately, such as those of water and air. Recent studies <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> potential for long-term rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to cause slight but critical increases in the acidity of ocean waters, and the possible effects of this on marine ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|Researchers <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> {{effect of}} {{hormonal}} contraceptive use in {{women on the}} frequency of sexual intercourse. Many of these contraceptives mimic a pregnancy state in females by altering hormone levels. Therefore, women who use these contraceptives do not experience the fertile phases of their cycles. In a systematic review, {{it appeared that the}} frequency of sexual intercourse was unaffected by contraceptive use in the majority of women. Although artificially created, this adds to the literature documenting the existence of copulation in humans during non-fertile periods.|$|E

25|$|Hydrologists {{from the}} University of Colorado <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> impacts of beetle-infested forests {{on the water}} cycle, in particular, snow {{accumulation}} and melt. They concluded that dead forests will accumulate more snowpack {{as a result of}} thinner tree canopies and decreased snow sublimation. These thinned canopies also cause faster snow melt by allowing more sunlight through to the forest floor and lowering the snowpack albedo, as a result of needle litter on the snow surface. Augmented snowpack coupled with dead trees that no longer transpire will likely lead to more available water.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) <b>have</b> <b>investigated</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} impacts {{climate change}} could have on agriculture, {{and how this}} would affect attempts at alleviating poverty in the developing world.

However, the vulnerability of the poor in developing countries to short term impacts from climate change, notably the increased frequency and severity of adverse weather events is likely to have a negative impact. This, they say, should be taken into account when defining agricultural policy.|$|E
