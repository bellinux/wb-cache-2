25|$|Given {{that reason}} alone cannot {{determine}} whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not know the}} outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.|$|E
25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not understand the physics involved.|$|E
25|$|English text, {{treated as}} a string of characters, has fairly low entropy, i.e., is fairly predictable. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know exactly {{what is going to}} come next, we can be fairly certain that, for example, 'e' will be far more common than 'z', that the {{combination}} 'qu' will be much more common than any other combination with a 'q' in it, and that the combination 'th' will be more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'. After the first few letters one can often guess the rest of the word. English text has between 0.6 and 1.3 bits of entropy per character of the message.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you bet I'll go, Mr. Farrington. The store closes {{at twelve}} on Saturdays. I guess Coney'll {{be all right}} <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> spend a week with the swells." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey {{would take}} ten years, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not know the}} way. And <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> what use would that be? The princess is no bride for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are but a}} short {{distance}} {{on this side of}} the town. We could not hope to get there before the Bairds; and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> it would be a quarter of an hour before we could mount and be off." ...|$|R
2500|$|If we {{actually}} construct our finite fields {{in such a}} fashion that [...] is contained in [...] whenever [...] divides , then this direct limit can be constructed as the union of all these fields. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not construct our fields this way, we can still speak of the algebraic closure, but some more delicacy is required in its construction.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, in {{response}} to a fallacious news article deemed to slander the nation, Circassian activists ramped up efforts with the scheduling of a mass-protest against the ignorance of the Russian government and the Russian people of their rights in Karachaevo-Cherkessia. However, the government canceled the gathering, saying it would be banning any and all public gatherings for an indefinite period {{to prevent the spread of}} the H1N1 flu virus. However, the head of the Circassian youth movement, Timur Jujuev, said [...] "All the public markets continue working on a regular basis, so where is the emergency? We are going to organize the demonstration even if we will need to wear surgical masks and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have a license from the government. This is not the will of one or two men; it is the will of a nation, and we have right to say what we think".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 12th century, the {{cartulary}} of Saint Hugues {{reveals the}} existence of two other parishes, Saint-Simond with its church and that of Saint-Hippolyte (in the current area of Mouxy) also with a small priory. Urban geography begins to clarify: One can imagine the small town, contained in its walls, which nobody knew when was built. The central point of the town is the priory, near the ancient Roman temple. This centre could also have been the administrative centre since at least the 13th century. Aix was a seigneurie subservient to the [...] , who had a château which, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not place with certainty, was probably the location of the actual château. Two hamlets are attested, Saint-Hippolyte, in the immediate vicinity of the town but outside the ramparts, with a small priory at the centre and at its side, now under the Villa Chevalley, a strong House, the maison forte de Saint-Pol , dependent upon the de Savoie family which recent studies date back to the 13th century. A second important village appears, Saint Simond (Saint Sigismond) with it having a church and a cemetery, established as a parish, and a dependant of Saint-Hippolyte.|$|E
5000|$|On {{being asked}} by his granddaughter, Brenda Furey, why he {{never tried to}} escape, he stated [...] "Your couldnt, there would be police with ammunition, {{continually}} walking around the wall, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> where would <b>we</b> go because we didnt even know the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} very slow work beating back up this inlet; and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so there isn't a stage across the island for several days. No doubt, you {{remember}} {{that you have to}} see that contractor on Thursday; and there's the directors' meeting, too." ...|$|R
60|$|I urged upon George, however, {{how much}} pleasanter {{it would be}} to have Harris clean and fresh about the boat, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> have to take a few more {{hundredweight}} of provisions; and he got to see it in my light, and withdrew his opposition to Harris’s bath.|$|R
60|$|Old Morton (aside). So our mishap {{is known}} everywhere. (Aloud.) No serious misfortune, Mr. Castro, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not recover the money. Adios.|$|E

6000|$|STRANGWAY. We're told otherwise. But come here! [Drawing {{him to the}} window] Look! Listen! To {{sleep in}} that! <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> it won't be so bad, Jack, will it? ...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not find}} {{statistical}} difference {{with all the}} strengths and TTR 1.1 was the best for lower strenghts, we decided to select TTR 1.2, to compare with the other solutions for unconstrained CIT test case generation, because TTR 1.2 performed better than TTR 1.1 for medium and higher strengths.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} too fast for us to catch him," [...] Edmund said carelessly; [...] "and as, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so, he could give us no {{information}} of any use, for you may be sure he has not ventured near the town, we may well let him go on in his way." ...|$|R
60|$|In this statement, then, of {{the past}} efforts of Spain--and of her present {{preparations}} for further efforts--will be found a full answer to all the charges alleged, by Sir John Moore in his letters, against the people of Spain, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not find sufficient ground for rejecting them in an examination of these letters themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma {{wanted us}} to come back," [...] {{explained}} Dora. [...] "She says, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> lose that fortune {{she wants me to}} have a better education, and she will pay the bill for Nellie and Grace, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{no other}} way," [...] replied the other. [...] "It is wondrous work to get them both here at all, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not succeed in luring him to the ground, we shall have {{accomplished}} much." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{secure a}} single plane for Western {{civilisation}} and ultimately for the world, {{there will be}} but slow and difficult progress in the lot of mankind. And unless we secure it, there will be only a march backwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall go quick, Mak. But {{in order}} to <b>do</b> that, <b>we</b> must eat well, and sleep {{at least an hour}} or so. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> push on just now, after a hard day's journey, without food or rest, we shall make but slow progress; and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> come up with the slave-dealer, we should not be in a very fit state for a battle." ...|$|R
30|$|Action {{precondition}} axioms: In what follows, all action precondition axioms {{are written}} using equivalent conditions except startWrite action. This {{is because we}} consider that all these actions are always permitted (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not mention the permission rules associated with them for simplicity). In contrast, precondition axiom of actions startWrite and endWrite will be rewritten later {{to take into account}} the permission rule associated with them.|$|R
30|$|In sum, a {{goal is a}} goal {{even before}} or without being pursued: {{satisfaction}} or happiness are due to goal-realization, and dissatisfaction or suffering are due to goal frustration, but not necessarily to our active successes or failures; we are sad because our mother has died, or happy because she gave us a kiss, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not ask for it, nor do or expected anything from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Eleanor, we {{understand}} each other, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not agree," [...] said Carley. [...] "You leave {{the future of}} women to chance, to life, to materialism, not to their own conscious efforts. I want to leave it to free will and idealism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr. Bathurst {{tells us}} to think {{it will all be}} right in the other world, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have to see the evil prosper here," [...] said Rose, gravely. [...] "The sufferings will all turn to glory, just as they did with our blessed King, out of sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|The two next {{examined}} the floor, {{to find it}} of brick, and as solid as the walls. [...] "Only the ceilin' left now," [...] said Luke. [...] "I reckon {{we might as well}} give it up. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> git out, more'n likely a guard outside will shoot us down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will march {{four miles}} along this road, and then strike off by another leading north. We must {{surprise}} them <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can. We don't really {{know much about}} their force, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> they may be joined by some other body before we get there--there are numerous bands of {{them all over the}} country. And in the next place, if they knew that we were coming, they might bolt before we got there.|$|R
5000|$|Phil Labonte stated {{about the}} song: [...] "Tru-Kvlt-Metal" [...] is really sarcastic. It's really {{directed}} towards {{the people that}} we've heard year after year, record after record, saying, 'Oh, put out another record like The Fall Of Ideals. We've <b>done</b> that, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it, some purist would say it's tarnished anyway because we've already done it. You can't win, so (the song) {{is kind of like}} flicking my nose at them and giving them the bird." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{spoke to}} Sarah about lettin' {{you take the}} old chest of drawers that was your mother's," [...] Tom whispered, as they stole along the narrow alley between the houses. [...] "Only she got on her high horse. Said that Daisy was as much my mother as yourn, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> have {{different}} fathers, and that the chest had always belonged in Daisy's family and not Captain Kit's, an' that it was mine, an' what was mine she had some say-so about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{would rather}} go round with you, George. I {{want to thank}} her for having kept it for me so long. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> miss the train it will not matter much, as it will make no {{difference}} whether we get in town an hour earlier or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{get inside}} the town, our plight can be no better. The Russians' cannon are bombarding it, night and day, and more {{batteries}} are in course of erection, and Schlippenbach the governor, who is, I believe, a brother of the general, has but a few pieces to reply to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} telling the rajah," [...] Harry went on, [...] "that the men must provide {{themselves}} with long bamboos, which they can thrust through the openings in the stockade, and push the faggots away. But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> so, we must calculate upon the enemy succeeding, in some places, in setting the palisades on fire." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{promised to}} be a messy passage, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{make it in the}} two or three days that would have been {{required}} if the southeast trades had been blowing fresh. But they weren't blowing fresh. After the first five hours the trade died away in a dozen or so gasping fans. The calm continued all that night and the next day--one of those glaring, glassy calms, when the very thought of opening one's eyes to look at it is sufficient to cause a headache.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And for you too, my boy. We {{should carry}} the Ballydehob branch {{to a dead}} certainty; and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not do that, we'd bring it so near it that the {{expectation}} of it would send the shares up like mercury in fine weather. They are at £2 12s. 6d. now, and, if I am in the House next Session, they'll be up to £7 10s. before Easter; and what's more, my dear fellow, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't help ourselves in that way, they'll be worth nothing in a very few months.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I daresay we might, captain; but if, as is probable, {{they come}} in large canoes, three of us would make but very little speed with one of them, {{and we should be}} pursued and {{overtaken}} in no time. You may be sure that they don’t spend the night up on the hill, and probably when they go up they will leave some of their number on the beach to look after the canoes, and cook. But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> get away <b>we</b> could <b>do</b> nothing with such a canoe.” ...|$|R
