40|$|The use of soil {{bio-engineering}} {{techniques in}} developing countries is {{a relevant issue for}} disaster mitigation, environmental restoration and poverty reduction. Research on authochtonal plants suitable for this kind of works and on economic efficiency is essential for the divulgation of such techniques. The present paper is focused on this two issues related to the realization of various typologies of soil bio-engineering works in the humid tropic of Nicaragua. In the area of RÃ­o Blanco, located in the Department of Matagalpa, soil bio-engineering installations were built in several sites. The particular structures built were: drainages with live <b>fascine</b> <b>mattress,</b> a live palisade, a vegetated live crib wall for riverbank protection, a vegetative covering made of a metallic net and biotextile coupled with a live palisade made of bamboo. In order to evaluate the suitability of the various plants used in the works, monitorings were performed, one in the live palisade alongside an unpaved road and the other on the live crib wall along a riverbank, collecting survival rate and morphological parameters data. Concerning the economic efficiency we proceed to a financial analysis of the works and once the unit price was obtained, we converted the amount in EPP Dollars (Equal Purchasing Power) in order to compare the Nicaraguan context with the Italian one. Among the used species we found that Madero negro (Gliricidia sepium) and Roble macuelizo (Tabebuia rosea) are adequate for soil-bioengineering measure on slopes while Helequeme (Erythrina fusca) reported a successful behaviour only in the crib wall for riverbank protection. In the comparison of the costs in Nicaragua and in Italy, the unit price reduction for the Central American country ranges between 1. 5 times (for the vegetative covering) and almost 4 times (for the <b>fascine</b> <b>mattress)</b> if it's used the EPP dollar exchange rate. Conclusions are reached with regard to hydrological-risk mitigating actions performed on a basin scale and through naturalistic (live) interventions: not only are they socially and technically attainable, even in hardship areas (by maximizing the contribution of the local labor force and minimizing the use of mechanical equipment), but they are also economically sustainable...|$|E
40|$|The bed {{and bank}} of a river, {{enclosing}} structures and other works where water is involved {{are exposed to}} waves, currents and water level changes. Bed and bank protection works are necessary to prevent eroding of the bed, bank or structure. Bed and bank protection works, on <b>fascine</b> <b>mattresses,</b> geotextile or on a granular filter, are important hydraulic engineering works. They are constructed out of thin layers of granular material. For the construction of these protection works stone-dumping vessels are often used. Granular material dumped by a side stone-dumping vessel will hit the bottom at a certain place and cover it with a thin layer. Repeated thin layers of dumped material will eventually form the bed or bank protection work of a certain thickness. The protection works are constructed in sections, which should all be of equal thickness to ensure a regular protection layer. Therefore {{it is important to}} know where stones, if dumped overboard, will hit the bottom and what happens when they hit the bottom. A theoretical model has been developed for the distribution of stones dumped in stationary water, based on a flat bottom. This theoretical model has already been validated by experiments done on a flat bottom. Bed and bank protection works, however, are often constructed on a slope. It is unknown whether the theoretical model is valid in this situation. In this model based on a flat bottom, the Single Stone Model, the stones are dumped at one spot. This theory can be rewritten to the Line Distribution model in which stones are dumped into the water over a certain length, like in the case of a side stone-dumping vessel. Like the Single Stone Model, this theory is based on dumping stones on a flat bottom. Experiments researching this theory have been performed (figure 1). In this thesis, results of experiments investigating the influence of slopes on the distribution of the stones dumped by a side stone-dumping vessel are reported and the validity of the Line Distribution Model on a slope is verified. In the experiments three different slope angles were used to investigate the influence of them. The distribution of stones dumped on a slope of 1 : 4 can be described by the Line Dumping Model without slope correction, for all water depths and stone diameters as used in the experiments. Apparently this slope angle is too small to influence the dumping process. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
50|$|Where a {{river is}} narrow near its mouth, has a {{generally}} feeble discharge {{and a small}} tidal range, the sea is liable on an exposed coast to block up its outlet during severe storms. The river is thus forced to seek another exit at a weak spot of the beach, which along a low coast may be at some distance off; and this new outlet in its turn may be blocked up, so that the river {{from time to time}} shifts the position of its mouth. This inconvenient cycle of changes may be stopped by fixing the outlet of the river at a suitable site, by carrying a jetty on each side of this outlet across the beach, thereby concentrating its discharge in a definite channel and protecting the mouth from being blocked up by littoral drift. This system was long ago applied to the shifting outlet of the river Yare to the south of Yarmouth, and has also been successfully employed for fixing the wandering mouth of the Adur near Shoreham, and of the Adour flowing into the Bay of Biscay below Bayonne. When a new channel was cut across the Hoek van Holland to provide a straighter and deeper outlet channel for the river Maas, forming the approach channel to Rotterdam, low, broad, parallel jetties, composed of <b>fascine</b> <b>mattresses</b> weighted with stone, were carried across the foreshore into the sea {{on either side of the}} new mouth of the river, to protect the jetty channel from littoral drift, and cause the discharge of the river to maintain it out to deep water. The channel, also, beyond the outlet of the river Nervion into the Bay of Biscay has been regulated by jetties; and by extending the south-west jetty out for nearly 0.5 mi with a curve concave towards the channel the outlet has not only been protected to some extent from the easterly drift, but the bar in front has been lowered by the scour produced by the discharge of the river following the concave bend of the southwest jetty. As the outer portion of this jetty was exposed to westerly storms from the Bay of Biscay before the outer harbour was constructed, it has been given the form and strength of a breakwater situated in shallow water.|$|R
40|$|In 1990, in Bangladesh, the "Meghna {{roads and}} highway bridge"was finisthed. This bridge {{is the first}} one in a series of two Bridges {{replacing}} the ferries over the Upper Meghna River. During construction, and also after the finalization of the Bridge, it was revealed that the designers of this Bridge underestimated the power of the Upper Meghna River here. This revealed itself in various aspects. The most severe ones are the slope failure just upstream from the Bridge which occurred already during the construction, the collapse of (parts of) the slope protection of one of the Bridge's abutments (eight months after the finalization) and the present danger induced by the morphological planform changes of the river just upstream of the Bridge. In the future this could lead to outflanking of the Bridge by the River. This study discusses the various possible measures which can be taken to safeguard the Meghna Bridge on the long term. Firstly, in part I of this report, the present situation at the location of the Meghna Bridge is described and analyzed. Subsequently, in part I I of this Report, a design study is conducted. Designs, solving the present problems, are elaborated onto a detailed design level. These designs are all elaborated with the specific characteristics of Bangladesh being a developing country in mind. Therefore an important aspect during the design study is the use of local resources (both technical as labour) as much as possible. The design study resulted in three final alternatives. These alternatives are evaluated by means of a Multi Criteria Analysis for their non-monetary criteria. Taking also into account the costs estimates for all alternatives resulted in the recommendation of "alternative I I I ". This "alternative III" consists of the following. A series of six groynes is foreseen in the river bend just upstream of the Bridge and a guide bank structure replaces the damaged abutment of the Bridge. A remarkable aspect of this finally recommended design is the fact that all projected structures are to be constructed with a core of sand cement stone and concrete blocks as slope protection. Instead of the (almost classical) method of a soil core with a slope protection of <b>fascine</b> <b>mattresses</b> etc., which is also elaborated being one of the alternatives, it is concluded that the application of sand cement stone as construction material here is the best option. This is explained by a combination of reasons. As the country of Bangladesh is located in one of the largest deltas in the world its soil consists mainly of the fine alluvial deposits as (rather fine) sand. Therefore rock and boulders are rather scarce construction materials here. Another important aspect is the fact that Bangladesh is a developing country. Therefore "high tech" construction techniques as dredging in deep water and the placing of elements under water are locally not (yet) widely known and available. Using sand cement stone and concrete blocks as construction materials requires only simple construction techniques. Another merit is {{the fact that in the}} structures rather steep slopes can be applied which results in a (relative) saving of material and therefore results in low costs. These (and others) reasons finally resulted in the recommendation of the mentioned alternative. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
