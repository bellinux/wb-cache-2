25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] speak of heartbreak and are direct, {{referring}} to the subject by his first name, Drew. The song describes fancying someone who already interested in someone else and, therefore, maintaining the sentiments a secret. To him, Swift acted {{as though she was}} happy about his relationship, while crying and lamenting at home. Dave Heaton of PopMatters interpreted the lines [...] "And there she goes, so perfectly / The kind of flawless <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be" [...] to address Swift's ideal of perfection and her attempting to meet it, but not succeeding, a predominant theme on Fearless.|$|E

I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have that time over again to redo this one."

500|$|Further Sky was {{met with}} {{received}} positive reviews music critics. AbsolutePunk staff member Aj LaGambina considered the release [...] "easily digestible" [...] and praised its [...] "cohesiveness". He thought the songs were composed well, despite the short recording time-frame. LaGambina described the production as [...] "well balanced" [...] and praised Fisher's vocals as [...] "com a very long way" [...] from the band's first album, <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Stay Here (2011). The only criticism the reviewer appointed to the EP was the percussion which sounded [...] "a bit cymbal heavy." [...] Alternative Press contributor Brian Kraus wrote that the band stuck with the alternative rock sound that they had used on Colourmekindness for this EP. He described Fisher's vocals as [...] "stretch across the canvas", and not too dissimilar {{to those of the}} members of Swervedriver. Kraus considered [...] "Animal Nitrate" [...] the [...] "most sprawling song" [...] of the set.|$|E
500|$|I cannot {{withhold}} my compliments {{from the}} government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march .... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent ....

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E

500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant would remind him that the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> call a waitress 'honey'." ...|$|E
500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him.

500|$|According to AllMusic, {{the album}} is mostly {{influenced}} by dance-pop, post-disco and pop rock music.

Madonna commented on her debut album: [...] "The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control.

[...] The album starts with the song [...] "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps. A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound. The song revolves around the [...] "Starlight, starbright" [...] hook for more than a minute, before going to the chorus. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.|$|E
