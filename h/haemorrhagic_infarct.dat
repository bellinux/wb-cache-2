40|$|Background: We present here {{a case of}} {{haemorrhagic}} brain infarction in {{a middle-aged}} and physically active male, who had never smoked. This case report aims to remind the internist and neurologist {{to bear in mind}} unusual aetiologies of brain infarcts in patients without classical cardiovascular risk factors. Case Description: A 49 -year-old male with pulmonary asthma and a prior history of nasal polyps had a wake-up stroke with left-sided symptoms and speech disturbance. A head MRI and MR angiography revealed a recent <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct</b> in the right putamen and corona radiata. The left hemiparesis progressed to sensory-motor hemiplegia on the 4 th day. In the head CT, it was shown that the <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct</b> had progressed to a large haematoma. A pansinusitis was also diagnosed. The aetiological investigations revealed a minor atrial septal defect (ASD) with shunting and a heterozygotic clotting factor V R 506 Q mutation. A remarkable blood eosinophilia of 9. 80 E 9 /l (42 %) together with fever, sinusitis, wide-spread bilateral nodular pulmonary infiltrates that did not respond to wide-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, positive anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, a high myeloperoxidase antibody level and slightly positive anti-proteinase 3 antibodies suggested the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome. These inflammatory symptoms and findings promptly responded to treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Conclusions: Even after the concomitant findings of the low risk factors, i. e. small ASD and heterozygotic clotting factor mutation, continued search for the final aetiology of stroke revealed Churg-Strauss syndrome, which was the key to the treatment...|$|E
40|$|Haemorrhagic {{transformation}} (HT) {{of brain}} infarction or hemorrhagic infarction is a complication of acute ischemic stroke, especially in cardioembolic stroke, and represents {{the most feared}} complication of thrombolysis. HT is a multifocal secondary bleeding into brain infarcts with innumerable foci of capillary and venular extravasation either remaining as discrete petechiae or emerging to form confluent purpura. HT is evidenced as a parenchymal area of increased density within an area of low attenuation in a typical vascular distribution on non-contrasted CT scans and is subdivided into two major categories {{on the basis of}} standardised definition: <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct</b> (HI) and parenchymal haematoma (PH). PH has been associated to poor outcome in ischemic stroke patients. Thus, its prevention, early detection and adequate treatment represent key points in the management of acute stroke. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dermoid cyst (Mature cystic teratoma), {{the most}} common type of {{primordial}} germ cell ovarian tumors is usually benign and asymptomatic. It can be malignant for only 5 per cent. Giant ones can be symptomatic. Torsion is {{the most common}} complication. Ovarian (adnexal) torsion is defined that is twisting of ovarian(adnexal) mass around itself and compression of its vascular pedicle. Unless it's diagnosed and treated quickly, ovarian torsion can give a way to <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct</b> and necrosis of that ovary. Torsion occurs and progesses in a few hours. The most important entities are early diagnosis and early treatment. Clinical signs are similar in pregnant and non-pregnant cases. Approximately 20 per cent can give symptoms during pregnancy. It can occur in any trimester, but especially in first trimester. The patient complains about severe lower abdominal and pelvic pain, nausea and vomiting. Ultrasound and Doppler scan are first choices to make a diagnosis. For an exact assessment and treatment, it is warranted to detorsion of that adnex-ovary, visualize and observe its vitality during the operation. Here we are presenting a case that is pregnant in ten weeks' gestation with bilateral dermoid cyst and unilateral ovarian torsion. [Cukurova Med J 2015; 40 (4. 000) : 814 - 817...|$|E
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} {{fails to}} ascertain, or exclude, {{the presence of}} intracranial haemorrhage in {{a considerable number of}} cases, especially in subarachnoid haemorrhage and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts.</b> A number of other methods, including cerebrospinal fluid spectrophotometry and cytology have, therefore, been tested to define their diagnostic efficacy in 25 cases of confirmed intracranial haemorrhage and in 25 instances of blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid due to traumatic puncture. The combination of spectrophotometry and cytology proved to have a high diagnostic reliability. On the basis of these results a routine scheme of investigation is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Isolated {{angiitis}} of the CNS (IACNS) commonly presents with recurrent ischaemic or <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts,</b> but {{subarachnoid haemorrhage}} is rare. Three patients with IACNS and subarachnoid haemorrhage are reported. Florid granulomatous angiitis with Langhans and foreign body type giant cells {{was found at}} necropsy in a child with sudden death. In two other patients the diagnosis was made angiographically. In one patient multifocal infarcts on MRI became evident one week after subarachnoid haemorrhage despite initial treatment with prednisone. Subarachnoid haemorrhage {{may be the first}} presentation of IACNS. Characteristic radiographic findings may allow early diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|We studied 305 {{patients}} with a first stroke and a potential cardiac source of embolism (PCSE), {{on the basis of}} the Lausanne Stroke Registry. We have compared these {{patients with}} 1006 patients with stroke but without PCSE, admitted into the Registry during the same period, in order to assess the potential role of PCSE and the coexistence of other causes of stroke. Analysis of the various types of PCSE suggests that some neurologic characteristics are more frequent in patients with than without PCSE (infarcts of the posterior division of middle cerebral artery with Wernicke's aphasia and lateral hemianopia; maximal neurologic deficit at onset; <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Tetracyclines are a {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} which could play a therapeutic role in several neurological disorders. Minocycline, extensively studied in animal models, decreased the size of ischaemic and <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct.</b> In Parkinson's disease models minocycline protected the nigrostriatal pathway, and in Huntington's disease and motoneuron disease models delayed the progression of disease extending the lifespan. Finally, in human diseases such as stroke and multiple sclerosis tetracyclines seem to play some neuroprotective role. The main biological effects of tetracyclines are the inhibition of microglial activation, the attenuation of apoptosis, and the suppression of reactive oxygen species production. These mechanisms {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. Several reports showed that minocycline reduced mitochondrial Ca(2 +) uptake, stabilized mitochondrial membranes, and reduced the release into the cytoplasm of apoptotic factors. Other effects include up-regulation of mitochondrial bcl- 2 (an antiapoptotic protein), direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of mitogen activated protein kinases. It is still unclear which of these mechanisms plays the pivotal role in neuroprotective properties of tetracyclines. The anti-apoptotic effect of tetracyclines probably involves the mitochondrion. The major target for tetracyclines in neurodegeneration could lie within the complex network that links mitochondria, oxidative stress, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 and apoptosis. Here, we review the neuroprotective effects of tetracyclines in animal models and in human disease, and we focus on their possible mechanism(s) of action, with special regard to mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration...|$|E
40|$|Twenty five {{patients}} with post operative ischaemic deficits, following clipping of intracranial aneurysms, were studied. Hypertensive-hypervolaemic-haemodilution (triple H) therapy {{was given to}} all patients using colloids and crystalloids. CVP was used to monitor the fluid therapy. Dopamine was needed in 22 patients to elevate the systemic blood pressure. Vasospasm was confirmed in 20 patients with transcranial doppler studies (TCD). 20 (80 &#x 0025;) patients survived, 10 (40 &#x 0025;) with good outcome, 7 (28 &#x 0025;) with fair, 2 (8 &#x 0025;) with poor outcome and 1 (4 &#x 0025;) with vegetative state. There were 5 (20 &#x 0025;) deaths, 4 of which occurred due to infarct. All these patients had poor Hunt and Hess grade at admission, high Fisher grade haemorrhages in the initial CT scan and/or required prolonged temporary clipping at surgery. One death occurred due to central venous line induced septicaemia. The duration of &#x 2032;triple H therapy&#x 2032; amongst the survivors varied from 2 - 7 days {{with an average of}} 4. 6 days. The complications of &#x 2032;triple H therapy&#x 2032; included hypokalaemia (3 patients), <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct</b> (1 patient) and septicaemia (1 patient). It is concluded that &#x 2032;triple H therapy&#x 2032; is useful in treating vasospasm induced ischaemic deficits. It worsens brain oedema in presence of acute infarcts and hence is contraindicated in such patients. A further study involving a larger number of patients with strict haemodynamic and ICP monitoring is suggested to determine the usefulness of individual components of &#x 2032;triple H therapy&#x 2032;...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} features in a 42 year {{old man with}} malignant atrophic papulosis with CNS involvement are described. They included mental dysfunction, paraesthesiae, weakness of left limbs, with pyramidal tract signs, bilateral ptosis, progressing to total ophthalmoplegia and obtundation. There were two crops of characteristic papular lesions on trunk and limbs, with terminal evidence of a coagulopathy and bruises, resulting in death in six months. Papular biopsy revealed multiple microinfarcts in the dermal collagen. The brain showed multiple small <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> of both hemispheres, the lower mid-brain, pons and a cerebellar peduncle. Microscopy showed fibrin exudation in the leptomeninges, various stages of thrombosis of small arteries without inflammatory reaction, and corresponding acute and subacute microinfarcts. The pathogenetic basis of the disease {{appeared to be a}} combined vasculopathy and coagulopathy...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is a relatively rare type {{of stroke}} {{which can be}} complicated by intracerebral haemorrhage resulting often in poor prognosis. Antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus both {{have been associated with}} cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Furthermore, a few cases combining heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been described in the literature. We present a  57 -year-old female patient who was admitted reporting confusion and fever for 4 days. She was immobilized due to a thoracic vertebral fracture and received enoxaparin as a prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis. A computed tomography scan demonstrated extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and two ipsilateral <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts.</b> Moreover, the patient was serum-positive for heparininduced thrombocytopenia antibodies and had persistent fever. A thorough immunological and serological investigation turned out consistent with antiphospholipid syndrome with possible systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient was treated accordingly and was finally discharged one month later, afebrile, with mild neurological deficits...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{characteristics and}} neuropathological findings of 22 organ transplant recipients with CNS aspergillosis were reviewed. Thirteen patients had liver, six kidney, two heart and one had cluster transplants. The most frequent neurological symptoms were alteration of mental status (86 %), seizures (41 %) and focal neurological deficits (32 %). Meningeal signs were less common (19 %). Aspergillus spp {{invasion of the}} blood vessels with subsequent ischaemic or <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts,</b> and solitary or multiple abscesses were the predominant neuropathological findings. The lungs were the probable portal of entry; however, isolated CNS aspergillosis was seen in two patients. Antemortem diagnosis of the infection was made in half of the patients. Concomitant diabetes mellitus was noted in 59 % of the patients and bacterial or other severe infections in 86 %. No specific clinical or pathological pattern could be identified among patients with different types of organ transplants. In addition CNS aspergillosis was preceded by organ rejection {{and the need for}} intense immunosuppression and retransplantation in the majority of the patients...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and neuropathological {{findings}} {{are reported in}} 63 patients with hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloid angiopathy. Patients had mostly recurrent strokes, and at least 80 % of these were haemorrhages. Almost {{a third of the}} patients died within a year of their first and only recorded haemorrhage, half of them within two weeks. This angiopathy was restricted to the cerebral and cerebellar cortex and its covering leptomeninges. As the most important consequence, <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> and haemorrhages occurred in the subcortical white matter [...] that is, the region most vulnerable to impaired cortical circulation. Further development of these subcortical lesions gives rise to the fatal haemorrhages seen at necropsy. In so far as dementia occurs this is likely to result from multiple microinfarcts or haemorrhages. In most cases preamyloid lesions or diffuse plaques and early plaques were seen. No other type of plaque or neurofibrillary degeneration was found. The plaques occur in conjunction with the angiopathy, but may not occur even when the angiopathy is severe. In one patient plaques were totally absent. Angiopathy and plaques {{may be the result of}} the same mutation, the expression of which is governed by tissue factors or phenotypic differences between individual subjects...|$|R
40|$|In a {{multicentre}} trial of streptokinase in {{acute myocardial infarction}} 302 patients received an intravenous infusion of 2 500 000 IU of streptokinase over 24 hours, while 293 patients served as controls. Neither group received anticoagulants unless indicated by thromboembolic complications. No significant difference in mortality was evident during inpatient treatment nor at six-week or six-month follow-up. The inpatient death rate was 12 - 6 % in the streptokinase group and 13 - 7 % among controls. There {{was no significant difference}} in the peak levels or pattern of enzyme increase. The incidence of cardiac failure and reinfarction was similar in the two groups, but major arrhythmias were less common in those on streptokinase (P less than 0 - 05). In the streptokinase group there were 36 minor and six more serious haemorrhagic complications. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage may have contributed to the death of one patient in each group. There were 18 thromboembolic complications in the streptokinase group and 38 among the controls. Pathological examination of the hearts of 25 patients who had taken streptokinase and 24 controls showed no striking differences between the groups, but <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> were found in three patients who had received streptokinase. An infusion of streptokinase within 24 hours of the onset of acute myocardial infarction does not significantly affect the mortality or course of the illness up to six months...|$|R
40|$|The {{surgical}} {{evaluation of}} <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcted</b> intestine {{and the decision}} for or against bowel resection {{require a lot of}} experience and are subjective. The aim of this prospective, clinical {{study was to examine the}} correlation between oxygen saturation and small intestinal wall (IW) thickness, using two objective methods. In 22 colicky horses, the blood flow, oxygen saturation and relative amount of haemoglobin were measured intraoperatively via laser Doppler and white light spectroscopy (O 2 C, oxygen to see, LEA Medizintechnik) at six measuring points (MPs) in small and large intestines. Furthermore, the IW thickness was measured ultrasonographically. Nine of 22 horses had an increased small IW thickness greater than 4 ?mm (Freeman 2002, Scharner and others 2002, le Jeune and Whitcomb 2014) at measuring point 1 (MP 1) (strangulated segment), four horses had a thickened bowel wall at measuring point 3 (MP 3) (poststenotic) and one at measuring point 2 (MP 2). The oxygen saturation was 0 at MP 1 in six horses, at MP 3 in two horses and at MP 2 (prestenotic) in one. Oxygen saturation and small IW thickness were independent of each other at MP 1 and MP 2. At MP 3, the two parameters were negatively correlated. In summary, it is not possible to draw conclusions about oxygen saturation based on IW thickness...|$|R

The {{source of the}} outbreak was contaminated locally produced semi-dry fermented sausage (mettwurst). One child died of multiple <b>haemorrhagic</b> cerebral <b>infarcts.</b> Eighteen children required renal dialysis (for a median of 14 days); 12 months after discharge five still had significant impairment of renal function. Other major complications included colonic necrosis (3), cerebral haemorrhage/infarction (3), convulsions (4), and glucose intolerance (2).

40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that {{individuals}} with sickle-cell trait present no anaesthetic prob-lems {{with the result that}} sickle-cell screening is not performed in Negro patients unless they are anaemic. This complacent attitude is potentially dangerous and may be the cause of occasional postoperative morbidity or mortality. This report is of a 12 -year-old Negro patient with sickle-cell trait who was anaesthetized for an elective eye operation. After the operation, he developed signs of a <b>haemorrhagic</b> cerebral <b>infarct</b> with aphasia and hemiplegia. The problems and risks in anaesthetizing a patient with sickle-cell disease are well documented (Gilbertson, 1967). Some authors have assumed that the sickle-cell trait (AS haemoglobin) presents no special problems (Searle, 1973; Gilbertson, 1967; Oduntan and Isaacs, 1971), while others suggest that the precautions taken with the SS disease patients should be taken with the "carrier " also (Howells et al., 1972; Schenk, 1964). The carrier may be at risk because it is likely that many patients who come for operation with a sickle-cell "trait" may remain undiagnosed because many physicians believe that it is unnecessary to test for HbS if the haemoglobin concentration exceeds 12 g/ 100 ml in Negro patients despite evidence that this is not s...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of computed tomography (CT) was assessed in 325 consecutive {{patients with a}} "clinically definite first stroke" from a community stroke register. CT detected five "non-stroke" lesions (two cerebral gliomas, one cerebral metastasis, and two subdural haematomas), a frequency of 1. 5 %. Five patients were identified with cerebellar haemorrhage, but only one survived {{long enough to have}} a CT scan. CT was useful in excluding intracranial haemorrhage as the cause of the stroke in four patients receiving anticoagulants and seven receiving antiplatelet treatment; it showed intracranial haemorrhage in one patient taking aspirin. Forty six patients were in atrial fibrillation {{at the time of their}} stroke; four had intracranial haemorrhages and three had <b>haemorrhagic</b> cerebral <b>infarcts.</b> Nineteen patients with presumed ischaemic minor stroke were considered suitable for carotid endarterectomy; CT showed small haemorrhages in two. The CT scan provides very useful information in a minority (up to 28 %) of patients with first stroke, who can be selected on quite simple criteria: (a) doubt (usually because of an inadequate history) whether the patient has stroke or a treatable intracranial lesion; (b) the possibility of cerebellar haemorrhage or infarction; (c) the exclusion of intracranial haemorrhage in patients who either are already taking or likely to need antihaemostatic drugs or are being considered for carotid endarterectomy; (d) if the patient deteriorates in a fashion atypical of stroke...|$|R
40|$|A multicentre, double-blind, {{randomized}} {{study was}} performed in 179 patients with acute ischaemic stroke resulting in limb paresis. The purpose was to compare the safety and efficacy of Org 10172 (1250 anti-Xa Units s. c. once daily) and heparin sodium (5000 IU s. c. twice daily) in preventing deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Prophylaxis started within 72 hours of the onset of stroke and continued for at least 9 days. To detect DVT, patients underwent a daily 125 I fibrinogen leg scanning which, if found positive, was followed by venography. A first computed tomography scan of the brain was performed at screening to rule out cerebral haemorrhagic and second at cessation of treatment to detect any haemorrhagic transformations. At the 2 - 3 -months' follow-up period the patients were examined for {{signs and symptoms of}} DVT or pulmonary embolism. On an intention-to-treat analysis, DVT occurred in 14. 6 % of patients receiving Org 10172 and in 19. 8 % of those receiving heparin during the treatment period (p= 0. 392, NS). Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in one patient in each group. Major conversion to a symptomatic <b>haemorrhagic</b> brain <b>infarct</b> was found in one patient in each group. Death occurred in 13. 5 % of patients treated with Org 10172 and in 6. 7 % of patients treated with heparin (p= 0. 135, NS). Deaths were mainly related to pulmonary infection and cerebral oedema, thus considered to be due directly to the clinical status of the patients. 1250 anti-Xa Units of Org 10172 once daily is both safe and as effective as 5000 IU of heparin sodium twice daily given for DVT prophylaxis in patients with acute ischaemic stroke of recent onset. © 1994 British Geriatrics Society.

40|$|Dementia is an age-associated organic brain disorder, recogniz­able by the {{essential}} features of psychological or behavioral abnormality associated with permanent dysfunction {{of the brain}} interfering with social and occupational functioning. There are two clinical and three histopathological forms of dementia 1) primary degenerative dementia, (PDD), or Alzhei­mer's dementia/Senile dementia of Alzheimers type (AD/SDAT) which is associated with clinical features of uniform progres­sion and insidious onset of symptoms and histopathologically i- dentified by the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile/neuritic plaques (SP/NP) in various cortical and subcor- tical regions; 2) vascular dementia, or multi-infarct dementia (MID), which is associated with clinical features of stepwise progress and patchy distribution of deficits, and histopatholo­gically identified by the occurrence of multiple large and/or small <b>haemorrhagic</b> and/or ischaemic <b>infarcts</b> in various cortical and subcortical regions and 3) intermediate form of dementia or "mixed” ("combined") dementia (AD-MID), which is histopatho- logically associated with the coexistance of symptoms and le­sions observed in AD/SDAT and MID, and clinically referred to the MID group. The DSM-III criteria separate the demented into two groups, AD/SDAT and MID, {{while there are no}} unique clinical criteria for the AD-MID patients. The clinical diagnosis of dementia according to the DSM-III criteria was shown to be in­sufficient. Histopathological diagnostic criteria were postu­lated by us for 1) pathological changes developing in mentallyunimpaired ageing, 2) AD/ SPAT, 3) MID and 4) AD-MID. These histopathological classes could be separated, by means of multivariate data analysis. The pathology in AD-MID was shown not to be merely a linear combination of the AD/SDATand MID pathology. Intrathecal synthesis of Ig, oligoclonal bands or other abnormal proteins in the CSF could not be demonstrated in aged non-demen- ted and demented patients. The blood-cerebrospinal barrier (B-CSF-B) or blood-brain barrier (BBB) function alters with age and this alteration was shown to be more pronounced in MID and AD-MID patients. In MID and AD-MID patients the BBB alteration involves primarily the grey matter while in AD/SDAT patients the alteration would appear to involve only the white matter. The BBB dysfunction and a possible complement activation, either through antibody-anti- gen activation or other complement activators, was visualized in MID and AD-MID patients as perivascular serum protein depo­sits in the grey matter, always with a capillary in the center. The occurrence of some serum proteins in plaques, and the previously descibed localization of plaques in close relation­ship to the capillaries, suggest that altered BBB function and serum factors may be involved in the etiology and maturation of plaques while the etiology and maturation of tangles may not be directly dependent on these factors, as they were never labelled with any of the antisera studied.
