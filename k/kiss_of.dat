5|$|The {{score for}} the film was {{composed}} by Craig Armstrong, who was the arranger for Massive Attack, a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film Unleashed. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's <b>Kiss</b> <b>of</b> the Dragon). At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.|$|E
5|$|With her task finished, Elspeth {{tries to}} resume her {{beautiful}} guise with the mirror. But instead, the magic mirror returns {{her to her}} true form, even more loathsome than before, as punishment from the Green-Eyed One for killing her stepdaughter. Meanwhile, the dwarfs, unable to save Snow White, place her in a coffin of ice and leave her near Monday's statue. When she receives a <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> true love from Prince Alfred, in his bear form, she is revived. The spells on Alfred, Sunday, and Monday break, and Elspeth's mirrors shatter, freeing John. Elspeth gets cornered, tackled, and killed by the gnomes, who have been freed from their enchantments. Freed from Elspeth, the Green-Eyed One is able to go his way. Snow White and Alfred {{live happily ever after}} while the dwarfs decide to move on to find Sleeping Beauty.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} after Wallingford, but in {{a rather}} half-hearted fashion. Stephen lost the towns of Oxford and Stamford to Henry while the King was diverted fighting Hugh Bigod in the east of England, but Nottingham Castle survived an Angevin attempt to capture it. Meanwhile, Stephen's brother Henry of Blois and Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury were for once unified {{in an effort to}} broker a permanent peace between the two sides, putting pressure on Stephen to accept a deal. The armies of Stephen and Henry FitzEmpress met again at Winchester, where the two leaders would ratify the terms of a permanent peace in November. Stephen announced the Treaty of Winchester in Winchester Cathedral: he recognised Henry FitzEmpress as his adopted son and successor, in return for Henry doing homage to him; Stephen promised to listen to Henry's advice, but retained all his royal powers; Stephen's remaining son, William, would do homage to Henry and renounce his claim to the throne, in exchange for promises of the security of his lands; key royal castles would be held on Henry's behalf by guarantors, whilst Stephen would have access to Henry's castles; and the numerous foreign mercenaries would be demobilised and sent home. Stephen and Henry sealed the treaty with a <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> peace in the cathedral.|$|E

Henry and Stephen sealed the treaty with a <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> peace in the cathedral. The peace remained precarious, however, and Stephen's second son William remained a possible future rival to Henry. Rumours of a plot to kill Henry were circulating and, possibly as a consequence, Henry decided to return to Normandy for a period. Stephen, however, fell ill with a stomach disorder and died on 25 October 1154, allowing Henry to inherit the throne rather sooner than had been expected.|$|E

25|$|Kissing was {{a custom}} during the Biblical period {{mentioned}} in the , when Isaac kissed his son Jacob. The kiss is used in numerous other contexts in the Bible: the <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> homage, in Esther 5:2; of subjection, in 1 Samuel 10:1; of reconciliation, in 2 Samuel 14:33; of valediction, in Ruth 1:14; of approbation, in Psalms 2:12; of humble gratitude, in Luke 7:38; of welcome, in Exodus 18:7; of love and joy, in Genesis 20:11. There are also spiritual kisses, as in Canticles 1:2; sensual kisses, as in Proverbs 7:13; and hypocritical kisses, as in 2 Samuel 15:5. It was customary to kiss the mouth in biblical times, and also the beard, which is still practiced in Arab culture. Kissing the hand is not biblical, according to Tabor. The <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> peace was an apostolic custom, {{and continues to be}} one of the rites in the Eucharistic services of Roman Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Among {{primitive}} cultures it was usual {{to throw}} kisses {{to the sun}} and to the moon, {{as well as to}} the images of the gods. Kissing the hand is first heard of among the Persians. According to Tabor, the <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> homage—the character of which is not indicated in the Bible—was probably upon the forehead, and was expressive of high respect.|$|E
