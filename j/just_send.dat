2500|$|In April 2010, {{while not}} {{addressing}} directly widespread [...] "birther" [...] {{sentiment in the}} Republican Party, Tancredo said at a South Carolina Tea Party rally about the president: [...] "If his wife says Kenya is his homeland, why don't we <b>just</b> <b>send</b> him back?" ...|$|E
2500|$|October 21: John Lehman, {{a member}} of the 9/11 Commission, {{reported}} that Osama bin Laden was indeed alive, and that the Pentagon knew exactly where he was. According to Lehman, bin Laden was living in South Waziristan in the Baluchistan Mountains of the Baluchistan region, surviving from donations from outside countries such as the United Arab Emirates and high-ranking ministers inside Saudi Arabia. [...] "There is an American presence in the area, but we can't <b>just</b> <b>send</b> in troops," [...] Lehman said. [...] "If we did, we could have another Vietnam, and the United States cannot afford that right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the first}} two years of the war, Kellner looked to America to provide support for England and France. [...] Numerous entries in the diary reveal Kellner’s belief that Germany had no chance to win if America would put aside its {{neutrality}} and do more than <b>just</b> <b>send</b> supplies to England. [...] When America entered the war in 1941, the diary entries show Kellner’s impatience for the Allies to mount an effective invasion of the continent, and to bring the fight to the Germans on their own territory. [...] When the invasion of Normandy took place on June 6, 1944, Kellner inscribed in large letters in the entry of that date: “Endlich!,” meaning “Finally!” ...|$|E

2500|$|As the Union {{troops were}} rearranging their lines on June 21 in {{preparation}} for their mission against the railroad, they received a surprise visitor, President Abraham Lincoln, who had traveled by water and landed at City Point, Grant's newly established headquarters. He told Grant, [...] "I just thought I would jump aboard a boat and come down and see you. I don't expect I can do any good, and in fact I'm afraid I may do some harm, but I'll just put myself under your orders and if you find me doing anything wrong <b>just</b> <b>send</b> me right away." [...] After discussing strategy with Grant, Lincoln visited some of the VI Corps troops who would participate in the upcoming battle.|$|E
2500|$|After Work's {{death on}} February 1, 1832, the mill would {{pass through the}} hands of several owners, and would change with the times. [...] The Mill under Work was a custom mill, where farmer's would <b>just</b> <b>send</b> corn for their own {{personal}} use. Future owners would make the mill a merchant mill, where farmers would sell the corn to a mill and the mill would process the corn to sell for itself in various forms, from flour to grits to flakes. Some {{of this would be}} shipped on the Ohio and the Mississippi River. [...] The original mill wheel was made of oak, but in the mid-19th century the wheels became metal, as wooden wheels only lasted 5–10 years before needing major repairs. When John Hunt Morgan did his 1863 Raid the mill was seen as being in dangered, as Morgan ransomed other Indiana mills such as Beck's Mill. [...] An addition was added to the house in the 1860s.|$|E
2500|$|God Emperor of Dune (1981) reintroduces Idaho as {{a serial}} ghola: Leto II has ruled as a sandworm-human hybrid for 3,500 years, and has {{continually}} had an Idaho ghola to serve him. Beyond his personal affection for Idaho, to Leto Idaho represents loyalty, humanity, {{and the spirit}} of the unknown, something which the God Emperor, having perfect prescience, knows nothing of. It is also implied that Duncan is needed for Leto's plan for humanity's ultimate survival — called the Golden Path — to come to fruition. However, the Idaho gholas, with their memories restored, struggle to deal with what the Atreides have become. Where before, the hallmark of Atreides rule was justice, Leto's reign has been one of godhood and oppression. Idaho's old-fashioned conscience rebels, leading the Idaho ghola to attempt to kill Leto (who as a sandworm is invulnerable to all but water and extreme violence). Leto notes that only nineteen of [...] "his" [...] Duncans have survived long enough to die what is considered a [...] "natural death." [...] In just about all of these rebellions, the Idaho ghola is killed by the God Emperor. After a certain time, the God Emperor orders another one from the Tleilaxu, or the Tleilaxu themselves <b>just</b> <b>send</b> another one as a token for their security.|$|E

50|$|Apparitions is a BBC {{drama about}} Father Jacob Myers, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, played by Martin Shaw, who {{examines}} evidence of miracles {{to be used}} in canonisation but also performs exorcisms.

50|$|The VNC {{protocol}} is pixel based. Although {{this leads}} to great flexibility (e.g., any type of desktop can be displayed), it is often less efficient than solutions that {{have a better understanding}} of the underlying graphic layout, like X11. Those protocols send graphic primitives or high-level commands in a simpler form (e.g., open window), whereas RFB <b>just</b> <b>sends</b> the raw pixel data.|$|R

50|$|The PRU is {{staffed by}} a doctor and an Emergency Care Practitioner (ECP).

30|$|In the {{previous}} section we gave {{an overview of the}} system’s architecture – in particular we described the generic app’s main components. Amongst those components, the Statistics Manager was mentioned. This object’s purpose goes a lot further than <b>just</b> <b>sending</b> information about how popular each feature of an app is.

5000|$|... 1. Lamport One-Time Signatures. Proposed in 1979 by Leslie Lamport. Lamport {{one-time}} signatures {{are based}} on cryptographic hash functions. For signing a message, the signer <b>just</b> <b>sends</b> a list of hash values (outputs of a hash function) to a publishing server and therefore the signature process is very fast, though {{the size of the}} signature is many times larger, compared to ordinary public-key signature schemes.|$|R
