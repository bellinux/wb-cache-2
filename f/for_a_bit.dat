25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|That same day, GM 15 {{was ordered}} to advance from Khang Kho; they were {{supported}} by a Thai mercenary battalion. On 2 November, they were struck by the earliest ever start for a PAVN dry season offensive. As Task Force Charlie was shoved back to Ban Pa Dong and Khang Kho, GM 32 took an additional 80 killed and 85 wounded. Thus rendered no longer fit for combat, they were returned to MR 3. GM 15 clung to Khang Kho <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> but withdrew by 14 November. On 26 November, they were returned to Military Region 1. Task Force Charlie was finished.|$|E

25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood.

The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E
25|$|Later, in October, one of Insolents boats hit a rock, {{with the}} result that her captain and three seamen drowned.

He swam on <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> with her, still clothed, on his back, but eventually, exhausted, he had to let her go and watch her drown.|$|E
25|$|As {{the men and}} Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, {{formerly}} Marcello's sweetheart, {{arrives with}} her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting. It is clear she has tired of him. To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: Quando me'n vo'—"When I go along"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention. The ploy works; at the same time, Mimì recognizes that Musetta truly loves Marcello. To be rid of Alcindoro <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended. Alcindoro leaves, and Musetta and Marcello fall rapturously into each other's arms.|$|E

25|$|In {{the table}} below, several flow {{quantities}} and parameters according to Airy wave theory are given. The given quantities are <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more general situation {{as for the}} solution given above. Firstly, the waves may propagate in an arbitrary horizontal direction in the x=(x,y) plane. The wavenumber vector is k, and is perpendicular to the cams of the wave crests. Secondly, allowance is made for a mean flow velocity U, in the horizontal direction and uniform over (independent of) depth z. This introduces a Doppler shift in the dispersion relations. At an Earth-fixed location, the observed angular frequency (or absolute angular frequency) is ω. On the other hand, in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity U (so the mean velocity as observed from this reference frame is zero), the angular frequency is different. It is called the intrinsic angular frequency (or relative angular frequency), denoted as σ. So in pure wave motion, with U=0, both frequencies ω and σ are equal. The wave number k (and wavelength λ) are independent of the frame of reference, and have no Doppler shift (for monochromatic waves).|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{fact that}} {{four out of}} five Germans {{complain}} about too much stress. One in six under 60 swallows at least once a week, a pill for the soul, whether it is against insomnia, depression or just <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more drive in the stressful everyday life. The phases of burnout can be described, among other things, first by great ambition, then follows the suppression of failure, isolation and finally, the cynical attitude towards the employer or supervisor. Concerned persons have very often also anxiety disorders and depressions, which are serious mental diseases. Depressions are the predominant causes of the nearly 10,000 suicides that occur alone each year in Germany. The implications of such imbalances can be further measured in figures: In 1993, early retirement due to mental illness still made 15.4 percent of all cases. In 2008, there were already 35.6 percent. Even in the days of illness, the proportion of failures due to mental disorders increased. Statisticians calculated that 41 million absent days in 2008 went to the account of these crises, which led to 3.9 billion euros in lost production costs.|$|E

500|$|Richmond {{grew up in}} {{a wealthy}} family and lived a {{freewheeling}} lifestyle, earning him the nickname [...] "Hollywood".

Van Morrison's exploration of spirituality is discussed in the book, including his experiences with mysticism, Christianity, and Dianetics. In the last chapter of the book, Turner comments on Van Morrison's experiences in religion, writing: [...] "His development of religion as a normal topic of discourse in popular song {{may turn out to}} be his most lasting contribution." ...|$|E
