A review by Idolator noticed [...] "Britney" [...] has [...] "a melody that dares to be clear and pretty in ways emo bands [...] don’t usually dare," [...] and commented how the song's [...] "strongly sung" [...] lyrics are [...] "sweet [...] not cynical at all." [...] The Denver Post reported that after the song's release, Spears' mother Lynne thanked Norman for writing the song, [...] "because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to say to}} her daughter." [...] On the week of September 19, 2008, [...] "Britney" [...] peaked at number twenty-eight on Billboard Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture and Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, [...] "The Summer Bay cop may {{have lots of}} storylines, but the LC community don't really approve – mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!" [...] In July 2009, Deller said, [...] "It {{would be easy to}} spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is [...] "everything Charlie isn't". Stephen wondered if Charlie is going through an early menopause as she always appears [...] "to be in a sweat onscreen." [...] During a storyline, which saw Charlie decide she needs a counsellor to find her self-identity, Stephen complained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> seemed to mention since her [...] "foray into lesbianism." [...] Stephen did, however, agree that Charlie needed a counsellor. She also stated she could help by telling her; [...] "Charlie: you're a mess." [...] Stephen was critical of Charlie's relationship with Angelo, which she described as a [...] "rocky road". She wanted to know how much the show could [...] "wring out of their on/off romance" [...] and asked if somebody could send them out to sea in a sinking boat. Following Charlie and Angelo's 2011 break up, Stephen stated that the show needs to [...] "change the record!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{she said}} nothing about the sword, Olaf, so let <b>it</b> <b>be.</b> <b>All</b> <b>she</b> said <b>was</b> that I must be careful that the robe matched the colour of the {{necklace}} you wear. She cannot bear colours which jar upon each other, especially by lamp-light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (She is going. She lifts {{a pistol}} {{from the table}} and puts it in his [...] hand. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> can do for her old friend. She goes away with [...] shining eyes. The penny dip burns low. The great Emperor is lost in [...] its shadows.) ...|$|R
60|$|PURDIE. If any blame there <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> mine; <b>she</b> <b>is</b> as spotless as the driven snow. The moment I {{mentioned}} {{love to her}} {{she told}} me to desist.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{could do}} to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you born fool!" [...] She {{took up the}} {{spinning}} stick, {{and it looked like}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could do to keep from giving him a crack with it. [...] "What made you think I'd like it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate stood up, and backed. It was Aunt Barbara's straight, handsome, terrible face, {{and with}} a great black {{moustache}} to make it worse. She saw that, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> feared! She was glad the sofa was between them! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! but I'm armed. I {{always told}} you we might trust to my mother, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> right. <b>She</b> loves Lenore {{with all her}} heart, and {{consents}} freely and gladly." ...|$|R
50|$|In the novel, {{the journey}} of famed anguissette, Phèdre nó Delaunay, brings her {{all the way to}} Caerdicca Unitas, chasing after the path of the infamous traitor of Terre d'Ange, Melisande Shahrizai. Even still, the curse of her one true friend, Hyacinthe, haunts her. She {{has a long way to}} go if she will ever have the chance to free him from the curse that should have <b>been</b> hers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> can do to keep madness at bay and try to stay one step ahead of Melisande.|$|R
60|$|Until {{she heard}} the whistle which {{told her that the}} Minneapolis train was leaving town, she kept herself from thinking, from moving. Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over. <b>She</b> had no plan nor desire for anything.|$|R
6000|$|... and, if Minerva had not appeared, {{and held}} his hand, he had {{executed}} his design; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could do to dissuade him from it. The event was, that he left the army, and would fight no more. Agamemnon gives his character thus to Nestor; ...|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{looked at}} Labiskwee, who smiled, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{could do to}} keep from sinking down. He nodded for her to push off, but she came near to him, and side by side, a dozen feet apart, they flew down through the {{stinging}} thickness of cold fire.|$|E
60|$|When {{the boys}} {{returned}} to the farmhouse Minnie ran out to meet them, and from their manner saw at once {{that they had no}} news worth mentioning. They could see that the girl had been crying, and now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could do to keep from bursting into tears again.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> really <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{had asked}} for, {{but now that}} she had got what she wanted of me the foolish soul's eyes became wet, she knew so well that the {{youthful}} romances are the best.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maria's still away?"--that was {{the first}} thing she had asked him; and when he had found the frankness to <b>be</b> cheerful about <b>it</b> in spite of the meaning he knew her to attach to Miss Gostrey's absence, she had gone on to enquire if he didn't tremendously miss her. There were reasons that made him by no means sure, yet he {{nevertheless}} answered [...] "Tremendously"; which she took in as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> had wished to prove. Then, [...] "A man in trouble MUST be possessed somehow of a woman," [...] she said; [...] "if she doesn't come in one way she comes in another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind. I {{wish you}} would stop {{trying to tell me}} the story. I'm telling you. What {{happened}} was this: somehow--I can't make out how--mother found out. And then, of course, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over. <b>She</b> stopped the thing." ...|$|R
60|$|Hermione looked {{long and}} slow at Ursula, seeming to accept {{confirmation}} from her. Then {{the two women}} were silent. As {{soon as they were}} in accord, they began mutually to mistrust each other. In spite of herself, Ursula felt herself recoiling from Hermione. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could do to restrain her revulsion.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{could do}} to hinder her walk from losing its calm slowness, and before she could divest her {{intended}} reply of undignified sharpness, he continued: 'Who could have betrayed my presence? But for this, I meant that you {{should never have been}} aware that I was hovering near to watch over you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Helen never climbed so {{hard and}} fast before, and {{when they reached the}} ridge-top she was all tuckered out. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could do to get on her horse. Dale led along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the western end, which was {{considerably}} higher. In places open rocky ground split the green timber. Dale pointed toward a promontory.|$|E
60|$|Maud {{had opened}} her mouth to explain, to say that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> a mistake. <b>She</b> closed it again without speaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Open the door, our Ursula," [...] {{came the}} {{complaining}} cry. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over. <b>She</b> must open the door. She heard the screech of the bucket downstairs dragged across the flagstones {{as the woman}} washed the kitchen floor. And the children were prowling in the bedroom, asking: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rolland's bushy eyebrows frowned in stern {{disapproval of}} the new topic of conversation. 'I regret to hear <b>it,</b> my lady,' <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said.|$|R
60|$|When he recurred to {{her pale}} looks and languid manner, and {{expressed}} concern, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{could do to}} keep from bursting into tears, and telling all her griefs; and she could not control the rapid agitated tones that belied her repeated assurances that nothing was amiss, and that he must not give a bad account of her and alarm her mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was a tall}} girl, {{slim and}} slender, you know the kind, with black hair, remarkably long hanging, down loose behind her, as she stood there no more afraid than nothing, her arms spread out to stop the engine. She was wearing a slimpsy sort of garment wrapped around her that wasn't cloth but ocelot skins, soft and dappled, and silky. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> had on--" ...|$|E
60|$|Alice {{never could}} quite make out, in {{thinking}} it over afterwards, {{how it was}} that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{could do to keep}} up with her: and still the Queen kept crying 'Faster! Faster!' but Alice felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.|$|E
6000|$|... "In baskets. I'll {{get you a}} piece, and you can try it." [...] So Twinkle flew up {{and crept}} into her basket again, quickly {{returning}} {{with a bit of}} cookie in her claw. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{not much more than a}} crumb, but nevertheless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>she</b> could carry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Horrid thing! <b>It</b> should <b>be</b> <b>all</b> white,' <b>she</b> murmured. 'And {{the gate}} isn't {{in the middle}} of the wall, either. I never noticed that before.' ...|$|R
50|$|Chellamma {{once again}} goes and tells Muthazhagu about the affair between Kadarkarai and Sneha, but {{she refuses to}} believe it. Later she {{questions}} Kadarkarai who says <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> lies. <b>She</b> asks him to confirm it by promising on their daughter Rathna, which he does having no other option, which he grieves a lot about.|$|R
60|$|It took a {{good deal}} to {{surprise}} Anna, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could do to follow Mr. Earles with composure into the inner room. There was a little murmur of consternation from the waiting crowd, and the florid young woman showed signs of temper, to which Mr. Earles was absolutely indifferent. He installed Anna in a comfortable easy chair, and placed his own {{between her and the}} door.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} she felt unnerved, and then resolutely pulled herself together. This {{was no time for}} hysteria. It was obvious that she had been duped. The lost sum was not large, but with the {{exception}} of a few coins <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> had, and it had not been stolen by a common thief. Somebody had searched her clothes while she slept and taken the money with the object of embarrassing her.|$|E
60|$|Little Sall {{went off}} like the wind, and soon {{returned}} with the redoubtable Charles in her arms. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could do to stagger under the load; but Charlie Christian had not yet attained to facility in walking. He {{was still in the}} nude stage of childhood, and his faithful nurse, being afraid lest he should get badly scratched if dragged at a rapid pace through the bushes, had carried him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, hasn't <b>it</b> <b>been</b> a {{brilliant}} evening?" [...] sighed Anne, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over and <b>she</b> and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry sky.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> true as <b>she</b> had pictured--she {{could have}} sworn it. Lucetta had a {{heightened}} luminousness in her eye {{over and above the}} advanced colour of her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|Anne hesitated; and Elizabeth replied, 'No, {{of course}} {{she could not be}} angry with Anne, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> my doing. <b>She</b> must be displeased enough with me, though.' ...|$|R
