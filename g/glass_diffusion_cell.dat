Cypermethrin did not penetrate in vitro through whole skin but did penetrate epidermal membranes.

Rat epidermal membranes in vitro were more than 20 times more permeable to cypermethrin than human epidermal membranes, indicating that cypermethrin would be less readily absorbed in humans than in the rat.

40|$|The {{absorption}} of undiluted phthalate diesters [dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethylphthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) ] has been measured in vitro through human and rat epidermal membranes. Epidermal membranes {{were set up}} in <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells</b> and their permeability to tritiated water measured to establish {{the integrity of the}} skin before the phthalate esters were applied to the epidermal surface. Absorption rates for each phthalate ester were determined and a second tritiated water permeability assessment made to quantify any irreversible alterations in barrier function due to contact with the esters. Rat skin was consistently more permeable to phthalate esters than the human skin. As the esters became more lipophilic and less hydrophilic, the rate of absorption was reduced. Contact with the esters caused little change in the barrier properties of human skin, but caused marked increases in the permeability to water of rat skin. Although differences were noted between species, the absolute rates of absorption measured indicate that the phthalate esters are slowly absorbed through both human and rat skin...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{validity}} of using drug amount-depth profiles in stratum corneum to predict uptake of clobetasol propionate into stratum corneum and its transport into deeper skin layers was investigated. Methods. In vitro diffusion experiments through human epidermis {{were carried out}} using Franz-type <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells.</b> A saturated solution of clobetasol propionate in 20 % (V/V) aqueous propylene glycol was topically applied for 48 h. Steady state flux was calculated from the cumulative amount of drug permeated vs. time profile. Epidermal partitioning was conducted by applying a saturated drug solution to {{both sides of the}} epidermis and allowing time to equilibrate. The tape stripping technique was used to define drug concentration-depth profiles in stratum corneum for both the diffusion and equilibrium experiments. Results. The concentration-depth profile of clobetasol propionate in stratum corneum for the diffusion experiment is biphasic. A logarithmic decline of the drug concentration over the first four to five tape strips flattens to a relatively constant low concentration level in deeper layers. The drug concentration-depth profile for the equilibrium studies displays a similar shape. Conclusions. The shape of the concentration-depth profile of clobetasol propionate is mainly because of the variable partitioning coefficient in different stratum corneum layers. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of an in vitro skin <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> system as a model for assessing decontaminants against the chemical warfare agent sulphur mustard (SM). The in vitro absorption rates of SM through heat-separated human (157 +/- 66 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)) and pig-ear (411 +/- 175 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)) epidermal membranes were in agreement with previous in vivo studies that quoted skin absorption rates of 150 and 366 mug cm(- 1) h(- 1), respectively. Decontaminants (fuller's earth, Ambergard and BDH spillage granules) were ranked in order of effectiveness by measuring the skin absorption rates and the percentage of applied dose of SM that penetrated human and pig-ear epidermal membranes. The effectiveness of fuller's earth measured in this in vitro study using human epidermal membranes was in agreement with a previous in vivo human volunteer study. Similarly, the effectiveness of fuller's earth and Ambergard measured in vitro with pig-ear epidermal membranes was in agreement with a previous in vivo study conducted on rats. However, there was complete disparity in the ranking of decontaminants between human and pig-ear epidermal membranes measured in vitro. Thus, although pig-ear skin may be a relatively good model for predicting the human skin absorption of SM, it is a poor model for testing decontamination systems. The results of this study further validate the use of Franz-type <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells</b> containing human epidermal membranes as a model for predicting in vivo human skin absorption.

40|$|Objectives : The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the feasibility of transdermal drug delivery of Labetalol Hydrochloride (LHCl) and to study the effect of different penetration enhancers on the skin permeability of LHCl. Methods : The permeability experiments were conducted using a horizontal <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> with a diffusional area of 2. 37 cm- 2 on albino rat skin. The effect of various penetration enhancers namely turpentine oil, dimethyl formamide (DMF), menthol, dimethyl sulfoxide, pine oil, and 2 -pyrollidone, and the effect of the concentration of drug and enhancer in the donor phase on the skin permeability of LHCl was studied. Results : The apparent partition coefficient of the drug was found to be 6. 95, suggesting it to be a lipophilic drug. The preliminary skin permeation studies revealed that the permeation of LHCL through albino rat skin was moderate (K p = 6. 490 &# 935; 10 - 2 cm hr - 1) from isotonic phosphate buffer of pH 7. 4. An appreciable increase in the LHCl permeability coefficient was observed on using a co-solvent (ethanol 95 &#x 0025;) with the penetration enhancers in the donor phase. DMSO (10 &#x 0025; v/v) was found to be the most effective enhancer for Labetalol hydrochloride (Enhancement Factor = 1. 165). An increase in the concentration of drug and enhancer in the donor cell accentuated the permeability coefficient of LHCl.

40|$|Rates of {{permeation}} of 75 [mu]m thick {{silicone rubber}} membranes by hydrocortisone and six homologous hydrocortisone 21 -alkyl esters, all {{applied to the}} membranes in aqueous media, were assessed in small <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells.</b> Solubilities of these agents in water and hexane were also determined. The permeability coefficient of hydrocortisone was 7. 4 x 10 - 5 cm/hr. Permeability coefficients for the esters ranged from 2. 3 x 10 - 3 cm/hr (acetate) to 6. 4 x 10 - 1 cm/hr (heptanoate). A direct correlation was found between permeability coefficients and lipophilicity {{but it appears that}} the heptanoate eater's mass transfer coefficient is substantially boundary layer controlled. Assessment of fluxes of the steroid solutes from their respective saturated aqueous solutions was made. The flux for hydrocortisone through silicone rubber was greater than the flux for the acetate ester. Thereafter, fluxes of the esters from saturated solutions systematically increased to the point where fluxes for the 21 -hexanoate and 21 -heptanoate esters were 20 times greater than found for hydrocortisone. This suggests that far more steroid can be delivered through a lipid membrane when the steroid is appropriately derivatized. The overall permeability pattern fits behavior expected of a barrier having a lipid membrane bounded by hydrodynamic layers. The pattern of permeability from saturated solutions was predictable using regular solution theory...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the relationship between solvent uptake into a model membrane (silicone) with the physical properties of the solvents (e. g., solubility parameter, melting point, molecular weight) and its potential predictability. We then assessed the subsequent topical penetration and retention kinetics of hydrocortisone from various solvents to define whether modifications to either solute diffusivity or partitioning were dominant in increasing permeability through solvent-modified membranes. Methods. Membrane sorption of solvents was determined from weight differences following immersion in individual solvents, corrected for differences in density. Permeability and retention kinetics of H- 3 -hydrocortisone, applied as saturated solutions in the various solvents, were determined over 48 h in horizontal Franz-type <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells.</b> Results. Solvent sorption into the membrane could be related to differences in solubility parameters, MW and hydrogen bonding (r(2) = 0. 76). The actual and predicted volume of solvent sorbed into the membrane was also found to be linearly related to Log hydrocortisone flux, with changes in both diffusivity and partitioning of hydrocortisone observed for the different solvent vehicles. Conclusions. A simple structure-based predictive model {{can be applied to the}} sorption of solvents into silicone membranes. Changes in solute diffusivity and partitioning appeared to contribute to the increased hydrocortisone flux observed with the various solvent vehicles.

40|$|Based on the {{hypothesis}} that limited receptor solubility of lipophilic compounds may result in lower observed permeability parameters, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the in vitro human epidermal permeability coefficients and membrane retention of a series of aliphatic alcohols (C 1 -C 10, log p - 0. 72 to 4. 06) using two different receptor solutions (water and 4 % bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline). Aqueous solutions of radiolabeled alcohols were dosed into the stratum corneum side of membranes mounted in side-by-side <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells.</b> Appearance of alcohol in the receptor compartment filled with either of the two solutions was monitored over a 7 h period when both stratum corneum (assessed by tape stripping) and the remaining epidermis levels of radioactivity were determined. In a separate study the degree of binding of alcohols to 4 % bovine serum albumin was determined. The data showed increased receptor phase solubility in the bovine serum albumin solution and higher permeability coefficients for the more lipophilic alcohols in the series. No changes were seen in the partitioning of the alcohols from the vehicle into either the stratum corneum or tape-stripped epidermis with the two receptor phases; however, a decrease in the amount of the more lipophilic alcohols partitioning into the water receptor phase from the tape-stripped epidermis was observed. We conclude that bovine serum albumin receptor phase allows better estimation of real permeability parameters for lipophilic compounds due to its increased solubility capacity and we question whether permeability parameters for lipophilic solutes from older data sets based on aqueous receptor phases are completely reliable...|$|R

Epidermal membranes were set up in <b>glass</b> <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells</b> and, following an initial determination of permeability to tritiated water, excess undiluted glycol ether {{was applied to the}} outer surface for 8 hr. The appearance of glycol ether in an aqueous "receptor" phase bathing the underside of the epidermis was quantified by a gas chromatographic technique. A final determination of tritiated water permeability was compared with initial values to establish any irreversible alterations in epidermal barrier function induced by contact with the glycol ethers. 2 -methoxyethanol (EM) was most readily absorbed (mean steady rate 2. 82 mg/cm 2 /hr), and a relatively high absorption rate (1. 17 mg/cm 2 /hr) was also apparent for 1 -methoxypropan- 2 -ol (PM). There was a trend of reducing absorption rate with increasing molecular weight or reducing volatility for monoethylene glycol ethers (EM, 2. 82 mg/cm 2 /hr; 2 -ethoxyethanol, EE, 0. 796 mg/cm 2 /hr; 2 -butoxyethanol, EB, 0. 198 mg/cm 2 /hr) and also within the diethylene glycol series: 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethanol (DM, 0. 206 mg/cm 2 /hr); 2 -(2 -ethoxyethoxy) ethanol (DE, 0. 125 mg/cm 2 /hr) and 2 -(2 -butoxyethoxy) ethanol (DB, 0. 035 mg/cm 2 /hr). The rate of absorption of 2 -ethoxyethyl acetate (EEAc) was {{similar to that of the}} parent alcohol, EE.

There was a dose-dependent increase in the rate of permeation of ketoprofen relative to the concentration of 1, 8 -cineole.

The oral administration of ketoprofen can cause gastric irritation and adverse renal effects. Transdermal delivery of the drug can bypass gastrointestinal disturbances and provide relatively consistent drug concentrations at the site of administration. The release of ketoprofen from proprietary gel products from three different countries was evaluated by comparing the in vitro release profiles. Twenty extemporaneously prepared ketoprofen gel formulations using Carbopol® polymers were manufactured. The effect of polymer, drug concentration, pH and solvent systems on the in vitro release of ketoprofen from these formulations were investigated. The gels were evaluated for drug content and pH. The release of the drug from all the formulations obeyed the Higuchi principle. Two static FDA approved <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells,</b> namely the modified Franz <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> and the European Pharmacopoeia <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell,</b> were compared by measuring the in vitro release rate of ketoprofen from all the gel formulations through a synthetic silicone membrane. High-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometric analytical techniques were both used for the analysis of ketoprofen. The validated methods were employed for the determination of ketoprofen in the sample solutions taken from the receptor fluid. Two of the three proprietary products registered under the same manufacturing license exhibited similar results whereas the third product differed significantly. Among the variables investigated, the vehicle pH and solvent composition were found have the most significant effect on the in vitro release of ketoprofen from Carbopol® polymers. The different grades of Carbopol® polymers showed statistically significantly different release kinetics with respect to lag time.

Slow release rates and linear release profiles were obtained using the side-by-side <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> method apparently due to limited model drug solubility in the donor chamber resulting in violation of sink conditions. Biphasic release profiles were obtained using the dialysis bag method apparently due to an initial rapid release of free and micellar solubilized model drug from the donor to the receiver chambers followed by slow release from the oil droplets. Using both release methods, an initial increase and latter decrease in release rates were observed with increase in surfactant concentration. The initial increase was considered to be due to a decrease in the model drug oil-in-water partition coefficients and the subsequent decrease in release rates was due to micellar shape change (spheres to rods) causing a decrease in diffusion rates. Sink conditions were violated using the side-by-side <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> method but were maintained in the dialysis bag method since emulsions were diluted infinitely in the donor phase...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Synthetic {{membranes}} used in Franz <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells</b> for {{topical formulation}} quality assessment should provide least resistance to drug diffusion. In this study, the diffusion rates of ibuprofen across thirteen membranes were determined using Franz <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells.</b> Correlation of the membrane thickness, pore size and MWCO with drug fluxes was also made. The drug diffusion {{results showed that}} the porous membranes were categorized into high-flux (8 – 18 mg/cm 2 /h) and low-flux (0. 1 – 3 mg/cm 2 /h) membranes. The drug fluxes did not show strong correlations (r 2 < 0. 99) with membrane parameters. Synthetic membranes can give variable drug fluxes, thus investigators should be careful in choosing membrane for formulation quality assessment...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The skin, by weight, is {{the largest}} organ of the body. Human skin serves to provide several {{important}} functions that may be classified. in a general context, as protective, maintaining homeostasis and sensing. The outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, has an essential role as a barrier against the transport of water and of chemical and biological agents. In this study acyclovir (ACV), an antiviral used for treating the varicella zoster virus, was used. It is sensible {{to say that a}} hydrophilic drug like acyclovir needs a delivery vehicle or penetration enhancer to permeate the skin with more ease. In an attempt to enhance the permeation of acyclovir, it was formulated in a delivery vehicle with the same formulation as for a micro-emulsion. Increasing percentages of the surfactant, Brij 97, were incorporated in the formulation to determine which of the four formulations is indeed a micro-emulsion. A gelating agent. carrageenan, was used to make the emulsion transdermally more applicable; the influence of this component on the transdermal delivery of acyclovir was also determined. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} determine: -The effect of a drug delivery vehicle on the transdermal delivery of acyclovir; -The specific formulation of a micro-emulsion and -The influence of a gelating agent on the transdermal delivery of acyclovir. Diffusion studies were performed in vertically mounted <b>glass</b> Franz <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells.</b> The epidermis of female abdominal skin, obtained after abdomeoplasty, was heat separated from the dermis. One millilitre of emulsion (0. 1 %: 1 mg/ml ACV) was added to the skin sample in the donor side of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell.</b> The control solution had an equivalent amount of active in water and was added to the donor compartment in a separate experiment. The receptor phase was PBS (phosphate buffered solution). The entire receptor phase of the cells was removed every second hour and was replaced with fresh receptor phase at 37 °C. The amount of acyclovir in the receptor phase was determined by HPLC analysis. The cumulative amounts of the active that permeated the skin over the 24 hour period were plotted with the slope of the graphs representing the flux in ng/cm²/h. The average flux values of the experimental cells and control cells were compared. Results of the diffusion studies without carrageenan showed that increasing the concentration of the surfactant increased the diffusion of acyclovir. Permeation studies with carrageenan had a totally different outcome. The enhancement ratio of the experimental cells was much lower than that of the control cells. However the experimental cells showed a small increase as the concentration of the surfactant increased. From VanKel dissolution studies it could be seen that release of acyclovir from the emulsion was not a problem and that the active was available for absorption. Confocal studies were done to determine whether there were any vesicles in the emulsions. Vesicles were expected in the 25 % Brij 97 emulsion because it was the same formulation as a micro-emulsion, but vesicles could only be found in the 4 % and 8 % Brij 97 emulsion. A previous study with acyclovir and three different delivery vehicles gave enhancement ratios between 0. 32 to 2. 92. Values obtained in this study of the 4 % and 8 % Brij 97 emulsion without carrageenan were more or less the same but the 15 % and 25 % Brij 97 emulsion had a much higher enhancement ratio. For the emulsions with carrageenan not one exceeded an enhancement ratio of 0. 57. More studies still have to be done on micro-emulsions to determine which specific concentration of surfactant forms a micro-emulsion. The active itself and its physicochemical properties also play an important role in the diffusion studies with the specific delivery vehicle and further research has to be done with different model drugs.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} the micro-organism contamination of excised porcine (pig) ear, {{and evaluate the}} use of Cyclopore track-etched membranes (CTEM) for preventing ingress into Franz-type <b>diffusion</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODS: Swabs were taken from four locations and used to inoculate Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) plates. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>cells</b> were assembled to include porcine skin with and without CTEM, and the receptor phase sampled periodically and spread onto plates. RESULTS: Five distinct colony types were isolated after incubation of all swabs on TSA plates at 37 degrees C; on SDA plates, one fungal colony was found at 30 degrees C and one at 37 degrees C. The SDA agar plate incubated at 30 degrees C resulted {{in the growth of}} a large diffused white fungal colony. No regional differences were observed. Without the CTEM, the receptor phase became contaminated within 6 h. With the CTEM present, microbial ingress was substantially retarded with visible presumptive fungal growth occurring at 24 h and detectable contamination on both microbiological media at 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the native porcine ears were considerably contaminated. The ingress of contamination into the <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> receptor phases can be largely, but not entirely, eliminated using CTEM. The addition of antimicrobial agents was necessary to eliminate micro-organisms that were observed at later time points. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This article, while highlighting the presence of a high number of micro-organisms on native porcine skin, presents a practical means {{to reduce the risk of}} microbial contamination in transdermal/transcutaneous permeation studies, particularly in the study of cell cultures grown within Franz <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> receptor compartments...|$|R
40|$|A <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> {{has been}} used to measure the {{effective}} diffusion coefficients of proteins. The method is applied to lysozyme and BSA at different pH and ionic strength. A parameter optimization technique is used to estimate the diffusion coefficients directly from experimental data. The importance and influence of pH and ionic strength on the diffusive properties in an agarose gel have been demonstrated. A comparison with other methods showed that there is good agreement. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>cell</b> is an accurate and easy-to-use method for the measurement of protein diffusion coefficients, in spite of the long time required for a protein diffusion experiment. For smaller proteins this time can be shortened considerably by the present parameter optimization technique. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
