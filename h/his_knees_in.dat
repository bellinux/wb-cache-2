25|$|On February 21, 2013 CMLL held a {{press conference}} to officially {{announce}} that the Homena a Dos Leyendas would pay tribute to Rayo de Jalisco ("The Lighting from Jalisco") and brought out Rayo's son, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., as part of the announcement. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. had not worked for CMLL since 2010 but made a special appearance due to the company honoring his father. During the press conference Rayo de Jalisco Jr.'s long time rival Universo 2000 interrupted Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and the two ended up challenging each other to a match that would take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, although the exact nature of the match was not announced at the time. The rivalry between the two wrestlers hailed back to at least 1997 where Universo 2000 defeated both Cien Caras and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. Universo 2000 defended the title three times during his reign: against Brazo de Plata, Máscara Sagrada, and Rayo de Jalisco Jr., before losing the championship to Rayo de Jalisco Jr. on September 13, 1998. Universo 2000 regained the title on December 10, 1999 Universo 2000's second reign became a recordbreaking reign in several areas, it was the longest to date as it lasted 1,225 days. He also became the champion with most successful title defenses in one reign including eight defenses against Rayo de Jalisco Jr. during their long running rivalry. After being masked since his debut in 1985 Universo 2000 lost a Lucha de Apuesta match to El Canek in the main event of the 71st Anniversary Show, on September 17, 2004, the match also included Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Dr. Wagner Jr. and originally came about due to the Universo 2000/Rayo de Jalisco Jr. rivalry. Following his unmasking Universo 2000 won the 2004 Leyenda de Azul (Blue legend tournament). In subsequent years both Universo 2000 and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. left CMLL. In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> a match against Universo 2000's brother Máscara Año 2000, where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring. The incident was used by several promoters as well as Rayo de Jalisco Jr. himself to create more interest in matches between himself and Universo 2000, Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. made his return to CMLL in May, 2010, siding with the CMLL loyalists in their feud with Los Invasores, especially Invasore members Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000, reiginting the long running storyline between them. But Rayo, Universo and Cien Caras only worked a select few dates for CMLL before leaving again. The official match between the long time rivals saw each team up with participants of the 2013 Torneo Parejas Increibles, only in this case they were on opposite sides instead of teaming up. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. would team up with Shocker and Rush while Universo 2000 would team up with Shocker's rival Mr. Niebla and Rush's rival El Terrible. Shocker and Mr. Niebla had a long backstory between then, having actually worked together as a regular tag team in the late 1990s. In 1998 the two defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Emilio Charles Jr. to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship and would subsequently defend the tag team championship against teams such as Blue Panther and Black Warrior, Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. and the Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras and Universo 2000). In October, 1998 Mr. Niebla suffered an injury during a match, an injury that was so severe that Mr. Niebla was forced to vacate the Tag Team title. Upon his return Mr. Niebla continued to team with Shocker but the team were not able to win the Tag Team title back. On September 24, 1999, at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, the team of Nr. Niebla and Shocker faced Atlantis and Villano III in a Relevos suicida match, a match where the losing team would fight each other for their mask. In the main event match of CMLL's 66th Anniversary show, Atlantis and Villano III defeated the much less experienced team, afterwards Mr. Niebla defeated Shocker to unmask him. In the years since Shocker's unmasking the two have wrestled each other on numerous occasions, both in CMLL and other promotions. The two teamed up for the Parejas Increibles tournament and made it to the semi-final but lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. when the tension between the two became a distraction in the match. The rivalry between Rush and El Terrible started when El Terrible defeated Rush in the finals of a tournament to determine a holder of the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on January 1, 2012. The two were also paired up for the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, and in {{the weeks leading up to}} the tournament Rush stated that he was willing to put his differences with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. After getting along and qualifying for the final match Rush and El Terrible's miscommunication and dissension allowed their opponents to win the match and the tournament. Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El Terrible to a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date. El Terrible did not accept the challenge at that point in time. The two faced off in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show in a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match that was won by Rush. The storyline continued to develop in the months following the anniversary event and included El Terrible successfully defending the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship against Rush on January 22, 2013. The two rivals were simply unable to get along from the beginning, causing them to be eliminated in the first round of the Parejas Increibles tournament by Dragón Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja.|$|E

500|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1825 and now in the National Gallery of Scotland. Inspired by the Elgin Marbles and intended by the artist to provide a moral lesson on [...] "the beauty of mercy", it shows a near-nude warrior whose sword has broken, forced to <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> front of another near-nude soldier who prepares to inflict a killing blow. A woman, also near-nude, clutches the victorious warrior to beg him for mercy. Very unusually for a history painting of the period, The Combat does not depict a scene from history, literature or religion and {{is not based on}} an existing artwork, but is instead a scene from the artist's own imagination.|$|E
500|$|Muldoon had {{an injury}} called patellar {{tendinitis}} in both <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> <b>In</b> December 2004, he underwent surgery {{on one of}} his knees. The operation was successful and he resumed training on April 2005. Muldoon started the 2006 Ulster Championship campaign very brightly scoring 1-03 (6) {{in the first round of}} the Ulster Championship against defending All-Ireland Champions Tyrone and 0-04 against Donegal. However Muldoon, with a previously exemplary disciplinary record at all levels, was red-carded late in that game. Some commentators called for Muldoon's red card to be rescinded after television replays showed he was reacting to [...] "extreme provocation" [...] from Donegal full back Paddy Campbell, who had punched Muldoon in the groin. Muldoon however received a four-week suspension and missed Derry's next two games against Kildare and Longford. Longford produced a shock victory to knock Derry out of the 2006 Championship. He finished the 2006 campaign with 1-07 (10) from two matches.|$|E

Guillot described the first moment which started the show as [...] "classic" [...] when [...] "the three biggest stars {{in the history of the}} business were in the same ring"; Hulk Hogan [...] "the biggest name", Stone Cold Steve Austin [...] "the biggest star" [...] and the Rock, [...] "the most successful". Next, Guillot wrote that [...] "the second indelible moment nearly stopped the show", describing the end of the Undertaker's Streak as [...] "the biggest surprise ending in WrestleMania history—and maybe even wrestling history". Finally, the third moment which closed the show was [...] "Bryan holding and hoisting in unison the two championships that represent the WWE World Heavyweight Championship while on <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> the ring", which Guillot predicted [...] "will go down among the greatest moments in WrestleMania history".|$|E

2500|$|In 1813 Wordsworth {{obtained}} {{the position of}} distributor of stamps. This government position was already sufficient to induce Shelley to write a sonnet of mild reprimand, [...] In 1842 he accepted a civil list pension of £300 from the government, and in 1843 when Southey died, he accepted the position of Poet Laureate. Browning saw this acquiescence to orthodox tradition—with its image of Wordsworth literally on <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> front of the queen—as his [...] "final surrender to the forces of conservatism". The poem arose from the resulting hatred and indignation, and was published in November 1845, in Dramatic Romances and Lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|Four days later, on 13March, a Jordanian soldier {{patrolling the}} borders between Jordan and Israel {{in the north}} near the Island of Peace, shot seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounded six others. The King, who was on an {{official}} visit to Spain, returned home immediately. He personally travelled to the Israeli town of Beit Shemesh to offer his condolences {{to the families of}} the Israeli children killed. He went on <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> front of the families. His gesture was received very warmly in Israel, and Hussein sent the families $1million in total as compensation for the loss of life. The soldier was determined to be mentally unstable by a Jordanian military tribunal and was sentenced to 20years in prison, which he served entirely. Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and the West Bank surfaced. Hussein's wife then, Queen Nour, later claimed her husband was having trouble sleeping: [...] "Everything he had worked for all his life, every relationship he had painstakingly built on trust and respect, every dream of peace and prosperity he had had for Jordan's children, was turning into a nightmare. I really did not know how much more Hussein could take." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Rico Carty of the Braves led {{the league}} in average, while Cepeda and Aaron drove in more than a hundred runs. However, the team's {{pitching}} was ineffective and the team finished in fourth place in the division. Cepeda finished with an average of [...]305, 34 home runs and 111 RBIs. In 1971, Cepeda began the season with a solid offensive, hitting 10 home runs before May was over. However, he re-injured one of <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> his house. The Braves' physician administered a shot, but that proved ineffective. Cepeda was attended to by Dr. Funk, the Atlanta Falcons' orthopedicist. After running tests and examining X-rays, he determined that the injury was serious. Because of this, Cepeda began playing part-time. His batting average declined, and he hit only five more home runs on the season. In September he traveled to New York where he underwent surgery, returning to Puerto Rico to recover during the winter. In 1972, Cepeda began playing while still feeling pain. On May 16, 1972, he hit two home runs against Houston. During this time Paul Richards had been replaced by Eddie Robinson as the team general manager. Robinson didn't assign treatment for Cepeda's leg, eventually deciding to trade him.|$|E
