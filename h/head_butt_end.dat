60|$|It was {{a dreadful}} sight, and Miss Harmer gave a loud cry {{when she saw}} it.

As she fired, there was a volley of deep oaths and fierce exclamations; {{the one who was}} holding Angela Harmer, with a jerk sent the chair in which she was sitting backwards, bringing her head with fearful force against the floor. There was a rush to the door; one of the robbers struck Cecilia Harmer a violent blow on the <b>head</b> with the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> of a heavy pistol which he held in his hand, stretching her insensible on the ground; and then the three men rushed downstairs, and through the hall window, by which they had entered; across the grounds--but more slowly now, for one was lagging behind--and out into the road.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks in {{developing}} a technical process to manufacture castings is to organize risering at the stage of solidification, which ensures the set level on shrinkable porosity and shrinkage cavities. As known, generally, the risering zone consists of a feeder zone and a feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone. In references the terms of final (end) effect action or an effective area of the casting edge is possible to encounter rather than the term of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone. The values of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone are used to calculate a directional solidification in the casting mould. The design procedure of a directional solidification of castings is follows. The first design section is advised to settle down at the distance equal to the zone of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end.</b> The subsequent design sections are advisable to settle down at distances a little bit less, than the zone of feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end.</b> The padding (lap) value ought to be selected to provide the later solidification of the upper sections of casting {{with respect to the}} sections lying below. A series of special experiments on castings of the simple configuration (slabs and bars) defines a value of the feeding zone of a <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> and makes it out as the regressional dependences of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone on the characteristic sizes of this or that casting. Thus, considerable material and time expenditures are demanded to define the value of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone to be used further, including calculation of directional solidification of castings. The paper offers a design procedure to calculate a zone of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> via computing simulation of solidification in a casting mould thereby sharply reducing expenditures for searching the desirable values. To reveal spaces in the casting, staggered with shrinkable porosity, the new criteria of porosity developed in BMSTU are used. The paper shows a possibility to use the effective size as a characteristic parameter of casting for dependence of the feeding <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> zone thus providing this dependence universality and a possibility to use it for making any shaped casting, but not just the castings of a simple configuration. </p...|$|R
60|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} the blacksmith, their ablest man and virtual leader, was knocked down senseless with a blow on his <b>head</b> with the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> of a gun. Immediately on seeing this the two famous shearers took to their heels and the young labourer followed their example. The brothers were left but refused to be taken, although Harbutt roared at them in his bull's voice that he would shoot them unless they surrendered. They made light of his threats and fought against the four, and eventually were separated. By and by the younger of the two was driven into a brambly thicket where his opponents imagined {{that it would be}} impossible for him to escape. But he was a youth of indomitable spirit, strong and agile as a wild cat; and returning blow for blow he succeeded in tearing himself from them, then after a running fight through the darkest part of the wood for a distance of two or three hundred yards they at length lost him or gave him up and went back to assist Harbutt and Moses against the other man. Left to himself {{he got out of the}} wood and made his way back to the village. It was long past midnight when he turned up at his father's cottage, a pitiable object covered with mud and blood, hatless, his clothes torn to shreds, his face and whole body covered with bruises and bleeding wounds.|$|R

The glass jars, which Mikie had to <b>head</b> <b>butt</b> three times to retrieve the heart inside, were replaced with bundles of three hearts, providing the same effect without requiring the player character to <b>head</b> <b>butt</b> glass. In the first level, the writing on the blackboard reads [...] "Failure Teaches Success", instead of [...] "E=MC2". Mikie's shout has no effect on his classroom teacher.

40|$|In {{adult males}} of the South African weakly {{electric}} bulldog fish, Marcusenius pongolensis, {{the duration of}} the electric organ discharge (EOD) increases with body size over lifetime. Although there is experimental support for intrasexual selection (male-male competition) having shaped the males' EOD pulse duration in evolution, nothing is known about intersexual selection, such as female choice. Playback of 25 natural male EODs of pulse duration varying from 320 μs (close to the average female value) to 716 μs, to eight female experimental subjects elicited approach, <b>head</b> <b>butts</b> and circling behaviour. The rate of <b>head</b> <b>butts</b> on the dipole electrode model increased significantly with stimulus pulse duration in seven out of eight experimental subjects. In ten experimental female subjects we contrasted the shortest playback pulse with simultaneous playback of one of four longer ones (424, 524, 628 and 716 μs). Pooled responses for all experimental subjects were stronger for the dipole playing back the longer pulse in a pulse pair. The difference in the number of <b>head</b> <b>butts</b> (Δhead butts) that were dealt the two dipoles per 60 s test session increased significantly with the difference in pulse duration (Δpulse duration). The increase followed a significant linear trend (P< 0. 0001). Similar results were obtained for Δassociation time, Δcircles with <b>head</b> <b>butts,</b> and Δcircles without <b>head</b> <b>butts.</b> These results suggest that a male's reproductive success is enhanced by longer, i. e. more attractive EODs, and that both intra- and intersexual selection must have {{played a significant role in}} shaping the EOD of male M. pongolensis...|$|R

40|$|The {{methods of}} the {{electrical}} parameter identification of the <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> bus connections of graphitization furnace current feeders with side bus packets basing on the conjugate three-dimensional mathematical models of electromagnetic and electro-thermal processes are presented. The finite element methods of solving partial derivatives vector equations systems in three-dimensional domain are used. The temperature dependences of the electro-physical properties and thermo-physical properties of the active materials and the external bus surface conditions of natural convection and radiation heat transfer are taken into account. The high accuracy and computational efficiency numerical calculations by using variations of the finite elements densities in the computational domain are produced. The finite elements densities in the domains of the magnetic field concentration are increased. The basic and new designs of <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> bus systems of AC graphitization furnace are considered. The calculations of geometric parameters of the bus conductors by using the equality criterion of active loss densities are presented. The currents, voltage drops, current density, electrical losses densities, active and inductive resistance of bus of side bus packages, <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> bus connections and graphite feeders are identified. The energy efficiency of <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> graphitization furnace electrical connections of different numbers of parallel buses is analyzed. The technical decisions to reduce weight, active and reactive power losses of bus <b>butt</b> <b>end</b> connections are substantiated...|$|R
