5|$|Intent {{on making}} more money, Forbes in November 1922 began selling {{valuable}} hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot in Maryland. The government had stockpiled huge quantities of hospital supplies {{during the first}} World War, which Forbes unloaded <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> their cost to the Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly {{at a time when}} the Veterans' Bureau was buying supplies for the hospitals at a much higher price.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> a second in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
5|$|Radio-Electronics had {{a smaller}} {{circulation}} than Popular Electronics but {{led the way}} with innovative construction projects between 1972 and 1975. John Simonton's first modular electronic music synthesizer was featured {{on the cover of}} the May 1973 issue. It sold <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> commercial synthesizers and his PAiA Electronics produced them for decades. Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter in September 1973 and Jon Titus's Mark-8 computer in July 1974 were the catalyst of the home computer revolution.|$|E

5|$|In May 2001, Bouchard's {{successor}} Bernard Landry, who had {{until then}} {{lived in a}} three-room apartment, {{announced that he would}} accept the SITQ offer of the Édifice Price apartment, and took up occupancy in November. The choice, although praised for its symbolic location, attracted criticism that the apartment, rather small and poorly lit, could not accommodate a family (Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time). Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor's residence, located at 1010 Chemin Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> its estimated value, would have made an excellent choice. From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building's second and third floors. This was moved out in 2002; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier's installation to be a complete coincidence.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

25|$|Kramer's {{new company}} {{was able to}} take {{advantage}} of unused production facilities by renting time, allowing him to create independent films <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the cost the larger studios had required, and he did so without studio control. Kramer also saw this as an opportunity to produce films dealing with subjects the studios previously avoided, especially those about controversial topics.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} firearm actions, the break-action design {{does not require}} the barrels to be {{specially}} fitted to an individual action.

25|$|The Dubois Brothers had the Mcsweens, an Irish-Canadian gang, {{join their}} {{associates}} in 1957 {{after one of}} the Brothers met Pierre McSween in reform school while serving a two-year term for theft. McSween reported in his testimony that him and his brothers specialized in truck hijackings, selling the booty to the Dubois gang <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the value and committing theft or robbery and the Dubois Brothers in turn provided them with supplies such as weapons, getaway cars and other hired hands.|$|E
25|$|Lightning {{scattering}} {{has sometimes}} been observed on VHF and UHF over distances of about 500km. The hot lightning channel scatters radio-waves <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> a second. The RF noise burst from the lightning makes the initial part of the open channel unusable and the ionization disappears quickly because of recombination at low altitude and high atmospheric pressure.

25|$|Except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the {{extra-heavy}} oil or bitumen {{which can}} be extracted by conventional oil well technology, oil sands must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated in-situ techniques. These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.|$|E

25|$|The network's {{defenders}} {{note that}} the CBC's mandate differs from private media's, particularly in its focus on Canadian content; {{that much of the}} public funding actually goes to the radio networks; and that the CBC is responsible for the full cost of most of its prime-time programming, while private networks can fill up most of their prime-time schedules with American series acquired <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> their production cost. CBC supporters also point out that additional, long-term funding is required to provide better Canadian dramas and improved local programming to attract and sustain a strong viewership.|$|E
25|$|This {{percolation}} {{of architectural}} style was {{not confined to}} private houses, but to civic architecture too: an illustrious architect added to civic pride; and when an architect was too expensive for the civic coffers, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the price he would judge a competition between local architects, {{for the privilege of}} designing a town hall or church. This is exactly what happened in Aylesbury. John Vanbrugh judged two sets of plans for the County Hall (now Aylesbury Crown Court). Thus for ever Vanbrugh's name was remembered in association with the building, the local architect almost forgotten, and civic pride maintained.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, he was {{selected}} to oversee the privatization of the Sibneft oil company. Sibneft was the youngest oil holding company in Russia at the time having been created hastily in early 1995 out of Rosneft. An unknown entity, Oil Finance Corporation (NFK), that had been created out of Menatep, a holding company started by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, won the auction. Berezovsky {{had an interest in}} the Menatep Group and for this reason, there was some speculation that the auction had been fixed. It later emerged that the company had been sold <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> the market value.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{finished}} transcriptions is a concern. Many outsourced transcriptionists simply {{do not have the}} requisite basic education to do the job with reasonable accuracy, as well as additional, occupation-specific training in medical transcription. Many foreign MTs who can speak English are not familiar with American expressions and/or the slang doctors often use, and can be unfamiliar with American names and places. An MT editor, certainly, is then responsible for all work transcribed from these countries and under these conditions. These outsourced transcriptionists often work <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> what transcriptionists are paid in the United States, even with the US MTs daily accepting lower and lower rates. However, some firms choose to employ American transcriptionists as they believe the quality of work is better.|$|E
25|$|Since German {{universities}} do {{not offer}} accommodation or meals, {{students are expected to}} organize and pay for board and lodging themselves. Inexpensive places in dormitories are available from Studentenwerk, a statutory non-profit organization for student affairs. However, there are only enough places <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> students. Studentenwerk also runs canteens and cafés on campus, which are similarly affordable. Other common housing options include renting a private room or apartment as well as living together with one or more roommates to form a Wohngemeinschaft (often abbreviated WG). Furthermore, many university students continue to live with their parents. One third to one half of the students works to make a little extra money, often resulting in a longer stay at university.|$|E
