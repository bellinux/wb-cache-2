40|$|In this work, we {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of inhomo-geneous, magnetically focused high-intensity beams of charged particles.

Jets <b>expell</b> particles from the beam core and ultimately generate a halo of parti-cles with concomitant emittance growth. Emittance growth directly indicates when the beam relaxes to its final station-ary state, {{and the purpose of}} the present paper is to describe halo and emittance in terms of test particles moving under the action of the inhomogeneous beam.

There is a nonsteady effect of rapid increase of the rate of bubble growth simultaneous with the growth of the product of gas solubility and solution supersaturation.

The second is that someone <b>expells</b> us from here, which believe me, is hard to achieve. Deporting 50,000 people looks like a big risk,". Commenting on EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule's urging of Belgrade to improve its relation with Pristina in order to begin EU accession talk, Jovic said that Fule [...] "means absolutely nothing compared with Resolution 1244. This resolution is stronger than Stefan Fule, and it is more powerful than the German Chancellor Merkel and other statesmen."

40|$|Ce-based heavy-fermion (HF) metals {{behave as}} Kondo-lattice systems {{and can be}} {{classified}} {{with the aid of}} a single coupling parameter, W, where J < 0 is the local exchange integral and W the conduction-band width.

In a narrow composition range, these two phases are nearly degenerate and <b>expell</b> each other upon varying either the temperature or the external magnetic field. The one-parameter-scaling approach appears inapplicable to the U-based HF metals. For the exemplary material UPd 2 Al 3, antiferromagnetic ordering between seemingly local 5 f moments coexists, on a microscopic scale, with HF superconductivity. Whether this coexistence can be explained by assuming 5 f states localized on a tetravalent U-ion with non-magnetic crystal-field ground state remains to be shown.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of Standard Model matter propagating in a slice of AdS 5 {{in the presence of}} infrared-brane kinetic terms. Brane kinetic terms are naturally generated through radiative corrections and can also be present at tree level. The effect of the brane kinetic terms is to <b>expell</b> the heavy KK modes from the infrared-brane, and hence to reduce their coupling to the localized Higgs field. In a previous work we showed that sizable gauge kinetic terms can allow KK mode masses as low as a few TeV, compatible with present precision measurements.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Effects of lactobacilli in enteric coated {{capsules}} {{were studied}} in piglets (Chapter I). Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus isolated from a commercial product were formulated in capsules, enteric coated, and then given to both Escherichia coli-challenged and unchallenged baby pigs. Decreased incidence {{and severity of}} diarrhea, and decreased weight deceleration showed that the enteric coated lactobacilli had more beneficial effects than nonenteric coated bacteria. A methodology for microencapsulating live lactobacilli with aqueous enteric polymers has been developed successfully (Chapter II). Short processing times and incorporation of talc in the coating chamber {{were found to be}} critical to maintain viability. Talc smoothed the coating, made application of coating solution easier, and stabilized previously adsorbed microorganisms. Dissolution tests and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the homogeneity of the aqueous enteric polymer film. The enteric coated microencapsulated dosage form may not only provide more uniform action, but also protect lactobacilli from oxygen and increase their shelf-life. Optimization of the growth of bifidobacteria, a genus closely related to lactobacilli, in modified milk was studied (Chapter III). A buffer system and a chemical reaction were provided simultaneously to neutralize acids produced and <b>expell</b> oxygen from the medium.

40|$|Sea ice {{ecosystems}} {{are characterized by}} microalgae living in brine inclusions. The growth rate of ice algae depends on light and nutrient supply. Here, the interactions between nutrients and brine dynamics {{under the influence of}} algae are investigated using a one-dimensional model. The model includes snow and ice thermodynamics with brine physics and an idealized sea ice biological component, characterized by one nutrient, namely, dissolved silica (DSi). In the model, DSi follows brine motion and is consumed by ice algae. Depending on physical ice characteristics, the brine flow is either advective, diffusive, or turbulent. The vertical profiles of ice salinity and DSi concentration are solutions of advection-diffusion equations. The model is configured to simulate the typical thermodynamic regimes of first-year Antarctic pack ice. The simulated vertical profiles of salinity and DSi qualitatively reproduce observations. Analysis of results highlights the role of convection in the lowermost 5 – 10 cm of ice. Convection mixes saline, nutrient-poor brine with comparatively fresh, nutrient-rich seawater. This implies a rejection of salt to the ocean and a flux of DSi to the ice. In the presence of growing algae, the simulated ocean-to-ice DSi flux increases by 0 – 115 % compared to an abiotic situation. In turn, primary production and brine convection act in synergy to form a nutrient pump. The other important processes are the flooding of the surface by seawater and the percolation of meltwater. The former refills nutrients near the ice surface in spring. The latter, if present, tends to <b>expell</b> nutrients from the ice in summe...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} apparatus of {{control at the}} disposal of employers and the state in South Africa, working class activity has not been eliminated nor organization erased. African migrant workers, such as those employed in the Durban docks, have held a leading position within the African working class for decades, absorbing the lessons of past struggles and putting forward demands which have led strike movements. These struggles demonstrate the uncompromising hostility of African workers to their class and national oppres- sion. With the growth of capital in South Africa an increase in class exploitation has been accompanied by intensified national oppression; the rule over African workers being enforced through vagrant, master and servant, and pass laws wh ich reproduce a cheap migrant labour force. Dock workers, {{for more than a century}} migrant workers, have shown a capacity for resistance in the city equal or higher than the level of class action by 'settled' urban workers. Their resilience is explained by their concentra- tion and commanding position in the labour process of the docks. During strikes the workers have laid claim to work and residence in towns in opposition to the employer and state strategy of <b>expell</b> ing strikers from th e urban centres. Decasualization has been introduced as a 'repressive reform' to reassert the control of the employers over an increasingly active workforce. Ironically, it has b en accompanied by increasing priority to the development of contract labour in the docks and has also not eliminated the high turnover of workers nor the insecurity of employment. The consciousness of the dock workers has been shaped by the harsh discipline of capitalist production, national oppression, and the daily experience of international communications. These factors, combined with a long tradition of resistance, have encouraged the formation of a class con- scious section of the African proletariat. ...|$|E
40|$|All {{junior high}} school {{students}} at Nishizaki, Tateyama City, a half agricultural and half fishing community, had been examined for Hookworm infestation for three years consecutively. Detection of eggs in the stool was done by a suspension method using saturated salt solution to which magnesium sulfate had been added. The student positive for eggs were given an anthelmintic drug, and the stools from the members of their families were also examined to determine infestation of Hookworm. Epidemiological aspects of Hookworm infestation were also studied. 1. Detection of the eggs and expelling of the worms had been carried out twice every year for three years. The rate of infestation among school children, which was 20. 3 per cent {{in the first year}} of the program, fell to 3. 3 per cent at the end of it. 2. The ratio of the number of children infested with Necator americanus to that of children infested with Ancylostoma duodenale was nearly 1 : 1. Children infested with the two varieties accounted for 56. 0 per cent of all the children who produced positive reactions to tests for hookworm eggs. 3. Fresh infection and reinfection of hookworms during a year occurred only in 1. 4 and 2. 0 per cents, respectively, of all the children, though no preventive steps were taken by people concerned. 4. The rate of infestation among members of the families of children who produced positive reactions to tests for hookworm eggs was 58. 7 per cent, which is very high as compared with 5. 0 per cent, a rate of infestation among members of the families of children who produced negative reactions. This suggests that, in working out a plan for protecting school children from hookworm infestation, members of their families should also be included in the program. 5. When tetrachlorethylene was given to children who produced positive results to tests for hook worm eggs, 65. 0 per cent of them became negative, while the conversion from positive to negative status occurred in 66. 6 per cent when 1 -bromo-naphthol-(2) was administered.

40|$|My {{fieldwork}} {{was conducted}} in the spanish enclave of Melilla in North Africa, where I spent eight and half months between July 2000 and August 2001. The {{focus is on the}} relation and discrepancy between an official discourse emphasizing social harmony between four different religious groups (Christians, Muslims, Jews and Hindues), what I call "the discourse of convivencia", and the social relationships as experienced by Melillas muslims. Taking a different approach to discourse than Michel Focaults focus on its exteriority, interpreting discourse to match Roland Barthes concept of "myth", I primarily relate discourse to the motives of the producers, the catholic middle class. The message of convivencia ("coexistence", "cohabitation" in harmony) is first of all presented to people living outside Melilla: It is used instrumentally to attract tourists, to get funds from the EU, to attract investors, and clean up Melillas bad reputation in Spain and abroad. The great majority of both my Catholic and Muslim informants are negative to the content of the discourse, experiencing it does not reflect how relations really are. Many factors work against the content being accepted. First of all Melilla went through a social upheaval in 1985, what I call a "social schism". This year muslims stood up for civil rights {{in the face of a}} new law of immigration threatening to <b>expell</b> most of them to Morocco, at the same time as most catholics demonstrated in favour of the law. This layer of "social memory" is still active, influencing relationships between the groups negatively on both sides. Apart from that I also show how muslims today are discriminated institutionally and are cognitively excluded by catholics. The celebration of Melilla as a "Spanish" city in public events, the conception of "Muslim" as defined in opposition to "Spanish", and the essentializing content of the official discourse parting groups strictly according to religion, all work together to exclude muslims and present them as "the Others". The last part of my work relate to how the exclusion experienced by Muslims gives birth to different kinds of resistance against the catholics, albeit the resistance is far from monolittic, like it was in 1985. The Muslims are fragmented into different groups with conflicting interests, concerned about different forms of discrimination, and are applying different discourses of resistance.
