40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the thermal and electrical consumptions of residential buildings {{located in the}} town of Turin (northwest Italy). The aim is to create mathematical models to evaluate monthly behavior of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> as a function of two predictable variables. In the evaluation of the different variables, two climatic data were chosen: the monthly average temperature and the monthly average daily solar irradiation. Two multiple linear regression models have been determined, one using standardized variables to evaluate how climatic data influence thermal and <b>electric</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> in residential buildings. The fields of application of these models can be: the evaluation of monthly energy-use data knowing the annual value with the construction of seasonal trends, the prediction of monthly energy-use data knowing the weather forecast, the management of the buildings' <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> to optimize the heating or electric networks for more future expansion in urban contests. After an initial state of the art review, the case study of Torino is presented, with more than 2700 users for the electric consumptions and 130 residential condominiums. A selection of the users was made to consider an homogeneous set of users and finally the models were developed with about 1200 electric users and 100 condominiums. The results show good correlations between <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> and climatic data, especially with the air temperature. For electrical consumption the monthly variation is limited compared with thermal energy-use, for both the seasonal patterns obtained have a deviation of less than 5 % between calculated and real consumptions...|$|R

40|$|The limited {{driving range}} is {{considered}} as a significant barrier {{to the spread of}} electric vehicles. One effective method to reduce “range anxiety” is to offer accurate information to the driver on the remaining driving range. However, the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> during driving is largely determined by driving behaviour, road topography information and traffic situation, which are hard to predict. This paper will discuss an accurate <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> model validated using driving tests on different public roads, and then the model is used to predict future <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> based on road information. The <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> model includes five parts: the road load model, the powertrain loss model, the regenerative braking model, the auxiliary system model and the battery model. The parameters of these models are obtained through driving tests on public road and dynamometer tests in the TU/e Automotive Engineering Science lab. The results show that the model can calculate the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> with a maximum error of 5 % based on driving speed under different circumstances. To predict the future <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> the road information is obtained from OpenStreetMap and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. An offline algorithm is built to predict the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> for a future trip based on the road information. The algorithm gives two <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> results: one is for the fastest driving speed; the other one is for the most economic driving speed. The results show that the measured <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> results for different types of road driving are all within the algorithm’s prediction scope. Therefore, the offline algorithm can give an accurate <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> estimation to the driver before a trip begins...|$|R
