40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. Little {{research}} {{has yet been}} undertaken in South Africa about commercial banks that are servicing the microenterprise market. The objective for the current research {{was to investigate the}} <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> that should be considered by commercial banks in South Africa servicing the microenterprise market. The focus for the study was on identifying the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> and on investigating how the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> were being considered. There are a number of case studies documenting the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> that international commercial banks have considered. However, in South Africa, there are relatively few documented cases, which rightfully confirms that commercial banks providing microfinance to microentrepreneurs are still in a new line of business that is in its early developmental stages. The first part of the current study aimed to identify the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> that required consideration, which have been well documented in a number of research reports. The focus was also laid on international commercial banks that offered microfinance services, especially to microenterprises. The intention was to obtain an overview of how international banks have considered the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> concerned. The second part of the research study aimed to see how South African commercial banks have considered the above-mentioned <b>key</b> <b>factors,</b> using Absa and Capitec banks as case studies. The <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> identified are the following: the operating model; the delivery model; institutional commitment; product development; funding; technical assistance; human resource (recruitment, retention and remuneration); and operations (credit methodology; loan appraisals; lending methodology; collections; branch network; and support services). The international commercial banks whose case studies are reviewed include: Banco do Nordeste; Bank Rakyat Indonesia; the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe; the Cooperative Bank of Kenya; Banque du Caire; the Agricultural Bank of Mongolia; Hatton National Bank; the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India; and Banco de la Empressa. From the case studies it was seen that some of the commercial banks considered certain factors more than others. The other differentiating factor is how the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> were considered, because the operating context of the different commercial banks differs. In South Africa, Absa and Capitec Bank have also considered the <b>key</b> <b>factors,</b> however, the operating model and the delivery model are the biggest differentiator as to how the other factors are considered...|$|R
40|$|The <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> of the damping solvent {{extraction}} method (DSEM) {{for the analysis}} of the unbounded medium are the size of bounded domain, the artificial damping ratio, and the finite element mesh density. To control the simulation accuracy and computational efficiency of the soil-structure interaction, this study establishes a value optimization model of <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> that is composed of the design variables, the objective function, and the constraint function system. Then the optimum solutions of <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained by the optimization model. According to some comparisons of the results provided by the different initial conditions, the value optimization model of <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> is feasible to govern the simulation accuracy and computational efficiency and to analyze the practical unbounded medium-structure interaction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reliability of}} traffic noise measurement techniques and the noise estimates in Hong Kong. A simulation model making use of the Monte Carlo technique is devised to incorporate the uncertainty in traffic noise estimates in Hong Kong. Traffic flow, traffic speed and traffic composition (in terms of percentage of heavy vehicles) are identified as the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> influencing the generation of traffic noise. The new equations for estimating the noise descriptors L 10, Leq, L 50 and L 90 were calibrated {{on the basis of}} the Hong Kong survey results. The effects of the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> on traffic noise estimates can be assessed. The probability distribution for each of the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> is derived with the use of the survey data. The variation on the <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> is due to the sampling error in the survey. The reliability of the traffic noise estimates is obtained from the combined probability distributions of the <b>key</b> <b>factors.</b> The reliability analysis gives the traffic noise estimates with a particular probability or vice versa.

40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) are {{the backbone of}} any national economy and key drivers for economic growth. To sustain their competitiveness, {{it is essential that}} SMEs take advantage of their capabilities and support market requirements. This research encourages an increased focus on work with manufacturing strategies in SMEs. The purpose of this research is to increase our understanding of manufacturing strategy formulation in SMEs. To provide SMEs with useful advice on how to work with manufacturing strategies, this research focuses on internal and external <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> that are considered to be significant for manufacturing strategy formulation in SMEs. Manufacturing strategy formulation was investigated in three case studies in Sweden and two supplementary case studies in Singapore. The results in this research are presented in six papers and are encapsulated and extended in the summarising chapters of the compilation thesis. Internal <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> for manufacturing strategy formulation are mainly identified from the literature about larger companies and are categorised in the following ways: procedure (what should be done), alignment (consistency between strategies, manufacturing strategies and manufacturing decisions), management (how the formulation is managed) and realisation (how the formulations are executed). The internal <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> seem to be of general value for all kinds of companies, but how the internal <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> are reflected in each individual company’s manufacturing strategy formulations may vary due to the characteristics that SMEs exhibit. The internal <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> are synthesised into a model that provides practical guidance for manufacturing strategy formulation and aims at facilitating learning in SMEs through a structured way of working. External <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> are addressed in two of the appended papers and the influence of these factors is further analysed in the summarising chapters. The external <b>key</b> <b>factors</b> identified were macro environment, industry, supplier, competitive environment and national culture. Two of these external <b>key</b> <b>factors,</b> competitive environment and national culture, were found to be more influential for manufacturing strategy formulation in SMEs...|$|R
5|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} is a <b>key</b> <b>factor</b> in sustaining the ecosystem. The {{thin layer of}} gases that envelops the Earth is {{held in place by}} gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The ozone layer {{plays an important role in}} depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface.
