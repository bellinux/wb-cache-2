2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic. But {{it is not}} as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem like a person is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed. [...] Also, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it. [...] False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is impossible," [...] {{replied the}} Tin Woodman. [...] "For the giant with the hammer would kill you all <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> pass him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{said the}} {{politicians}} would be against you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> become a State senator. Do {{you believe that}} the politicians are owned by the railroad?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> wield {{the long}} sword quickly, you will mistake the way. To wield the long sword well, you must wield it calmly. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> wield it quickly, like a folding fan or a short sword, you will err by using [...] "short sword chopping". You cannot cut down {{a man with}} a long sword using this method.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'll scrap <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{challenge}} me!" [...] (to Beltiana) [...] "That's because I was there! Yeah, me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow," [...] said Bickley. [...] "But {{learn that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> harm us {{we will bring}} another wave which will drown all your country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You dog!' said Mr Carker, {{leaning back}} in his chair, and smiling at him serenely. 'That's nothing to what I'd do to you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> deceive me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They gave me {{this for}} you!" [...] {{continued}} the tremulous voice close to her ear. [...] "I think it would do you good, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> take it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Both men laughed, skeptically. [...] "We'll just {{save you}} the trouble," [...] {{said one of}} them. [...] "We'll take you over. You might lose your way <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> go alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Dick Rover, {{and my two}} {{brothers}} are with me. We are well armed, and we'll shoot <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break that door down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't clinch such nails as these," [...] said Phonny. [...] "They are cut nails, {{and they}} will break off <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> clinch them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} would, and perhaps <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{be more like}} others you will find friends as they do, and so be happy, Sylvia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Henry B. Boltwood, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do that---- I'm not sure. Your {{being my}} parent might save you, but even so, I think he'd {{probably}} chase {{you off the}} road, clear down into that chasm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Basil!" [...] cried my wife, [...] "that {{is cruel}} of you! You knew I was keeping {{away from that}} point, and it seems as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make it as afflicting as you could--the whole affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess you'd {{be happier}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do something," [...] {{asserted}} Trot. [...] "If you can't {{do anything for}} yourself, you can do things for others, and then you'd get lots of friends and stop being lonesome." ...|$|E
5000|$|You cannot exist {{more than}} twice {{in the same time}} frame. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> go back a second time, the machine will simply fail to operate.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't matter, anyhow," [...] {{the other}} rejoined. [...] "I'm {{not going back}} to camp, and there's {{something}} coming <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I'll prob'ly spoil {{you for a}} king, an' mebbe for {{anything}} else. Anyhow, you'll get badly damaged <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> interfere with us, an' that's a fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In a way, he was wise," [...] replied Nasmyth. He {{understood}} the man's reluctance. [...] "Now don't {{you think it}} would be better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> drive the thing out of your mind? It can't be altered--there's a danger in dwelling too much upon one's grief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn't look far enough, Tom, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sail in {{the balloon}} you'd {{probably}} {{drop into the}} ocean and be drowned. No, we'll have to do our searching from the steam yacht. But I have several maps and drawings which I think, will aid us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{to enter}} into {{negotiations}} for the surrender of the mine. It is a good notion. You would mature your plan. Of course, I don't ask what it is. I don't want to know. I would refuse to listen to you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> tell me. I am not fit for confidences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot," [...] she answered. [...] "The {{years can}} carry {{no more than}} their {{ordinary}} burden of sensations. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fill them too full, you lose everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{climb up}} I'll shoot you," [...] said Benson, {{and ran back}} swiftly to where the second rascal was just getting out of his {{unconscious}} state.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{not exactly}} a hold-up," [...] said the detective with a faint smile. [...] "Get down and I will explain. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> resist, you'll only get into trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|As Ludlow {{walked with}} Cornelia toward {{the point where}} she was to take her car down town, he began, [...] "You see, she is so dramatic, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do her in any other way--that is, simply--you would be doing her artificially. You have to take her as she is, don't you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've made up {{our minds}} {{to hold you}} with us a few days 'cause you're sich jolly company. If you obey orders an' {{keep your mouth shut}} there's a chance of gettin' outer this scrape mighty easy; but I'd slit your throat in a jiffy <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> give us the slip or made any noise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stuff!" [...] said Mr. Havelot. [...] "People {{can live}} in a {{temperature}} of thirty-two degrees above zero all winter. Out in Minnesota they think that's hot. And you gave him victuals and drink through your diploma case! Well, miss, I told you that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> roast chestnuts in that diploma case the bottom would come out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, Cis," [...] {{interposed}} {{one of the}} boys--"we shall {{lose all}} our play time <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make him {{do it with a}} grace. Curtsies are women's work--go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, I {{point out}} {{that you will be}} compromising <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep both your {{conscience}} and your love. You will be seeking to have, it both ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing 'll happen <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep quite {{calm and}} do exactly as I tell you. Go to the kitchen, and wait there until I call <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> the {{soldiers}} {{come in and}} question <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> frighten <b>you,</b> remember that {{we have nothing to}} fear from men, and that our lives are in God's keeping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The doctor states Douglas {{must not}} be moved," [...] the officer {{presently}} remarked. [...] "In the morning, I must start for the railroad and you will go with me. I'll try to make things as easy as I can, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get away, you would run some risk. The Royal North-West have powers the Government does not give municipal police." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By warning Mynheer Ben Isaje {{against any}} attempt at escape on your part, against any attempt at {{betrayal}} on mine. Mynheer Ben Isaje is prepared: he hath a guard of ten picked {{men on the}} watch, and two more men outside his door. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> leave this house with me without his consent he would prevent you, and I am no match alas! for twelve men." ...|$|E
6000|$|And as much {{softer than}} {{the noise of}} mowing-machine hum, as the {{machines}} which make it are more delicate and more curious. Madam How is a very skilful workwoman, and has eyes which see deeper and clearer than all microscopes; as you would find, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> see what makes that [...] "Midsummer hum" [...] of which the haymakers are so fond, because it promises fair weather.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll have till to-morrow night," [...] said Teddy, firmly, [...] "but no longer. I don't think there's {{any need}} to tell you what'll be done <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bother Carrots or me again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might as}} well stop," [...] {{continued}} Dave, undaunted by the threat. [...] "You can't get away from us. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> jump off the unfinished end of the bridge you'll break your neck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man can't {{distinguish}} as to {{the terms}} of a dismissal. They're always insolent,--more insolent than ever <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make them kindly. I should merely make this as short and sharp as possible." ...|$|R
