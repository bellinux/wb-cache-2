5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E

Oral prednisone (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (<b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> or ferrous gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss.

Alternative forms of iron (fumarate, gluconate, chelates) are less irritating and probably better absorbed. Calcium carbonate preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. Chewable calcium supplements that include vitamin K are sometimes recommended by doctors as {{a good way to}} get calcium.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals in the clinker arises {{both from the}} natural raw materials and {{from the use of}} recycled by-products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 < pH < 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. Nickel, zinc and lead are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations. Chromium may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground. As chromate (CrO42−) is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration, it is sometimes reduced into trivalent Cr(III) by addition of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> (FeSO4).|$|E

50|$|The FOX reagent is used {{to measure}} levels of {{hydrogen}} peroxide in biological systems. The reagent is incubated with the sample and absorbance is then measured at 560 nm. It is an aqueous solution of <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>sulfate,</b> sorbitol, sulfuric acid and xylenol orange.|$|R
25|$|Bags {{of cement}} {{routinely}} have {{health and safety}} warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate (CrO42−) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less toxic chemical species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from alunite, it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|E

500|$|Producing fast {{black in}} the Middle Ages was a {{complicated}} process involving multiple dyeings with woad or indigo followed by mordanting, but {{at the dawn of}} Early Modern period, a new and superior method of dyeing black dye reached Europe via Spanish conquests in the New World.

Although logwood was poorly received at first, producing a blue inferior to that of woad and indigo, it was discovered to produce a fast black in combination with a <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> (copperas) mordant. [...] Despite changing fashions in color, logwood was the most widely used dye by the 19th century, providing the sober blacks of formal and mourning clothes.|$|E
500|$|Compounds {{containing}} {{one or more}} elements {{which can}} exist {{in a variety of}} charge/oxidation states will have a stoichiometry that depends on which oxidation states are present, to ensure overall neutrality. This can be indicated in the name by specifying either the oxidation state of the elements present, or the charge on the ions. Because of the risk of ambiguity in allocating oxidation states, IUPAC prefers direct indication of the ionic charge numbers. These are written as an arabic integer followed by the sign (..., 2−, 1−, 1+, 2+,...) in parentheses directly after the name of the cation (without a space separating them). For example, FeSO4 is named iron(2+) sulfate (with the 2+ charge on the Fe2+ ions balancing the 2− charge on the sulfate ion), whereas Fe2(SO4)3 is named iron(3+) sulfate (because the two iron ions in each formula unit each have a charge of 3+, to balance the 2− on each of the three sulfate ions). Stock nomenclature, still in common use, writes the oxidation number in Roman numerals (..., −II, −I, 0, I, II,...). So the examples given above would be named iron(II) sulfate and iron(III) sulfate respectively. For simple ions the ionic charge and the oxidation number are identical, but for polyatomic ions they often differ. For example, the uranyl(2+) ion, , has uranium in an oxidation state of +6, so would be called a dioxouranium(VI) ion in Stock nomenclature. An even older naming system for metal cations, also still widely used, appended the suffixes -ous and -ic to the Latin root of the name, to give special names for the low and high oxidation states. For example, this scheme uses [...] "ferrous" [...] and [...] "ferric", for iron(II) and iron(III) respectively, so the examples given above were classically named <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulfate</b> and ferric sulfate.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Fricke Xylenol Gel (FXG) dosimetric {{system is}} based on the {{radiation}} induced oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions. In this kind of gels it can occur that ferrous and ferric ions diffuse in the gel matrix. To preserve the spatial distribution of the dose from diffusion, Fricke gels must be undergoing measurement within a few hours of their irradiation. Thus, the spatial integrity of the dose distribution in the Fricke gel is maintained. The oxidation of ferrous ions also causes a reduction of the longitudinal nuclear magnetic relaxation time which can be measured by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrumentation. In this work we performed NMR relaxometry and MR imaging investigations of Fricke Xylenol Gel characterized by gelatinous matrix of Agarose for possible applications in clinical photon beams used for radiation therapy. Materials and Methods: NMR relaxometry measurements were performed using an mq-ProFiler single-side relaxometer (Bruker Biospin). MRI imaging was realized on a 1. 5 T Achieva scanner (Philips) with an eight channel head coil. The gels were irradiated in the clinical dose range (0 – 20 Gy) with a Siemens Primus Low linear accelerator. Results: The main dosimetric features of the NMR signal were investigated. The linearity of the response with dose was observed. In order to assess the photon sensitivity we analyzed the dependence of NMR relaxation time on radiation dose with varying <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>sulfate</b> content inside FXG. The <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>sulfate</b> content which maximizes sensitivity is 1. 75 mM. Furthermore, signal stability was followed for several days after irradiation. Aldo for MRI analysis the dose calibration curves were obtained also with MRI scanner. Moreover, a depth dose profile was reconstructed. Conclusions: We can conclude that FXG dosimeters with optimal <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>sulfate</b> content can be regarded as a valuable dosimetric tool to achieve fast information on spatial dose distribution...|$|R

30|$|Orthorhombic WO 3 {{structures}} are the usual product from the direct hydrothermal synthesis. However, when reacted with <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>sulfate,</b> {{it was observed}} that one of its lattice parameters ‘b’ is reducing from 12.513 to 7.324 Å. The remaining lattice parameters ‘a’ and ‘c’ are almost unchanged in such a case. So, {{it is clear that the}} formation of hexagonal crystal structure from the orthorhombic structure is taking place by reducing ‘b’ lattice significantly. The interlayer spacing for the direct synthesized WO 3 and <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>sulfate</b> used WO 3 products, respectively, at d 220 (3.143 Å) and d 200 (3.156 Å) are almost the same, which proves that the lattice parameters ‘a’ and ‘c’ are similar to each other. When reacted with cobalt chloride, a reduction in the ‘b’ value close to ‘a’ value was noted and that could be the reason for the change in crystal structure from orthorhombic to hexagonal. Though the exact reason behind the one-dimensional nanorod growth is not clear, we believe that chlorine ions also play a similar role as that of sulfate ions and help to grow a one-dimensional nanostructure.|$|R
