The ratio of the natural frequencies of the two vibration modes f x 0 /f z 0, the gate opening ratio s/d, and the submergence of the <b>gate</b> <b>plate</b> were varied. Depending on the ranges of reduced velocities and frequency ratios, a complex interaction of two di!erent kinds of instability-induced excitation was detected.

To evaluate possible mechanisms for crack formation, this research applies a 3 -D finite-element model of the thermal and mechanical stress in a sliding-gate plate during preheating and casting induced by thermal expansion and/or mechanical movement. The thermal model is first validated with previous temperature histories measured during preheating and casting in a ladle plate.

40|$|Hayley Uden 1, Saravana Kumar 21 Podiatry Department, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; 2 Post Doctoral Senior Research Fellow, International Centre for Allied Health Evidence, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, AustraliaBackground: An intoed {{gait pattern}} {{is one of}} the most common {{referrals}} for children to an orthopedic consultation. Parental concern as to the aesthetics of the child&rsquo;s gait pattern and/or its symptomatic nature will primarily drive these referrals during a child&rsquo;s early developmental years. Whilst some of these referrals prove to be the result of a normal growth variant, some children will present with a symptomatic intoed gait pattern. Various treatments, both conservative and surgical, have been proposed including: braces, wedges, stretches and exercises, shoe modifications, and surgical procedures. However, which treatments are effective and justified in the management of this condition is not clear within the literature. The aim of this systematic review was to therefore identify and critique the best available evidence for the non-surgical management of an intoed gait pattern in a pediatric population. Method: A systematic review was conducted of which only experimental studies investigating a management option for an intoeing gait pattern were included. Studies needed to be written in English, pertaining to a human pediatric population, and published within a peer reviewed journal. Electronic databases were searched: Ovid (Medline), EMBASE, AMED, PubMed, SportDiscus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. The National Health and Medical Research Council&rsquo;s designation of levels of hierarchy and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme cohort studies critical appraisal tool were used. Results: Five level IV studies were found. The studies were of varied quality and with mixed results. Gait plates, physiologic/standardized shoes, and orthotic devices (with <b>gate</b> <b>plate</b> extension) were shown to produce a statistically significant improvement to an intoed gait pattern. Shoe wedges, torqheels, and a leather counter splint were not able to reduce an intoed gait pattern. Conclusion: There is limited evidence to inform the non-surgical management of a pediatric intoed gait pattern. The body of evidence that does exist is small (n = 5) and of varied quality, which means recommendations arising from this evidence base should be interpreted with caution. There is generally weak evidence that suggests that gait plates and orthotic devices with a gait plate extension may assist in the management of a pediatric intoed gait pattern.
