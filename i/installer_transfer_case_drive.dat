5000|$|More commonly, Command-Trac is used {{to refer}} to the NP/NV-231 or NP-207 <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> {{introduced}} along with the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) in 1984. The system offers a chain-driven, aluminum, [...] "shift-on-the-fly" [...] <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> The [...] "shift-on-the-fly" [...] feature provides manual ease and assist while engaging 4WD. Command-Trac should only be driven in 4WD on low-traction surfaces due to the front and rear axles being locked together (no differential action in the <b>transfer</b> <b>case).</b> <b>Driving</b> in 4WD on dry pavement causes excessive wheel and drivetrain wear. Four-wheel modes are most commonly used for wet/slick surfaces or extreme weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.) (4H), towing (N), and off-road activities (4L).|$|R
50|$|Quite {{similar to}} offerings from other manufacturers, drive passes from the gearbox to a center viscous limited slip differential, into a <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{splitting}} <b>drive</b> to a co-located front differential, and tail shaft {{connected to the}} vehicle's rear differential.|$|R
5000|$|UAZ {{began its}} growth {{away from being}} a mere {{assembler}} in 1954, {{with the creation of}} its own design office. It was this office, responding to a request from the Red Army, that in 1955 created a forward control van project, codenamed [...] "Forty", on the GAZ-69 chassis. This became the UAZ-450, the first Soviet [...] "cabover" [...] truck. The prototype appeared in 1956, and was tested in both the Caucasus Mountains and the Crimea. Its loaded weight was 2.7 tonnes, and it, like all the 450 series vehicles, was powered by a [...] low-compression [...] inline-four (based on the ubiquitous Pobedas, but with an 88 mm bore, rather than 82 mm), and the Pobedas three-speed transmission, while the <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> <b>drive</b> axles, leaf springs, and drum brakes came from the GAZ 69.|$|R
50|$|The Allison 3070 SP seven-speed {{transmission}} {{fitted to}} A1P2 and A1R FMTVs has also evolved with the FMTV, its A1 designation being MD 3070 PT, its A0 designation being MD-D7. This has an integral single-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> All-wheel <b>drive</b> is full-time, with a 30/70 per cent front/rear torque split for on-road driving, and a 50/50 per cent split for off-road driving.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{driveline}} {{layout of}} the Eclipse is a transverse-mounted 4-cylinder Mitsubishi 4G37 or 4G63 engine situated on the left-hand {{side of the car}} driving an automatic or manual transmission on the right-hand side. AWD models have a different transmission which includes a limited-slip center differential and output shaft for a <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> which <b>drives</b> the rear differential (also available as limited-slip) and half-shafts.|$|R
5000|$|The B12 chassis {{would be}} the last chassis to offer a station wagon model, which was marketed as the [...] "California" [...] in some Asian markets. Even more rare are the four-wheel drive {{versions}} of the station wagon, offered as an option in 1987, 1988 and 1989 model years. These models featured an electrically activated single-range <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to <b>drive</b> the independently suspended rear wheels, making the car a selectable four-wheel-drive (not all-wheel-drive) vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Export trim {{levels were}} often engine-specific, {{depending}} on the market: GL models were offered with either 1.6-litre or 1.8-litre engines, GLS models (GLX in some markets) had 2.0-litre engines (badged 2000 GLS) and Diesel versions had a 1.8-litre Sirius turbodiesel engine. The diesel model {{did not have a}} trim level, it was simply the 1800 TD. Vehicles in Japan installed with the four speed transmission were equipped with what Mitsubishi called Super Shift, essentially <b>installing</b> a <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> without adding another driveshaft to the rear wheels. Super Shift was no longer offered with the introduction of the five-speed manual transmission.|$|R
50|$|In April 1963, the National Defense Council {{decided to}} develop a {{prototype}} of an armoured personnel carrier equipped with Romanian automotive components. These auto parts were successively installed in the hull of a Soviet BTR-60P (also known as the GAZ-49) at different factories of the local automotive industry. The experimental prototype, designated T.A.B.-63, was equipped with two local-made SR-213 engines, two gearboxes, two <b>transfer</b> <b>cases,</b> two <b>drive</b> shafts, two power take-offs, brakes, hydraulic pumps, parts of the electric system, parts of the centralized tire air pressure control system {{and a number of}} support elements of the armoured hull.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the UK's Wheeled Tanker variants, all MTVRs are powered by a Caterpillar C-12, Advanced Diesel Engine Management (ADEM) III 11.9-litre six-cylinder diesel engine that develops 425 hp at 1,800 rpm and 2,101 Nm of torque at 1,200 rpm. When the central tire inflation system (CTIS) is set at 0 to 1,814 kg (2 tons) payload, engine power output is automatically reduced by around 20%. Driveline is completed by an Allison HD 4070P seven-speed automatic transmission, TC-541 torque converter and an Oshkosh 30000 Series single-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> All-wheel <b>drive</b> is permanent and under highway driving conditions the torque split is 32% front, 68% rear.|$|R
50|$|The Staghound was an {{innovative}} design that incorporated some advanced features. It had two rear-facing 6-cylinder engines with automatic transmissions (with 4 forward and 1 reverse gears) feeding through a <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to <b>drive</b> both axles. Either two- or four-wheel drive could be selected. Either engine could {{be shut down}} while in motion and {{taken out of the}} drive train. Additionally, a power steering pump was incorporated that could be switched on or off manually from the driver's instrument panel depending on steering conditions. Steering and suspension components were directly attached to the hull as the structure was rigid enough to dispense with the need for a separate chassis.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} manual locking hubs and a two-speed dual range New Process 205 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> with four <b>drive</b> modes: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, while Four High yielded a locked 50:50 torque split. Four Low applied reduction gearing. The {{front and rear}} propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral allowed for flat towing, or use of the power take off (PTO).|$|R
50|$|In 1988, the 22R-E {{engine was}} joined by an {{optional}} 3.0 L V6 engine, the 3VZ-E. This engine was significantly larger and more powerful although not as reliable as the original 4-cylinder offering. Trucks sold with the V6 engine were equipped with the same heavy duty rear differential {{that was used in}} the turbocharged trucks, as well as a completely new transmission and transfer case; the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> was chain <b>driven,</b> although considered less rugged, created less cab noise than the old gear-driven unit used behind the four-cylinder engine.|$|R
5000|$|The DUKW {{was built}} around the GMC AFKWX, a cab-over-engine (COE) version of the GMC CCKW six-wheel-drive {{military}} truck, {{with the addition of}} a watertight hull and a propeller. It was powered by a 269.5 cuin L GMC Model 270 straight-six engine. A five-speed overdrive transmission drove a <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> for the propeller, then a two-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to <b>drive</b> the axles. The propeller and front axle were selectable from their <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> A power take-off on the transmission drove the air-compressor and winch. It weighed 13,000 lb empty and operated at 50 mph on road and 5.5 kn on water. It was 31 ft long, 8 ft wide, 7 ft high with the folding-canvas top down and 8 ft high with the top up. It was not an armored vehicle, being plated with sheet steel between 1/16 and 1/8 inches (1.6-3.2 mm) thick to minimize weight. A high-capacity bilge pump system kept it afloat if the thin hull was breached by holes up to 2 in in diameter. One in four DUKWs mounted a [...]50-caliber Browning heavy machine gun on a ring mount.|$|R
2500|$|Prompted by a {{perceived}} {{need for a}} simple, inexpensive all-terrain vehicle for oil exploration in North Africa, the French motor manufacturer Citroën developed the 2CV Sahara in 1958. Unlike other 4×4 vehicles which use a conventional <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to <b>drive</b> {{the front and rear}} axle, the Sahara had two engines, each independently driving a separate axle, with the rear engine facing backwards. The two throttles, clutches and gear change mechanisms could be linked, so the two [...] engines could run together, or they could be split and the car driven solely by either engine. Combined with twin fuel tanks and twin batteries (which could be set up to run either or both engines), the redundancy of two separate drive trains meant that they could make it back to civilization even after major mechanical failures. Only around 700 of these cars were built, and only 27 are known to exist today.|$|R
50|$|Situated {{on top of}} {{the rear}} {{differential}} is a high pressure, low volume electric pump. This pump pressurizes Normal ATF (0-288 psi) into the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to engage the clutch pack. This fluid only engages the clutch pack and does not mix with the NS-ATF lubricating the tranfercase. The higher the fluid pressure the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is supplied with from the pump, the more the clutch pack engages, enabling the torque to the front wheels to be varied. Exiting the <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> the front <b>drive</b> shaft runs along {{the right side of the}} transmission, into a differential located on the right of the engines sump. This is a cast aluminum unit, with the sump and front differential made as a single unit that cannot be separated. The front right axle is shorter than the left, because the differential is closer to the right wheel. The front left axle runs through the engine's sump to the left wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The HEMTT A3 is {{the first}} production-ready {{tactical}} defense vehicle to feature a diesel-electric drive system. The ProPulse system fitted uses a modular series-hybrid arrangement to simplify the transmission of power to the wheels. The diesel engine powers an electric generator, which provides direct power to the wheels, eliminating the torque converter, automatic transmission, <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> and <b>drive</b> shafts. A dedicated motor controlled from its own power converters drives each axle independently. ProPulse technology, it is claimed, can increase fuel economy by up to 40% over conventional power trains. The diesel engine is optimized to run at the most efficient speed based on power demand, and transient loads to the engine are eliminated using stored energy. This eliminates the inefficiency associated with changing rpm levels during acceleration and deceleration, and also reduces emissions. In stopping operations, the electric motors operate as generators, and energy is stored {{for use in the}} next acceleration. Other stated advantages of the system include the system acting as an on-board generator, providing enough electricity (up to 200 kW of AC power) to power a small airfield, hospital, or military command center. Since the system uses no batteries, they never need to be replaced, and the amount of fuel needed to supply ProPulse-equipped trucks will be less.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} types of internal power-transfer mechanism found in most <b>transfer</b> <b>cases.</b> Gear-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> use sets of gears to drive either the front or both the front and rear driveshafts. These are generally strong, heavy units that are used in large trucks, but there are currently several gear <b>drive</b> <b>cases</b> in production for passenger cars.|$|R
5000|$|The Explorer saw {{significant}} exterior, interior, and suspension updates for the 1995 model year, {{losing all}} its exterior bodywork {{shared with the}} Ford Ranger. However the interior was shared with the Ranger and the Rangers chassis was retained. The 4.0 L Cologne V-6 from the previous generation carries over. The [...] "Twin Traction Beam" [...] (TTB) front suspension was replaced with a more carlike independent front suspension. The Ford Explorer lineup now consisted of two models, the 3-door Explorer Sport and the 5-door Explorer. The Limited was once again {{the top of the}} line model. The selectable automatic ControlTrac four wheel drive system debuted with a two-speed dual range <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> featuring three <b>drive</b> modes: auto, 4WD high, and 4WD low. The 1995 Ford Explorer was the first production vehicle to use a neon center high-mount stop lamp. It was also the first vehicle in its segment to have dual front airbags. Like the Explorer 5-door, the Explorer Sport was significantly redesigned for 1995. The Eddie Bauer trim level was replaced with Expedition on 3-door Explorers for the 1995 model year, but the Expedition trim was removed from the lineup for the 1996 model year, as the name was being reused for the new 1997 Ford Expedition.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the drive}} train was still {{developed}} from the same source, the available engines were identical: The same 2.4 L four-cylinder (22R-E) and 3.0 L V6 (3VZ) engines were available in rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive layouts. The new 4Runner used the independent front suspension that had been developed on the previous generation. The older style gear <b>driven</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> was phased out on the V6 models and they now had a chain <b>driven</b> <b>case.</b> The older gear <b>driven</b> <b>case</b> was retained on the 4-cylinder models.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1998, Mitsubishi {{issued a}} recall (bulletin 98V069001) for all 1990-1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing, [...] "Lockup of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> can occur due to {{insufficient}} lubrication. The condition {{can cause a}} loss of vehicle control increasing {{the risk of a}} crash." [...] The dealers would inspect the vehicles for adequacy of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil volume, <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil leakage, and operational degradation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> mechanism. The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> itself did not leak but rather the brass plug {{in the center of the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> yoke would leak. Mitsubishi estimated 24,275 vehicles were affected.|$|R
50|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> was a New Venture 271 {{and had a}} 2.72:1 {{low range}} gear ratio. A <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> skid plate was and is {{standard}} equipment. A manual shift-on-the-fly <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is the only available, the electronic shift on-the-fly has never been an option. As of the 2012 model year, the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> has changed to a Borg-Warner 44-47 manual shift-on-the fly. Low range is now 2.64:1.|$|R
5000|$|The 2G Eclipse {{received}} numerous Technical Service Bulletins (TSB) affecting {{a variety}} of issues with the car however there was one notable powertrain recall. In March 1998, Mitsubishi issued a recall (bulletin 98V069001) for all 1990-1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing, [...] "Lockup of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> can occur due to insufficient lubrication. The condition can cause a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk of a crash." [...] The dealers would inspect the vehicles for adequacy of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil volume, <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> oil leakage, and operational degradation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> mechanism.

Mitsubishi estimated 24,275 vehicles were affected.|$|R
50|$|A {{divorced}} {{or independent}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is completely {{separate from the}} transmission. It is located further down the driveline than a married <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and connected to the transmission output shaft by a short driveshaft. Independent <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are used on very long wheelbase vehicles, such as commercial trucks or military trucks.|$|R
50|$|The Quadra-Trac name {{is used on}} {{a variety}} of {{full-time}} 4WD systems. The first version used the Borg-Warner BW1339 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and was produced from 1973 to 1979. The next version used the New Process NP219 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> and was produced from 1980 to 1982. From 1993 to 1995 the New Process NP249 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> carried the name. And from 1996 to 1998 the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> was manufactured by New Venture Gear with some minor improvements and it was renamed the NV249.|$|R
5000|$|... lowered gearing {{in either}} {{or all of}} the transmission, <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> (including often {{employing}} a second <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to reduce gearing even more), or axle differentials ...|$|R
50|$|Selec-Trac II uses a console mounted {{switch to}} control the MP3022 <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> The switch {{controls}} the 4WD mode with options of 2WD - 4WD Auto - N - 4WD Low. The MP3022 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> uses an electronically controlled clutch pack to bias torque from 100% rear to 50/50% front/rear. The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> has no center differential, so power can only be supplied to the front axle when the rear wheels begin to slip. In this way, the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> works almost identically to the NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> used in the Quadra-Trac II system in 1999 to 2004 WJ Jeep Grand Cherokees. In 4WD Low mode, the clutch pack is locked and power flows through a 2.72:1 planetary gear set for higher torque at lower speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{wheel drive}} Explorers receive a new {{electronic}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> selection knob {{on the dash}} no longer has a [...] "2WD" [...] option, being replaced with [...] "Auto".|$|R
50|$|New Process <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are {{chain-driven}} and use {{a circular}} 6 bolt, 23-spline input on the case. The output for the front drive shaft {{is on the left}} side. The New Process <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> used by AMC attach the same as the Dana 300 except that New Process cases have the front output on the left side. Interchange ('flip') is possible, but there is an indexing lug in the pattern, in an attempt to allow the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> to attach in only one position. Thus, some modification on the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> or the adapter is required.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 Jeep {{replaced}} the New Venture Gear NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> with the NV245 <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> This <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{actually has a}} center differential, allowing both {{the front and rear}} axles to have power supplied to them without driveline binding, even on dry pavement. The torque distribution under normal driving conditions (no tire slippage) is 48% front and 52% rear. There is also an electronically controlled variable lockup clutch pack that can apply progressive 0 to 100% locking across the center differential. This is the improvement over the Selec-Trac NV242 <b>transfer</b> <b>case,</b> as that system has only fully unlocked and fully locked settings and requires manual shifting between them. And finally, the NV245 has the 'N' and '4WD Low' modes which act {{in the same manner as}} in the NV247 <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> above.|$|R
50|$|Chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> use a {{chain to}} drive most often only one axle, but can drive both axles. Chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are quieter and lighter than gear-driven ones. They {{are used in}} {{vehicles}} such as compact trucks, full size trucks, Jeeps and SUVs. Some off-road driving enthusiasts modify their vehicles to use gear-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>cases,</b> accepting the additional weight and noise to gain the extra strength they generally provide.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>cases</b> {{are also}} {{classified}} as either [...] "divorced"/independent or [...] "married". Married <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> are bolted {{directly to the}} transmission, usually between the transmission's output shaft and the rear or main driveshaft. Sometimes a married <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> {{is an integral part}} of the transmission and the two components share the same housing or [...] "case", as is commonly found on recent Subaru products and some other all-wheel-drive cars.|$|R
50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the front {{differential}}, rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the <b>transfer</b> <b>case.</b> The transmission, front differential, center differential and <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The front differential distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|R
50|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> is an {{auxiliary}} transmission {{that connects the}} front and rear axles. It also commonly provides a selectable secondary gear reduction. AMC and Jeep vehicles have used several different <b>transfer</b> <b>cases</b> in their various models.|$|R
50|$|Since the 2007 model redesign, the Navigator {{no longer}} {{uses the same}} <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> as the Expedition. Expedition four-wheel drives {{continue}} to use a two-speed dual range <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> with off-road low range reduction gearing and default off-road program that remaps (reprograms) the electronic throttle control and traction control system response for off-road conditions. Navigator four-wheel drives have been demoted to a light-duty one-speed single range <b>transfer</b> <b>case</b> which lacks low range gearing.|$|R
