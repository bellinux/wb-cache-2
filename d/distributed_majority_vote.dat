Bowen {{showed that}} if voters have equal tax shares and if {{marginal}} rates of substitution are symmetrically <b>distributed,</b> then <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> leads to efficient provision of public goods. These conditions {{are not likely}} to apply in a community with asymmetric income distribution. This paper defines a new idea for public goods allocation, a "pseudo-Lindahl equilibrium" which combines <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> with tax rates that depend on income and other observable characteristices {{in such a way that}} the majority rule outcome is Pareto optimal for an interesting class of societies. The informational requirements for implementing pseudo-Lindahl are much less stringent than those required for an ordinary Lindahl equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Directors have {{traditionally}} been elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that in uncontested elections, a candidate who receives even a single vote is elected. Proponents of "shareholder democracy" have advocated a shift to a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rule in which a candidate must receive a <b>majority</b> of the <b>votes</b> cast to be elected. Over the past decade, they have been successful, and the shift to <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> {{has been one of}} the most popular and successful governance reforms. Yet critics are skeptical as to whether <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> improves board accountability. Tellingly, directors of companies with <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rarely fail to receive majority approval - even more rarely than directors of companies with plurality voting. Even when such directors fail to receive majority approval, they are unlikely to be forced to leave the board. This poses a puzzle: why do firms switch to <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> and what effect does the switch have, if any, on director behavior? We empirically examine the adoption and impact of a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rule using a sample of uncontested director elections from 2007 to 2013. We test and find partial support for four hypotheses that could explain why directors of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> firms so rarely fail to receive majority support: selection; deterrence/accountability; electioneering by firms; and restraint by shareholders. Our results further suggest that the reasons for and effects of adopting <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> may differ between early and later adopters. We find that early adopters of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> were more shareholder-responsive than other firms even before they adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting.</b> These firms seem to have adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> voluntarily, and the adoption of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> has made little difference in their responsiveness to shareholders responsiveness going forward. By contrast, for late adopters, we find no evidence that they were more shareholder-responsive than other firms before they adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting,</b> but strong evidence that they became more responsive after adopting <b>majority</b> <b>voting.</b> Differences between early and late adopters can have important implications for understanding the spread of corporate governance reforms and evaluating their effects on firms. Reform advocates, rather than targeting the firms that, by their measures, are most in need of reform, instead seem to have targeted the firms that are already most responsive. They may then have used the widespread adoption of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> to create pressure on the nonadopting firms. Empirical studies of the effects of governance changes thus need to be sensitive to the possibility that early adopters and late adopters of reforms differ from each other and that the reforms may have different effects on these two groups of firms...|$|R

40|$|The <b>distributed</b> {{minority}} and <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> based redundancy (DMMR) scheme was recently proposed as an efficient {{alternative to the}} conventional N-modular redundancy (NMR) scheme for the physical design of mission/safety-critical circuits and systems. The DMMR scheme enables significant improvements in fault tolerance and design metrics compared to the NMR scheme albeit {{at the expense of}} a slight decrease in the system reliability. In this context, this paper studies the system reliability, fault tolerance and design metrics tradeoffs in the DMMR scheme compared to the NMR scheme when the majority logic group of the DMMR scheme is increased in size relative to the minority logic group. Some example DMMR and NMR systems were realized using a 32 / 28 nm CMOS process and compared. The results show that 5 -of-M DMMR systems have a similar or better fault tolerance whilst requiring similar or fewer function modules than their counterpart NMR systems and simultaneously achieve optimizations in design metrics. Nevertheless, 3 -of-M DMMR systems have the upper hand with respect to fault tolerance and design metrics optimizations than the comparable NMR and 5 -of-M DMMR systems. With regard to system reliability, NMR systems are closely followed by 5 -of-M DMMR systems which are closely followed by 3 -of-M DMMR systems. The verdict is 3 -of-M DMMR systems are preferable to implement higher levels of redundancy from a combined system reliability, fault tolerance and design metrics perspective to realize mission/safety-critical circuits and systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Boosting is {{recognized}} as one of the most successful techniques for generating classifier ensembles. Typically, the classifier outputs are combined by the weighted <b>majority</b> <b>vote.</b> The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the advantages of some fuzzy combination methods for ensembles of classifiers designed by Boosting. We ran two-fold cross-validation experiments on six benchmark data sets to compare the fuzzy and nonfuzzy combi-nation methods. On the “fuzzy side ” we used the fuzzy integral and the decision templates with different similarity measures. On the “nonfuzzy side ” we tried the weighted <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> as well as simple combiners such as the <b>majority</b> <b>vote,</b> minimum, maximum, average, product, and the Naive–Bayes combination. In our experiments, the fuzzy combination methods performed consistently better than the nonfuzzy methods. The weighted <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> showed a stable performance, though slightly inferior to the performance of the fuzzy combiners.

40|$|A robust {{character}} of combining diverse classifiers using a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> {{has recently been}} illustrated in the pattern recognition literature. Furthermore, negatively correlated classifiers turned out to offer further improvement of the <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> performance even comparing to the idealised model with independent classifiers. However, negatively correlated classifiers represent a very unlikely situation in the real-world classification problems and their benefits usually remain out of reach. Nevertheless, it is theoretically possible to obtain 0 % <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> error using {{a finite number of}} classifiers at the error level lower than 50 %. We attempt to show that structuring classifiers into relevant multistage organisations can widen this boundary as well as the limits of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> error even more. Introducing discrete error distributions for analysis, we show how <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> errors and their limits depend on parameters of a multiple classifier system with hardened binary outputs (correct/incorrect). Moreover, we investigate sensitivity of boundary distributions of classifier outputs to small discrepancies modelled by the random changes of votes and propose new more stable patterns of boundary distributions. Finally, we show how organising classifiers into different structures can be used to widen the limits of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> errors and how this phenomenon can be effectively exploited...|$|R
