In 1842 the first stragglers who had crossed the Sierra del Crystal are said to have been seen upon the head waters of the Gaboon. I cannot, however, but suspect that they are the [...] "Paämways" [...] of whom Bowdich ("Sketch of Gaboon," [...] p. 429) wrote in the {{beginning}} of the century, [...] "All the natives on this route are said to be cannibals, the Paämways not so voraciously as the others, because they cultivate a large breed of dogs for their eating." [...] Mr. W. Winwood Reade suspects them to be an offshoot of the great <b>Fulah</b> race, and there is nothing in point of dialect to disprove what we must at present consider a pure conjecture. [...] "The <b>Fulah</b> pronouns have striking analogies with those of the Yoruba, Accra, Ashantee, and Timmanee, and even of the great Kaffir class of dialects, which reaches from the equator to the Cape," [...] wrote the late learned E. Norris, in his [...] "Introduction to the Grammar of the <b>Fulah</b> Language" [...] (London: Harrison, 1854).|$|E

When I arrived he was moody and often brooded, but it {{looked as if he had}} a talent for {{managing}} the bushmen. They seemed to understand him and the business was growing fast. He began to go up river, although I imagine no other trader had reached the native market then. It was good for business; our oil was first quality and we got stuff, skins and sometimes ivory, Millers' and the Association couldn't buy. Besides, there were bits of pottery, brass, and silver work, the <b>Fulah</b> brought across the desert. Wyndham said the patterns were Sarascenic and the stuff was hundreds of years old. The house knew where to sell the goods at home. Once or twice we got Aggri beads." ...|$|E
60|$|Passing the easternmost {{end of the}} peninsula, and sailing {{along the}} Bullom ('lowland') shores, we {{verified}} Dr. Blyden's assertion that this 'home of fevers' shows no outward and visible sign of exceeding unhealthiness. The soil is sandy, the bush is comparatively thin, and the tall trees give it the aspect of a high and dry land. We then turned north-east and skirted Tasso Island, a strip of river-holm girt with a wall of mangroves. It had an old English fort, founded in 1695; the factors traded with the Pulo (<b>Fulah)</b> country for slaves, ivory, and gold. It was abandoned after being taken by Van Ruyter, when he restored to the Dutch West Indian Company the conquests of Commodore Holmes. The rich soil in 1800 supported a fine cotton plantation, and here Mr. Heddle kept a 'factory.' The villagers turned out to gaze, not habited like the Wolofs of Albreda, but clad in shady hats and seedy pantaloons.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{difficulty}} in distinguishing {{at first sight}} Moslem from Kafir. Besides the gypsy-like Pulo, the 'brown race,' our older <b>Fúlahs</b> and Fellalahs, whose tongue {{is said to be}} a congener of the Nubian; and the wild, half-naked pagan Jolu, the principal tribes, are two, the Mandengas and the Wólofs. The former, whom Europeans divide into the Marabút, who does not drink, and the Soninki, who does, inhabit a triangle, its base being the line from the south of the Senegal to the Gambia River, and its apex the Niger; it has even extended to near Tin-Bukhtu (the Well of Bukhtu), our Timbuctoo. In old Mohammedan works their territory is called Wángara. This race of warmen and horsemen surprisingly resembles the Somal, who hold the same parallels of latitude in Eastern Africa, as to small heads, semi-Caucasian features, Asiatic above the nose-tip and African below; tall lithe figures, high shoulders, and long limbs, especially the forearm.|$|R
60|$|In 1854 France {{commenced}} a new {{and systematic}} course of colonial policy. She first beat the Pulos (<b>Fulahs),</b> once so bold, and then she organised and gave flags to them. She checked, with a strong hand, the attacks of the Moors upon the gum-gatherers of the Sahará. And now, after drawing away from us the Gambia trade, she has begun a railway intended to connect the Senegal with the Niger and completely to outflank us. This line will annex the native regions behind our settlements, and make Bathurst and Sierra Leone insignificant dependencies upon the continent of Gallic rule. The total distance is at least 820 miles, and the whole will be guarded by a line of forts. It begins with a section of 260 kilometres, which will transport valuable goods now injured by ass and camel-carriage. The natives, wearied with incessant petty wars, are ready to welcome the new comers. The western Súdán, or Niger-basin, has a population estimated at forty millions, ready, if a market be opened, to flock to it with agricultural and industrial products, including iron, copper, and gold. Meanwhile the Joliba (Black Water), with the Benuwe and other tributaries, offers a ready-made waterway for thousands of miles. Sierra Leone lies only 400 miles, less than half, from the Niger; but what would the Colonial Office say if a similar military line were proposed? Nor can we console ourselves by the feeble excuse that Senegal has a climate superior to that of our 'pest-houses.' On the contrary, she suffers severely from yellow fever, which has never yet visited the British Gold Coast. Her mortality is excessive, but she simply replaces her slain. She has none of that mawkish, hysterical humanitarianism which of late years has become a salient feature in our campaigning. During the Ashanti affair the main object seems to have been, not {{the destruction of the}} enemy, but to save as many privates as possible from ague and fever, sunstroke and dysentery.|$|R
60|$|The butchers' yard, {{near the}} market, {{is no longer}} a 'ragged and uncleanly strip of ground.' The long-horned cattle, small, mostly humpless, and {{resembling}} the brindled and dun Alderney cow, are driven in from the Pulo (<b>Fulah)</b> country. I have described the beef as tasting not unlike what one imagines a knacker's establishment to produce, and since that time I have found but scant improvement. It is sold on alternate days with mutton, the former costing 6d., the latter 9d. a pound. Veal, so bad in England and so good in Southern Europe, is unknown. The long, lean, hairy black-and-white sheep do not supply an excellent article. Goats and kids are plentiful, and the flesh would be good if it had any taste. Hogs abound, as in Ireland; but no one eats pork, for the best of reasons. The poultry-list comprises small tough fowls (l0d. to 2s.), partridges, ducks (2s. 6d.), geese, especially the spur-winged from Sherbro, and the Muscovy or Manilla duck--a hard-fleshed, insipid bird, whose old home was South American Paraguay--turkeys (10s. to 15s.), and the arripiada, or frizzly chicken, whose feathers stand on end. Milk is scarce and dear. Englishmen raw in the tropics object to milch-goats and often put up with milch-pigs, which are said to be here kept for the purpose. I need not tell all the old tale, 'Goat he go die; pig he go for bush,' &c. Butter (1s. 8d. in 2-lb. tins) is oily and rancid, with the general look of cartgrease, in this tropical temperature. It is curious that the Danish and Irish dairies cannot supply the West African public with a more toothsome article.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2005, West Kurdufan State was {{abolished}} and {{its territory}} divided between North and South Kurdufan States, in {{implementation of the}} Protocol between the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) on the resolution of conflict in Southern Kurdufan/Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile States signed at Naivasha, Kenya, 26 May 2004. Section 2.1 of the protocol states that [...] "The boundaries of Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State shall be the same boundaries of former Southern Kordofan Province when Greater Kordofan was sub-divided into two provinces." [...] The protocol forms part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. Al <b>Fulah</b> presently has the status of second capital of South Kurdufan State, and sessions of the state Legislative Council are to alternate between Al <b>Fulah</b> and Kaduqli.

5000|$|Amawom {{is one of}} the 18 {{villages of}} Oboro clan in the Local Government Area of Ikwuano in the Abia State. [...] The name is derived from two words [...] "Ama" [...] meaning {{location}} and [...] "Awom" [...] meaning farm. The present Amawom {{is believed to have been}} discovered in the 18th century. The languages of English, Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and <b>Fulah</b> are spoken in the village.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} names {{applied to the}} {{language}}, {{just as there are}} to the Fula people. They call their language Pulaar or Pular in the western dialects and Fulfulde in the central and eastern dialects. <b>Fula(h)</b> and Fulani in English come originally from Manding (esp. Mandinka, but also Malinke and Bamana) and Hausa, respectively; Peul in French, also occasionally found in literature in English, comes from Wolof.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Banja Tejan-Sie, GCMG (7 August 1917 - 8 August 2000) was a {{politician}} and lawyer in Sierra Leone {{and one of}} the [...] "founding fathers" [...] of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP). Tejan-Sie was born in Moyamba District (in the current Southern Province) to a famous Muslim cleric and scholar from the <b>Fulah</b> tribe. Tejan-Sie was educated at the Bo School and the Prince of Wales School before continuing his education at the London School of Economics and Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the bar in 1951.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} names (and spellings of the names) {{used in other}} {{languages}} {{to refer to the}} Fulɓe. Fulani in English is borrowed from the Hausa term. Fula, from Manding languages, is also used in English, and sometimes spelled <b>Fulah</b> or Fullah. Fula and Fulani are commonly used in English, including within Africa. The French borrowed the Wolof term Pël, which is variously spelled: Peul, Peulh, and even Peuhl. More recently the Fulfulde / Pulaar term Fulɓe, which is a plural noun (singular, Pullo) has been Anglicised as Fulbe, which some people use. In Portuguese, the terms Fula or Futafula are used. The terms Fallata Fallatah or Fellata are of Kanuri origins, and are often the ethnonyms by which Fulani people are identified by in Sudan.|$|E
5000|$|Fula , {{also known}} as Fulani [...] or <b>Fulah</b> (Fula: Fulfulde, Pulaar, Pular; Peul), is a {{language}} spoken {{as a set of}} various dialects in a continuum that stretches across some 20 countries in West and Central Africa. Along with other related languages such as Serer and Wolof, it belongs to the Senegambian branch within the Niger-Congo languages, which does not have tones, unlike most other Niger-Congo languages. More broadly, it belongs to the Atlantic geographic grouping within Niger-Congo. It is spoken as a first language by the Fula people ("Fulani", Fulɓe) from the Senegambia region and Guinea to Cameroon and Sudan and by related groups such as the Toucouleur people in the Senegal River Valley. It is also spoken as a second language by various peoples in the region, such as the Kirdi of northern Cameroon and northeastern Nigeria.|$|E
