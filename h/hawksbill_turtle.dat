5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle</b> and the leatherback sea turtle, are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle</b> than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E
5|$|Within the Florida {{mangrove}} systems live 220species of fish, and {{a variety}} of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), and white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala). The mangroves also support 24species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata), and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).|$|E

25|$|The reptile fauna {{recorded}} {{from the}} park is 47 and six of them are endemic. Sri Lankan krait, Boulenger's keelback, Sri Lankan flying snake, painted-lip lizard, Wiegmann's agama, and Bahir's fan-throated lizard are the endemic species. The coastal line of the park is visited by the all five globally endangered sea turtles (leatherback turtle, olive ridley, loggerhead sea turtle, <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle,</b> and green turtle) that visit Sri Lanka. The two breeding crocodile species of Sri Lanka, mugger crocodile and saltwater crocodile, inhabit the park. The Indian cobra and Russell's viper are among the other reptiles.|$|E
25|$|Diego Garcia {{provides}} suitable foraging and nesting {{habitat for}} both the <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata) and the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). Juvenile hawksbills are quite common in the lagoon and at Barachois Sylvane (also known as Turtle Cove) {{in the southern part}} of the lagoon. Adult hawksbills and greens are common in the surrounding seas and nest regularly on the ocean-side beaches of the atoll. Hawksbills have been observed nesting during June and July, and from November to March. Greens are have been observed nesting in every month; the average female lays three clutches per season, each having an average clutch size of 113 eggs. Diurnal nesting is common in both species. An estimated 300–700 hawksbills and 400–800 greens nest in the Chagos.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 2,927 marine {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the Spratly Sea, including 776 benthic species, 382 species of hard coral, 524 species of marine fish, 262 species of algae and sea grass, 35 species of seabirds, and 20 species of marine mammals and sea turtles. Terrestrial vegetation in the islands includes 103 species of vascular plants of magnolia branches (Magnoliophyta) of 39 families and 79 genera. The islands that do have vegetation provide important habitats for many seabirds and sea turtles. Both the green turtle (Chelonia mydas, endangered) and the <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata, critically endangered) formerly occurred in numbers sufficient to support commercial exploitation. These species reportedly continue to nest even on islands inhabited by military personnel (such as Pratas) to some extent, though {{it is believed that}} their numbers have declined.|$|E
25|$|All {{but one of}} {{the marine}} turtles come to the Mazunte area to lay their eggs, as well as a few land and {{freshwater}} turtle species. The Pacific coast town of Mazunte is famous for its sea turtles. Thousands of Olive Ridley turtles arrive en masse to lay their eggs in nearby Escobilla Bay. The nesting season generally begins in May and lasts for several months. Although an endangered species, the turtles come to the beach in large numbers for a few nights after a full moon. These events are called arribadas. Other turtles that lay eggs here are the <b>Hawksbill</b> <b>turtle,</b> the “prieta” (a subspecies of green turtle), and some leatherback turtles. In 1997, The Centro Mexicano de Tortuga counted the arrival of about 900,000 sea turtles to La Escobilla beach alone.|$|E
25|$|Anatomically, a few {{characteristics}} {{distinguish the}} green turtle {{from the other}} members of its family. Unlike the closely related <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle,</b> the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell. The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the green turtle has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's plastron and its shell. Mature C. mydas front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill's two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens.|$|E
40|$|The {{coast of}} Northern Andhra Pradesh has {{predominantly}} rocky and sandy shores with sporadic nesting sites of olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea. However, {{there have been}} rare sightings of <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtles</b> Eretmochelys imbricata along this coast {{in the past couple}} of decades and their nesting is seldom observed. Carcasses of two adult <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtles</b> were observed on 29 / 12 / 2010 and 07 / 03 / 2011 along the coast of Visakhapatnam in Northern Andhra Pradesh, India. These sightings of dead <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtles</b> along this coast come recently after a long gap of several years and emphasize on the need to carry out surveys in the area for devising effective long term conservation management strategies...|$|R

40|$|February 23 - 25, 2010, Phuket, ThailandWe {{developed}} a new releasing system to allow turtles to escape spontaneously from underwater bag net of set nets. This system consists of a turtle releasing device (TRD) which is a square vent (1 m x 1 m) with a flap and a 20 degrees sloping upper panel of the bag net. In this study, we examined the behavior of sea turtles in the experimental bag net and escaping capability through the TRD. The experimental bag net was composed of quadratic-prism shaped upper panels of 20 degrees angle on a box-shaped net (8 m x 8 m, 1. 8 m high in total) and the TRD attached {{on the top of}} the upper panel. Eleven captive loggerhead, six wild green, and twelve captive <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtles</b> were used. All the loggerhead and green turtles and about half the <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtles</b> successfully escaped out through the TRD. Loggerhead turtles reached the TRD by pushing their heads up continuously, while green and <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtles</b> swam to the shallowest position directly along the upper panel and reached the TRD. All loggerhead and green turtles pushed up the flap strongly and escaped out successfully, while half of the <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtles</b> didn’t push the flap strongly enough to open it...|$|R

Finding the skipper down with a particularly bad stroke of fever, Grief had relieved him and taken the Uncle Toby on her semiannual run to the atolls. He had elected to make his first call at Leu-Leu, which lay farthest, and now found himself lost at sea with a chronometer that played tricks.|$|E
60|$|Polly {{was like}} her father, generous {{to the point}} of absurdity with her meagre possessions. Mary admired a Spanish fan--a Mexican {{treasure}} that had come down from one of the grand ladies of the Court of the Emperor Maximilian. Polly's delight flamed like wild-fire. Mary found herself the immediate owner of the fan, almost labouring under the fictitious impression that she had conferred an obligation by accepting it. Only a foreign woman could do such things, and Polly was guilty of similar gifts to all the young women. It was her way. It might be a lace handkerchief, a pink Paumotan pearl, or a comb of <b>hawksbill</b> <b>turtle.</b> It was all the same. Whatever their eyes rested on in joy was theirs. To women, as to men, she was irresistible.|$|E
