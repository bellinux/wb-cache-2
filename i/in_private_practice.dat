40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the initiation of}} and response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) <b>in</b> <b>private</b> rheumatology <b>practices</b> versus academic centers. METHODS: We compared newly initiated TNF inhibition for axSpA in 363 patients enrolled <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>practices</b> with 100 patients recruited in 6 university hospitals within the Swiss Clinical Quality Management (SCQM) cohort. RESULTS: All patients had been treated with ≥ 1 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug and > 70 % of patients had a baseline Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4 before anti-TNF agent initiation. The proportion of patients with nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) treated with TNF inhibitors was higher <b>in</b> hospitals versus <b>private</b> <b>practices</b> (30. 4 % vs 18. 7 %, p = 0. 02). The burden of disease as assessed by patient-reported outcomes at baseline was slightly higher in the hospital setting. Mean levels (± SD) of the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score were, however, virtually identical <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>practices</b> and academic centers (3. 4 ± 1. 0 vs 3. 4 ± 0. 9, p = 0. 68). An Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS 40) response at 1 year was reached for ankylosing spondylitis in 51. 7 % <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>practices</b> and 52. 9 % in university hospitals (p = 1. 0) and for nr-axSpA in 27. 5 % versus 25. 0 %, respectively (p = 1. 0). CONCLUSION: With {{the exception of a}} lower proportion of patients with nr-axSpA newly treated with anti-TNF agents <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>practices</b> <b>in</b> comparison to academic centers, adherence to ASAS treatment recommendations for TNF inhibition was equally high, and similar response rates to TNF blockers were achieved in both clinical settings...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{adequacy}} of reimbursement for childhood vaccinations in two rural regions in Colorado, {{the authors measured}} medical practice costs of providing childhood vaccinations and compared them with reimbursement. METHODS: A "time-motion" method {{was used to measure}} labor costs of providing vaccinations <b>in</b> 13 <b>private</b> and public <b>practices.</b> Practices reported non-labor costs. The authors determined reimbursement by record review. RESULTS: The average vaccine delivery cost per dose (excluding vaccine cost) ranged from $ 4. 69 for community health centers to $ 5. 60 for <b>private</b> <b>practices.</b> Average reimbursement exceeded average delivery costs for all vaccines and contributed to overhead <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>practices.</b> Average reimbursement was less than total cost (vaccine-delivery costs + overhead) <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>practices</b> for most vaccines in one region with significant managed care penetration. Reimbursement to public providers was less than the average vaccine delivery costs. CONCLUSIONS: Current reimbursement may not be adequate to induce <b>private</b> <b>practices</b> to provide childhood vaccinations, particularly in areas with substantial managed care penetration...|$|R

5|$|In an {{arrangement}} that predates the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a District Attorney independent of the mayor's office. Dilworth had been elected to the office in 1951 but resigned in 1955 to run for mayor. Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman and former assistant district attorney, was elected to fill the unexpired term. Blanc was a veteran of both World Wars who, during his time on the council, led an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. In 1957, he ran for a full four-year term, but his connection with machine politics led Clark and Dilworth to withhold their endorsement of him. The Republican nominee was Emil F.
