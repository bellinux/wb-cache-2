5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur {{some time before}} 1000CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town {{was transformed into a}} Vaishnava center of pilgrimage.

5000|$|Indeed, local {{consistency}} is only {{relative to}} the consistency of groups of variables. For example, arc consistency guarantees that every consistent evaluation of a variable can be consistently extended to another variable. However, when a single value of a variable is extended to two other variables, {{there is no guarantee}} that these two values <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with each other. For example, [...] may <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with [...] and with , but these two evaluations may not <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> with each other.|$|R

5|$|No known {{globular}} clusters display active star formation, which <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> {{with the view}} that {{globular clusters}} are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy, and {{were among the first}} collections of stars to form. Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.|$|E

5|$|Caroline Island {{is heavily}} vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an inward zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. This pattern of vegetation <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> across the larger islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E

In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters.

5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E
