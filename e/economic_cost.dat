The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in the developing world, and an aging population in many countries.

Although {{it has been argued}} that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology.

Despite of the seriousness of blackout, however, there are scarce studies with ex-ante analysis of the <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> from blackout. In order to evocate the seriousness, we calculate the <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> for both industrial and household sectors with using some survey data and statistical methodologies. As a result, total <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> are 39. 23 trillion KRW (35. 83 trillion KRW for industrial sector, 3. 40 trillion KRW for household sector) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on conflict and terrorism has {{paid little attention}} to the <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> of terrorism for the perpetrators of terror attacks. Our research fills that gap by examining the <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> of harboring suicide terror attacks. We combine data on Palestinian suicide terrorists with data from the Palestinian Labor Force Survey, to identify and quantify the impact of a successful attack on unemployment and wages. We find robust evidence that terror attacks have important <b>economic</b> <b>costs.</b> They cause a significant increase in unemployment and a significant decrease in wages and on the number of Palestinians working in Israel. Importantly, these effects are persistent and last for at least six months after the attack. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the competitive position of peanuts for the U. S. in comparison with China at both the national and regional levels in a free trade market for the 1988 – 93 period. A nonparametic statistical method was used to determine the similarities and differences in <b>economic</b> <b>costs,</b> yield, and net returns to farm management and risks between the two countries. Total <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> were decomposed further into seed, fertilizer, chemicals, labor, and other expenses. Results indicate that <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> in peanut production were significantly larger in the U. S. than in China. Peanut production was, however, more profitable in the U. S. than in China if land value and quota rent were not included in U. S. <b>economic</b> <b>costs.</b> There was no statistical evidence for the difference of net returns based on world peanut prices in Rotterdam if land value and quota rent were excluded in <b>economic</b> <b>costs.</b> This study concludes that American peanuts were less competitive than Chinese peanuts in the world market in terms of costs and net returns. The U. S. peanut industry has a competitive advantage in high-quality products and good infrastructure of production, processing, and transportation, while China’s peanut industry has a competitive advantage in “free land ” and cheap labor.

If however, interventions increase <b>economic</b> <b>costs</b> and increase health benefits then the trade-off between cost and benefit should be examined. Decision makers should assess the cost per unit of health benefit from infection-control programmes, consider the impact on health budgets and compare infection-control with alternate uses of scarce health care resources...|$|R
