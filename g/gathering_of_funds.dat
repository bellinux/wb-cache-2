50|$|The {{main body}} of the {{collection}} was gathered between 1947 and 1960. Pietro Maria Bardi, formerly owner of commercial galleries in Milan and Rome, was in charge of searching and selecting the works which should be acquired, while Chateaubriand had to look for donors and patrons who shared his dream of endowing the country with a museum of international standard. Although many spontaneous donations had been registered, Chateaubriand gained reputation for using bold methods of persuasion. Endorsed by the influence of his Diários Associados Press, he negotiated with announcers his <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> After that, he rewarded the donors with the title of patrons, celebrating each new acquisition with banquets, speeches and even student parades in the streets of São Paulo, as happened at the arrival of Van Gogh's The Student.|$|E

Gabriel, then parish priest and rector of the cathedral parish, through a special project committee and the pastoral council, spearheaded the massive renovation of the Cathedral and <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to sustain the project. The renovation has changed the Major altar placing the Crucifix on its center, adding two side chapels (altar of saints and Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso Chapel), replacing the glass windows with stained glass featuring some of the important events in the Life of our Lord Jesus, placing new marble stone {{on the floor and}} replacing the roof and ceiling of the cathedral painting the interior walls, replacing the doors, placing an air conditioning units and the restoration of the original image of Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso and St. Andrew the Apostle.

50|$|Pogge imagines {{that there}} may be dissent between and within nations. Again, he does not think a world {{government}} is necessary. Those countries that fail to pay their required GRD could be taxed by all the other countries doing trade with it. If a majority of countries are paying their GRD, these taxes would help deter dissenters. The idea is that there would be added pressure on each country to enforce the <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> GRD <b>funds</b> within its borders.|$|R
50|$|At any rate, the <b>gathering</b> {{together}} <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> scattered {{during the}} sackings allowed {{the opening of}} the Prado Museum in Madrid, in the building originally intended as the base for the Royal Office for Science, the National Library, and other academic institutions. \ Gradually, the university sector was renewed: one major act was the move of the former University of Alcalá to Madrid as the Universidad Central. Primary and secondary education were developed as the foundation of a far-reaching educational programme (:es:Ley Moyano), which however was not implemented effectively or widely until the Second Republic of 1931-36.|$|R

5000|$|Education in Appalachia has {{historically}} lagged behind average literacy levels of United States. At first, {{education in this}} region was largely nurtured through religious institutions. Children who found time away from family work were often taught to read about the Bible and Christian morality. Then, after the civil war, some districts established primary schools and high schools. People began to access standard education during this period, and higher education in large communities was expanded at that time. Lately, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, education in rural areas has been advanced; some settlement schools and sponsored schools were established by organizations. In the 20th century, the national policy has begun affecting education in Appalachia. Those schools were trying {{to meet the demands}} which federal and state settled. Some public schools were facing the problem <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>funds</b> because <b>of</b> government’s No Child Left Behind policy. (DeYoung 1517-1521) ...|$|R
50|$|After Klumb's death, {{the house}} was {{acquired}} by the University of Puerto Rico in 1986. In 1997, it {{was included in the}} National Register of Historic Places as a Regional Monument for its architectural relevance. However, with time, the house has been abandoned and is currently inaccessible and deteriorated. Several organizations have made efforts to restore it, and in 2014, the Comité Casa Klumb was founded. The World Monuments Fund added the house to its 2014 World Monuments Watch list, which helps in the process <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>funds</b> to restore monuments. According to Dr. Enrique Vivoni Farange, director of the Architectural and Construction Archives of the University of Puerto Rico, the costs of restoring the house ascend to $1.9 million.|$|R

50|$|Combat cavalry units {{existed in}} the Polish Army until January 27, 1947, when the 1st Warsaw Cavalry Division was disbanded. The last Polish cavalry unit, the Representative Squadron of the President of Poland, was disbanded in July 1948. However, after several years <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>funds,</b> a group <b>of</b> enthusiasts formed in 2000 the Representative Squadron of Cavalry of the Polish Army. The unit is {{under the auspices of}} the army, which thus {{returned}} to its cavalry tradition. The squadron is present at most official anniversary celebrations in Warsaw, as well as other towns of Poland. In other places people are forming reenactment groups that continues, often with help of army, the traditions of local cavalry units. An example of such a society is the Volunteer Representative Squadron of City of Poznań which is a tribute to the 15th Poznań Uhlans Regiment.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{protection}} {{fund has}} been constituted {{and has been}} operating for gathering financial means for investing in preservation and {{protection of the environment}} in Serbia in the past seven years. The idea of creating a special fund was based on definition of particular sources <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>funds</b> and their dedicated investment in preservation and protection of natural goods, values and capitals. Until its recent termination in the end of 2012, the Environmental protection <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Serbia presented unique, specialised national financial institution through which the funds were provided for financing ecology projects. The fund was formed on the initiatives that were started during the 1990 ’s by United Nations with a goal of supporting environmental protection investment programs. Unfortunately, the fund in Serbia had a short life so there was no creation of assumptions for the long-term empiric research of its potential role. The doubts that within the fund there were speculative financial transactions lead to political decision to terminate the fund. Later institutional solutions, however, show that the main cause <b>of</b> the <b>fund</b> termination is in conducting centralisation <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> financial compensations for using natural values, {{and at the same time}} to lose the trail of dedicated investment <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> in environmental protection from the total amount of the budget. The Environmental protection fund was planned as non-profitable institution unlike regular investment funds. This paper first presents a short overview of ways of functioning <b>of</b> regular investment <b>funds.</b> Regardless <b>of</b> the fundamental differences in goals it was possible to use some of the experience in the work of the Environmental protection fund. The paper gives comprehensive presentation of the aspects of organization, business, creation of incomes as well as the fields <b>of</b> using the <b>Fund’s</b> resources...|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after joining}} the Latter Day Saint church, Toronto's ship {{collided}} with another, which almost resulted in Toronto's drowning.

As such, the balcony was named the Confederate Gallery. Upon the completion of the balcony, the Ryman's capacity rose to 6,000.

40|$|Internet satire percolates {{contemporary}} society, yet remains vastly unstudied {{despite the}} ease of communication that the Internet provides. Although the theoretical discussion surrounding satire is already complicated—given a reliance on outdated, classical forms and post-modernism’s current trend of non-absolutes—the Internet can be studied through a satirical lens. By using the Age of Enlightenment and post-modernism as models, I compare and contrast the methods utilized by Internet satirists and those on other mediums. The satirists of websites such as The Oatmeal, The Onion, and The Duffleblog encourage user participation at a level previously insurmountable by other means. For example, methods like linking to other webpages, known as hyperlinks, and crowdfunding, the practice <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>funds</b> using Internet resources, harness the power of audiences. However, Internet satirists still rely on rhetorical devices popularized by other mediums, such as {{the construction of a}} persona. The Internet is where ideas from the Age of Enlightenment and post-modernism converge and diverge, where author and audience craft satire. In turn, that satire is used to intimidate and self-preserve, yet can also initiate social change on and offline...|$|R
40|$|As {{more than}} half a century has passed since the {{establishment}} of the international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank), this paper analyzes the opinion that these institutions have not accomplished their mission. They generally admit that they have not succeeded in the activities that they set out to accomplish, a propos <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>funds</b> for countries faced with economic gaps and helping them to maintain long term economic growth and development. We show that these financial institutions have done nothing to reduce poverty and financial disparities, to increase their own transparency, responsibility and management, especially with the public participation of developing countries, or to create a more effective loans system. In this paper the main goal of research is to explore the arguments pro and contra the strategic effect, policy, and working methodology of the international financial institutions in view of finding a solution to the global financial crisis and global prevalent financial problems, and also to consider the reasons for the justification or otherwise of their being part of the global financial system...|$|R
50|$|Though {{there is}} {{evidence}} of activity of religious choral societies before 1800, the bulk seems to have occurred from 1800 to 1820. This coincides with an important political development; 1798 saw the ratification (imposed by the French) of a new constitution. One of the most important provisions of this new constitution was the effective separation of church and state. As a consequence, the Dutch reformed church was no longer entirely supported by the state, leaving the churches in the Republic to devise other means <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>funds</b> for their activities, largely those in support of the poor. A special committee was established particularly for this purpose in 1798. Given the charitable character of the ‘zanggenootschap’ concerts it is very likely that {{this was one of the}} ways the church attempted to accrue additional <b>funds.</b> The organizers <b>of</b> these societies were largely members of the clergy or associated with it. That they chose this way <b>of</b> generating <b>funds</b> is quite remarkable given the period with its turmoil and social and economic unrest. It also presupposes a broad interest in religious music of a rather modern nature which given the dominance of the Psalms in the church music in the Netherlands is equally remarkable.|$|R
