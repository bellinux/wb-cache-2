50|$|In Garhanga {{there are}} several craft shops, {{including}} tanneries, basket-making workshops, blacksmiths and pottery. Their products are in high demand in the surrounding area due to the remoteness of Garhanga {{and the lack of}} organization in the national economy. The retail sector is predominantly managed by women, who trade peanut oil, utensils, spices and sweets. Labor migration is widespread and is operated rotationally in larger families. There are significant deposits of gypsum and lime in the rural community, which are mined in the traditional manner. The main source of energy for the population is firewood and it is used for cooking. Timber needs to be imported to a large extent from the neighboring countries. The predominant form of artificial lighting are kerosene lamps, since a <b>high-voltage</b> <b>line</b> from nearby Nigeria was passed only to the village of Laba.|$|E
5000|$|For {{high-voltage}} and extra-high-voltage transmission lines, {{specially trained}} personnel use [...] "live line" [...] techniques to allow hands-on contact with energized equipment. In {{this case the}} worker is electrically connected to the <b>high-voltage</b> <b>line</b> but thoroughly insulated from the earth so that {{he is at the}} same electrical potential as that of the line. Since training for such operations is lengthy, and still presents a danger to personnel, only very important transmission lines are subject to maintenance while live. Outside these properly engineered situations, insulation from earth does not guarantee that no current flows to earth—as grounding or arcing to ground can occur in unexpected ways, and high-frequency currents can burn even an ungrounded person. Touching a transmitting antenna is dangerous for this reason, and a high-frequency Tesla coil can sustain a spark with only one endpoint.|$|E

The inuence of meteorological parameters on the ozone concentration variation is discussed and it is determined that the relative humidity, wind speed and direction were the most important parameters causing the ozone concentration increase in the surroundings of transmission lines in nonurbanized areas.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{inherent}} isolation and ability for remote interrogation, wireless sensors are {{an effective way}} to monitor the operation of high-voltage power transmission lines. A wireless sensor on a <b>high-voltage</b> <b>line</b> has the potential to form corona discharges, particularly on an exposed antenna. The effects of corona formation on the antenna of a wireless radio frequency (RF) communication system were studied. The physics of corona plasma formation and charge composition was analyzed, leading to a theoretical understanding of corona interaction with the antenna. Through a series of high-voltage experiments, the effects of corona on the impedance and gain of an antenna, as well as the RF interference generated by corona current pulses, were identified. RF interference and low-frequency corona current were observed to have the largest impact on a wireless RF system. Corona was found to have no significant impact on the impedance or gain of an antenna. Based on the results, design guidelines were proposed for an antenna and RF front end to be used in wireless high-voltage sensing applications. Ph. D...|$|E
