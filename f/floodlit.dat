For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during the Second World War the North Bank terrace was bombed {{and had to}} be rebuilt; the roof was not restored until 1956. Floodlights were fitted in 1951, with the first <b>floodlit</b> match being a friendly against Hapoel Tel Aviv on 19 September of that year. The floodlights that adorn Dalymount Park, once stood at the Arsenal stadium. They were shipped to Dublin in 1962. The inaugural <b>floodlit</b> match saw Arsenal beat Bohemians 3–8. Undersoil heating was added in 1964. Unlike at many other grounds, Arsenal refused to install perimeter fencing, even at the height of hooliganism in the 1980s, which made it ineligible for use as an FA Cup semi-final venue.|$|E

Since then most test playing countries have installed <b>floodlights</b> in {{some or all of}} their stadiums. Traditional Cricket <b>floodlights</b> have a long pole on which lights are fixed. This is done because several times, the ball travels too high when a batsman hits it and high lights are needed to keep the ball in sight. However, many cricket stadiums have different types of <b>floodlights</b> like the ANZ Stadium in Australia. The DSC Cricket Stadium in Dubai recently installed Ring of Fire system of <b>floodlights</b> which is latest and smartest system of <b>floodlight</b> in the world.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} vertex <b>floodlights</b> of angle ß suffice to {{illuminate}} any polygon, {{and that no}} angle less than ß suffices for all polygons. A vertex <b>floodlight</b> of angle ff is an internal cone of light of aperture no more than ff with apex at a vertex. No vertex may {{have more than one}} <b>floodlight.</b> Keywords: Computational geometry, visibility. 1 Introduction There has been recent interest in illumination by <b>floodlights</b> [1] [2] [6], a new variation on visibility problems in computational geometry. A <b>floodlight</b> of angle ff is a light that projects in a (contiguous) cone of angle at most ff. A <b>floodlight</b> placed in a simple polygon with its apex at a vertex, aimed entirely interior to the polygon, is called a vertex floodlight; if it has angle at most ff, we will call it a vertex ff-light. We restrict each vertex to anchoring at most one <b>floodlight.</b> The question of illuminating a polygon with vertex <b>floodlights</b> was first explored in [3], in which it was established that every orthogonal polygon [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the gatehouse was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council {{as part of the}} disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first street light had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been <b>floodlit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey {{took charge}} of the team in a {{caretaker}} capacity for a league match against Portadown that afternoon, and remained as caretaker manager for the following match against Ballyclare Comrades in the <b>Floodlit</b> Cup on 7 January. He was officially appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 8 January 1997. In his first full season in charge he led the club to three trophies – the League Cup, County Antrim Shield, and <b>Floodlit</b> Cup – and narrowly missed out on the league title to champions Cliftonville by four points. Jeffrey won his first league title as manager in the 1999–2000 season however, along with a third consecutive League Cup triumph. The Blues retained the league title the following season, and also won the Charity Shield and the County Antrim Shield. The 2001–02 season saw the club win a cup double, lifting both the Irish Cup and the League Cup. In 2005, the inauguration of the Setanta Cup meant the return of an all-Ireland cup competition {{for the first time since}} 1980. The Blues qualified as league champions, but started the competition poorly – losing 2–1 away to Longford Town. However, they recovered to eventually reach the final against Shelbourne, and although the Blues were major underdogs going into the match against professional League of Ireland opposition, they overcame the odds to become inaugural winners of the competition by defeating Shelbourne 2–0. Incidentally, Linfield were in fact the reigning all-Ireland champions at the time, having won the final staging of the Tyler Cup in 1980 before the competition was discontinued.|$|E

Before the Old Trafford football stadium was built, the site was used for games of shinty, the traditional game of the Scottish Highlands. During the First World War, the stadium was used by American soldiers for games of baseball. On 17 September 1981, the North Section of cricket's Lambert & Butler <b>Floodlit</b> Competition was played there; in the semi-finals, Nottinghamshire defeated Derbyshire and Lancashire beat Yorkshire, before Lancashire beat Nottinghamshire by 8 runs in the final to reach the national final, played between the other regional winners at Stamford Bridge the next day.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of the {{workshops}} is Carisbrook, Dunedin's former main sports venue. Opened in 1883, the ground had a capacity of 35,000 people, and was <b>floodlit</b> from the 1990s. Used primarily for rugby union, but also for other sports (notably as a Test cricket venue), Carisbrook lost its pre-eminence among the city's sports arenas with {{the construction of a new}} stadium in the northern end of the city in 2011; demolition began in 2013. The ground is named for the former home of early colonial settler James Macandrew, which in turn was named for Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight in southern England.|$|E
50|$|Further {{enhancements}} {{were made}} to the football pitch in 2011, when <b>floodlighting</b> was added. There had been a desire to include <b>floodlighting</b> at the stadium since 2006, but this had not been achieved due to the high cost of installation. A trip to Bhutan by Tata Group owner Ratan Tata led to an agreement between Tata Power, Druk Green and the Bhutan Olympic Committee to install <b>floodlighting,</b> with Tata bearing the cost of installation as an act of corporate social responsibility. The total cost of installing the <b>floodlighting</b> was Rs 13,230,000.|$|R

He oversaw the club's entry into the Football League and remained in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. Major changes were not seen until businessman Dave Russell took over in 1961. His introductions included the team's current all-white kit and regularly arranged <b>floodlit</b> home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War Millwall's {{form was}} {{poor and the}} club dropped into the Third and Fourth Division of the Football League. West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other {{competitively}} between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79. They played two cup games {{against each other in}} the Southern Professional <b>Floodlit</b> Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{the college}} {{announced}} an extensive expansion of its campus, including new halls of residence, a sports and complementary therapy building {{and a new}} outdoor <b>floodlit</b> sports pitch.

A £10 million fundraising campaign, Building Brighter Futures, was created to raise the funds required to complete the project, and construction work began {{in the summer of}} 2007. The complex, thePoint4, was originally named The Point after a nearby block of flats. It includes a bistro and conference facilities, and commenced operation in April 2009, and was officially opened on 24 June by BBC sports presenter and Daily Mail columnist Des Kelly. In 2008 the college was nominated as one of the sites for the 2012 Paralympic Games and acted as a pre-Games training camp for Paralympic athletes.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of severe storms and gale force winds in December 2006, the <b>floodlights</b> at Park View Road were damaged.
