6000|$|ALL the {{way home}} from Maine, Babbitt <b>was</b> certain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a changed man. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} to serenity. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to cease worrying about business. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have more [...] "interests"--theaters, public affairs, reading.

5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on what you have started, to sit where you are sitting and, when you are gone, attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E

5|$|Before each episode, Steel {{researches}} {{the history}} of the place in which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to perform. His research interests include local notable people, landmarks, customs and humorous anecdotes. The majority of the research sometimes took place close to the actual recording date. For example, Steel carried out almost no research for his episode in Walsall until ten days before the recording. In Merthyr Tydfil he spent three days in the town, where he carried out research and met locals. He then performs a tailor-made show about the town in front of a local audience. The style of the programme is similar to other shows starring Steel, such as The Mark Steel Lectures, in which Steel presented a humorous lecture about a famous person in history.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E
60|$|LEE TAI. He {{told you}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to an {{official}} dinner, but he didn't {{tell you that}} as soon as he could get away <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to play bridge at the Knoxes'. Pity you don't play. They might have asked you too.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} in the February 1975 edition of Billboard magazine that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> signed to Famous Music and even though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> involved in other assignments for Famous Music, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to retain his position as executive producer and writer for The Hues Corporation.|$|R
60|$|Some {{critical}} spirit {{within him}} asked him urgently why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to the station, what <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, what <b>he</b> {{thought he had}} done, and what <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do. To all of which questions Mr. Brumley perceived he had no adequate reply.|$|R
5|$|During lunch, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Leslie that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to propose}} to Ann (Rashida Jones). Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars {{to stay awake}} for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses {{to let him go}} because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, {{he is capable of}} serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E
60|$|Then next, being a philosopher, {{he would}} decide that if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to buy a}} great number of {{libraries}} in this way, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make an absolutely new sort of demand for these books, and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> entitled to a special sort of supply.|$|R

"Then Abner Batterfield {{told his}} tale. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to make a}} fresh start; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to spend the rest}} of his life in some manner worthy of him. He hadn't read much of the book he had taken out of the library, for in his present way of {{spending}} his life there didn't seem to be any very good time for reading, but he had read enough of it to make him feel that it was time for him to make a fresh start, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do it.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Shearer, Guest and McKean {{starred in}} the folk music mockumentary A Mighty Wind, portraying a band called The Folksmen. The film was written by Guest and Eugene Levy, and {{directed}} by Guest. Shearer had {{a major role in}} the Guest-directed parody of Oscar politicking For Your Consideration in 2006. He played Victor Allan Miller, a veteran actor who is convinced that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be nominated for an Academy Award.

His other film appearances include The Right Stuff, Portrait of a White Marriage, The Fisher King, The Truman Show, EdTV and Small Soldiers.|$|E
5|$|John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{is shown}} {{working in an}} office {{building}} for a box company.

He tells a woman named Helen on the phone about it, but it is revealed that she charges by the hour to talk with Locke, {{and that they have}} been conversing for eight months. Locke reveals to Helen that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with her is up.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and says that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to stay for a}} few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> burning to do {{something}} besides helping Mother in the kitchen--something which would save them and pull the tea-room out of the hole. Without a word to Mother he started for Grimsby Hill, the estate of Mrs. Vance Carter.

60|$|It <b>was</b> perfect weather. <b>He</b> {{left his}} mother, telling her where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> She would <b>be</b> alone all the day.

It <b>was</b> sweet to rush through the morning lanes on his bicycle.|$|R
