The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill, who was struck by lightning and killed {{when they were both}} eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; [...] "if you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that asked <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Aerosmith brought [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{into the}} hard-rock mainstream. [...] Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had {{performed}} the song prior to joining Aerosmith. [...] Perry recalled, [...] "'Train Kept A-Rollin {{was the only}} song we had in common {{when we first got}} together. [...] Steven's band had played 'Train' and Tom and I played it in our band... It's a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back... I always thought <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> play one song, it would be that one because of what it does to me". [...] Perry's band began performing the song regularly after he had been moved by the performance of [...] "Stroll On" [...] in Blowup; Tyler recalled his band opened for the Yardbirds in 1966: ...|$|E
500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> sit on the bench, that's all I care about.'" ...|$|E

500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe {{wrote that}} the song [...] "is totally shameless and {{completely}} effective" [...] as it [...] "derives much of its charm from a hefty sample of Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'". Joanne Dorken of MTV UK {{wrote that the}} sample gives [...] "the tune an instant eighties feel". Najah Goldstein of radio station WNOW-FM wrote that the song is [...] "shows a much softer side of Chris Brown", and further added that it's [...] "definitely a song for the ladies...maybe even for pop star Rihanna." [...] Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the sentiment of the song is refreshingly complex." [...] Hannah Ash of The Harber Herald wrote that on F.A.M.E., [...] "She Ain't You" [...] and [...] "Up to You" [...] are [...] "the perfect sweet and cute love songs". While reviewing the album, Sean Fennessey of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "a more appropriate application appears on 'She Ain’t You', which interpolates Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'. Jackson {{has long been the}} emotional, physical and musical forebear to Brown. But on 'She Ain’t You' he begs the comparison, and it isn’t pretty." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Brown [...] "has a really charmless way with a lyric, as on 'She Ain’t You'—"When I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex / With you I had a bad romance / And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> trade her in I would"—and a voice nowhere near strong enough to make up for it." [...] The song was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, and Top R Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.|$|E

He was frightened. In a moment now all the eyes in the room would be unwinkingly focused on him. He hated this place of crowding, curious young people and drab text-hung walls. In the last row he noted the pew in which Professor Frazer sat (infrequently). He could fancy Frazer there, pale and stern. [...] "I'm glad I spied on 'em.

5000|$|Close Your Eyes is {{the fifth}} studio album by New Zealand singer-song writer Bic Runga. The album {{is made up of}} ten covers and two {{original}} tracks. Upon announcement of the album in October, Runga said: [...] "There are so many songs I've always wanted to cover. I wanted to see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> be a singer-songwriter, but someone who could also interpret songs. In the process, I found there are so many reasons why a cover version wouldn't work, perhaps because the lyrics were not something <b>I</b> <b>could</b> relate to first hand, because technically I wasn't ready or because the original was too iconic. But the songs that all made it on the record specifically say something about where I'm at in my life, better than if I'd written it myself. It was a challenging process, I'm really proud of the singing and the production and the statement".|$|R
