40|$|Objectives The initial step in {{certification}} by the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) requires {{passing a}} multiple-choice-question qualifying <b>examination.</b> The qualifying <b>examination</b> is typically {{taken in the}} first year after residency training. This study was undertaken to determine if a delay in taking the qualifying <b>examination</b> is associated with poorer performance. The authors also examined the relationship between in-training <b>examination</b> scores and qualifying <b>examination</b> scores. Methods This was a pooled time-series cross-section study. Primary measurements were initial qualifying <b>examination</b> scores, the timing of the qualifying <b>examination,</b> and in-training <b>examination</b> scores. The three groups, based on qualifying <b>examination</b> timing, were immediate, 1 -year delay, and ≥ 2 -year delay. In-training <b>examination</b> scores were analyzed to determine the relationship between intrinsic ability, <b>examination</b> timing, and qualifying <b>examination</b> scores. For analysis, a generic pooled ordinary least-squares dummy variable model with robust standard errors was used. A pre hoc level of significance was determined to be α 3 ̆c 0. 01.
