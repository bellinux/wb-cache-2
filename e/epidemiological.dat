5|$|Historical and <b>epidemiological</b> {{data are}} {{inadequate}} {{to identify the}} pandemic's geographic origin. It was implicated in the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{correlative}} <b>epidemiological</b> studies have implicated selenium deficiency (measured by blood levels) {{in a number}} of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. In addition, selenium supplementation {{has been found to be}} a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epidemiological</b> {{studies have}} {{proposed}} relationships between certain modifiable factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors {{can help to}} prevent AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors. Findings of incidence and prevalence in <b>epidemiological</b> studies vary {{based on such}} factors as which grades of severity are included, whether deaths are included, whether the study is restricted to hospitalized people, and the study's location. The annual {{incidence of}} mild TBI {{is difficult to determine}} but may be 100–600 people per 100,000.|$|E
5|$|There is also direct <b>epidemiological</b> {{evidence}} that TCDD is not carcinogenic at low doses, {{and in some}} studies cancer risk has even decreased. This is called a J-shape dose-response, low doses decrease the risk, and only higher doses increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{measures}} {{are used in}} <b>epidemiological</b> studies: incidence and prevalence. Incidence {{is the number of}} new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while prevalence is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epidemiological</b> {{data are}} limited, but {{reactive}} attachment disorder {{appears to be}} very uncommon. The prevalence of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little systematically gathered epidemiologic information on RAD. A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children {{to the age of}} 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When <b>epidemiological</b> studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to cadmium {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from <b>epidemiological</b> studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epidemiological</b> {{practice}} {{and the results of}} <b>epidemiological</b> analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks.|$|E
25|$|However, such {{analyses}} were not designed with <b>epidemiological</b> inference {{in mind and}} {{it may be difficult to}} extrapolate from standard statistics to desired <b>epidemiological</b> quantities.|$|E
25|$|For more {{complicated}} <b>epidemiological</b> models, {{such as those}} involving cross-immunity, age structure of host contact rates, seasonality, or multiple host populations with different life history traits, it is often impossible to analytically predict genealogical patterns from <b>epidemiological</b> parameters.|$|E
25|$|This rate, derived for the SIR model at equilibrium, is {{equivalent}} to the rate of coalescence given by the more general formula provided by Volz et al. Rates of coalescence can similarly be derived for <b>epidemiological</b> models with superspreaders or other transmission heterogeneities, for models with individuals who are exposed but not yet infectious, and for models with variable infectious periods, among others. Given some <b>epidemiological</b> information (such as the duration of infection) and a specification of a mathematical model, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to estimate <b>epidemiological</b> parameters that might otherwise be difficult to quantify.|$|E
25|$|Although many <b>epidemiological</b> {{risk factors}} have been identified, the cause of any {{individual}} breast cancer is most often unknowable. <b>Epidemiological</b> research informs the patterns of breast cancer incidence across certain populations, {{but not in a}} given individual. Approximately 5% of new breast cancers are attributable to hereditary syndromes, and well-established risk factors accounts for approximately 30% of cases.|$|E
