50|$|The {{function}} of the mammalian penis relies {{on the use of}} a hydrostatic skeleton and is known as a hydrostatic organ. The <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>fluid,</b> which in this case is blood, fills the penis during an erection. Unlike the use of hydrostatic skeletons in many invertebrates, which use the bending of the animal for locomotion, the penis must resist bending and shape changes during sexual intercourse. Instead of connective fibers arranged in a helical shape, the penis contains a layer called the corpus cavernosum. The corpus cavernosum contains connective fibers arranged both parallel and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. These fibers remain folded when the penis is flaccid, but unfold as the penis fills with blood during an erection, which allows the penis to resist bending. The penises of turtles are structured similarly, although they evolved separately.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Stratified <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>fluids</b> have linear {{internal}} {{gravity waves}} with different phase speeds and vertical profiles. Here a simplified set of partial differential equations (PDE) is derived {{to represent the}} nonlinear dynamics of waves with different vertical profiles. The equations are derived by projecting the full nonlinear equations onto the vertical modes of two gravity waves, and the resulting equations are thus referred to here as the two-mode shallow water equations (2 MSWE). A key aspect of the nonlinearities of the 2 MSWE is that they allow for interactions between a background wind shear and propagating waves. This {{is important in the}} tropical atmosphere where horizontally propagating gravity waves interact together with wind shear and have source terms due to convection. It is shown here that the 2 MSWE have nonlinear internal bore solutions, and the behavior of the nonlinear waves is investigated for different background wind shears. When a background shear is included, there is an asymmetry between the east- and westward propagating waves. This could be an important effect for the large-scale organization of tropical convection, since the convection is often not isotropic but organized on large scales by waves. An idealized illustration of this asymmetry is given for a background shear from the westerly wind burst phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation; the potential for organized convection is increased {{to the west of the}} existing convection by the propagating nonlinear gravit...|$|R

40|$|Labrum {{pathology}} {{may contribute}} to early joint degeneration through the alteration of load transfer between, and the stresses within, the cartilage layers of the hip. We hypothesize that the labrum seals the hip joint, creating a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>fluid</b> pressure in the intra-articular space, and limiting the rate of cartilage layer consolidation. The overall cartilage creep consolidation of six human hip joints was measured during {{the application of a}} constant load of 0. 75 times bodyweight, or a cyclic sinusoidal load of 0. 75 ± 0. 25 times bodyweight, before and after total labrum resection. The fluid pressure within the acetabular was measured. Following labrum resection, the initial consolidation rate was 22 % greater (p= 0. 02) and the final consolidation displacement was 21 % greater (p= 0. 02). There {{was no significant difference in}} the final consolidation rate. Loading type (constant vs. cyclic) had no significant effect on the measured consolidation behaviour. Fluid pressurisation was observed in three of the six hips. The average pressures measured were: for constant loading, 541 ± 61 kPa in the intact joint and 216 ± 165 kPa following labrum resection, for cyclic loading, 550 ± 56 kPa in the intact joint and 195 ± 145 kPa following labrum resection. The trends observed in this experiment support the predictions of previous finite element analyses. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>fluid</b> pressurisation within the intra-articular space is greater with the labrum than without, which may enhance joint lubrication. Cartilage consolidation is quicker without the labrum than with, as the labrum adds an extra resistance to the flow path for interstitial fluid expression.

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} for the instability of steady mountain waves is found through analysis of the linear stability problem. Steady flow of a <b>hydrostatic</b> stratified <b>fluid</b> {{is known to be}} unstable when the streamlines are at, or very close to, overturning.

The mechanism behind the instability is the parametric amplification of counter-propagating gravity waves. The resonant nature of the instability is further illustrated by the existence of discrete peak-to-peak separation distances where the growth rate is a maximum. 1...|$|R
