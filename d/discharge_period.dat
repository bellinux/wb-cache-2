40|$|Time-series {{observations}} {{were conducted in}} the Dowleiswaram dam reservoir that was constructed on the largest monsoonal river in India to understand the source of inorganic carbon, and fluxes to the atmosphere. The reservoir stores water during dry period of six months and water increases during the period when Indian subcontinent receives signif i cant rainfall. Significant modification of organic matter was noticed during storage period indicated by decrease in pH from 7. 5 to 6. 4 and oxygen saturation from ~ 95 % to 65 %. The relationship of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with oxygen saturation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and isotopic ratios of DIC suggest s that heterotrophic activities are {{the major source of}} inorganic carbon to the reservoir. In addition to this, ground water exchange also contributes significantly to the inorganic carbon pool in the reservoir. Nutrients released due to decomposition of organic matter in the reservoir supports both autotrophic and heterotrophic activities. The pCO 2 levels in the reservoir varied between 3944 and 16, 042 μatm and higher pCO 2 levels were noticed during peak <b>discharge</b> <b>period.</b> The annual mean CO 2 fluxes from the reservoir amounted to 112 ± 126 mmolC m - 2 · d - 1 and ~ 6 times higher fluxes were noticed during <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> compared to dry period and such high fluxes during <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> were contributed by both high pCO 2 levels and winds.

Emitted powers of EUV light and deposited powers to the charged species were simulated by varying the values of four key parameters, which include the driving frequency, gas pressure, gap distance and number of dielectric layers. Results show that there are three distinct periods that include pre-discharge, discharge and post-discharge ones.

Phase change materials (PCMs) commonly suffer from low thermal conductivities, being around 0. 4 W m(- 1) K(- 1) for inorganic salts, which prolong the charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>period.</b> The problem of low thermal conductivity is a major issue {{that needs to be}} addressed for high temperature thermal energy storage systems.

In this paper, the feasibility of using metal foams and expanded graphite to enhance the heat transfer capability of PCMs in high temperature thermal energy storage systems is investigated. The results show that heat transfer can be significantly enhanced by both metal foams and expanded graphite, thereby reducing the charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>period.</b> Furthermore, the overall performance of metal foams is superior to that of expanded graphite.

There isn't any standard definition for difference between normal and abnormal lochia in post-partum period. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the relationship between ultrasonic findings of the postpartum uterus after normal vaginal delivery with the duration of lochia discharge. Methods: In this cross-sectional study was done in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from 2014 to 2015. In this study 160 women with non-complicated vaginal delivery were entered. Inclusion criteria were: Term pregnancy with gestational age >  37, singleton fetus with cephalic presentation. Exclusion criteria were pre-term pregnancies, previous Cesarean section or other uterine surgeries and twin fetuses. Transvaginal ultrasound was done in first 48 hours after delivery, endometrial thickness echogenicity and uterine size was evaluated. Maternal age, parity, duration of labor and neonatal weight were evaluated. Then the mothers were followed for 6 weeks. The quality and the quantity of lochia discharge were asked by the phone. Results: Lochial discharge last more than 6 weeks in 96 out of 160 (60 %). One had less than 4 weeks. The uterus length, thickness, height and endometrial length did not show any relationship with the duration of lochial discharge, but endometrial strip thickness significantly correlated with the duration of lochial <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> (P= 0. 04). None of clinical variables like the number of gravidity, parity, live birth or child birth weight, were correlated to the duration of lochia <b>discharge</b> <b>period,</b> but the labor time was correlated to the duration of lochia <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> (P= 0. 04). Although both endometrial thickness and labor time in univariate analysis were correlated to the lochia duration time but this was true just for endometrial thickness in multivariate analysis.

The right {{cervical}} vagus was cut peripherally to ganglion nodosum in {{the upper}} part of the neck and the peripheral stump was separated untill the afferent nerve fibres originating from the receptor in the gastric wall showed the unitary spike. The stomach was distended with the air-charged balloon. From such fibre preparations, impulses during maintained gastric distension were recorded. In some fibres, burst and pause of discharge recurred periodically. Such type of discharge pattern was described here as periodically intermittent discharge, in which the relation between gastric distension and impulse activity was pursued. Therein, gastric distension was represented by gastric content in terms of volume and impulse activity by the total number of impulses during stomach <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> (sum of the duration of burst and pause of discharge) from following two reasons. Firstly, analysis of discharge pattern showed that, when the degree of stomach distension became higher, the duration of burst of discharge became longer, that of pause shorter, while stomach <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> showed only slight change. Secondly, experiments suggested that, in the fibres in which the response to maintained distension of the stomach was expected to be a slowly adapting discharge, the above-mentioned type of discharge pattern came into existence under the influence of peristaltic movement in and around the site of the receptor. Thus, the relation between the increase of gastric content and that of total number of impulses during stomach <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> was found nearly proportional and two sorts of values, 22. 5 impulses/ 50 cc and 161 impulses/ 50 cc, were regarded as proportional constant...|$|E

In this paper, detailed exergy and energy analyses of shell and tube type latent heat thermal storage system (LHTES) for medium temperature solar thermal power plant (similar to 200 degrees C) are performed to estimate the net useful energy during the charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>period</b> in a cycle. A commercial-grade organic phase change material (PCM) is stored inside the annular space of the shell and the heat transfer fluid (HTF) flows through the tubes. Thermal conductivity enhancer (TCE) {{in the form of}} metal matrix is embedded in PCM to augment heat transfer. A numerical model is developed to investigate the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics using the momentum equation and the two-temperature non-equilibrium energy equation coupled with the enthalpy method to account for phase change in PCM. The effects of storage material, porosity and pore-diameter on the net useful energy that can be stored and released during a cycle, are studied. It is found that the first law efficiency of sensible heat storage system is less compared to LHTES. With the decrease in porosity, the first law and second law efficiencies of LHTES increase for both the charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>period.</b> There is no significant variation in energy and exergy efficiencies with the change in pore-diameter of the metal matrix.
