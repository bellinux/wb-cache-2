500|$|Seward's wife Frances {{was deeply}} {{committed}} to the abolitionist movement. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Seward's frequent travel and political work suggest that it was Frances who played the {{more active role in}} Auburn abolitionist activities. In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William [...] "Jerry" [...] Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, [...] "two fugitives have gone to Canadaâ€”one of them our acquaintance John." [...] Another time she wrote, [...] "A {{man by the name of}} William Johnson will apply to you for assistance to purchase the freedom of his daughter. You will see that I have given him something by his book. I told him <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> give him more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My darling, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{grow up to}} feel as I did; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{thank me}} for leading you to see {{such things as the}} blind world is {{incapable}} of seeing. There I made a mistake; and sorely am I punished for it. Don't visit it upon my head in your recollections when I can no longer defend myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you loved}} me as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> did, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not--you could not-- have thus taken from me my darling little maid. Oh! shame, shame on you, father--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sophy! Sophy!' he cried, hanging round her. 'I wouldn't {{have gone}} without telling <b>you,</b> if <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> mind it. Speak to me, Sophy!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That pleases me {{more than}} my own promotion, sahib. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have had it long ago, after that {{business}} at Nagpore." ...|$|R
60|$|Aha! my {{good little}} dog! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> stand to that game {{when you found}} it.|$|E
60|$|BENNET [drily]. Yes. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be surprised. He {{claims to}} be an old friend of yours--Mr. George Newte.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} a quotation, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> admire {{anything}} Mr. Leavenworth said, Aunt Pen," [...] replied Debby, demurely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; if {{you think}} so we will say nothing more about it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to have him aft with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Patience, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{not have}} her, Goody Grace might for the pay, but then who knows when any more may come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{knew you}} the instant I saw you!' she {{returned}} cheerfully. 'I don't know why, but <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{come back to}} your old town again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why couldn't you do it? You know it all. I {{told you}} because--because--because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be the kindest to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear, dear!' cried Tom, 'what have I done? I {{hoped it}} would be a {{pleasant}} surprise, sir. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose it}} was some scrape of his that took you into Smoke-jack Alley. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> get him out best without me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{considered}} so once,' said Mrs Todgers, warming {{herself in a}} gentlemanly manner at the fire; 'but <b>I</b> hardly <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have known it, my loves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The ought {{is not on}} your side, Felix. It is not all folly, I hope; but <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} a better parson than your father.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS DUBEDAT [turning indignantly on him] I {{see what}} it is. Oh! it is envious, mean, cruel. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be above such a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Kangaroo. 'I {{wish that}} I hadn't. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{do it by}} charms and incantations, {{but this is a}} {{practical}} joke.' ...|$|E
6000|$|ASHER. You {{refuse to}} help me, when I'm {{starting}} {{out on a}} liberal scheme which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{be the first to}} endorse? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to {{hear about}} Phyllis, so, having enjoyed it with Ada, I brought it over for further {{enjoyment}} with you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found your}} younger {{daughter}} charming," [...] Wrayson said seriously, [...] "but {{it was of}} your daughter Louise I was speaking. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> understand that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I?" [...] exclaimed Joan, in {{the voice}} of one unable to believe her ears. [...] "Oh, father, I am {{surprised}} at you; <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say such a thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have read}} the articles, and I knew if <b>you</b> had, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have taken the trouble to inform {{yourself}} of the world's opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay; there's no friend {{like the}} women--their {{interest}} carries all {{in court and}} camp.--Come, you are reasonable now--Ay, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{like to have}} me. And besides, I couldn't {{possibly}} have gone to any one so well fitted to advise me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never come. I {{could not}} bear to wait in the house for you, {{especially}} with this rain and wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} very wrong," [...] she said suddenly, after walking for some time in silence. [...] "You must have worked hard indeed. I own <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> used to {{consider}} your sketches very pretty, but <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come {{to be a great}} artist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{has that}} to do with you?" [...] I cried. [...] "It is a {{pollution}} that you should dare even to think of her. If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> harm her----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Dor. My love, I'll try. [...] [She {{draws the}} chair nearer to the audience. [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> never <b>would</b> have walked again; [...] They {{told me you}} were gone to heaven; [...] Have you been there? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I've {{wanted so}} much to be friends with you again," [...] she sobbed. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never relent--and--and--I've been so lonely--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{is an old}} lady, but of {{the first}} {{distinction}} here. I would not ask this favour of you unless <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be pleased.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, of course, you did {{not give}} one to Ned Long. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never succeed in making him {{remember}} which is the ninth commandment.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I ain't {{dismissed}} at all, {{and there}} needn't be any waiting. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be suffering {{as well as}} me, and so I came right away to you, all at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not going!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{have told}} them that I am at home to no one, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> stay and {{entertain}} me. Sit down again, Wingrave!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, and {{therefore}} I wanted to spare you something of their company. The Duke, whom {{you really do}} like, isn't coming yet. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> too, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have your work to finish off." ...|$|R
