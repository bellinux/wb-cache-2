To investigate the effects of intra-particle diffusion limitations, internal diffusion coefficients for propylene in the MOF catalysts were measured with pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) and were incorporated into the kinetics analysis. Using these coefficients to compute effectiveness factors for heterogeneous catalytic reactions, diffusion-limited artifacts were accounted for to obtain intrinsic rate constants and activation energies from apparent kinetics data.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the metal loading (i. e. interparticle distance) of shape-controlled Pt nanoparticles on their electrocatalytic properties is evaluated for the first time. For this purpose, carbon-supported cubic Pt nanoparticles (~ 17 nm) with different <b>metal</b> <b>loadings</b> were prepared, characterized and electrochemically tested. To avoid differences in particle size and shape/surface structure of the Pt nanoparticles between samples, all samples used in this work were prepared from a single batch. The surface structure of the Pt nanoparticles was evaluated through the so-called hydrogen region and showed a preferential (100) orientation. Interestingly, the electroactive surface area of the samples, estimated both from the H or CO stripping processes, was directly proportional to the total Pt mass, independently of the metal loading. The CO stripping profile was also found to be unaffected by the metal loading. However, for ammonia and formic acid electrooxidation, the activity obtained was dependent on the metal loading. For ammonia oxidation, the optimal loading {{was found to be}} about 20 – 30 wt%. Nevertheless, this trend may be altered by different factors including (i) active surface area, (ii) metal loading and (ii) thickness of the catalytic layer.

These alternatives ranged from removal of adit and point source discharges to modification of the water supply scheme to provide higher in-stream flows.

Although standards exceedances are common throughout the watershed, model-ing results indicated that removal of point sources, mine waste near watercourses, and streambed sediment can help improve water quality. Alteration of the water supply scheme and increasing baseflow will also ultimately be required to meet standards for all metals. The model also showed that although adits and point sources contribute significant <b>metals</b> <b>loadings</b> to the stream during baseflow, in some areas shallow groundwater and bed sediment can also be sources of metals.
