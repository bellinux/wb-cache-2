The Aces drew first blood by taking game 1 but fell behind with a 1–2 series deficit after newly crowned Best Player of the Conference Mark Cardona scoring big. Newly crowned MVP candidate Willie Miller erupted for 29 points to tie the series. Cardona then <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> when he top-scored all locals on Game 5.|$|E

2500|$|Other sources {{indicate}} {{the replacement of}} Detroit's large electric streetcar network with buses & highways was much more controversial. [...] In 1930, Detroit had 30 electric streetcar lines over 534 miles of track. [...] In 1941, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds at peak times. Wartime restrictions on vital war materials such as rubber and gasoline caused particularly heavy use of the streetcar system during the 1940s. [...] However, {{between the end of}} the war and 1949, the city discontinued half of its 20 streetcar lines. Five more were discontinued in 1951 — three of them switched abruptly to bus lines during a DSR strike. More closings followed until August 1955, when Mayor Albert Cobo, who promoted freeway construction as the way of the future, urged City Council to sell the city's recently purchased fleet of modern streetcars to Mexico City. [...] It was a controversial move. A newspaper poll showed that Detroiters, by a margin of 3-to-1, opposed the switch to buses. Some even jeered the sunken freeways Cobo championed, dubbing them [...] "Cobo canals." [...] "A lot of people were against the decision... A common complaint was about the sale of the [...] cars, that the city didn't get its money's worth. Of course, the city <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> for anything. ..." [...] On April 8, 1956, the last streetcar in Detroit rolled down Woodward Avenue. After less than 10 years in service, Detroit's fleet of streamlined streetcars was loaded on railcars and shipped to Mexico City, where they ran for another 30 years.|$|E
