His other roles were determining fishing grounds based on fishing gear, permitting outsiders fishermen to fish within their territory, locating landing sites and boat mooring as well as settling and resolving disputes and conflicts arising from fishing and sharing of the catch. Lately, upon creation of government fisheries offices in district level, Panglima Laôt became merely ‘customary police’. He was only responsible in resolving conflicts among fishermen; however, the custom occupied wide aspects of conflicts, varied from catch sharing to fishnet thievery. He is not authorised to officially make a verdict, although he can practically impose penalty, confiscate fish catch, pass the compensation and prohibit the fishing activity. It makes custom enforcement weak by the law. Consequently, he needs to coordinate with the Geuchik (village head) and Imum Mukim (sub district head) in resolving disputes and conflicts since his authority may superimpose the authority of gampong (village) or mukim (sub district).|$|E

Ecotourism also presents challenges: while it raises money and awareness for the animals, by its nature it also increases human effect on the species, both through associated development and direct disturbances in the field. A number of restrictions on land use and human intrusion are required to properly maintain wild populations. Schenck et al., who undertook extensive fieldwork in Peru in the 1990s, suggest specific [...] "no-go" [...] zones where the species is most frequently observed, offset by observation towers and platforms to allow viewing.

40|$|December 15 - 17, 2007 Royal Phuket City Hotel, Phuket, ThailandThis review {{provides}} information on the incidental catch of sea turtles in fishing activities in Indonesian waters. There are a few works related to the interaction between sea turtles and fisheries that were done in 2005 to 2006. The data and information available concerns the status of catching of sea turtles as by-catch in tuna longline and shrimp trawl fisheries. Based on the data gathered through an interview approach and observation on board of commercial fishing fleets, it is shown {{that a number of}} sea turtles are caught by these fisheries activities. Finally, almost all turtles caught are finally released back directly to the sea by the fishermen for some reasons such as protection by law, non target <b>fishing,</b> <b>prohibition,</b> and pity. Due to some weaknesses and limitations of previous work, it is necessary to determine a comprehensive program related to the conservation of sea turtles and diminution of the incidental catch of sea turtles by fishing activities...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{scuba diving}} censuses {{were used to}} assess the effects of <b>fishing</b> <b>prohibition</b> on {{abundance}} and size structure of littoral fish populations by comparing the same benthic communities inside and outside the protected area of Medes Islands (NE Catalonia, Spain). The total number of species found was 43 in the reserve and 44 outside, but the mean value of species richness per sampling station was significantly higher in the protected area. However, diversity, heavily affected by {{the presence or absence of}} large schools of pelagic species, showed no significant differences between sites. The prohibition of fishing for 6 years is the first factor affecting the qualitative and quantitative structure of fish populations ('reserve effect'), and depth is the second factor. Thus, except in the cases of Serranus cabrilla and Mullus surmuletus, all other vulnerable species are highly sensitive to the protection measures. The size structure of all vulnerable species was found to be absolutely different at the reserve sites than in the unprotected zones, and the modal size classes of size frequency distributions were always higher in the reserve than outside. The reserve effect was significantly responsible of the differences observed in this change on size structure. Some highly vulnerable species, such as Epinephelus guaza and Sciaena umbra, have only been found in the protected area. Others, such as Sparus aurata, Diplodus cervinus and Dicentrarchus labrax, were much more frequent inside the reserve...|$|E
40|$|The {{sailfish}} {{fisheries chart}} {{is a tool}} to determine the concentration areas and movement patterns of schools that are incidentally caught during migration for reproduction by boats that target mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) and tunas (Thunnus atlanticus and T. albacares). There are 350 boats regularly operating in that studied area of the Brazilian coast. That information is based on logbooks and is related to four migratory cycles observed from 2002 to 2006. A model developed by COPPE/UFRJ was used for making the fisheries chart. The use of that chart, as {{a new source of}} information in this research, identified concentration areas and movement patterns of sailfish schools, contributing to the formulation of sustainability system of the stock that are in heavy decline. Two areas were identified, from 180 o to 220 o off Ilha de Cabo Frio and 100 -m deep isoline. The concentrations were first found 10 miles off the coast. The incidental sailfish catches in tuna fisheries are concentrated in the same area at 90 o, beginning at 70 miles off the coast, near the local oil platforms. Due to the observed spawning of the species in the studied period and local, we suggest a sailfish <b>fishing</b> <b>prohibition</b> from December to January, between 180 o and 220 o off Ilha de Cabo Frio, from 10 to 30 miles off the coast.

40|$|A {{response}} {{to each of}} the review’s terms of reference is provided below. Provided here are general comments pertinent to all terms of reference. The overall approach to discard estimation was designed-based as opposed to modelbased. The former makes no attempt to explain discarding as a function of influential factors whereas the latter does. Discarding is a function of processes related to the stock (e. g. local concentration, population age/size structure), fishing operations (e. g. gear mesh) and management (e. g. small <b>fish</b> <b>prohibitions).</b> Ideally, {{it would be useful to}} develop a discard estimation model which describes the key processes and in doing so provides the capability to project discard rates in sampling strata where data are sparse. During the review meeting, it was noted that the initiation of fleet sector management in 2010 will introduce considerable uncertainty into how discard practices may change. Thus, at least in the short term, a designbased approach is warranted. It may be possible to explore modeling of the discard process as the database under sector management accumulates. Certainly, the results of the current analyses could be used as Bayesian priors in these modeling efforts. As a number of the papers noted, catch is equal to landings plus discards, the latte...|$|R

The current study describes the results of analyses of 20 year monitoring data from two interconnected Anatolian lakes, Lakes Mogan and Eymir, receiving sewage effluents and undergoing restoration. The first step of restoration in both lakes was sewage effluent diversion. Additionally, in hypertrophic Lake Eymir, biomanipulation was conducted, involving removal of benthi-planktivorous <b>fish</b> and <b>prohibition</b> of pike <b>fishing.</b> The monitoring period included high (H) and low (L) water levels (WL) enabling elucidation of the effects of hydrological changes on lake restoration. In shallower Lake Mogan, macrophyte abundance increased after the sewage effluent diversion in periods with low water levels even at turbid water. In comparatively deeper Lake Eymir, the first biomanipulation led to a clear water state with abundant macrophyte coverage. However, shortly after biomanipulation, the water clarity declined, coinciding with low water level (LWL) periods during which nutrient concentrations increased. A second biomanipulation was conducted, mostly during high water level (HWL) period, resulting in a major decrease in nutrient concentrations and clearer water, but without an expansion of macrophytes. We conclude that repetitive fish removal may induce recovery but its success may be confounded by high availability of nutrients and adverse hydrological conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{centralised}} fisheries management systems {{to prevent the}} overexploitation of coral reef resources has led many scholars and conservation practitioners to promote the use of customary marine tenure (CMT) as an alternative devolved means of fisheries management. The effectiveness of CMT for fisheries management is debated; some scholars argue that CMT is embedded within particular historical, socio-economic and political contexts and that unless it evolves to changing circumstances, its effectiveness for fisheries management will wane under external influences and changing exploitation patterns. Each CMT regime is unique; hence its response to changing circumstances may vary. A {{better understanding of the}} circumstances under which a CMT regime is likely to succeed is important {{if it is to be}} effectively used for fisheries management. This research is posited on the DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) model and employs multidisciplinary methods to investigate the effectiveness of CMT for reef finfish fisheries management. The aims of this thesis are: (1) To investigate the role of markets and subsistence as driving factors for fishing; (2) To investigate fisher spatial allocation of fishing, methods and target taxa (as proxies for pressure and impact); (3) contribute to the biological knowledge of a prominent vulnerable species (Plectropomus leopardus) by investigating aspects of its demography and reproduction (as a proxy for state); and (4) Investigate relationships between the Nggela CMT governance system and modern governance system (as a proxy for response), to improve understanding of how this knowledge may be applied to enhance small-scale fisheries management. The role of markets and subsistence as driving (D) factors for fishing was investigated using the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA). Ninety three (43 from the western zone and 50 from the eastern zone) household surveys were conducted in 10 (5 from the eastern zone and 5 from the western zone) randomly selected villages in Nggela to determine the contribution of different livelihood activities to fisher livelihoods. The reason for comparing the eastern and western zone was to determine the role of available natural land capital as one contributing factor (besides markets) to fishing drivers. Quantitative data generated from the household surveys were analysed using the statistical package SPSS. Additional key informant interviews to generate qualitative data to support the quantitative data were also conducted. Spatial allocation of fishing and target taxa was investigated using household surveys (the same household survey mentioned above but with questions to address the issue of spatial allocation and fishing methods used), participative fishing with fishers to confirm spatial allocation of fishing and fishing methods employed and recording of landings data to determine the types of fish taxa targeted. One of the initial aims of studies on P. leopardus was to compare the age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus between CMT areas and offshore sub-tidal areas, the hypothesis being that if CMT was effective agebased demographic parameters would reveal the non vulnerability of P. leopardus in CMT areas. Such a comparison was not possible as only 4 specimens were obtained from inshore CMT areas compared to 116 specimens from offshore sub-tidal reefs. To determine the age-based demographic parameters of Plectropomus leopardus, fish total lengths (mm) and otoliths of fish were collected in the field, this was followed by otolith annuli counts of ages (tagged to a particular fish of certain total length) at the laboratory. A von Bertalanffy growth curve was then fitted to the fish total length data and to the age data to determine asymptotic length, Brody growth coefficient and theoretical age at length zero. Total mortality rate was determined by generating catch curves where the frequency of fish in each age class was regressed against age. Longevity was determined by calculating the mean age of 10 % of the oldest individuals. Demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were also compared to those of Australian locations to determine variations in age-based demography. Data analysis of P. leopardus data was done using the statistical software R and Microsoft Excel 2003. Reproductive aspects of P. leopardus were determined from the fish gonads collected from the field. Fish gonads were used to determine different sexual reproductive stages. Data on the different sexual reproductive stages was used to determine sexual maturity and sex change. The relationship between CMT governance and modern governance and how they may be combined for an effective reef finfish fisheries management was investigated using literature research, key informant interviews and dynamite fisher interviews. Investigations of livelihoods show that Nggela fishers were engaged in more than one livelihood activity for their livelihoods. Subsistence gardening was the most important livelihood activity. While finfish was important for subsistence purposes, accessible markets and the role of middlemen in the villages made it especially important for income generation. A comparison of the role of fishing between eastern and western zone showed that available natural land capital was also an important driver for fishing; fishing was higher in the western zone where there was a narrow natural land capital. Fisher perceptions indicate a declining trend in fisheries resource abundances within CMT areas; such decline has resulted in changes in the spatial allocation of fishing with a shift in fishing to offshore sub tidal reefs. Although some spatial closures were observed, fishing within the CMT areas is flexible. Three MPA’s currently existed in West Nggela and <b>fishing</b> <b>prohibitions</b> within the areas were observed mainly because people thought that the MPA’s were underscored by the government. Line fishing from dugout canoes remains the main method of fishing. Median trophic level of fish catch was between 2 - 3. 84 while median standard length of catch was between 19 - 24 cm. Age-based demographic studies show that the Brody growth coefficient of Nggela P. leopardus was 0. 13 yr- 1, longevity was 12. 9 years, maximum age was 15 years and mortality rate was 0. 22 % yr- 1. Female sexual maturity of Nggela P. leopardus began at 2 years of age with 50 % sexual maturity achieved at 3. 22 years. Sexual transition from female to male began at 3 - 10 years of age with 50 % sex change achieved at 11 years. Mature female to male ratio was 3 : 1. The age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were similar to those in Swain and Lizard Island in Australia. For Swain reef, growth coefficient was 0. 17 yr- 1, longevity was 10. 1 years, maximum age was 14 years and mortality rate was 0. 39 % yr- 1. For Lizard Island, growth coefficient was 0. 26 yr- 1, longevity was 7. 2 years, maximum age was 10 years and mortality rate was 0. 59 % yr- 1. Age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were different to locations in Western Australia – Scott and Abrolhos reefs. For Scott reef, growth coefficient was 0. 42 yr- 1, longevity was 6. 4 years, mortality rate was 0. 30 % yr- 1 while the maximum age was 8 years. For Abrohlos reef growth coefficient was 0. 08 yr- 1, longevity was 13 years, mortality rate was 0. 24 % yr- 1 and maximum age was 18 years. Sea temperature may be one contributing factor to regional variations in age-based demographic parameters. The current CMT governance system has undergone changes which has rendered it ineffective as a coercive force for reef finfish fisheries management. While CMT is recognised by the modern governance system through National legislations, necessary ordinances at the provincial level are absent which prevent the effective use of CMT for fisheries management. For CMT to be effective it requires empowerment at the provincial government level.
