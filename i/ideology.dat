5|$|Most generally, State Shinto {{refers to}} any use of Shinto {{practices}} {{incorporated into the}} national <b>ideology</b> during the Meiji period starting in 1868.

5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare.

The liberal <b>ideology</b> has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant <b>ideology.</b> Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E

40|$|Ethnic {{minorities}} are adopting a bicultural identity to simultaneously identify with their heritage culture and mainstream American culture. While much research has investigated {{the extent to}} which ethnic majority and minority groups differentially respond to cultural <b>ideologies,</b> bicultural reactions to cultural <b>ideologies</b> remain uninvestigated. Bicultural individuals 2 ̆ 7 differential endorsement of cultural <b>ideologies</b> has critical implications for implementation of assimilation and multiculturalism in multicultural societies. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to test {{the extent to which}} the salience of cultural identity predicts bicultural individuals 2 ̆ 7 endorsement of assimilation and multicultural <b>ideologies.</b> Identity saliency was manipulated for bicultural Latino Americans and endorsement of assimilation and multiculturalism was measured. It was predicted that Latino Americans would show greater support for multicultural <b>ideologies</b> after their Latino identity was made salient and greater support for assimilation <b>ideologies</b> after their mainstream American identity was made salient. Bicultural identity integration was included as an exploratory variable to determine the extent to which cultural conflict and cultural distance predict endorsement of cultural <b>ideologies.</b> The prediction that multicultural <b>ideologies</b> would be endorsed when a Latino identity was made salient was supported. The prediction that assimilation <b>ideologies</b> would be endorsed when a mainstream American identity was made salient, however, was not supported. The implications of cultural identity saliency for endorsement of cultural <b>ideologies</b> are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Discourse {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the methods of identifying <b>ideologies</b> reflected in text as well as the communication strategies used to convey those <b>ideologies</b> effectively to the addressed audience. Political business speeches defined as ‘a relatively autonomous discourse produced orally by a politician {{in front of an audience}} with the main purpose of persuading the audience into accepting a business proposition’ can be a good source to understand (a) the dominant business <b>ideologies</b> in a country, and (b) the reasons of success or failure of a political leader in conveying his/her business <b>ideologies</b> and/or justifying his/her business proposition. Hence, this article was aimed to identify Dr. Mahathir’s <b>ideologies</b> on Asia-Europe business relationships as well as the communication strategies he used to convey his <b>ideologies</b> to the audience. Analyzing one of Dr. Mahathir’s speeches delivered at an international business summit in the year 2000 revealed some of his <b>ideologies</b> with regard to Euro-Asia business relationships as well as the communication strategies he used to convey these <b>ideologies</b> to the audience. In this speech, Dr. Mahathir strongly believes in ‘equal power in Euro-Asia relationships’ as well as ‘unity and solidarity among Asian countries’ as the two main <b>ideologies</b> in this speech; and he tries to convey these <b>ideologies</b> by ‘referring to the bitter history of Euro-Asia relationships’ as well as ‘using pronouns’ as the two salient strategies used in this speech...|$|R
30|$|Ideas are {{transformed}} into sets of ideas or ideological patterns through a choice-making process, which is continuous and dynamic in its nature. <b>Ideologies</b> may thus be situated on a continuum, ranging from weak to strong ideas, from sets {{proposed by the}} institutional or governmental body to fundamentalist <b>ideologies</b> 6. Even though <b>ideologies</b> are usually labelled as political, various other types may be distinguished as well, such as epistemological, ethical or social <b>ideologies.</b> This study, however, wishes to primarily interpret the notion in its epistemological sense: as a more dominant group representing {{the world in a}} certain way, urging the audience to accept this truth as an inevitable reality, in addition to a more sociological view that sees <b>ideologies</b> as permeating various layers of social life. According to Althusser (1984), <b>ideologies</b> are produced by social practices. Bourdieu (1992) construes <b>ideologies</b> as vehicles of symbolic power and domination, thereby favouring a more concrete, behavioural response over intellectual thought, since <b>ideologies</b> do not only embody ideas but also attitudes – or rather – ideological stances, such as racism.|$|R

The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The <b>Ideology</b> has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to explore how consumers experience nature through consumption. The background of the current study is in unsustainable consumption of antifouling paints in leisure time boats. Therefore, the context of the research is studying sailors' experiences mainly at the Baltic Sea. It studies how nature <b>ideologies</b> influence sailors thought, speech and action and the relationships between the <b>ideologies</b> rising from sailor's experiences. The study also explores the meanings behind sailing consumption to find opportunities for sustainable consumption. The research lies under Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) concept addressing socio-cultural, experiential, symbolic and ideological consumption. Methodology: The research is interpretative and qualitative in nature. Six well-experienced Finnish sailors were interviewed. The interview transcriptions form the empirical data of the study. Interviews, analysis and interpretation followed the existential-phenomenological research approach and method. Key findings: The key findings of the study discover that multiple <b>ideologies</b> of nature influence sailing experiences simultaneously. These <b>ideologies</b> follow previously found Romantic and Gnostic <b>ideologies</b> but the findings show them to be too extreme creating a need for idealized solutions of Survival and Liberating <b>ideologies.</b> The study frames the multiple nature <b>ideologies</b> into a Semiotic Square of nature <b>ideologies</b> framework, which illustrates the contradictions between the <b>ideologies</b> and forms an interrelated synthesis between them. The findings also describe how sailing as a loved activity allows sailors to have advantages of the contradictive <b>ideologies</b> and bring synthesizing solution. This research finds that meanings behind sailing consumption stem from sailors' identity work and are driven by nature. Thus, the findings emphasize that marketers attempting to influence consumers' unsustainable consumption should focus not only on viewing nature as a single pure nature but studying the <b>ideologies</b> behind consumption and extending the view into a broader dynamic ideological model...|$|R
40|$|This article sets controversies {{surrounding}} Anti-Oppressive Practice (AOP) theorisations in British {{social work}} debates {{in an international}} welfare regime framework. The article suggests that those authors {{on both sides of}} the pro and anti perspectives have consistently shared an empirical agenda to establish and respond to the perspectives of social service users for public policy debates concerning social work reforms. However, rather than dodging the ideological controversies surrounding AOP, the article adopts an international comparative framework to contrast and compare how social work practice <b>ideologies</b> are shaped and influenced by welfare state <b>ideologies.</b> Specifically the article illustrates that in liberal welfare regimes such as Great Britain and Ireland, professional social work practice identities and <b>ideologies</b> have developed in a context of residual selective welfare <b>ideologies</b> and asymmetrically from social care work and training.   On the other hand in universal welfare regimes such as Norway and Sweden professional social work practice identities and <b>ideologies</b> have traditionally been embedded or closely allied to social care practices identities and <b>ideologies.</b> We contend that it is in the interfacing of welfare regime <b>ideologies</b> and social work/social care practice <b>ideologies</b> that in our view the breadth and possibilities of AOP can only be located...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} two interethnic <b>ideologies</b> (assimilation and multiculturalism) on in-group favoritism and discrimination intention toward immigrants. Specifically, this study aims to test the concomitant impact of these two <b>ideologies</b> on intergroup biases in order to affirm whether these two paths are related to intergroup bias. Moreover, this study is designed to extend previous work that found relationships between interethnic <b>ideologies</b> and in-group favoritism to discrimination intention. Graduate students in management programs (N = 182) answered a questionnaire. The findings show that both interethnic <b>ideologies</b> are concomitantly related to in-group favoritism. In particular, while assimilation is positively related to in-group favoritism, multiculturalism is negatively related to in-group favoritism. Additionally, it shows evidence of indirect relationships between interethnic <b>ideologies</b> and the discrimination intention through in-group favoritism. The results are discussed in light of interethnic <b>ideologies</b> literature and presents directions for future research...|$|R

5000|$|Social {{dominance}} theory (SDT) is {{a theory}} of intergroup relations {{that focuses on the}} maintenance and stability of group-based social hierarchies. [...] According to the theory, group-based inequalities are maintained through three primary intergroup behaviors—specifically institutional discrimination, aggregated individual discrimination, and behavioral asymmetry. SDT proposes that widely shared cultural <b>ideologies</b> (i.e., legitimizing myths) provide the moral and intellectual justification for these intergroup behaviors. There are two functional types of legitimizing myths: (1) hierarchy-enhancing and (2) hierarchy-attenuating legitimizing myths. Hierarchy-enhancing <b>ideologies</b> (e.g., racism or meritocracy) contribute to greater levels of group-based inequality. Hierarchy-attenuating <b>ideologies</b> (e.g., anarchism and feminism) contribute to greater levels of group-based equality. People endorse these different forms of <b>ideologies</b> based in part on their psychological orientation toward dominance and their desire for unequal group relations (i.e., their social dominance orientation; SDO). People who are higher on SDO tend to endorse hierarchy-enhancing <b>ideologies,</b> and people who are lower on SDO tend to endorse hierarchy-attenuating <b>ideologies.</b> SDT finally proposes that the relative counterbalancing of hierarchy-enhancing and -attenuating social forces stabilizes group-based inequality.|$|R
