While the 75th Congress had in excess of 300Democrats, many of them were conservative, and Voorhis emerged as a leader of a progressive caucus of some 50 representatives. Voorhis advocated the purchase by the Federal Government of the stock in the Federal Reserve Banks, which was held by the member banks, as a way of financing <b>government</b> <b>expenditures</b> and briefly got President Roosevelt to support the measure until the President's advisers caused Roosevelt to change his mind. Voorhis later allied with future House Banking Committee chairman Wright Patman to force Federal Reserve Banks to pay most of the interest they earned on federal securities to the U.S. Government, rather than to the bank stockholders.|$|E

5|$|Jaffna kingdom {{was less}} feudalized than other kingdoms in Sri Lanka, such as Kotte and Kandy. Its economy {{was based on}} more money {{transactions}} than transactions on land or its produce. The Jaffna defense forces were not feudal levies; soldiers in the kings service were paid in cash. The king’s officials, namely Mudaliayars, were also paid in cash and the numerous Hindu temples seem not to have owned extensive properties, unlike the Buddhist establishments in the South. Temples and the administrators depended on the king and the worshippers for their upkeep. Royal and Army officials were thus a salaried class and these three institutions consumed over 60% of the revenues of the kingdom and 85% of the <b>government</b> <b>expenditures.</b> Much of the kingdom's revenues also came from cash except the Elephants from the Vanni feudatories.

Central Java consist of 35 Regency/City for periods {{research}} (2004 - 2007) have structure of <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> which inclined increase {{for each year}} but it was notfollowed with increasing of economic growth during its periods. Economic growth in that periods inclined in fluctuation. Based on the theory, increasing of <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> will increase the regional income. Regional income or GDRP creates economic growth. According to endogenous growth theory, economic growth depended on <b>government</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The purpose of this research are to asses empirically the effect of <b>government</b> <b>expenditure</b> in public sector on economic growth in 35 Regency/City during 2004 - 2007.
