5|$|After {{graduating from}} Barringer, Berg {{enrolled}} in New York University. He spent two semesters there and played baseball and basketball. In 1919 {{he transferred to}} Princeton University and never again mentioned that he had attended NYU for a year, presenting himself exclusively as a Princeton man. Berg received a B.A., magna cum laude in modern languages. He had studied seven languages: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German and Sanskrit, studying with the philologist Harold H. Bender. His Jewish heritage and modest finances combined to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the fringes of Princeton society, where he never quite fit in.|$|E
5|$|Because Koufax's {{signing bonus}} {{was greater than}} $4,000 ($ today), {{he was known as}} a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the major league roster {{for at least two years}} before he could be sent to the minors. To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger {{pitching}} staff.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was hired}} as a player-coach by Brian Talbot at West Bromwich Albion in February 1989. He spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1988–89 season at The Hawthorns {{managing}} and playing for the reserve team, before being promoted to first team coach in the summer, in a move that saw former first team coach Stuart Pearson demoted to reserve team coaching. Allardyce and Talbot were sacked in January 1991 following a defeat to Isthmian League side Woking in the FA Cup. He later worked as a part-time coach at Bury, but manager Mike Walsh could not afford to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the staff for the 1989–90 season.|$|E

50|$|Zanzibar overplays {{the role}} of a pirate, raiding {{waterways}} aboard his air skiff, and even speaking with an excess of bluster. Zartan <b>keeps</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> retainer, mostly to <b>keep</b> an eye <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> Many of the Dreadnoks also suspect that his eyepatch is simply for show.|$|R
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Levesque's {{role as an}} Executive Senior Advisor {{was officially}} formalized as he was given an office at WWE {{headquarters}} in Stamford, Connecticut. Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011. In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within {{the company has been}} under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view {{it as a way to}} <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> top on-screen and to give him more television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E

Buck eventually transfers Sam to the Tigers, the league's worst team.|$|R
5|$|Pugh {{started his}} career with First Division club Burnley where, at a young age, he started as a Centre of Excellence player, and {{gradually}} {{worked his way up}} through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003. As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record, which led to him being named on the bench for two first-team matches in the League Cup, they decided to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> for a third year. As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club's reserve and youth team. This led to him to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football. He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th-minute substitute in a 3–1 defeat to Stevenage Borough. He converted a Simon Heslop cross during a match against Dagenham & Redbridge to score his first career goal, which helped Kidderminster to a 3–1 victory. Also, during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel, then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score; this move was featured on Soccer AMs showboating section.|$|E
25|$|James {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with Championship side Bristol City on 30 July 2010, with the option of a second year.

Often I was forced to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> for lengthy spells because this was necessary for the team's success.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{his effort}} to name a Cabinet which {{included}} all elements of Indonesian politics, Wahid included Wiranto in the Cabinet as Coordinating Minister of Politics and Security. Wiranto was only in his position for three months when in January 2000, Wahid called for Wiranto to step down from his position on an overseas trip to Europe. It appeared as if the President saw Wiranto {{as an obstacle to}} his plan to reform the military and that he took the human rights abuses allegations seriously. Wiranto waited until Wahid returned before meeting with the President to argue his case. Wiranto seemed to have succeeded when Wahid decided to continue to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> but changed his mind during the same day and Wiranto was removed from the Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Wozniak competed on Season 8 of Dancing {{with the}} Stars in 2009 where he danced with Karina Smirnoff. Despite Wozniak and Smirnoff {{receiving}} 10 combined points {{from the three}} judges out of 30, the lowest score of the evening, he remained in the competition. He later posted on a social networking site that {{he felt that the}} vote count was not legitimate and suggested that the Dancing with the Stars judges had lied about the vote count to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the show. After being briefed on the method of judging and vote counting, he retracted and apologized for his statements. Despite suffering a pulled hamstring and a fracture in his foot, Wozniak continued to compete, but was eliminated from the competition on March 31, with a score of 12 out of 30 for an Argentine Tango.|$|E

25|$|Preston Burke is {{the former}} chief cardiothoracic surgeon at Seattle Grace Hospital. He {{completed}} his pre-medical studies at Tulane University where he pledged Kappa Alpha Psi, {{and went on to}} graduate first in his class from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. While in college, he met Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who graduated in second place after him, beginning a rivalry between them. He was once the interim chief of surgery while Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) was healing from his brain surgery. In season 1 it is revealed that Richard had promised him the position but instead enticed his former student, renowned neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), to Seattle as he felt Burke was becoming arrogant and needed competition to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> his toes. He began a relationship with intern Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) but broke it off because he feared it would ruin both of their reputations. Her miscarriage brought them back together. He and Cristina lived together in his perfectly kept apartment.|$|E
25|$|At the 2002 Winter Olympics, {{having been}} {{selected}} by Gretzky to captain the roster, Lemieux led the Canadian men's team into Salt Lake City, United States. The team {{had failed to}} win a {{gold medal at the}} Olympics in fifty years but were still considered favourites to win. Lemieux was second to Joe Sakic in team scoring with six points in five games, and led the team to gold by defeating the United States 5-2 in the final game. Lemieux showcased his amazing hockey intelligence during the gold medal game against the United States. With Team Canada trailing 1-0 in the first period, Lemieux made {{one of the most famous}} and savvy plays in Olympic hockey history. After a cross-ice pass from Lemieux in the neutral zone, Canadian defenceman Chris Pronger carried the puck across the blue line into the American zone, and fired a pass across the zone. Lemieux then faked like he was receiving the pass and proceeded to take a shot at the net, all while letting the puck slide through his legs, knowing he had forward Paul Kariya streaking behind him. Lemieux's fake caused American goalie Mike Richter to lunge in Lemieux's direction, and thus created a wide open net for Kariya to fire the puck in, as he received the pass from Pronger after Lemieux let it go to Kariya. During the tournament, his hip injury required several painkilling injections to <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the ice, and he only played one more NHL game after the Olympics before being lost for the season.|$|E

Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer took over the lead when Jani made a scheduled pit stop. Lotterer and Lieb battled for the position until the former made a pit stop that saw Tréluyer assume his driving duties.
