5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} radical {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E

5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E

5|$|In the 10th century AD, Georgia for {{the first}} time emerged as an ethnic concept in the territories where the Georgian {{language}} was used to perform Christian rituals.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} whether microbial <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> the amniotic cavity affects maternal plasma or placental immunoreactive corticotrophin releasing factor (ir-CRF) concentrations in pregnant women with pre-term or term labour.

5|$|Under Napoleon, a new {{emphasis}} towards the destruction, not just outmanoeuvring, of enemy armies emerged. <b>Invasions</b> <b>of</b> enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant {{more than the}} loss of isolated enclaves. Near-Carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts, intensifying the Revolutionary phenomenon of total war.|$|E
5|$|Both the British and Spanish {{settlements}} coexisted in {{the archipelago}} until 1774, when Britain's new economic and strategic considerations led it to voluntarily {{withdraw from the}} islands, leaving a plaque claiming the Falklands for King George III. Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata became the only governmental presence in the territory. West Falkland was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp. Amid the British <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> the Río de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{and other}} nearby cities faced the British <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. In {{the absence of}} {{reinforcements}} from Spain, viceroy Santiago de Liniers arranged that everyone in Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms should join the resistance against the second invasion. Larrea established the Legion of Catalan Volunteers with Jaime Nadal y Guarda, Jaime Lavallol and José Olaguer Reynals. Larrea was appointed captain of this military unit. The defense was successful, and the British were driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E

Kesselring conducted an uncompromising defensive campaign against the Allied forces in Italy until he was injured in an accident in October 1944. In the final campaign of the war, {{he commanded}} German forces on the Western Front. He won the respect of his Allied opponents for his military accomplishments, but his record was marred by massacres committed by troops under his command in Italy.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, {{traders and}} Jesuit missionaries from Portugal reached Japan {{for the first}} time, {{initiating}} direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. This allowed Oda Nobunaga to obtain European technology and firearms, which he used to conquer many other daimyōs. His consolidation of power began what {{was known as the}} Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603). After Nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Korea in 1592 and 1597.|$|E

The Tatar <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> 1448, 1451, 1509 and 1528, as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533, caused damage to both the castle and the city but all of these invasions were successfully repelled.|$|E
25|$|Imperialism, {{colonialism}} and irredentism {{played an important}} role in the foreign policy of Fascist Italy. Among the regime's goals were the acquisition of territory considered historically Italian in France (e.g. Nice) and Yugoslavia (e.g. Dalmatia), the expansion of Italy's sphere of influence into the Balkans (e.g. Greece) and the acquisition of more colonies in Africa. The pacification of Libya (1923–32), the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Ethiopia (1935–36), the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Albania (1939), the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> France (1940), the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Greece (1940–41) and the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia (1941) were all undertaken in part to add to Italy's national space.|$|R

In 1945, she transferred to the Pacific, and bombarded Japanese positions during the <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Iwo Jima and Okinawa. After {{the end of the}} war, she ferried troops back to the United States as part of Operation Magic Carpet.

5|$|For {{his travels}} from 1253 to 1255, the Franciscan monk William of Rubruck {{reported}} numerous Europeans in Central Asia. He described German prisoners {{who had been}} enslaved and forced to mine gold and manufacture iron weapons in the Mongol town of Bolat, near Talas, Kyrgyzstan. In Karakorum, the Mongol capital, he met a Parisian named Guillaume de Buchier, and Pâquette, a woman from the French city of Metz, who had both been captured in Hungary during the Mongol <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> Europe.

5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill.
