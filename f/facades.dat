40|$|A fully glazed <b>facade</b> is a <b>facade</b> which {{provides}} maximal advantages for buildings concerning daylight and view. Daylight reduces the energy use for lighting; view provides comfort {{and gives the}} possibility to experience the surroundings of the building. The possibility of providing solar entrance into the building has big influence on the reduction of energy consumption for heating in winter period. Applying a fully glazed <b>façade</b> requires necessary measures to control solar entrance in the building. Unwanted solar radiation results in a unwanted heating of the building, increasing the energy consumption for cooling. Unwanted light irradiation leads to discomfort due to overexposure. In the current design practice shading is applied in- or {{in front of the}} glazing. The shading (temporarily) outweigh the benefits of the glass surface. A permanent- solar controlling glass prevents the utilization of the heat of the sun in any situation. And an adjustable sun shading device {{in front of the window}} is keeping out the heat of the sun, but also keeps out the light and the view. For these reasons, also from an energetic point of view, the amount of glass in a <b>façade</b> is often limited. The <b>façade</b> concept researched in this study is a fully glazed <b>façade</b> that has the ability to shade without drastic reduction of light and view, and that optimizes the energy balance of the building. The <b>facade</b> has two positions: closed and open. The <b>facade</b> in closed position, is flat, vertically oriented, and offers the benefits of insulation and solar gain. When the <b>facade</b> is in open position, it is forward inclined and is creating shading as a result of the inclination. The change of position of the <b>facade</b> is performed by tilting the <b>facade</b> forward. The expectation is that this dynamic <b>facade</b> can provide energy savings compared to existing <b>façade</b> types. The purpose of this study is to calculate the resulting energy consumption of this dynamic <b>facade.</b> Also the <b>façade</b> concept is technical-practical elaborated. The main questions of the research are: What is the energetic performance of the dynamic <b>façade,</b> what is its best configuration, and which mechanisms play a role in the energetic result. The <b>facade</b> is proposed for an office with fully glazed <b>facade.</b> For the calculation of the energy performance, a detailed model of a standard office room and its <b>façade</b> is created. Existing <b>façade</b> types, used to compare the dynamic <b>façade</b> with, are the following conventional variants: - a <b>façade</b> with low g-value, a <b>facade</b> with outdoor blinds, a <b>facade</b> shading by geometry, and a <b>façade</b> with reduced glass area. The technical-practical elaboration of the dynamic <b>façade</b> answers the question of how the adaptable <b>façade</b> can be made in practice. This elaboration focusses on how an adaptable <b>façade</b> can be created while maintaining constant primary functions. The results of the energy performance calculations are the input for the technical elaboration. The method of the research is as follows: first the two static positions of the <b>façade</b> are modelled separately by means of dynamic modelling in TRNSYS. The two positions are combined in a dynamic model of the dynamic <b>façade</b> that is able to change position during simulation, depending on the desired comfort-temperature. The resulting values of energy use for heating and cooling of both the dynamic <b>façade</b> and the conventional variants are compared to each other. Researched is the influence of the properties of the dynamic <b>façade</b> on the resulting energy use. For various locations in Europe, the dynamic <b>facade</b> is compared to the best performing conventional variant(façade with external sun shading). This comparison makes it clear the locations of preference for the dynamic <b>facade.</b> Concerning the technical elaboration; by means of researching the separate elements of the <b>façade,</b> the concept is elaborated into a detailed design. Factors that are addressed are the material choice of the movable layer, the moving of a <b>façade</b> element and the combination of those factors into a <b>façade</b> system. Results are in favour of the dynamic <b>facade.</b> Following from the comparison with the existing types, the dynamic <b>facade</b> gives an energy consumption of a fifth of the best performing static variant. Applying night- cooling changes the advantage of the dynamic <b>façade</b> to a third of the best performing conventional variant. In this comparison the energy use for heating and cooling is used. To get a complete overview of the energy use, the influence of ventilation- energy, lighting- energy and motion- energy needs to be added in the comparison. During the period of the year where normally cooling takes place, the initial state of the <b>facade</b> is opened, and during the period of the year where normally heating takes place, the initial state of the <b>façade</b> is closed. During these periods the <b>facade</b> changes to another phase when the external climatic makes that the thermal comfort otherwise could not be guaranteed. Out of the comparison of the dynamic <b>façade</b> to the conventional, for other climates in Europe, the effect of the dynamic <b>façade</b> depends on the type of summer; locations with a hot summer, compared to locations with a warm summer are reducing the effect. Concluding, the simulated <b>facade</b> is focussing at exchanging heat by means of transmission. The elaboration of the <b>façade</b> is focussing on the combination of the two positions. In closed position the heat transmission is minimized, and in open position the heat transmission is maximized. To ensure constant basic functions of the <b>façade,</b> like water- and air- tightness, and sound isolation, a flexible movable layer with high mass is used. A foldable bellow principle is used to make this layer movable. The resulting <b>façade</b> system is a fully glazed <b>facade</b> with adaptive heat transfer and sun shading. <b>Facade</b> designBuilding TechnologyArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

5|$|The {{exemplar of}} Puuc-style {{architecture}} is Uxmal. The style {{developed in the}} Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper <b>façades</b> of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower <b>façades</b> were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.|$|E
