5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

25|$|Several new {{options and}} {{standard}} features {{were introduced in}} the following years, including the Pony Package (2005), a DVD-based GPS navigation system made by Pioneer (2006, late availability), a power passenger seat (2006), heated seats (2006), Sirius Satellite Radio (2006), new flat bottom spoiler for V6 only (2006), standard side airbags (2007), HID headlamps (2007), and ambient <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> (2007). The ambient <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> package consisted of the installation of electroluminescence that gave the driver the ability to choose various color combinations for the instrument cluster, sound system and climate control displays, as well as light emitting {{from the top of}} the front footwells and from beneath the rear seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} is notable {{for being a}} hybrid dome. A braced fabric dome forms the central area of the roof, while the surrounding area is a standard metal deck roof. The 13,000-sq-ft dome acts as a skylight during the day, and at night, it stands out with the glow of <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> Structural engineering was performed by David Geiger Associates.|$|E
50|$|All <b>interior</b> <b>lights</b> are {{provided}} by light-emitting diodes (LED), so power consumption is lessened.|$|R
25|$|Lighting {{costs are}} reduced on sunny days, as most Costco {{locations}} have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light {{is coming in}} the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the <b>interior</b> <b>lights.</b> During an average sunny day, it is normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have <b>interior</b> <b>lights</b> in use.|$|R

25|$|All second-generation IS models {{offered a}} more typical Lexus {{interior}} {{compared to the}} previous generation {{with a focus on}} luxurious accouterments. The interior featured memory leather seats, lightsaber-like electroluminescent instrument display lighting and LED <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> accents, the choice of faux-metallic or optional Bird's Eye Maple wood trim (aluminum composite on the IS F), and SmartAccess keyless entry with push-button start. Options ranged from touchscreen navigation with backup camera to a Mark Levinson premium sound system and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.|$|E
25|$|Hornby {{introduced}} Mk.2 BFK and TSO {{models in}} the late 1960s and these have remained in production intermittently ever since, sometimes being used to represent coaches of later variants (such as the Mk.2B BFK in the Royal Train). In 2013 (for the 2014 range) Hornby {{announced that it would}} produce the Mk2E variant. These are re-tooled versions and will be available in both their main range and their RailRoad range. Some from the main range will have <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> Hornby are making 3 versions of the Mk2E i.e. FO, TSO and BSO.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{innovations}} for night and all-weather flying {{used by the}} US, UK, Japan and Germany during World War II {{was the use of}} UV <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> to illuminate the instrument panel, giving a safer alternative to the radium-painted instrument faces and pointers, and an intensity that could be varied easily and without visible illumination that would give away an aircraft's position. This {{went so far as to}} include the printing of charts that were marked in UV-fluorescent inks, and the provision of UV-visible pencils and slide rules such as the E6B.|$|E

25|$|Claude's patents {{envisioned the}} use of gases such as argon and mercury vapor to create {{different}} colors beyond those produced by neon. In the 1920s, fluorescent glasses and coatings were developed to further expand the range of colors and effects for tubes with argon gas or argon-neon mixtures; generally, the fluorescent coatings are used with an argon/mercury-vapor mixture, which emits ultraviolet light that activates the fluorescent coatings. By the 1930s, the colors from combinations of neon tube lights had become satisfactory for some general <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> applications, and achieved some success in Europe, {{but not in the}} US. Since the 1950s, the development of phosphors for color televisions has created nearly 100 new colors for neon tube lighting.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{research}} {{on the effects of}} excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure, and some lighting design textbooks use human health as an explicit criterion for proper <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> Health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety. Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety. For those who need to be awake at night, light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former West End houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near North Station by artist Sheila Levrant de Bretteville; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist Ross Miller in parcel 17; an historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder Donald McKay in East Boston; blue <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> of the Zakim Bridge; and the Miller's River Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the Charles River.|$|E
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a design study of LED <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> units. Aim {{of the study}} is to design set of three {{luminaire}} types â€“ office table light, standard lamp and a pendant luminaire. All three lights are following the same design. Curve is the main shape for this light set. LED, called light source of the future, {{is supposed to be the}} only light source at all three units. LEDs were chosen as the contemporary most efficient and modern light source. Use of LEDs has many positive economical and social aspects. Use of innovative design, most recent technologies and modern shapes brings new inspiration and variety into current <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> world.

25|$|The InterCity 125 {{is still}} in {{widespread}} use. First Great Western planned to supplement (but not replace) its InterCity 125s with 14 Class 180 Adelante trains, which can travel at the same speed. Because every carriage has an underfloor engine, they can accelerate approximately twice as quickly, which reduces journey times and allows for more frequent services. However, in-car noise levels are {{higher than in the}} InterCity 125 because of the underfloor engines, which, combined with less-comfortable seats and harsh <b>interior</b> <b>lighting,</b> has made them unpopular with passengers. They also proved to be unreliable, leading to a significant overhaul programme in 2004 to fix the major problems. These issues ultimately led to the units being withdrawn from First Great Western services and transferred to open access operators Grand Central and Hull Trains.|$|E
25|$|Interior design {{improvements}} {{were another}} {{main focus of}} the LRX concept though {{the interior of the}} production Evoque changed significantly from the concept LRX. Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a â€˜floatingâ€™ three-dimensional LCD display. An aluminium centre console with an iPhone docking station stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and the tailgate. Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of an airy interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor stowage areas. Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough room for two mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|E

500|$|The 757 {{interior}} allows seat {{arrangements of}} up to six per row with a single center aisle. [...] Originally optimized for flights averaging two hours, the 757 features <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> and cabin architecture designs aimed at a more spacious impression. As on the 767, garment-bag-length overhead bins and a rear economy-class galley are standard equipment. The bins have twice the capacity as those on the preceding 727. To save weight, honeycomb sandwich is used for interior paneling and bins. Unlike previous evacuation slide designs which are not equipped for water landings, the 757's main exits feature combination slide rafts {{similar to those found}} on the 747. In the 1980s, Boeing altered the interior designs of its other narrow-body aircraft to be {{similar to that of the}} 757.|$|E
500|$|Textiles {{have been}} {{exported}} from the Peak {{for hundreds of}} years. Even {{as early as the}} 14th century, the area traded in unprocessed wool. There was a number of skilled hand spinners and weavers in the area. By the 1780s, inventors such as Richard Arkwright developed machinery to produce textiles more quickly and to a higher standard. The early mills were narrow and low in height, of light construction, powered by water wheels and containing small machines. <b>Interior</b> <b>lighting</b> was by daylight, and ceiling height was only [...] These Arkwright type mills are about [...] wide. The Peak District was the ideal location, with its rivers and humid atmosphere. The local pool of labour was quickly exhausted and the new mills such as Litton Mill and Cressbrook Mill in Millers Dale brought in children as young as four from the workhouses of London as apprentices.|$|E
