40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Supraspinatus {{deficiency}} {{associated with}} total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) provokes eccentric loading and may induce loosening of the glenoid component. A <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> of the glenoid component {{has been proposed}} to balance supraspinatus deficiency. METHODS: This hypothesis was assessed by a numeric musculoskeletal model of the glenohumeral joint during active abduction. Three cases were compared: TSA with normal muscular function, TSA with supraspinatus deficiency, and TSA with supraspinatus deficiency and <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> of the glenoid. RESULTS: Supraspinatus deficiency increased humeral migration and eccentric loading. A <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> of the glenoid partly balanced the loss of stability, but this potential advantage was counterbalanced by an important stress increase within the glenoid cement. The additional subchondral bone reaming required to incline the glenoid component indeed reduced the bone support, increasing cement deformation and stress. CONCLUSION: Glenoid inclination should not be obtained {{at the expense of}} subchondral bone support...|$|R

These cells exhibit a characteristic plastid zonation (five zones) with one zone (No. 3) specialized for the lateral sedimentation of amyloplasts.

In basipetally centrifuged protonemata observed using infrared videomicroscopy, tip extension occurred with or without amyloplasts present in the apical dome. The initial return of upward curvature was always correlated with the return and sedimentation of amyloplasts in zone 3. Subsequent vigorous upward curvature was correlated with distinct amyloplast zonation and further sedimentation in zone 3. <b>Initial</b> <b>downward</b> ("wrong way") curvature, which often preceded upward curvature, correlated {{with the presence of}} amyloplasts in the apical dome (zone 1).

The air was maintained at room temperature and the wall is heated by Joule effect. The temperature difference between the wall and the air was prefixed at 25 K and the wall placement had been varied from the vertical to different downward inclined positions (5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 °, 25 ° and 30 °). The experimental results had shown an increase in the heat transfer coefficient, at the different wall inclinations, due to the jets; actually they had induced turbulence in the dynamic field, by interrupting the laminar flow. Our aim was to optimize the variables involved in the phenomenon, in order to find out the highest enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient values, caused by the jets. The variables were the number of active horizontal lines of jets, their activity and the inactivity time and their velocity. We had also investigated the conditions without jets and we found out that the heat transfer coefficient trend versus the <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> angles, could not be described by correlations present in literature. In fact, in the investigated range of the <b>downward</b> wall <b>inclinations,</b> the heat transfer coefficient did not may be simply correlated with the cosine of the angle, but it increased up to a maximum value, reached at 15 °, and then decreased.

This process includes increasing the weight bearing capabilities and performance of in-situ soil and sand. Soil nailing is a construction technique {{that can be used}} as a remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as a construction technique that allows the safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope – often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight <b>downward</b> <b>inclination.</b> Soil nail components may also be used to stabilize retaining walls or existing fill slopes like embankments and levees and this is normally undertaken as a remedial measure.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} involves the modeling of gas–liquid interface in a two-phase stratified flow through a horizontal or nearly-horizontal circular duct. The most complete and fundamental model used for these calculations {{is known as}} the one-dimensional two-fluid model. It is the most accurate of the two-phase models since it considers each phase independently and links both phases with six conservation equations. The mass and momentum balance equations are written in dimensionless form. The dimensionless mass and momentum balance equations are combined with the method of characteristics and an explicit method to simulate the flow. At first, the linear stability of the flow is investigated by disturbing the liquid flow with a small perturbation. An improved version of the one-dimensional twofluid model for horizontal flows is developed as a set of non-linear hyperbolic governing equations. The importance of this research lies in obtaining a model that accounts for the effects of flow and geometrical conditions (such as liquid viscosity, surface tension). It is shown that, for positive values of the slope angle (upward inclination), the slug flow becomes more probable, whereas negative values of the slope angle (<b>downward</b> <b>inclination)</b> induce a more stable stratified flow.

Alternating field and thermal demagnetization revealed northern (southern) directions with moderate to high upward (<b>downward)</b> <b>inclinations.</b> Rock magnetism experiments and magnetic mineralogy show that this characteristic magnetization is carried by Ti-poor magnetite or by hematite that replaces magnetite by late-magmatic cleuteric alteration.

Paleogeographic reconstructions using this pole and other reliable Paleoproterozoic poles suggest that Laurentia, Baltica, North China Craton and Amazonian Craton were located in laterally contiguous positions forming a large continental mass at 1790 Ma ago.

The Utror Volcanic Formation formed during Late Paleocene, when Kohistan existedas an Andean-type arc on the southern margin of Eurasia. Five to ten block samples were collected from 17 sites of the formation for paleomagnetic studies. Magnetic minerals that serve as remanent carriers are maghemite, magnetite, hematite and titanohematite. Magnetite, hematite, and titanohematite carry the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM). The declination values of ChRM are highly discordant before and after structural correction. While inclination values show uniformity in geographic coordinates. The ChRM carried by magnetite yields <b>downward</b> <b>inclinations,</b> whereas the ChRM carried by hematite or titanohematite have upward inclinations in geographic coordinates. The correlation between polarity state and magnetic mineralogy suggests that the acquisition of magnetization occurred during two distinct time intervals. An inclination only fold test of ChRM of these two mineral assemblages indicates that they are post-folding magnetizations. The calculated paleolatitudes for ChRM carried by magnetite and hematite or titanohematite are 9 ± 4 °N and 13 ± 4 °N respectively. A comparison of these paleolatitudes with the Indian apparent polar wander path (APWP) shows that the remagnetization likely happened between 55 to 45 Ma. Discordant declinations indicate that these volcanics suffered local rotations after remagnetization event.|$|R

The <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> of the J-shaped well introduces periodic waves {{over time}} {{as a result of}} mixing gas and liquid. This behavior introduces periodic fluctuations of the superficial gas and liquid velocities along tubing. The velocity fluctuation is due to the accumulation of liquid in the heel of the inclined section of J-shaped well and the development of reservoir gas pressure to overcome the accumulated liquid column making the J-shaped gas-lift well to be prone to production under slugging regime. The investigation here is addressing two aspects with the objective to optimize the gas-lift performance. The first addresses the production behavior and the mechanism that leads to development of slugging regime in the J-shaped well. Secondly it addresses the effect of the gas composition of the gas-lift on the production performance. Different gas-lift gas composition causes the gas and liquid compositions to change with the pressure and temperature profile in the production tubing. Gas-lift contains C 1 as a major component. The work here shows that a fraction of 0. 15 nC 5 combined with C 1 gives highest oil production rates. In the contrary, high content of 0. 20 iC 4 with C 1 give lowest oil rates.

At low levels of production long run production functions generally exhibit increasing returns to scale, which, for firms that are perfect competitors in input markets, means that the long run average cost is falling; the upward slope of the long run average cost function at higher levels of output is due to decreasing returns to scale at those output levels.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Consideration of {{previous}} work and new data show a systematic {{distribution of the}} directions of high coercivity and high blocking tempera-ture magnetization in the Newer Gabbros of Aberdeenshire. The site-mean directions show a non-Fisherian distribution with the corresponding pole positions distributed along a published early Palaeozoic apparent polar wander path for Great Britain. The mean of the distribution closely agrees with the mean direction previously reported and widely quoted. There is a close correlation of the site-mean directions with {{the position of the}} sampling sites with respect to the contours ('chrontours') of the K-Ar coolingage. Sites where stable NRM has SE declinations and shallow (t 20 ") inclinations have the oldest chrontour ages (- 468 Myr). The mean palaeomagnetic direction progressively shifts and the sites with the youngest chrontour ages (- 428 Myr) have SW declinations with moderately steeper (t 45 ") inclination. The relative age of magnetization, determined from the position of the corresponding pole on the apparent polar wander path, is consistent with the relative chrontour age. The gabbros have therefore recorded the shift of the north-east Highlands with respect to the palaeomagnetic pole during the slow cooling of the terrain. The slow cooling is presumably related to uplift and erosion, and the resulting downward migration of isothermal surfaces. A previously published suggestion that all magnetizations with southerly declinations and moderately <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> are the resultant of normal and reversed magnetizations with shallow inclination is shown to be incorrect...|$|R

Due to the presence of acromial arch in the shoulder, accessing the supraspinatus tendon with physical modalities is difficult; thus this model may not be suitable for studying the treatment for tendinosis. To develop a rat model for Achilles tendinosis, we tested 14 mature SpragueDawley rats by dividing them into 2 groups of 7 each. The experimental group was subjected to a daily enforced downhill bipedal running program by suspending their upper bodies so that they ran with their hind limbs on a treadmill for 1 hr/day for 8 weeks. The <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> was 20 °and the speed was 17 m/min. The animals in the control group did not undergo any exercise. After 8 weeks, the Achilles tendons were harvested and subjected to histological and biomechanical analysis. Histological examination revealed tenocyte proliferation, change in tenocytes appearance, and collagen bundle disintegration in the running group. The biomechanical testing revealed significant decrease in stiffness (p= 0. 002) and ultimate tensile strength (p= 0. 016) in the running group than in the control group. Both the histological and biomechanical findings are suggestive of changes in the tendon of the running group that resembled the pathological changes of tendinosis in human.

This paper {{investigates the}} {{dependence}} of estimates of reservoir storage capacity derived using behavior analysis {{on the length of}} inflow sequence used for overyear reservoir simulation. It has generally been assumed that simulation using behavior analysis, which incorporates a given probability of failure, will always give steady state estimates of the storage capacity (apart from the effects of the initial reservoir condition). The results reported here show that it may take sequence lengths as much as 1000 years or more for the mean of the distribution of storage capacity estimates to approach a stationary value. For some cases with high draft and high inflow variability, we show that a significant swing of the mean storage estimates from an <b>initial</b> <b>downward</b> bias into an upward bias occurs before their convergence to a stationary level. However, the median storage estimates always showed downward bias which sometimes decreased very slowly with increasing sequence length. We provide explanations for these observations and discuss some of the implications on the choice of inflow sequence length in determining reservoir storage capacities using behavior analysis...|$|R
40|$|Seedling {{establishment}} {{is critical to}} profitable and sustainable production from small-seeded crops. A programme of work is reported that identifies key seed vigour traits that are required for predictable seedling establishment followed by a quantitative genetic analysis to identify loci that influence them. The three key traits were: (1) rapid germination; (2) rapid <b>initial</b> <b>downward</b> growth of the seedling; and (3) a high potential for upward shoot growth in soil of increasing impedance. All three traits reduce the time between sowing and seedling emergence when the seed bed can be deteriorating. This suggests a strategy of stress avoidance, through rapid progress when adequate moisture is present, rather than reliance on stress tolerance. B. oleracea doubled haploid mapping populations were screened for these traits and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified. These QTL were then subsequently fine-mapped where possible. We report {{on the outcome of}} this work and discuss the results in the context of other QTL studies. A way forward for marker and candidate gene identification is then outlined that uses a translational approach to exploit the colinearity that exists between B. oleracea and the model plant Arabidopsis.

40|$|Most work in {{literature}} on condensation in tubes {{has been done}} for smooth tubes in the horizontal and vertical configurations. Recent experimental works with condensation at different inclination angles showed that the heat transfer characteristics were a function of inclination angle. These works were limited to heat transfer and pressure drop measurements with visual observations. However, no {{work has been done}} on measuring the void fractions during condensation at different inclination angles. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure void fractions and heat transfer coefficients during condensation for tube inclinations ranging from vertical downwards (- 90 ᵒ) to vertical upwards (90 ᵒ) at a saturation temperature of 40 ᵒC. Measurements were taken in an experimental set-up in which condensation occurred on the inside of a test section. The test section was a circular tube with an inner diameter of 8. 38 mm and a heat transfer length of 1. 488. The refrigerant used was R 134 a, and the void fractions were measured using two capacitive void fraction sensors. Mass fluxes ranging from 100 – 400 kg/m 2. s and vapour qualities ranging from 10 – 90 % were considered. Heat transfer coefficients were also compared with void fractions. It was found that at combinations of low mass fluxes and vapour qualities, void fraction and heat transfer were significantly affected by changes in inclination angle. Generally, void fractions and heat transfer coefficients increased with <b>downward</b> <b>inclination</b> angles with an optimum angle between - 10 ᵒ and - 30 ᵒ (downward flow). At some intermediate mass flux and vapour quality conditions, the void fraction and heat transfer coefficients were observed to be independent of the inclination angle despite changes in the prevailing flow patterns.
