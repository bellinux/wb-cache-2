5|$|Bayh spent a {{considerable}} amount of time campaigning throughout the early primary states (particularly <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire)</b> for most of 2005 and 2006. The staff from his All America Political Action Committee (PAC) worked as his campaign team.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{continued}} {{campaigning in}} <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> visiting {{up to four}} different cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Chris Dodd was launched on January 11, 2007 and ended on January 3, 2008 after a sixth-place {{finish in the}} Iowa caucuses. Dodd, the Senior Senator from Connecticut, sought the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Centering his campaign in the strategically important states of <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> he tried to bring forth a platform of change. Dodd's performance in the opinion polls varied, but in the financial sphere, he had secured some notable and influential endorsements who had sufficiently funded his campaign.|$|E

50|$|The show {{followed}} the 2012 Republican primary trail by broadcasting from states where primaries are held, usually in local diners and cafes. In {{its first two}} weeks, O'Brien anchored first from Des Moines, <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> then Manchester, <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> to cover the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary respectively. Other cities the show has covered include Charleston, South Carolina and Jacksonville Beach, Florida.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Shrum {{worked on}} John Kerry's campaign, guiding {{him to a}} victory in the crucial <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary, <b>and</b> soon after, the Democratic presidential nomination, only for Kerry to be {{defeated}} in the general election by George W. Bush.|$|R
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
25|$|Romney was {{the first}} {{candidate}} in the 2008 election to begin airing TV and radio advertisements, beginning in February 2007. His advertisements, most of which focus primarily on Romney's conservative credentials, have aired mainly in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> which experts credit with helping his early lead in those and other early primary states. Romney's campaign advisors explained that their early advertisement push was {{to make up for}} Romney being relatively unknown compared to contenders Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Fred Thompson. On September 4, 2007, Romney was estimated to have spent $2 million in advertisements in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} New Hampshire primary the {{following}} week, Iowa's caucuses {{have become the}} starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president. The national and international media give <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage. Those who enter the caucus race often expend enormous effort to reach voters in each of Iowa's 99 counties.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the {{primaries}} and caucuses, Richardson lagged behind fellow Democrats in polling data. Despite campaigning heavily in early {{states such as}} <b>Iowa,</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> <b>and</b> Nevada, Richardson continued to barely register in polls. Richardson competed only in the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary due to his withdrawal prior to caucuses in Nevada.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{these states}} are small, campaigning {{takes place on}} a much more {{personal}} scale. As a result, even a little-known, underfunded candidate can use [...] "retail politics" [...] to meet intimately with interested voters and perform better than expected. The <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary have produced a number of headline-making upsets in history: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{campaign}} {{began to}} buy advertising in November 2015 when it spent $2million on television ads. In {{the last two}} weeks of December and the first week of January, the Sanders campaign spent $4.7million on TV ads, outspending the Clinton campaign. Prior to the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primaries, the campaign launched the advertisement [...] "America".|$|R
25|$|The {{role played}} by the Iowa Caucuses is viewed with envy by states across the country. Traditionally, Iowa has been first and then {{followed}} by the state of New Hampshire, but states such as South Carolina, Nevada, and Florida have been moving up the dates of their presidential primaries to try to capture some of the media and political attention that <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> receive.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{candidates}} started their campaigns in mid-2011, but after the first two primaries in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> only four well-funded campaigns (Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, and Paul) remained for the Republican Party nomination; Gary Johnson had withdrawn to run on the Libertarian ticket, and Buddy Roemer sought the American Elect nomination. At the beginning of May, Gingrich and Santorum suspended their campaigns; Romney was widely reported as the presumptive nominee, with Paul the only other major candidate running an active campaign.|$|E
25|$|Mike Huckabee's {{results in}} the opinion polls rose from 29% in the Des Moines Register's poll in late November 2007. Mitt Romney rose two points from 24% in November to 26% in December. John McCain enjoyed the biggest {{increase}} from November, increasing six points from 7% to 13%, while Rudy Giuliani suffered the biggest drop from November, decreasing eight points from 13% to 5%. Giuliani's large drop was attributed to his strategy of skipping early states such as <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> in favor of larger, delegate-rich states such as Florida, California, and New York. No other candidate polled more than 10%.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{made the}} fateful {{decision}} not {{to compete in the}} early <b>Iowa</b> caucus <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary, which Jimmy Carter won after liberals split their votes among four other candidates. Though Jackson won the Massachusetts <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York primaries, he dropped out on May 1 after losing the critical Pennsylvania primary to Carter by 12% and running out of money.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{candidates}} vied for the nomination, including retired four-star general Wesley Clark, former Vermont Governor Howard Dean, and Senators John Edwards and John Kerry. For most of 2003, Howard Dean {{had been}} the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary, which gave him enough momentum to carry {{the majority of the}} rest of the states.|$|R
50|$|Premier Guitar {{was founded}} by Peter Sprague and {{partners}} in February 2007. Premier Guitar is published by Gearhead Communications, LLC, a privately owned company that is headquartered in Marion, Iowa. Premier Guitar also has offices in Nashville, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Fort Dodge, <b>Iowa,</b> <b>and</b> Peterborough, <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> Revenue growth for the company was 38% in 2009, and approximately 41% in 2010. The company's consistent growth has led to Peter Sprague being included in 2009's Folio Forty.|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time in modern Republican Party history, three {{different}} candidates won the first three state contests in January (the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, and the South Carolina primary). Although Romney had been expected to win in at least <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> Rick Santorum won the non-binding poll at caucus sites in Iowa by 34 votes, as near as can be determined from the incomplete tally, earning him a declaration as winner by state party leaders, although vote totals were missing from eight precincts. The election of county delegates at the caucuses would eventually lead to Ron Paul earning 22 of the 28 Iowa delegates to the Republican National Convention. Newt Gingrich won South Carolina by a surprisingly large margin, and Romney won only in New Hampshire.|$|E
500|$|In February, Dodd {{turned his}} {{attention}} fully to the early primary states of <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in here and do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a [...] "thug".|$|E
500|$|Bayh {{continued}} to campaign in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> as November 2005 approached. Media outlets reported that 10 potential presidential candidates had visited Iowa in October. When {{asked about the}} attention given to the state 26 {{months prior to the}} caucus, Bayh replied that he [...] "wish the process didn't begin this early, but it does". Later in the month, former chief counsel and master political strategist for Bayh, Federal District Judge David Hamilton ruled that prayer could not be conducted prior to the opening of the state legislature in Indiana, reasoning that the mention of [...] "Jesus Christ" [...] as [...] "Savior" [...] or [...] "Son of God" [...] is unconstitutional. Commentators argued that the decision diminished Bayh's label as the [...] "centrist candidate" [...] for the Democratic nomination due to his connections to the judge.|$|E
25|$|Alexander {{made two}} {{unsuccessful}} runs for President of the United States in 1996 and in 2000. In 1996, he finished 3rd in the <b>Iowa</b> Caucus <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> Primary, <b>and</b> dropped {{out before the}} Super Tuesday primaries. After {{dropping out of the}} race, Alexander took on an advisory role in the Dole/Kemp campaign. In 2000, during his second candidacy, he traveled around the US in a Ford Explorer, eschewing a campaign bus or plane, and that journey lasted less than six months, having been announced 9 March 1999, and was withdrawn on 16 August 1999, after a poor showing in the Ames Straw Poll, both times in Nashville, Tennessee.|$|R
40|$|The {{presidential primary}} vote {{represents}} a unique electoral forecasting challenge, with multiple candidates and sequential voting. This study compares the leading primary vote forecast models by re-estimating {{them for a}} common set of candidates and nomination campaigns. A new forecast model is estimated to assess the predictive power of candidate ideology, controlling for the effects of variables found to be significant in prior studies. Finally, the study compares the early forecasts, based on data from before the Iowa caucus, with "momentum" models, which are the early models, updated with variables representing the results of the <b>Iowa</b> Caucus <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> Primary vote, predicting the remaining contested primary vote. ...|$|R
25|$|Despite public polling showing Romney behind Obama in {{the swing}} states of Nevada, Colorado, <b>Iowa,</b> Wisconsin, Ohio, <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> tied with Obama in Virginia, and just barely ahead of Obama in Florida, the Romney {{campaign}} said they were genuinely surprised by the loss, having believed that public polling was oversampling Democrats. The Romney campaign had already set up a transition website, and had scheduled and purchased a fireworks display to celebrate in case he won the election.|$|R
500|$|Colbert's {{timing was}} too late for his name to be added the South Carolina primary ballot, and South Carolina law would not allow for {{write-in}} candidates. [...] Polling showed that 21% of the potential Republican primary electorate reported they would be [...] "more likely" [...] to vote for former candidate Herman Cain, who remained on the ballot, if that vote served as encouragement for Colbert. Herman Cain received 6,338 votes in the South Carolina Republican Primary, which was more than all the other withdrawn candidates received combined. On the next episode of The Colbert Report broadcast on January 23, 2012, Colbert boasted about passing the 1% threshold and for Cain receiving many more votes in South Carolina than in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> Colbert then announced that he would no longer be exploring a run for President of the United States of South Carolina.|$|E
500|$|Early in May, Dodd {{continued}} to campaign in California {{for a few}} days but later shifted back to the strategically important states of <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> {{for the rest of the}} month. On May 15 the campaign released its first ad, which detailed his plan for ending the war in Iraq. In the ad, Dodd also criticized his fellow Democratic candidates by stating, [...] "We can't simply wait for a new president. We should have the conviction to stand up to this one," [...] In Washington, Dodd was exposed to debate on the Iraq War Spending Bill and new videos from al-Qaeda's second in command Ayman al-Zawahiri. Back on the campaign trail he talked about how he would deal with foreign issues particularly in regards to the situation in Iraq, [...] "I'm not going to let my foreign policy be decided by Mr. al-Zawahiri. Obviously, he's playing his game here. He'd probably like to see us stay down there, bogged down, at the costs we're increasing here, the loss of lives, not to mention the isolation of the United States." [...] When Presidential candidate John Edwards released an ad criticizing Congress' failure to end the Iraq War, Dodd took it personal and shot back at Edwards stating, [...] ""With all due respect, we could have used John's vote here in the Senate on these issues here." [...] He concluded the May campaign by attending House parties in three cities in New Hampshire[...]|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Wellstone {{formed an}} {{exploratory}} committee and a leadership PAC, the Progressive Politics Network, that {{paid for his}} travels to <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> two early primary states in the nomination process. He spoke before organized labor and local Democrats, using the slogan, [...] "I represent the democratic wing of the Democratic Party". Governor Howard Dean later incorporated that phrase into his stump speech in the 2004 US presidential election.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the presidential}} primary season started slowly, ramping up {{several weeks after}} the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary. In the 2008 Presidential primary season, with {{competition}} to increase the relevance of each state's selection process, 34 states (plus the District of Columbia), have scheduled their primary or caucus process {{to be held in}} January and February, tripling the number of states voting this early than the count in the 2000 races.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they are}} the states that {{traditionally}} hold their respective contests first, the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary usually attract the most media attention; however, critics, such as Mississippi Secretary of State Eric Clark and Tennessee Senator William Brock, point out that these states are not representative of the United States as a whole: they are overwhelmingly white, more rural, and wealthier than the national average, and neither is in the fast-growing West or South.|$|R
5000|$|The Michigan Legislature {{passed a}} bill to move {{the date of the}} state's presidential {{primaries}} to January 15 in an effort to increase the state's influence in the presidential candidate nominating process. They argued that the <b>Iowa</b> Caucuses <b>and</b> the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> Primary unfairly dominated the selection process. Just as in Florida, the move-up bill originated in a Republican-controlled State Senate and passed by a 21-17 straight party-line vote with every Democrat casting a [...] "no" [...] vote.|$|R
2500|$|Romney, on September 5, 2007, began {{advertising}} in South Carolina, the early primary state {{where he was}} doing the poorest. During the second week of September, he expanded his advertising to Florida, showing the [...] "Energy" [...] ad which he debuted in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> and also began showing in South Carolina. The ad features Romney jogging and highlights his career as governor of Massachusetts, running the Salt Lake Olympics, and the private sector.|$|E
2500|$|In the January 3 Iowa caucus, {{the first}} contest {{of the primary}} elections, Romney {{received}} 25% of the vote and placed second to Mike Huckabee, who received 34%. The result was seen as disappointing as Romney spent about five {{times more than the}} former Arkansas governor in Iowa and had banked on wins in both <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> to propel him to an overall victory. [...] Twelve of Iowa's delegates were awarded to Romney for his second-place finish.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics, {{including}} Romney, {{have accused}} Huckabee of using his religion background for political advantage. A Romney campaign staff member {{pointed out that}} similar ads in <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> are different in that the New Hampshire ad {{did not include the}} term [...] "Christian Leader" [...] in the spot, while an ad in Iowa did. Alice Stewart, a spokeswomen of the Huckabee campaign later said there was no intention to downplay religion in New Hampshire, noting the ads [...] "were simply different spots running in different markets, which is typical in presidential campaigns." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gingrich {{increased}} his fundraising after consistently performing {{well in the}} Republican debates. Pollster Kellyanne Conway, who worked for Gingrich's American Solutions, reviewed his debate performances and said his focus and ability to stay on-point during the discussions helped him enormously, as compared to past speeches where he would entertain many different topics. In September 2011, {{he was able to}} increase his ground operations in <b>Iowa,</b> South Carolina, <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> Tea Party founder Judson Phillips endorsed him, praising his [...] "presidential" [...] appearances at the debates.|$|R
2500|$|As fall 2007 continued, Obama fell {{further behind}} Clinton in {{national}} polls. In late October 2007, {{two months before}} the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary, Obama began directly charging his top rival with failing to clearly state her political positions. This shift in approach attracted much media commentary; The New York Times Adam Nagourney wrote that, [...] "Obama has appeared to struggle from the start of this campaign with how to marry what he has promised to be a new approach to politics—free of the partisan bitterness that has marked presidential campaigns for so long—with what it takes to actually win a presidential race." [...] In an early-anticipated October 30 Democratic debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance under cross-examination from her Democratic rivals and the moderator. Obama's campaign was reinvigorated, and he began to climb again in the polls.|$|R
50|$|Senator Jackson made {{a fateful}} {{decision}} not {{to compete in the}} early <b>Iowa</b> caucus <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> primary, which Jimmy Carter won after liberals split their votes among four other candidates. Though Jackson {{went on to win the}} Massachusetts <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York primaries, he was forced to quit the race on May 1 after losing the critical Pennsylvania primary to Carter by twelve percentage points. Carter then defeated Governor Wallace, his main conservative challenger, by a wide margin in the North Carolina primary, thus forcing Wallace to end his campaign. Representative Udall, a liberal, then became Carter's main challenger. He finished second to Carter in the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire,</b> Massachusetts, Wisconsin, <b>New</b> York, Michigan, South Dakota, and Ohio primaries, and won the caucuses in his home state of Arizona, while running even with Carter in the New Mexico caucuses. However, the fact that Udall finished second to Carter in most of these races meant that Carter steadily accumulated more delegates for the nomination than he did.|$|R
