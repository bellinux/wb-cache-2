PaperPhone was {{one of the first}} OUIs to introduce bend gestures on a real flexible screen. It featured a flexible electrophoretic display and an array of 5 bend sensors that allowed for user navigation of content. Examples of actuated OUIs include shape changing prototypes like MorePhone and Morphees.

Comparisons between pen pressure input and pen tilt input {{have been made in}} the three experiments. Experimental results show that decreasing pressure input resulted in very poor performance and was not a good <b>input</b> <b>technique</b> for any of the three experiments. In "Experiment 1 -Coupling to Cursor Position", the tilt <b>input</b> <b>technique</b> performed relatively better than the increasing pressure <b>input</b> <b>technique</b> in terms of time, even though the tilt technique had a slightly higher error rate. In "Experiment 2 -Coupling to Cursor Angle", the tilt input performed a little better than the increasing pressure input in terms of time, but the gap between them is not so apparent as Experiment 1. In "Experiment 3 -Coupling to Cursor Scale", tilt input performed a little better than increasing pressure input in terms of adjustment time.

We report two experiments that compare these techniques to a point cursor; in one experiment participants use a touchpad for operating the <b>input</b> <b>techniques,</b> in the other a mouse. In both experiments, the bubble cursor is fastest and participants make fewer errors with it. Participants also unanimously prefer this technique. For small targets, the cell cursors are generally more accurate than the point cursor; in the second experiment the box cursor is also faster. The cell cursors succeed in letting participants select objects while the cursor is far away from the target, but are relatively slow in the final phase of target acquisition.

40|$|It is now {{possible}} to develop head-mounted devices (HMDs) that allow for ego-centric sensing of mid-air ges-tural input. Therefore, we explore the use of HMD-based gestural <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> in smart space environments. We developed a usage scenario to evaluate HMD-based gestural interactions and conducted a user study to elicit qualitative feedback on several HMD-based gestural in-put techniques. Our results show that for the proposed scenario, mid-air hand gestures are preferred to head gestures for input and rated more favorably compared to non-gestural <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> available on existing HMDs. Informed by these study results, we developed a prototype HMD system that supports gestural interac-tions as proposed in our scenario. We conducted a sec-ond user study to quantitatively evaluate our prototype comparing several gestural and non-gestural input tech-niques. The {{results of this study}} show no clear advantage or disadvantage of gestural inputs vs. non-gestural <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> on HMDs. We did find that voice control as (sole) input modality performed worst compared to the other <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> we evaluated. Lastly, we present two further applications implemented with our system, demonstrating 3 D scene viewing and ambient light con-trol. We conclude by briefly discussing the implications of ego-centric vs. exo-centric tracking for interaction in smart spaces...|$|E
40|$|An in-car {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine different <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> for list-based scrolling tasks and the effectiveness of haptic feedback for in-car touchscreens. The use of physical switchgear on centre consoles is decreasing which allows designers to develop new ways to interact with in-car applications. However, these new methods need to be evaluated to ensure they are usable. Therefore, three <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> were tested: direct scrolling, pressure-based scrolling and scrolling using onscreen buttons on a touchscreen. The results showed that direct scrolling was less accurate than using onscreen buttons and pressure input, but took almost half the time when compared to the onscreen buttons and was almost three times quicker than pressure input. Vibrotactile feedback did not improve input performance but was preferred by the users. Understanding the speed vs. accuracy trade-off between these <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> will allow better decisions when designing safer in-car interfaces for scrolling applications...|$|E

Both rotating and sliding the stylus inside the holder can simultaneously adjust two parameters. We implemented a prototype system with an inexpensive image sensor, and evaluated its input.

40|$|In {{everyday}} life people use their mobile phones on-the-go with different walking speeds and with different touch <b>input</b> <b>techniques.</b> Unfortunately, {{much of the}} published research in mobile interaction does not quantify the influence of these variables. In this paper, we analyze the influence of walking speed, gait pattern and <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> on commonly used performance parameters like error rate, accuracy and tapping speed, and we compare the results to the static condition. We examine the influence of these factors on the machine learned offset model used to correct user input and we make design recommendations. The results show that all performance parameters degraded when the subject started to move, for all <b>input</b> <b>techniques.</b> Index finger pointing techniques demonstrated overall better performance compared to thumb-pointing techniques. The influence of gait phase on tap event likelihood and accuracy was demonstrated for all <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> and all walking speeds. Finally, it was shown that the offset model built on static data did not perform as well as models inferred from dynamic data, which indicates the speed-specific nature of the models. Also, models identified using specific <b>input</b> <b>techniques</b> did not perform well when tested in other conditions, demonstrating the limited validity of offset models to a particular input technique. The model was therefore calibrated using data recorded with the appropriate input technique, at 75 % of preferred walking speed, which is the speed to which users spontaneously slow down when they use a mobile device and which presents a tradeoff between accuracy and usability. This led {{to an increase in}} accuracy compared to models built on static data. The error rate was reduced between 0. 05 % and 5. 3 % for landscape-based methods and between 5. 3 % and 11. 9 % for portrait-based methods...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the use of hand drawn marks as a human-computer <b>input</b> <b>technique.</b> Drawing a mark is an efficient command <b>input</b> <b>technique</b> in many situations. However, marks are not intrinsically self-explanatory as are other interactive techniques such as buttons and menus. This research develops and evaluates an interaction technique called marking menus which integrates menus and marks such that both self-explanation and efficient interaction can be provided. A marking menu allows a user to perform a menu selection by either popping up a radial menu and then selecting an item, or by drawing a straight mark {{in the direction of the}} desired menu item. Drawing a mark avoids popping up the menu. Marking menus can also be hierarchic. In this case, hierarchic radial menus and “zig-zag ” marks are used. Marking menus are based on three design principles: self-revelation, guidance and rehearsal. Self-revelation means a marking menu reveals to a user what functions or items are available. Guidance means a marking menu guides a user in selecting an item. Rehearsal means that the guidanc...|$|R
