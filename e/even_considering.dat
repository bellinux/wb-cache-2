5|$|Before the Battle of Niså, Harald {{had been}} joined by Haakon Ivarsson, who {{distinguished}} himself in the battle and gained Harald's favour. Reportedly <b>even</b> <b>considering</b> {{to give him the}} title of Earl, Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise. With a strong hold over the Uplands, Haakon was additionally given the earldom of Värmland by the Swedish king Stenkil. In early 1064, Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes, the region thus effectively threatening to renounce their loyalty to Harald. The revolt of Haakon and the farmers in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson. After the agreement, Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands, only to find that the farmers would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived. In response, Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon. Still facing opposition from the farmers, Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes. Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country, the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king's realm. Using harsh measures, Harald burned down farms and small villages, and had people maimed and killed. Starting in Romerike, his campaign continued into Hedmark, Hadeland and Ringerike. Since the regions contained several rich rural communities, Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates. By the end of 1065 there was probably peace in Norway, as any opposition had either been killed, chased into exile or silenced.|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century, reports {{surfaced}} about a 1982 {{album that}} sounds {{similar to what}} would later be called acid house. The album, , is by Charanjit Singh, a Bollywood session musician from Bombay, and features Indian ragas fused with disco. The album was recorded using the same basic Roland equipment often used for the later acid house music: the TR-808 and particularly the TB-303, which Singh {{was one of the}} first musicians to utilize. The record was initially a commercial failure in India and eventually forgotten, but its re-discovery in 2002 and eventual re-release in early 2010 has prompted comparisons to acid house music, with a few writers <b>even</b> <b>considering</b> it to be the first example of an acid house record.|$|E
25|$|The only {{recorded}} {{evidence of}} his pitching speed stems from 1958, when Dalkowski was sent by the Orioles to Aberdeen Proving Ground, a military installation. Here, using a radar machine, he was clocked at , a fast but not outstanding speed for a professional pitcher. However, several factors worked against Dalkowski: he had pitched a game the day before, he was throwing from a flat surface instead of from a pitcher's mound, {{and he had to}} throw pitches for 40minutes at a small target before the machine could capture an accurate measurement. Further, the device measured speed from {{a few feet away from}} the plate, instead of 10 feet from release as in modern times. This cost Dalkowski approximately 9 MPH, not <b>even</b> <b>considering</b> the other factors.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 he {{advanced}} even further, {{scoring a}} maiden century against Kent, then June 1926 saw Geary produce {{two of his}} finest performances against powerful batting sides (<b>even</b> <b>considering</b> the treacherous pitches): he took fourteen cheap wickets against both Hampshire and Lancashire. The latter match was Lancashire's last defeat {{for over a year}} and a half. He consequently played in two of the Tests that year and saved England from defeat at Headingley with some steady batting whilst George Macaulay hit up 76, but took only three wickets. 1927, with so many very dead wickets, was a struggle for Geary, but on the matting wickets of South Africa he bowled so well to be regarded as the most dangerous bowler since the incomparable Sydney Barnes, taking twelve wickets at Johannesburg.|$|E

25|$|According to UN {{estimates}} {{that are not}} based on any household survey access to an improved water source in Lebanon is universal. The UN figures on water access may not give an accurate picture of the real situation: A representative survey {{carried out by the}} World Bank in 2008 estimated that the average connection rate to the public water network was 80%, varying from 96% in Beirut to 55% in the North. These figures are similar to those that came out of a 2004 Household Living Conditions Survey carried out by the Lebanese Central Administration of Statistics. <b>Even</b> <b>considering</b> that improved water sources include protected wells and springs in addition to piped water connections, it is unlikely that water access in Lebanon is universal. For example, many urban households that are not connected to the network rely on water bought from tanker trucks.|$|E
25|$|The {{friendship}} between Bacalbașa and Mille had soured over those months, and Toni soon left Adevărul for good. It {{is possible that}} this rift occurred because of Beldiman, who ceded his stock to Mille without <b>even</b> <b>considering</b> Bacalbașa for a successor. The issue was {{of interest to the}} entire socialist movement, since Adevărul vied for attention with the same niche of the working public. One of Stere's colleagues, the socialist N. Quinezu, denounced Anton Bacalbașa for being in a conflict of interest, for holding a PSDMR office while still working at Adevărul, and for vetoing funds for the PSDMR sheet Lumea Nouă. On September 25, 1894, Bacalbașa presented his resignation from the PSDMR Council. He also reconciled with Familia, where he published his sketch story La garda pieții ("Guarding the Marketplace", December 1894). Adevărul Literar went out of business on February 13, 1895, and Mille found himself expelled from the PSDMR after the Third Party Congress of April.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, {{a license}} & Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd, and Suzuki of Japan. At first, Maruti Suzuki was mainly an {{importer}} of cars. In India's closed market, Maruti received {{the right to}} import 40,000 fully built-up Suzukis {{in the first two}} years, and even after that the early goal was to use only 33% indigenous parts. This upset the local manufacturers considerably. There were also some concerns that the Indian market was too small to absorb the comparatively large production planned by Maruti Suzuki, with the government <b>even</b> <b>considering</b> adjusting the petrol tax and lowering the excise duty in order to boost sales. Finally, in 1983, the Maruti 800 was released. This 796 cc hatchback was based on the SS80 Suzuki Alto and was India’s first affordable car. Initial product plan was 40% saloons, and 60% Maruti Van. Local production commenced in December 1983. In 1984, the Maruti Van with the same three-cylinder engine as the 800 was released and the installed capacity of the plant in Gurgaon reached 40,000 units.|$|E

Botha's place was taken by acting president, J. Christiaan Heunis. On 2 February 1989, Botha resigned {{as leader of the}} National Party (NP) anticipating his nominee – finance minister Barend du Plessis – would succeed him. Instead, the NP's parliamentary caucus selected as leader education minister F. W. de Klerk, who moved quickly to consolidate his position within the party. In March 1989, the NP elected De Klerk as state president but Botha refused to resign, saying in a television address that the constitution entitled him to remain in office until March 1990 and that he was <b>even</b> <b>considering</b> running for another five-year term. Following a series of acrimonious meetings in Cape Town, and five days after UNSCR 435 was implemented in Namibia on 1 April 1989, Botha and De Klerk reached a compromise: Botha would retire after the parliamentary elections in September, allowing de Klerk to take over as president.|$|E
25|$|The Arab invasions {{and loss}} of {{territory}} was not all that bore heavily upon the Emperor's mind.

Furthermore, {{it appears that the}} Empire was not <b>even</b> <b>considering</b> the Arab threat as a danger. The religious controversies once again emerged when the Patriarch of Constantinople Sergius proposed monothelitism as a compromise to the Chalcedonian Christians and the Monophysites. Heraclius agreed to the proposal. However, it received much criticism {{from both sides of the}} theological debate of Christ's true nature. When Sophronius, a major critic of monothelitism was elected as Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Empire began once again to tear itself apart. To some in the Empire the Arabs' promise of religious freedom seemed preferable to the other, seemingly blasphemous politically motivated proposals. At his death bed on 11 February 641, Heraclius died whispering that he had lied; he was reluctant to support monothelitism. It appears that unity was all that he sought.|$|E
