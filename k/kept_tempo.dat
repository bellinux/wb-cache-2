5000|$|In {{his later}} years, Lombardo lived in Freeport, Long Island, New York where he <b>kept</b> <b>Tempo,</b> Tempo VI, and Tempo VII (built in 1955). He {{invested}} in a nearby seafood restaurant called [...] "Liota's East Point House." [...] It was soon [...] "Guy Lombardo's East Point House." [...] Lombardo later became promoter and musical director of Jones Beach Marine Theater. The venue was built specifically with him in mind by Robert Moses, who was a fan of Lombardo. One of Lombardo's productions at Jones Beach was Paradise Island in 1961. His final production there was the 1977 staging of Finian's Rainbow with Christopher Hewett in the title role.|$|E
50|$|After a {{year out}} of the ring, he signed with K-1 and made his promotional debut at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2012 in Los Angeles in California on September 8, 2012 against Lerdsila Chumpairtour. Varga dropped the three-time Rajadamnern Stadium {{champion}} with a spinning backfist in the opening round but it was ruled a slip by the referee. Nonetheless, he <b>kept</b> a high <b>tempo</b> and fought aggressively en route to winning by unanimous decision.|$|R
500|$|Shear's {{original}} version of [...] "All Through the Night" [...] {{is set in}} the key of F major, and proceeds at a tempo of approximately 96 beats per minute. For her cover version, Lauper transposed the key up a minor third to A-flat major, and <b>kept</b> the <b>tempo</b> at the same 96 beats per minute as the original. The song is set in common time. Lauper's voice spans an octave and a fourth between G3 and D♭5. Jules Shear himself makes a guest appearance on Lauper's version, singing a wordless falsetto melody near the end, as well as the lower harmony in the choruses. [...] The chorus was unintentionally altered by Lauper from the Shear version when she heard the upper harmony vocal and thought it was the lead vocal. [...] Lyrically, [...] "All Through the Night" [...] addresses the same concept of love and its tug at heart-strings as was emphasized by Lauper's previous single, [...] "Time After Time." ...|$|R

This {{study investigated the}} differential stability of the 2 phase modes. In Experiment 1, in which Ss were instructed {{to remain in the}} initial phase mode, the alternate phase mode was found to be less stable as the frequency of oscillation increased. In addition, analysis of the nonsteady state cycles revealed evidence of a switching to the symmetric phase mode for the initial alternate phase mode trials. In Experiments 2 and 3, Ss were instructed to remain at a noninitial phase angle if it was found to be more comfortable. The transition observed between the 2 phase modes satisfies the criteria of a physical bifurcation—hysteresis, critical fluctuations, and divergence—and is consonant with previous findings on transitions in limb coordination within a person. The coordination of movements between people is an omnipresent aspect of daily life. Such coordinations consist of the very natural and commonplace coordinations exhibited by people walking and talking together and the very practiced and refined coordinations exhibited by people playing sport...|$|R
