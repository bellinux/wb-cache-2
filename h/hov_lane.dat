5|$|By then, {{work was}} already {{advanced}} on several projects, including the northbound <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> on Highway404 (that opened on July23, 2007) and an <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> along both directions of Highway403 between Highway407 and Highway401. A third pair of HOV lanes {{has since been}} introduced to the QEW/403 through Oakville, and a fourth individual <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> travels eastbound on Highway417 from just west of Eagleson Road in Ottawa to just east of Moodie Drive.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{northbound}} <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> began shortly thereafter, {{opening at}} 8:30am on Monday, 23 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|The highway was widened {{to permit}} an {{additional}} <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> {{in either direction}} between Guelph Line and Trafalgar Road starting in 2007. These lanes were opened to traffic on November29, 2010.|$|E
50|$|There are <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> in {{operation}} 24 {{hours a day}} in each direction of SR-170 between I-5 and the Hollywood Split interchange. There is a direct connection from the northbound SR-170 <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> onto the northbound I-5 <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes,</b> {{as well as from the}} southbound I-5 <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> onto the southbound SR-170 <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes.</b> This makes it possible to connect with the I-5 <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> as well as the SR-14 <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> (from the I-5) without merging into regular lanes.|$|R
50|$|As of October 2012, <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> on the Red Mountain section {{run from}} I-10/SR 51 to Gilbert Road. In 2015, the <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> were {{extended}} from Gilbert Road to Broadway Road. <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> are planned to extend to US 60 in Mesa, eventually tying into planned <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> on the Santan Freeway.|$|R
50|$|The Santan section has <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> between I-10/Pecos Rd. and Gilbert Rd. Long term {{plans call}} for <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> to extend to US 60 and to the <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> on the Red Mountain section.|$|R
5|$|The highway {{continues}} directly north {{along the}} old Woodbine Avenue right-of-way to just south of Steeles Avenue, where it diverges to the west before continuing north. From just north of Sheppard, a northbound <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> is present alongside the central median. Southbound, the <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> continues as far as Highway401. Alongside Highway 404 to the east is an industrial warehouse and commercial office area, while on the west is a suburban subdivision of North York. Northbound, the freeway is six lanes wide from Sheppard Avenue to Finch Avenue, where one lane diverges onto an off-ramp, re-emerging north of Finch. Southbound, it is six lanes wide from Steeles south to Sheppard.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the three}} {{original}} HOV lanes in Ontario opened on Highway404 in late 2005; {{the other two were}} the lanes on Highway403. In early 2004, construction began on a new ramp to westbound Highway401, curving beneath the southbound lanes of Highway404. On 13 December 2005, the southbound <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> was opened to traffic.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 2016, it was {{announced}} that the segment between Highway 407 and Stouffville Road would be widened from six to eight lanes, and that an <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> would be added in each direction. The project will also add a carpool lot at Major Mackenzie Drive, upgrade overpasses at Highway 7 and 16th Avenue, and replace the Rouge River overpass. The project will start in 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2021.|$|E
40|$|High-occupancy-vehicle (<b>HOV)</b> <b>lanes</b> {{are often}} {{suggested}} as a cost-effective alternative to address growing traffic congestion problems by providing priority treatment for buses and carpools. As {{a consequence of}} introduction of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes,</b> some auto drivers would switch to buses and carpools, thereby reducing total vehicle demand, whereas there would be fewer lanes available for the remaining vehicles, thus possibly increasing the time cost of solo drivers. It is therefore an important issue to evaluate the efficiency of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> based on some system-wide cost-effectiveness measures. This short note presents a simple demand-supply equilibrium model to evaluate the benefit resulting from <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes,</b> and therefore determine whether and how many <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> should be introduced in a multilane highway...|$|R
40|$|Collision {{data from}} High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) {{facilities}} with {{two different types}} of access, continuous and limited, are examined in this paper. The findings show that HOV facilities with limited access offer no safety advantages over those with a continuous access. Compared with continuous access <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes,</b> a higher percentage of collisions was concentrated on limited access <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes.</b> Limited access <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> also had higher collision rates. Findings from investigating the relationship between collision rates in <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> with respect to shoulder width, length of access, and the proximity of access to its neighboring ramps are also documented. These findings provide enhanced understanding about the effects of geometric factors on the collision rates in <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes.</b> Engineering...|$|R
50|$|Critics {{have argued}} that <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> are underused. It is unclear whether <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> are {{sufficiently}} used to compensate for delays in the other mixed-use lanes.|$|R
5|$|Southbound, {{the freeway}} {{is divided into}} two {{carriageway}}s, both of which provide access to the DVP. The outer carriageway also provides access from Sheppard and to Highway401, including the westbound express lanes, while the inner carriageway is intended for DVP-bound traffic. The <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> also provides access to westbound Highway401 via a dedicated tunnel, which passes beneath the other southbound lanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} portion east of I-805 to South Worthington Street was {{upgraded to}} a freeway {{in the late}} 1990s, and an <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> opened in each direction, east of I-805 only. The first part from I-805 to near Woodman Street was finished in November1993. The second part was to begin the construction phase in 1994; this was complete by 1998. The state legislature allowed for the relinquishment of SR54 from the El Cajon city limit to I-8 to the City of El Cajon in 1999, and the transfer took place that year.|$|E
5|$|The Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, a {{study of}} how to handle Long Island traffic issues in 2020, was started in 1997 by {{engineers}} from NYSDOT. The preferred alternative in the study would widen several parkways on the island, inserting high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) for buses and carpools. The Meadowbrook would receive a new <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> between the Southern and Northern state parkways, while everything south of the Southern State Parkway would remain the same. The Northern State Parkway would get lanes from the Long Island Expressway to the Meadowbrook, and the Southern State would get lanes from the Meadowbrook to the Sunrise Highway.|$|E
500|$|More than [...] of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> are {{currently}} proposed for construction by 2031. Future plans include extending existing <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> and introducing {{them to other}} 400-series freeways.|$|R
50|$|Some underused <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> {{in several}} states have been {{converted}} to high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT), which offer solo drivers access to <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> after paying a toll.|$|R
40|$|High-occupancy-vehicle (<b>HOV)</b> <b>lanes</b> and toll {{differentiation}} {{have been}} used as efficient measures to address growing traffic congestion problems by providing priority treatment for buses and carpools. This paper deals with carpooling behavior and optimal congestion pricing in a multilane highway with or without <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes.</b> It is shown that in the absence of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes,</b> a uniform toll for all vehicles (independent of their number of occupants) should be charged to achieve a first-best social optimum. However, in the presence of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes,</b> first-best pricing for a social optimum requires differentiating the toll per vehicle across segregated lanes. In the case where toll differentiation cannot be applied, the optimal uniform toll for the second-best solution in the presence of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> should be set to be a weighted average of the marginal external congestion costs between non-carpooling and carpooling commuters. Our theoretical observations have strong practical implications for combined implementation of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> and congestion pricing.

25|$|In 2014, the {{province}} announced a massive expansion and redevelopment project {{to the existing}} highway #410 in Brampton. The project includes widening the highway, resurfacing the highway, new overhead signs, lighting, medians, an <b>HOV</b> <b>lane,</b> new guardrails, landscaping and ponds.|$|E
25|$|Tolls {{are only}} {{collected}} from westbound traffic at the toll plaza {{on the east}} side of the bay. Since July 2010, the toll rate for passenger cars is $5. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $5 per axle. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the FasTrak electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only <b>HOV</b> <b>lane,</b> allowing carpool vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{comparisons of}} traffic safety {{during the morning}} and afternoon peak hours in extended stretches of eight High Occupancy Vehicle (<b>HOV)</b> <b>lanes</b> with {{two different types of}} access – four corridors with continuous access and the others with limited access. Traffic collision patterns in two different types of <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> were investigated by evaluating 1) the differences in collision distribution, severity, types of collisions and per lane traffic utilization, 2) spatial distribution of collision concentrations by using Continuous Risk Profile (CRP) approach, and 3) collision rates in the vicinity of access points in <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> with limited access. In the paper, the authors conducted detailed analysis on collision data occurred during peak hours in relation to geometry and traffic features. Based on the findings from the assessment on eight routes, the limited access <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> appear to offer no safety advantages over the continuous access <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes.</b> Such difference is due to more frequent and sporadic distribution of collision concentration in limited access <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes...</b>|$|R

50|$|The traffic speed {{differential}} between <b>HOV</b> and general-purpose <b>lanes</b> {{creates a}} potentially dangerous situation if the <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> are not {{separated by a}} barrier. A Texas Transportation Institute study found that <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> lacking barrier separations caused a 50% increase in injury crashes.|$|R
25|$|Of {{particular}} interest in the investigation is {{the design of the}} exit itself. Several factors played a possible role, including the fact that the exit was an atypical left exit; inadequate advance notice was given of this setup; the HOV exit was signed differently than standard exits; the arrow on the exit sign misled drivers about where the <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> continued; and the exit ramp itself had poor signage.|$|E
25|$|Motorcycles {{have been}} allowed to use most of the bus lanes in the city since 1996.

25|$|About 5:38am EST, while {{operating}} the motorcoach southbound in a left-hand <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> of I-75 in the Atlanta metropolitan area, the driver accidentally entered a left exit ramp, which ended abruptly at an elevated T-junction {{marked by a}} stop sign. When it {{reached the top of}} the ramp and the stop sign, the bus was traveling at highway speed. The driver lost control of the bus, which slid sideways into a concrete bridge wall and chain-link security fence, then fell 19 feet, landing on its left side across the interstate highway below. Twenty-nine passengers survived the crash, while seven occupants were killed.|$|E
25|$|In Houston, I-45 meets Interstate Highway 610 and State Highway 35 at a {{complicated}} interchange. At the merge with Spur 5, a short freeway spur to the University of Houston, elevated collector/distributor roads (also part of Spur 5) begin. The C/D roads and the <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> end at Dowling Street, the original {{end of the}} Gulf Freeway. Just past Dowling Street is an interchange with Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 (Eastex Freeway and Southwest Freeway) and State Highway 288 (South Freeway), after which I-45 technically becomes the North Freeway as it runs along the northwest half of the block between Pierce Street and Gray Street as the Pierce Elevated.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas, or METRO, offers bus {{services}} {{available at the}} south side of Terminal C. The 102 Bush IAH Express serves the airport. Previously, METRO also operated an express bus service known as Airport Direct, launched in the summer of 2008, which traveled from Downtown Houston to Terminal C via the <b>HOV</b> <b>lane</b> of the Eastex Freeway (I-69)/(US 59). In 2010, in an effort to increase ridership and maximize revenue, METRO reduced the fare of Airport Direct and closed a dedicated passenger plaza for the service in Downtown Houston; instead, the bus stopped at several downtown hotels. The fare each way was reduced from $15 to $4.50. The fare change increased ridership levels but reduced cash flow. METRO consistently provided the service at an operational loss. However, in the summer of 2011, METRO announced it was discontinuing the Airport Direct service, while the Route 102 local service (which serves the greater Greenspoint business and residential district before traveling on I-45 to access downtown) continued to operate.|$|E

50|$|The MTO began {{planning}} {{for the use of}} high-occupancy vehicle (<b>HOV)</b> <b>lanes</b> with the <b>HOV</b> Opportunities Study, contracted to McCormick Rankin in 2001. This led to the test trial of three <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> in the GTA in December 2005: southbound Highway 404 between Highway 7 and Highway 401, with a dedicated HOV ramp built to connect with westbound Highway 401, and Highway 403 in both directions between Highway 407 and Highway 401 in Mississauga.Since then, <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> have been opened on several 400-series freeways around the Golden Horseshoe and National Capital Region.

50|$|<b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> {{are present}} {{on more than}} 1200 North American freeway route-miles (1900 route-kilometers), and {{are by far the}} most common form of managed <b>lane.</b> All <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> {{accommodate}} buses, and sometimes other vehicles such as motorcycles and hybrids since the combined demand of each of these modes can usually be accommodated by a single lane. The majority of HOV facilities exist as single lanes that are concurrent with adjacent general purpose freeway <b>lanes.</b> Most commonly, <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> are separated from mixed use lanes by a painted stripe or buffer, although some are separated by a physical barrier, either fixed or moveable. Depending on the design, <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> may have continuous access to concurrent flow lanes or traffic may only be able to enter and exit at designated access locations. Some <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> are reversible to serve directional demands at different times of the day; these facilities are separated by a permanent barrier and are accessed via exclusive ramps. Contraflow <b>HOV</b> <b>lanes</b> borrow an off-peak direction lane for peak commute purposes, and they use placement of pylons or moveable barriers to safely segregate oncoming traffic flow.|$|R
