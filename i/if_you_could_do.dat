Domains measured include child symptoms and functional impairment, parental stress, child strengths, time spent in out-of-home placements (e. g. inpatient hospitalization), and school disciplinary information, e. g. attendance, suspensions. As part of the evaluation, caregivers completed semi-structured telephone interviews three and nine months after enrollment into CFFC, during which standardized measures of fidelity, involvement in services, and parent empowerment were administered. In addition, CMHSR evaluators asked caregivers three open-ended questions to assess satisfaction with the CFFC program. Questions included: 1. What is your favorite thing about the program? 2. What would <b>you</b> change, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could?</b> 3. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> have anything else {{to say about the}} team? Responses to these questions, as well as spontaneous comments offered by caregivers during the telephone interview protocol, were recorded. These data were coded into thematic categories by two raters: inter-rater reliability of 93 % was computed. RESULTS Four themes emerged from the analysis of the data. 4 Identified themes included: encouragement to participate in treatment planning; support during the wraparound process; focus on child and family strengths; and concerns surrounding discharge. Caregivers were encouraged to participate in the treatment planning process Caregivers reported that teams listened to their ideas and didn't make decisions without them.

6000|$|I was now {{relieved}} {{from all}} {{charge of the}} brig; and a relief I found it, between shoals, enemies, and the tides, of which I knew nothing. That day {{we got into the}} Downs, and came-to. Here I saw a fleet at anchor; and a pretty stir it made among the man-of-war's-men, when our story was repeated among them. I do think twenty of their boats were alongside of us, to get the facts from the original source. Among others who thus appeared, to question me, was one old gentleman, whom I suspected of being an admiral. He was in shore-dress, and came in a plain way; the men in his boat declining to answer any questions; but they paid him unusual respect. This gentleman asked me a great many particulars, and I told him the whole story frankly, concealing or colouring nothing. He was evidently much interested. When he went away, he shook me cordially by the hand, and said--"Young gentleman, you have acted prudently and well. Never mind the grumbling of some of our lads; they think only of themselves. It was your right and your duty to save your own vessel, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> without <b>doing</b> anything dishonourable; and I see nothing wrong in your conduct.
