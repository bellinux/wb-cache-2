25|$|Delaware {{experienced}} all {{the contention}} and bitterness of a border {{state in the}} Civil War and the {{events leading up to}} it, but because of its location and certain decisive military action, was spared much of the bloodshed of Kentucky and Missouri. Nevertheless, the divisions in communities and families, and their corresponding strong feelings were the same. A slave state with very few slaves or slaveholders, many in Delaware had an attitude they called “states rights,” which really meant, “Outsiders are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what to do.” Given the close economic ties to Philadelphia, and the geographical separation from the Confederacy, there was little sentiment for actual secession. However, the opposition to the abolitionist and voting rights agenda of the Republican federal government were strong enough to create considerable contentiousness. These feeling were strongest in the two lower counties, which still had a majority of the population in 1860, and completely dominated the General Assembly, the real decision maker in the state.|$|E

Archive curator Nicholas Meriwether, who has also written extensively about the culture {{and its impact on}} society, states [...] "The Grateful Dead archive is going to end up being a critical way for us to approach and understand the 1960s and the counterculture of the era...It’s also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> a lot about the growth and development of modern rock theater, and it’s helping us understand fan culture." ...|$|E
5000|$|Anatot {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{settlements}} linked by a road secretly built by settlers in 1995. The road links Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road {{was one of a}} number under clandestine construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if the Israel Defense Forces told him to. He also said [...] "What are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> take the road away? If the road is illegal let them take us to court." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He co-founded the group, {{but left}} {{following}} {{the recording of}} their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song [...] "Just for You". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly toured with the band in 1971 and played on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled, [...] "We all Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood tended to write together, but Dave would {{come in with a}} complete song that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sing and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all what he expected us to play. No discussion, like we were his backing group." ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 7, it was {{announced}} that the hoof abscess Classic Empire had developed earlier in the season had returned, and that the colt would not start in the Belmont Stakes. Casse described the affliction as [...] "the same thing that got him after the Holy Bull. When we came in this morning, he could hardly get around. And there is a very good chance that in the next hour it will bust and he'll be fine, but even with that, we wouldn't want to do that to him." [...] His connections instead began preparing him for a summer campaign, with the Haskell Invitational as a possible next start. Classic Empire began preparing for the Haskell Invitational but only had one unrecorded breeze before being sidelined again, with his hoof and back bothering him again. Mark Casse then said they would train up to the Travers Stakes at Saratoga. He missed the Travers, too, but this time Classic Empire's hoof was completely better, he was just not enthusiastic about training at Saratoga because of the humidity, with Mark Casse saying: [...] "He just hasn't had as much energy, day-to-day. He'll have a good day and then he'll have kind of an off-day. He's behaving perfectly. It's just his energy level. His foot seems to be great. He's a little bit like Tepin. I see some similarities between the two from this time last year. He likes it chillier, too. I don't want to give a specific date because then everyone is disappointed if we don't do it. Instead of <b>us</b> <b>telling</b> him what we want him <b>to</b> do, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what he wants to do.It was then announced that Classic Empire would just wait for the Pennsylvania Derby, where he would have more time to prepare and the weather would be cooler.|$|R

6000|$|First Friar. I {{wonder if}} the Superior will mind our taking the branches. They are only cut on Palm Sunday other years. What will he tell us, I wonder?

60|$|Pilgrims, I desire {{first to}} thank those {{undergraduates}} of Oxford. When {{a man has}} grown so old as I am, when he has reached the verge of seventy-two years, {{there is nothing that}} carries him back to the dreamland of his life, to his boyhood, like recognition of those young hearts up yonder. And so I thank them out of my heart. I desire to thank the Pilgrims of New York also for their kind notice and message which they have cabled over here. Mr. Birrell says he does not know how he got here. But {{he will be able to}} get away all right--he has not drunk anything since he came here. I am glad to know about those friends of his, Otway and Chatterton--fresh, new names to me. I am glad of the disposition he has shown to rescue them from the evils of poverty, and if they are still in London, I hope to have a talk with them. For a while I thought he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> the effect which my book had upon his growing manhood. I thought he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how much that effect amounted to, and whether it really made him what he now is, but with the discretion born of Parliamentary experience he dodged that, and we do not know now whether he read the book or not. He did that very neatly. I could not do it any better myself.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Pollstar published on March 26, 2014, bassist Tom Drummond explained {{the gap between the}} band's 2009 release Paper Empire and All Together Now:"We decided {{that we were going to}} put this out on our own terms. Nobody was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> we had to put one out right now and then we’d rush through a bunch of songs to put out. We didn’t want to do that. We wanted to make the album we wanted to make ... So we took our time with it, we hired the right producer and we’re very excited about it." ...|$|E

Ah! {{he was a}} real hearty fellow; he would tell you all kinds of queer things, and would pump you dry of all you knew in no time. Well, but the thing I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you was this. One of the men said to him he had heard that the greenness of the Greenland Sea, was caused by the little things like small bits of jelly, on which the whales feed. As soon as he heard this he got a bucket and hauled some sea-water aboard, and for the next ten days he was never done working away with the sea-water; pouring it into {{tumblers}} and glasses; looking through it by daylight and by lamplight; tasting it, and boiling it, and examining it with a microscope." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tad Pilati of the Roberts team said of Rainey: [...] “There’s {{no feeling}} {{from the center}} of his chest down. He’s being held at a {{hospital}} near Rimini. He’s in stable condition, and the next 48 hours are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> everything.” [...] Rainey would be paralysed from the chest down, and never walk again. He stayed in motorcycle racing in management roles, and has raced in a hand-control shifter kart, often with his motorcycle racing rival Eddie Lawson. Rainey has raced the shifter kart exhibition race held at Red Bull United States Grand Prix, which features motorcycle racing legends.|$|E

He narrates Moon Over Morocco (the only Jack Flanders adventure narrated by a character within the story) and is a principal character in this adventure, but never recurs in any other adventure. Kelly is fond of adages and gets into {{a bit of a}} contest with Mojo, the two of them quipping increasingly esoteric sayings back and forth. At the beginning of Moon Over Morocco Kelly warns us that not all of what he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> will necessarily be true.|$|E
