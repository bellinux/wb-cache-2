50|$|Each card {{contains}} the wanted person's address and, if available, the job performed by that individual. The highest-ranking cards, {{starting with the}} aces and kings, {{were used for the}} people {{at the top of the}} most-wanted list. The ace of spades <b>is</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> the aces of clubs and hearts are his sons Qusay and Uday respectively, and the ace of diamonds is Saddam's presidential secretary Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti. This strict correspondence to the order of the most-wanted list was not carried through the entire deck, but some time later in 2003, the list itself was renumbered to conform (almost) to the deck of cards. The card backs feature a green military camouflage pattern.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{of those}} same targets of {{criticism}} would later become fierce advocates of neoconservative policies. During 1992, referring to the first Iraq War, then United States Secretary of Defense and future Vice President Richard Cheney said: I would guess if we had gone in there, I would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We {{would not have been}} able to get everybody out and bring everybody home....And the question in my mind is how many additional American casualties <b>is</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> worth? And the answer is not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the president made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.|$|E

I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.And the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties <b>is</b> <b>Saddam</b> (<b>Hussein)</b> worth? And the answer is, not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.Instead of a greater involvement of its own military, the US hoped that Saddam would be overthrown in an internal coup d'état. The CIA used its assets in Iraq to organize a revolt, but the Iraqi government defeated the effort.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{a debate}} among {{scholars}} regarding the true power of Hassan al-Bakr and <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> in their relation to the Revolutionary Command Council. Some scholars argue that early on the RCC [...] "functioned as a genuine collective decision-making body, and was often the arena for heated debates." [...] Many argue it <b>was</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> who greatly changed and controlled the RCC by eliminating any manifestations of pluralism. The government under Hussein was often seen as a brutal dictatorship. In 1979, Hussein “accused dozens of party officers and party officials, including five of the RCC’s twenty-two members, of {{taking part in a}} Syrian plot against the regime. [...] The accused were put on trial and sent to death. Hussein’s actions {{at the beginning of his}} presidency greatly limited the plurality in the RCC with his accusations against the Syrian plot “conspirators.” This action consolidated his power in the RCC.|$|R

Although Ba'ath Party founder Michel Aflaq called for {{equal rights for}} all ethnic and religious minorities under Arab rule, in practice the new regime ultimately became more chauvinist than any before. The Arab nationalists had not forgotten the atrocities they suffered {{at the hands of}} the Mulla Mustafa and the Barzanis in 1959. Ironically, one of the Baath's leading advocates of a more considered and amenable approach to the Kurdish question in these early days <b>was</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> Ahmad and Talabani also welcomed the new Ba'ath regime, as they felt more at home with its socialist ethos than any previous Baghdad government.|$|R
