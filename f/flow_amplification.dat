40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with utilizing the acoustic analogy approach to predict the sound from unheated supersonic jets. Previous attempts have been unsuccessful at making such predictions over the Mach number range of practical interest. The present paper, therefore, focuses on implementing the necessary refinements needed to accomplish this objective. The important effects influencing peak supersonic noise {{turn out to be}} source convection, mean flow refraction, mean <b>flow</b> <b>amplification,</b> and source non-compactness. It appears that the last two effects have not been adequately dealt with in the literature. The first of these because the usual parallel flow models produce most of the amplification in the so called critical layer where the solution becomes singular and, therefore, causes the predicted sound field to become infinite as well. We deal with this by introducing a new weakly non parallel flow analysis that eliminates the critical layer singularity. This has a strong effect on the shape of the peak noise spectrum. The last effect places severe demands on the source models at the higher Mach numbers because the retarded time variations significantly increase the sensitivity of the radiated sound to the source structure in this case. A highly refined (non-separable) source model is, therefore, introduced in this paper...|$|E
40|$|By using {{distributed}} {{arrays of}} micro-actuators as effectors, micro-sensors {{to detect the}} optimal actuation location, and microelectronics to provide close loop feedback decisions, a low power control system has been developed for controlling a UAV. Implementing the Microsensors, Microactuators, and Microelectronics leads to {{what is known as}} a M 3 (M-cubic) system. This project involves demonstrating the concept of using small actuators (~micron-millimeter scale) to provide large control forces for a large-scale system (~meter scale) through natural <b>flow</b> <b>amplification</b> phenomenon. This is theorized by using fluid separation phenomenon, vortex evolution, and vortex symmetry on a delta wing aircraft. By using MEMS actuators to control leading edge vortex separation and growth, a desired aerodynamic force can be produced about the aircraft for flight control.

By knowing the leading edge separation line, a closely coupled micro actuation from the effectors can cause the required separation that leads to vortex control.

40|$|It is {{proved that}} a small liquid stream or a {{triggered}} landslide may occasionally evolve into a debris flow. As its propagation takes place, available sediments from the bottom slope and nearby banks can be added. In addition, under certain conditions, the entrainment yields an increase of both mass and momentum, enhancing {{the efficiency of the}} resulting movement. The same efficiency can be as well sustained by bed liquefaction and mass fluidification. The first is due to an abruptly increase of fluid pore pressure of the bed when overridden, causing a falling of effective shear stresses and therefore behaving like a liquid, the latter consists of the dynamic interaction between sediments and fluid porosity inside the propagating mass, responsible of both high pore pressures and continuous modification of voids and matrix distribution. The amplification process is therefore essential for a proper hazard assessment. For example, average volumes mobilized during the 1998 events of Sarno (Italy), have been three times the initial detached volumes. The work here presented means to analyze debris <b>flow</b> <b>amplification</b> features, from the first stages up to the entrainment processes As main result, we obtain that reducing bed slope decreases the amplification to the point it is negligible. This {{is due to the fact}} that both bed liquefaction and mass fluidification are attenuated. A mitigation intervention consisting of a check dam system causes a reduction of the original bed slope, determining debris flow volumes to be stored and a stabilization of the banks at the same time. Other mitigation strategies, consisting of open dams and storing reservoirs, do not act likely, hence sustaining the effect of mass amplified. As a check dam system is realized, the slope decreases over time since sediments mobilized by small floods fill on upstream the single dam, eventually reaching the final design slope. The allocation of a check dam system, needed to decrease the amplification process, is not random but related to the position of the areas of triggering formation. Such areas are concentrated along the upstream impluvium heads, named Zero Order Basin (ZOB). We propose a one-dimentional numerical model based on a finite difference scheme. The ruling equations implemented are taken from (Egashira et al., 2000), accounting for erodible beds. Results show that exists a relationship between the original bed slopes and the amount of added volumes. Moreover, varying the different input parameters a particular temporal and spatial evolution of both debris flow and erodible bed is presented. Other numerical analyses have been carried out in (Viccione and Bovolin, 2010; 2011). Concluding, check dam systems with attained design slope of 10 - 15...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} fluid-structure {{interaction}} (FSI) problem of elastic membrane aerofoils at low Reynolds numbers. The {{dynamics of the}} fluid and membrane coupled system is studied via direct numerical simulation (DNS) using a newly developed computational framework whose characteristics and validation are included in this report. A set of two-dimensional DNS were performed for varying Reynolds number, membrane elasticity and aerofoil geometry in order to investigate {{the effect of these}} relevant fluid and structural parameters on the behaviour of fluid-structure coupled system. Static and dynamic features of the system, and their effect in aerodynamic properties, are described and compared for the different parameter combinations. The case with highest Reynolds number, Re = 10; 000, and intermediate elasticity was chosen as a base case to further study the fluid-structure coupling mechanism, particularly at low angle of attack conditions. The dynamic behaviour was characterised via spectral analysis in the frequency and wavenumber-frequency domains, which allowed the propagating wave nature of the membrane vibrations and their effect on the surrounding pressure field fluctuations to be clarified. The membrane vibrations are found to introduce upstream-propagating pressure waves that seem to be responsible for a loss in aerodynamic efficiency compared to a rigid aerofoil. Stability aspects of the FSI problem are also investigated by performing numerical experiments to analyse the response of the system to initial flow perturbations. The solutions of the 2 D DNS are used as initial conditions for three-dimensional simulations, upon which initial perturbations in spanwise velocity are added. As the simulation is advanced in time the evolution of the perturbations is studied to determine the stability characteristics of the <b>flow.</b> <b>Amplifications</b> of the perturbations are found for Re > 10; 000. The coupling of the fully three-dimensional developed flow and the elastic aerofoil is also analysed with spectral techniques.

40|$|Recently, {{focus has}} been placed on ocean energy {{resources}} because environmental concerns regarding the exploitation of hydrocarbons are increasing. Among the various ocean energy sources, tidal current power (TCP) is recognized as the most promising energy source in terms of predictability and reliability. The enormous energy potential in TCP fields has been exploited by installing TCP systems. The flow velocity is the most important factor for power estimation of a tidal current power system. The kinetic energy of the flow is proportional to the cube of the flow’s velocity, and velocity is a critical variable in the performance of the system. Since the duct can accelerate the flow velocity, its use could expand the applicable areas of tidal devices to relatively low velocity sites. The inclined angle of the duct and the shapes of inlet and outlet affect the acceleration rates of the flow inside the duct.

Linear inviscid analysis is used to study the effect of upstream temperature fluctuations on the evolution of turbulent kinetic energy k across the shock. The dominant mechanisms contributing to the k amplification are identified and then modeled in a physically consistent way.

Physical processes dominate site formation at fully submerged wreck sites, and in turn influence chemical and biological processes at many stages of site formation. Scouring presents a fundamental yet poorly understood threat to wreck sites, and the processes and patterns of erosion and deposition of sediments and artefacts at wreck sites are poorly understood. Laboratory and field based experiments to study these phenomena are time-consuming and expensive. In this study open-source computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are used to model the processes and patterns of flow, erosion, and deposition at fully submerged wreck sites.

The onset of streamwise vortices is accompanied by significant distortion in the transverse distribution of the streamwise velocity component. The presence of inflexion points, absent in corresponding velocity distributions of the unforced flow, suggests the formation of locally unstable regions of large shear in which broadband perturbations already present in the base <b>flow</b> undergo rapid <b>amplification,</b> followed by breakdown to small-scale motion.

40|$|A {{number of}} methods of {{reducing}} the drag over airfoils have been investigated. This paper considers the use of riblets, which are structures that run {{parallel to one another}} that are positioned longitudinally to the flow. It has been shown experimentally that when the shape, spacing and height of the riblets are optimized, the drag coefficient can be reduced by up to 10 %. These results have been confirmed by direct numerical simulation studies. However, the mechanism of drag reduction is unclear. This paper examines the effect of riblet structures on the amplification of background noise within channel flow between two parallel plates (Poiseuille flow), where riblets are present on the surface of one of the plates. A linearized version of the Navier-Stokes equation about the steady flow is developed and through a coordinate transformation, the boundary conditions associated with the riblets are transferred into the partial differential equations. Spectral methods are used to discretize these equations, leading to a large-scale state space model. The energy amplification is calculated for the streamwise constant component of the flow from the controllability grammian and the associated Lyapunov equation is solved efficiently by exploiting the structure of the problem.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} magnetic-energy amplification by a turbulent flow of conducting fluid. This effect {{is known as the}} small-scale turbulent dynamo, and it is believed to be relevant in application to magnetic fields in astrophysical objects. It is, in fact, a generic property of random (in time and/or space) flows that they can amplify magnetic fluctuations at scales smaller than the scale of the <b>flow</b> itself. The <b>amplification</b> is a net result of stretching of the field lines by the ambient random shear associated with the flow [1, 13, 3]. The fields that are generated by this mechanism have a characteristic structure: they concentrate in flux folds containing antiparallel field lines that reverse direction at the resistive scale and remain straight up to the flow scale [7, 10, 11]. Because of the direction reversals, the magnetic energy in the wave-number space concentrates at the resistive scale [5, 6]. The properties of the small-scale dynamo are most pronounced for systems where the fluid viscosity is much larger than magnetic diffusivity (magnetic Prandtl number Prm = ν/η ≫ 1), i. e., where magnetic fields reverse direction at scales much smaller than the viscous cutoff of the fluid turbulence. This regime is realised in many astrophysical plasmas: examples are warm interstellar medium, intracluster and intergalactic plasmas, solar corona. In this note, w...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} secondary vortical structures in a plane mixing layer subjected to spanwise-nonuniform excitation has been studied in a closed-return water facility. It is shown that secondary vortices may result from spanwise-nonuniformities in the nominally two-dimensional vorticity layer close to the flow partition, or from spanwise core deformations of the primary vortices further downstream. These distinctly different mechanisms are excited by time-harmonic wavetrains with spanwise amplitude or phase variations, respectively, synthesized by a mosaic of surface film heaters flush-mounted on the flow partition. The appearance of the secondary vortical structures is accompanied by significant distortions in transverse distributions of the streamwise velocity component. Inflection points, which are not present in corresponding velocity distributions of the unforced flow, suggest the formation of locally unstable regions of large shear in which broadband perturbations, already present in the base <b>flow,</b> undergo rapid <b>amplification.</b> This amplification is followed by breakdown to turbulence thus producing the small-scale motion necessary for mixing transition. The present investigation further shows that the flow is extremely receptive to spanwise-periodic amplitude excitation at any wavelength synthesizable by the heater mosaic. Spanwise-periodic phase excitation leads to substantial deformations of the primary vortices, although the receptivity of the flow {{appears to have a}} short wavelength cutoff. Spanwise-nonuniform amplitude and phase excitations at a subharmonic frequency of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability result in complex pairing interactions of the primary vortices...|$|R

40|$|In 1930, a canal was {{excavated}} {{to connect}} the Lesina Lagoon with the Adriatic Sea, modifying the track of the previous existing Acquarotta canal. The 1100 m long stretch of the canal situated next to the coast exposed unknown highly cavernous gypsum bedrock underlying a loose sandy cover. During the last two decades, {{a large number of}} cover collapse and cover suffosion sinkholes have formed along two bands situated next to the canal, impinging the adjacent Lesina Marina residential area. The area affected by subsidence has increased exponentially from 1999 to 2009. The tight spatial correlation between the sinkholes and the canal reveals that the subsidence phenomenon has been induced by the local hydrogeological changes caused by the canal in the coastal evaporite aquifer: (1) Local lowering of the average water table. (2) Deflection of the groundwater flow lines towards the canal and increase in <b>flow</b> velocity. (3) <b>Amplification</b> of the groundwater level oscillations, largely controlled by the tidal regime. (4) Local reversals in the groundwater flow, changing the canal temporarily from effluent to influent. These changes in the hydrogeological functioning of the system have favoured both internal erosion and karstification processes. Hydrochemical evidence reveals that gypsum dissolution is a currently active process favoured by fresh water and sea water mixing and cationexchange processes. Most likely, the partial replacement of a concrete lining in the canal by pervious gabions in 1993 provided more adequate conditions for the evacuation of the sediments filling the karst conduits, accelerating internal erosion and sinkhole development...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of spanwise instability modes and 3 -D) pulsed disturbances {{leading to the}} formation of streamnwise vortices in a plane mixing layer and subsequently to the onset of small-scale 3 -D motion were studied in a closed-return water facility. Streamwise vortices may result from a spanwise core instability of the primary vortices, or a spanwise instability of the nominally 2 - 1) strain field between them. These two instability modes were excited by time-harmonic wavetrains with spanwise phase or amplitude variations, respectively, synthesized by a mosaic of surface film heaters flush-mounted on the flow partition. 0 The appearance of the streamnwise vortices is accompanied by significant distortion in the transverse distribution of the streamwise velocity component. Inflection points, which are not present in corresponding velocity distributions of the unforced flow, indicate the formation of locally unstable regions of large shear in which broadband perturbations already present in the base <b>flow</b> undergo rapid <b>amplification</b> which is followed by breakdown to turbulence and mixing transition. The core instability of the primary vortices suggests itself as viable mechanism for the continuation of the mixing process far downstream of mixing transition. Pulsed excitation was produced by pulsed spanwise amplitude modulation of a spanwise-uniform time-harmonic carrier wave *train synthesized by the surface film heaters. Schlieren visualization showed that the disturbance spreads rapidly in the streamnwise and lateral directions as it is advected downstream, and causes a substantial distortion of the adjacent spanwise vortices. The {{evolution of}} the disturbance depends crucially on the phase between the modulating pulse and the carrie...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionHypoxia induces {{dilatation}} of {{the umbilical}} vein by releasing autocoids from endothelium; prostaglandins (PGs), adenosine and nitric oxide (NO) have been implicated. ATP is vasoactive, thus we tested whether hypoxia releases ATP from primary Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC). MethodsHUVEC were grown on inserts under no-flow conditions. ATP was assayed by luciferin–luciferase and visualised by quinacrine labeling. Intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) was imaged with Fura- 2. ResultsATP release occurred constitutively and was increased by hypoxia (PO 2 : 150 – 8  mmHg), ∼ 10 -fold more from apical, than basolateral surface. Constitutive ATP release was decreased, while hypoxia-induced release was abolished by brefeldin or monensin A, inhibitors of vesicular transport, and LY 294002 or Y 27632, inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3 -kinases (PI 3 K) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). ATP release was unaffected by NO donor, but increased by calcium ionophore, by > 60 -fold from apical, but < 25 % from basolateral surface. Hypoxia induced a small increase in [Ca 2 +]i compared with ATP (10  μM); hypoxia inhibited the ATP response. Quinacrine-ATP fluorescent loci in the perinuclear space, were diminished by hypoxia and monensin, whereas brefeldin A increased fluorescence intensity, consistent with inhibition of anterograde transport. Discussion. Hypoxia within the physiological range releases ATP from HUVEC, particularly from apical/adluminal surfaces by exocytosis, via {{an increase in}} [Ca 2 +]i, PI 3 K and ROCK, independently of NO. We propose that hypoxia releases ATP at concentrations sufficient to induce umbilical vein dilation via PGs and NO and improve fetal blood <b>flow,</b> but curbs <b>amplification</b> of ATP release by autocrine actions of ATP, so limiting its pro-inflammatory effects...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a magnetic configuration consisting of an arcade structure and a detached plasmoid, {{resulting from a}} magnetic reconnection process, as is typically found in connection with solar flares. We study spontaneous current fragmentation caused by shear and vortex plasma flows. An exact analytical transformation method was applied to calculate self-consistent solutions of the nonlinear stationary MHD equations. The assumption of incompressible field-aligned flows implies that both the Alfven Mach number and the mass density are constant on field lines. We first calculated nonlinear MHS equilibria {{with the help of}} the Liouville method, emulating the scenario of a solar eruptive flare configuration with plasmoids and flare arcade. Then a Mach number profile was constructed that describes the upflow along the open magnetic field lines and implements a vortex flow inside the plasmoid. This Mach number profile was used to map the MHS equilibrium to the stationary one. We find that current fragmentation takes place at different locations within our configuration. Steep gradients of the Alfven Mach number are required, implying the strong influence of shear <b>flows</b> on current <b>amplification</b> and filamentation of the MHS current sheets. Crescent- or ring-like structures appear along the outer separatrix, butterfly structures between the upper and lower plasmoids, and strong current peaks close the lower boundary. Impressing an intrinsic small-scale structure on the upper plasmoid results in strong fragmentation of the plasmoid. Hence fragmentation of current sheets and plasmoids is an inherent property of MHD theory. Transformations from MHS into MHD steady-states deliver fine-structures needed for plasma heating and acceleration of particles and bulk plasma flows in dissipative events that are typically connected to magnetic reconnection processes in flares and coronal mass ejections.

40|$|Objective: This study aims {{to assess}} the {{alterations}} in various HPV-related biomarkers 6 months post-treatment and how these relate to various risk factors and individual characteristics; their role for the prediction of treatment failure was also evaluated. Material and methods: Design: Prospective observational study. Population: Women planning to undergo treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Intervention: A liquid-based cytology sample was taken pre-operatively. This was tested for HPV genotyping, Nucleic Acid Sequence Based <b>Amplification,</b> <b>flow</b> cytometric evaluation and p 16 immunostaining. A repeat LBC sample was obtained 6 months post-treatment and was tested for the same biomarkers. Outcomes: The alterations of the biomarkers 6 months post-treatment were recorded. Their relation to individual characteristics and risk factors (age, smoking, sexual history, use of condom, CIN grade, excision margin status, crypt involvement) {{as well as their}} role for the prediction of residual/recurrent disease were assessed. Analysis: The accuracy parameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and the likelihood ratios) of each biomarker for the prediction of recurrent/residual CIN were calculated. Results: A total of 190 women were recruited. All biomarkers had significantly higher negativity rates post-treatment compared to pre-treatment ones. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that consistent condom use post-treatment significantly reduces the high-risk HPV positivity rates in comparison to no use (OR = 0. 18; 95 % CI: 0. 09 - 0. 38). Sensitivity and specificity for all high risk HPV DNA testing were 0. 5 / 0. 62, respectively; the relevant values for only type 16 or 18 DNA typing were 0. 5 / 0. 92, for NASBA 0. 5 / 0. 94, for flow 0. 5 / 0. 85 and for p 16 0. 25 / 0. 93. Conclusion: CIN treatment reduces positivity for all HPV-related biomarkers. Consistent condom use significantly reduces high-risk HPV positivity rates. More cases of treatment failures are required in order to specify whether different combinations of HPV-related biomarkers could enhance the accuracy of follow up, possibly {{in the form of a}} Scoring System that could allow tailored post-treatment surveillance...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{transforming}} Research and Development knowledge to successfully introducing new {{products in the}} market forms a key competency of an innovative company. This new product introduction process was studied at an analytical instrument manufacturing firm. The process of commercialization spanned a number of departments and the process flow lacked functional integration. The current introduction process also lacked a number of management processes, structured feedback loops for information transfer and data metrics for process assessment and evaluation. Due to this, the information related to product knowledge {{was lost in the}} process flow creating isolated compartments which was never shared in the process flow. It was also seen that problems created earlier in the process cascaded through the <b>flow</b> and an <b>amplification</b> effect of the problems was seen later. This combined with micro-management of key processes deliverables and inadequate documentation led to a phenomenon of 'firefighting' during the product introduction process. A new process was created {{for the creation of a}} Quality Inspection Plan, which was earlier missing. The two important deliverables were created as part of the process describing the critical dimensions and design tolerances of the new product. These documents were linked to the existing introduction process as a part of the phase gate review deliverables and would hence establish a structured method for information communication and feedback to Research and Development. These documents would also drive the creation of the Quality Inspection Plan by integrating downstream departments earlier in the process. Certain sub-process within the commercialization process were selected and the process was standardized for feedback- in terms of information as well as possible data base for metrics creation for continuous improvement initiatives. Also a set of recommendations were made to further strengthen and functionally integrate the process in order to reduce redundancies in the current commercialization process. by Aditya Ranjan.
