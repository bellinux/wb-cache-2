The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E

5|$|Football is {{a popular}} {{participatory}} sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer Joe Tomlin started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory <b>he</b> <b>owned.</b> <b>The</b> original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, {{who had just been}} hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to the boys in the league. In his honor, the league was renamed the Pop Warner Conference.|$|E
5|$|He {{bought a}} 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through {{a chain of}} firms, trusts, and {{offshore}} companies in 1994. The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly {{before the end of}} his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that <b>he</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues.|$|E

He was a successful tax lawyer, and his real estate investments {{made him one of}} the nation's wealthiest men. His work brought him into contact with National Football League team owners, and his failed purchase of the Los Angeles Rams placed him in line to become the owner of the fledgling Buccaneer franchise. <b>He</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> team from its inception until his death.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta.

Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them <b>he</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E
5|$|The Cal Neva {{was sold}} in 1975 {{alongside}} the Crystal Bay Club to BKJ Corporation, who consisted of Everett Brunzell, Charles Ketchum and Norman Jenson. The two clubs were purchased {{for a total of}} $9 million. But their licensing application for Cal Neva was turned down by the Nevada Gaming Commission due to a their lack of ongoing finances. The First National Bank of Nevada foreclosed on the property in early 1976 before selling it to Kirk Kerkorian, a significant shareholder in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. <b>He</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> Cal Neva through his Tracinda Investment Corporation, a different entity than the one through which he owns his MGM shares.

5|$|By 1888, {{the estate}} {{was in the}} {{possession}} of Fiennes Stanley Wykeham Cornwallis MP (created 1st Baron Cornwallis in 1927), grandson of the fifth Earl Cornwallis's other daughter Jemima Isabella Mann. <b>He</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> house until his death in 1935. His first son, Captain Fiennes Wykeham Mann Cornwallis MC, was killed in an IRA ambush near Gort, County Galway in 1921, and so the first baron was succeeded by his second son, Wykeham Stanley Cornwallis. The second baron sold the house in 1937 and it became the property of Olaf Hambro, a member of the Hambro banking family. Following the death of Hambro in 1961, the house was sold to the Daubeny family. The house and its nearest surrounding land were sold to the Freemasons in 1974 and were briefly operated as a school before passing into corporate ownership.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{was a more}} {{hands-on}} owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations. He personally financed {{construction of}} the Forum in 1967 {{at a cost of}} $16.5million. <b>He</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67million. Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce. Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate. Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998, and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well. Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988. In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league. Fast food chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor, the company gives all fans in attendance at home games a coupon for two free tacos if the Lakers hold their opponent under 100 points and win. The company also sponsors the team's halftime shows on KCAL-TV and Fox Sports West. In 2013, Buss {{died at the age of}} 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer. His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote. Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.|$|E
5|$|Edward Dalyngrigge was {{a younger}} son and thus {{deprived}} of his father's estates through {{the practice of}} primogeniture, hence {{he had to make}} his own fortunes. By 1378, <b>he</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land-owning family. From 1379 to 1388, Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex {{and one of the most}} influential people in the county. By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate (build a castle), the Hundred Years' War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50years. Edward III of England (reigned 1327–1377) pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais. Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies– groups of mercenaries who fought for the highest bidder. He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel, Duke of Clarence and son of Edward III. After fighting under the Earl of Arundel, Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles, a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100,000gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder. It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle; he returned to England in 1377.|$|E
