For example, a row of isosceles triangles, forming the pasung motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called dhlorong, are commonly used for the head.

5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the <b>head</b> <b>or</b> thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E

Apart from usual meaning of Chamunda as slayer of demons Chanda and Munda, Devi Purana gives a different explanation: Chanda means terrible while Munda stands for Brahma's <b>head</b> <b>or</b> lord or husband.|$|E

Instead, the unique Nash equilibrium of this game is in mixed strategies: each player chooses <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> tails with equal probability. In this way, each player makes the other indifferent between choosing <b>heads</b> <b>or</b> tails, so neither player has an incentive to try another strategy.

5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% on the <b>head</b> <b>or</b> neck. In {{some cases the}} same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
