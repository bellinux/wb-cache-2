40|$|AbstractWe employ 100 -ns {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to study the}} influence of cholesterol on structural and dynamic properties of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers in the fluid phase. The effects of the cholesterol content on the bilayer structure are considered by varying the cholesterol concentration between 0 and 50 %. We concentrate on the <b>free</b> <b>area</b> in the membrane and investigate quantities {{that are likely to}} be affected by changes in the <b>free</b> <b>area</b> and <b>free</b> volume properties. It is found that cholesterol has a strong impact on the <b>free</b> <b>area</b> properties of the bilayer. The changes in the amount of <b>free</b> <b>area</b> are shown to be intimately related to alterations in molecular packing, ordering of phospholipid tails, and behavior of compressibility moduli. Also the behavior of the lateral diffusion of both dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol molecules with an increasing amount of cholesterol can in part be understood in terms of <b>free</b> <b>area.</b> Summarizing, our results highlight the central role of <b>free</b> <b>area</b> in comprehending the structural and dynamic properties of membranes containing cholesterol...|$|R

The material of the electronic component or substrate carrier is partially removed at the respective contact element such that a <b>free</b> <b>area</b> (6) is formed around the contact element, where the <b>free</b> <b>area</b> provides two-dimensional movement of the contact element. The <b>free</b> <b>area</b> is arranged around the column. The <b>free</b> <b>area</b> surrounds the contact elements in a radially symmetrical manner. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing a connecting structure. USE - Connecting structure for connecting an electronic component i. e. semiconductor chip, and/or substrate carrier on a substrate i. e. organic printed circuit board. ADVANTAGE - The <b>free</b> <b>area</b> provides two-dimensional movement of the contact element, so that the different mechanical expansions between the component and/the substrate carrier and the substrate can be balanced, thus improving the electrical-mechanical reliability of the total structure and strongly reducing the critical mechanical voltages at the contact area between the component and/or substrate carrier and the substrate...|$|R

However, smoking rooms do not reduce ETS concentrations in the smoke <b>free</b> <b>area</b> to levels found in smoke free hospitality industry without smoking rooms. The simulation model shows that in particular high density of customers, the intensity of the smoking, the use of swing doors and transfer of smoke from the smoking room to the smoke <b>free</b> <b>area</b> by the ventilation system, are the cause of the 10 to 20 times elevated ETS concentrations [[compared to what?]]]...|$|R

40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>area</b> {{theories}} for {{lateral diffusion}} in lipid bilayers are reviewed and discussed. It {{has been suggested}} by Almeida et al. that <b>free</b> <b>area</b> theories yield quantitative predictions for lateral diffusion coefficients of lipids. We investigate the plausibility of this suggestion by first sketching {{what is to be}} expected of a quantitative theory with predictive power, and subsequently examining whether existing <b>free</b> <b>area</b> theories comply with these expectations. Our conclusion is that current <b>free</b> <b>area</b> theories for lipid bilayers are not quantitative theories with predictive power. They involve a number of adjustable parameters, all of which are not estimated independently, but derived from fitting the theory to the very data whose behavior the theory is supposed to predict. Further, the interpretation and behavior of some of the parameters are ambiguous. The best example is the so-called activation barrier, whose qualitative behavior with the cholesterol concentration in a DMPC bilayer varies depending on the experimental method used to generate the input data and the exact assumptions made to formulate the theory. Independent determination of the activation barrier from numerical simulations or experiments appears to be very difficult...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{algorithm}} incorporating two novel {{ideas is}} {{proposed to improve}} the time performance of the quad tree-based method for planning the shortest path from a given source to any given destination. One of the novel ideas is to combine the free quads. The strength of this idea {{lies in the fact}} that the quads after the total division isolate the free space from the obstacle space. The free quads, which are normally small in size, along the boundary of the obstacles, are combined to form larger <b>free</b> <b>areas.</b> The boundary of every <b>free</b> <b>area</b> is thought of being fenced by a sequence of unit <b>free</b> <b>area</b> cells called frame cells. The size of such a cell is a pixel. The <b>free</b> <b>area</b> together with the frame cells is called framed free space. Thus the entire free space, isolated from the obstacle space, is cognized through the frame cells. The other idea is the adoption of the philosophy of the rectilinear propagation of light rays to trace the shortest path and employ dynamic programming as design strategy to compute the optimal/shortest path through the cognized <b>free</b> <b>area.</b> In the framed free space, all the frame cells hold the information about the shortest distance from it to the source point, computed using the notion of rectilinear propagation of light. The shortest distance from a destination point to a source point is computed using this information. Since the quads are combined to form larger <b>free</b> <b>areas,</b> the number of framed free spaces considered for finding the shortest path is reduced. This in turn reduces the total number of frame cells cognizing the free space so that the total number of frame cells that take part in the computation of the shortest path are drastically reduced. The proposed algorithm works in a 2 D static environment with obstacles of any shape and practically unconstrained size of an autonomous vehicle. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
