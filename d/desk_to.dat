5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E
5|$|Pile and her co-writers {{initially}} used {{battery packs}} to represent characters, moving them around on her <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> develop scenarios for the show. The {{decision to make}} the characters doctors came later. Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.|$|E

While snooping in her <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> take back his yo-yo, he discovers her personal ad, and decides to get revenge on her pulling a prank and responding by mail. He creates a new adult male alter ego named Woodrow, after former President Woodrow Wilson. Edna responds by sending a suggestive photograph. Bart writes a response to Edna, using lines from a old love letter Homer had sent Marge.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, California's George Murphy {{joined the}} Senate, and kept candy in his <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> offer his colleagues, and for himself, though eating {{is not allowed}} on the Senate floor. When he left the Senate after a six-year term, other Republican {{senators}} maintained the custom.

25|$|Devices like moving heads {{also require}} {{independent}} power, as they cannot function on a partially dimmed channel for power, {{on top of}} requiring several other channels in order to convey all of the data they require for their several features. In order to simplify the control of moving head lanterns, instead of assigning channels manually to the lantern, many desks also offer a fixtures section, where one can assign the lantern as a fixture, allowing the <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> organise the data being transferred to the lantern on a much simpler scale for the operator. Fixtures may also incorporate smoke machines, snow machines, haze machines etc., allowing many special effects to be run from a single desk.|$|E

25|$|At {{the advent}} of World War II, BPW {{developed}} a classification system for women with specialized skills critical {{to the war effort}} and supported the formation of women's branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. While wage discrimination has existed in the U.S. since women and minorities first entered the paid workforce, its prevalence was not felt until the massive influx of women sought work during World War II. Immediately following the war, the Women's Pay Act of 1945 - the first ever legislation to require equal pay - was introduced in the U.S. Congress. It was another 18 years before an equal pay bill made its way to the President's <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> be signed into law.|$|E
25|$|When {{president}} Lyndon B. Johnson {{took office}} in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the Wilson desk, the desk from the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and believed {{to be that of}} former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought the Resolute desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until George H. W. Bush returned the Wilson <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> the Senate, preferring the C desk that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. Bill Clinton subsequently brought the Resolute desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
