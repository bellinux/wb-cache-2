In cross country, the rider tends {{to stay out of the}} saddle and be standing up with their <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> the upper body leaning over the horse's withers. The heel of the rider should be in line with their shoulders and then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E
500|$|Bruegel based {{the work}} on the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from Matthew 15:14, in which Christ refers to the Pharisees. [...] According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's {{audience}} was likely as familiar with classical literature as with the Bible. Erasmus had published his Adagia two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation [...] "" [...] ("the blind leader of the blind") by Roman poet Horace. [...] Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. [...] The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.|$|E

60|$|Thus, {{even when}} he came out of his nook to warm himself on a wet day, Toby trotted. Making, with his leaky shoes, a crooked line of slushy {{footprints}} in the mire; and blowing on his chilly hands and rubbing them against each other, poorly defended from the searching cold by threadbare mufflers of grey worsted, with a private apartment only for the thumb, and a common room or tap {{for the rest of the}} fingers; Toby, with his <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> his cane beneath his arm, still trotted. Falling out into the road to look up at the belfry when the Chimes resounded, Toby trotted still.|$|E
6000|$|... "And thus it {{was that}} I, Sitka Charley, saw the baby wolves make their kill. No word is spoken. Only does the stranger-man snarl with his hungry face. Also does he rock to and fro, his {{shoulders}} drooping, his <b>knees</b> <b>bent,</b> <b>and</b> his legs wide apart so {{that he does not}} fall down. The man and the woman stop maybe fifty feet away. Their legs, too, are wide apart so that they do not fall down, and their bodies rock to and fro. The stranger-man is very weak. His arm shakes, so that when he shoots at the man his bullet strikes in the snow. The man cannot take off his mitten. The stranger-man shoots at him again, and this time the bullet goes by in the air. Then the man takes the mitten in his teeth and pulls it off. But his hand is frozen and he cannot hold the revolver, and it fails in the snow. I look at the woman. Her mitten is off, and the big Colt's revolver is in her hand. Three times she shoot, quick, just like that. The hungry face of the stranger-man is still snarling as he falls forward into the snow.|$|E

"He shook himsel' free o' me," [...] the {{shepherd}} told afterward, [...] "and I saw him bending down and measuring the distance wi' his een {{as cool as}} if he was calculating a drill o' tatties.

After that there was no sound but the jaw o' the water; and I prayed, but no to God, to the mist to rise, and after an awful time it rose, and I saw the minister was safe; he had pulled the earl into the middle o' the bit island and was rubbing him back to consciousness. I sweat when I think o't yet." ...|$|E
50|$|A lunge {{can refer}} to any {{position}} {{of the human body}} where one leg is positioned forward with <b>knee</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> foot flat on the ground while the other leg is positioned behind. It is used by athletes in cross-training for sports, by weight-trainers as a fitness exercise, and by yogis as part of an asana regimen.|$|R

6000|$|The good man, he was {{now getting}} old, towards sixty perhaps; and gave you {{the idea of a}} life that had been full of sufferings; a life heavy-laden, half-vanquished, still {{swimming}} painfully in seas of manifold physical and other bewilderment. Brow and head were round, and of massive weight, but the face was flabby and irresolute. The deep eyes, of a light hazel, were as full of sorrow as of inspiration; confused pain looked mildly from them, as in a kind of mild astonishment. The whole figure and air, good and amiable otherwise, might be called flabby and irresolute; expressive of weakness under possibility of strength. He hung loosely on his limbs, with <b>knees</b> <b>bent,</b> <b>and</b> stooping attitude; in walking, he rather shuffled than decisively steps; and a lady once remarked, he never could fix which side of the garden walk would suit him best, but continually shifted, in corkscrew fashion, and kept trying both. A heavy-laden, high-aspiring and surely much-suffering man. His voice, naturally soft and good, had contracted itself into a plaintive snuffle and singsong; he spoke as if preaching,--you would have said, preaching earnestly and also hopelessly the weightiest things. I still recollect his [...] "object" [...] and [...] "subject," [...] terms of continual recurrence in the Kantean province; and how he sang and snuffled them into [...] "om-m-mject" [...] and [...] "sum-m-mject," [...] with a kind of solemn shake or quaver, as he rolled along. No talk, in his century or in any other, could be more surprising.|$|E
6000|$|... "The cruel {{impression}} {{conveyed by}} the mutilated forests," [...] he wrote, [...] "is heightened {{in the places}} where, till lately, native villages [...] nestled, hidden and protected by thick and lofty foliage. The [...] inhabitants have fled. They have fled in spite of encouraging palavers [...] and promises of peace and kind treatment. They have burnt their huts, [...] and great heaps of cinders mark the sites, amid deserted palm-groves [...] and trampled-down banana fields. The terrors caused {{by the memory of}} [...] inhuman floggings, of massacres, of rapes and abductions, haunt their [...] poor brains, and they go as fugitives to seek shelter in the recesses [...] of the hospitable bush, or, across the frontiers, to find it in French [...] or Portuguese Congo, not yet afflicted with so many labours and [...] alarms, far from the roads traversed by white men, those baneful [...] intruders, and their train of strange and disquieting habits." [...] The [...] outlook was as gloomy when he wandered along the path trodden by the [...] caravans to the Pool and back again. [...] "We are constantly meeting these [...] carriers, either isolated or in Indian file; blacks, blacks, miserable [...] blacks, with horribly filthy loin-clothes for their only garments; [...] their bare and frizzled heads supporting their loads--chest, bale, [...] ivory-tusk, hamper of rubber, or barrel; for the most part broken [...] down, sinking under the burdens made heavier by their weariness and [...] insufficiency of food, consisting of a handful of rice and tainted [...] dried fish; pitiful walking caryatids; beasts of burden with the lank [...] limbs of monkeys, pinched-up features, eyes fixed and round with the [...] strain of keeping their balance and the dulness of exhaustion. Thus [...] they come and go by thousands, organized in a system of human [...] transport, requisitioned by the State armed with its irresistible [...] force publique, supplied by the chiefs whose slaves they are and who [...] pounce on their wages; jogging on, with <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> stomach [...] protruding, one arm raised up and the other resting on a long stick, [...] dusty and malodorous; covered with insects as their huge procession [...] passes over mountains and through valleys; dying on the tramp, or, [...] when the tramp is over, going to their villages to die of exhaustion." ...|$|E
50|$|Because {{of loose}} material. Loose gravel or scree {{on top of}} smooth rock acts like ball bearings. Precautions include {{spotting}} the situation ahead, keeping <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> weight forward, using hiking sticks, and brushing aside the gravel where possible.|$|E
25|$|Choctaws are the two-foot {{equivalents}} of rockers and counters.

Hydroblading refers to a deep edge performed with the body as low as possible to the ice in a near-horizontal position.|$|R
50|$|If {{the kick}} is being thrown {{from the rear}} leg, another option is available. The rear leg lifts with the <b>knee</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> {{pointing}} to the side, and the entire body rotates as the knee swings {{around to the front}} (picture swinging one's leg over to mount a bicycle). The rotation of the body and lateral movement of the leg add to the momentum of the lower leg, which moves in and out the same as above.|$|R
60|$|To steady himself, {{he pressed}} his {{shoulder}} against the white bulkhead, one <b>knee</b> <b>bent,</b> <b>and</b> a sweat-rag tucked in his belt hanging on his hip. His smooth cheek was begrimed and flushed, and the coal dust on his eyelids, like the black pencilling of a make-up, enhanced the liquid brilliance of the whites, giving to his youthful face something of a feminine, exotic and fascinating aspect. When the ship pitched he would with hasty movements of his hands screw hard at the little wheel.|$|R

5000|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the patient's history, clinical signs, and, increasingly, an MRI exam. Symptoms can often be reproduced by maneuvers such as performing sit-ups or crunches.

50|$|The {{power stroke}} {{starts with the}} feet drawn up with <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> fins {{approximately}} horizontal. The fins are rotated outwards with the soles facing backwards, and toes outwards, then the legs are extended so the fins push water backwards, while extending the ankles {{to close the gap}} between the fins, to push backwards a bit more. Incomplete ankle rotation will cause thrust to be exerted partly upwards which would tend to push the feet down.|$|E
5000|$|The Burmese position, named {{so because}} of its use in Buddhist sculptures in Burma, places both {{feet in front of}} the pelvis with <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> {{touching}} the floor to the sides. The heels are pointing toward pelvis or upward, and toes are pointed so that the tops of the feet lie on the ground. This looks similar to the cross legged position, but the feet are not placed underneath the thigh of the next leg, therefore the legs do not cross. Instead, one foot is placed in front of the other.|$|E
