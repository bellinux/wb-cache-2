5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a <b>drug</b> <b>mule</b> by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E

500|$|Christensen {{subscribed to}} the anti-semitic {{conspiracy}} theory that Jews control the Western socio-political establishment, {{and believed that}} this would prevent the growth of any explicitly political movement to spread racial consciousness among those she deemed to be Aryan. Instead, she believed that Heathenry [...] a Pagan religion that she termed [...] "Odinism" [...] represented {{the best way of}} spreading this racial consciousness. In 1969, Christensen and her husband founded a group called The Odinist Fellowship. Alex died in 1971, and Christensen continued her work, relocating to the United States. That year she began publication of a newsletter called The Odinist, which continued for many years. In 1993 she was imprisoned for drug smuggling, although maintained that she had been used as a <b>drug</b> <b>mule</b> without her knowledge. On release, she was deported to Canada, where she lived in Vancouver Island during her final years.|$|E

40|$|While {{the turn}} to {{vulnerability}} in law responds to a recurrent critique by feminist scholars on the disembodiment of legal personhood, this article {{suggests that the}} mobilization of vulnerability in the criminal courts does not necessarily offer female <b>drug</b> <b>mules</b> a direct path to justice. Through an analysis of sentencing appeals of female <b>drug</b> <b>mules</b> in England and Wales, this article presents a feminist critique of the dispositif of the person {{and its relation to}} vulnerability. Discourses on drug mules’ vulnerability mobilize the trope of the colonial victim in need of protection, which is often translated into legal mercy. But mercy is rather an expression of biopower which inscribes not only fragility onto the bodies of <b>drug</b> <b>mules</b> by figuring them as exemplar paradigms of colonial subjectivity, but also reinvigorates the dispositif of gender implicit in the legal person. In this set-up, it would appear as if law and politics totalize the registers of life, in this case the contours of vulnerable body. The article suggests we must revisit the image of the wounded body in order to carve out a space for resistance. Drawing on Elaine Scarry and Judith Butler, it suggests vulnerable bodies are marked by a semiotic openness, which renders them subject to appropriation but also able to signify the precarity produced by the law through their resistance to representation...|$|R
40|$|Body Packers or <b>Drug</b> <b>Mules,</b> as {{they are}} often {{referred}} to, represent a method of drug trafficking that has gained popularity since the 1970 ’s. It appears to be most popular {{as a method of}} transporting powder drugs such as Cocaine and Heroin; as it is a surreptitious method of couriering, there is little mystery as to why the method was developed. This review aims to decipher why there is the necessity for this dangerous and flawed method of trafficking, focusing on cocaine in particular. The paper will review the evolution of cocaine body packing, how legislation and the cartels worked together to force the development of <b>drug</b> <b>mules,</b> and the effect this method of trafficking has on the individuals who become the packers, or ‘mules’. A thorough understanding of the development and risks associated with this most dangerous practice, may contribute to the efforts to eradicate this method of cocaine trafficking...|$|R
