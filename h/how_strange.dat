25|$|Any {{habitual}} pattern {{which is}} interrupted unexpectedly will cause sudden and light trance. The handshake {{is a particularly}} good pattern to interrupt because the formality of a handshake is a widely understood set of social rules. Since everyone knows {{that it would be}} impolite to comment on the quality of a handshake, regardless of <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> it may be, the subject is obliged to embark on an inner search (known as a transderivational search, a universal and compelling type of trance) to identify the meaning or purpose of the subverted pattern.|$|E

[...] She wrote [...] " [...] has the undervalued nostalgia of being episode five of the entire series and it benefits from the aforementioned chemistry of Spongebob and Squidward." [...] She also praised the episode as [...] "an in-depth look at their [...] relationship, and it {{set the tone for}} just <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> the show could be." [...] Estep lauded the hitchhiking dances by SpongeBob, saying [...] "These moves are amusing and charming, while Squidward's bitterness is easy to relate to." [...] In 2009, [...] "Pizza Delivery" [...] was chosen by viewers on Nick.com as the [...] 1 episode during a television marathon called [...] "The Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash".|$|E
500|$|By 1850 {{and with}} the {{publication}} of Hurry-Graphs, Willis was becoming a forgotten celebrity. In August 1853, future President James A. Garfield discussed Willis's declining popularity in his diary: [...] "Willis {{is said to be a}} [...] man, although an unrivaled poet. <b>How</b> <b>strange</b> that such men should go to ruin, when they might soar perpetually in the heaven of heavens". After Willis's death, obituaries reported that he had outlived his fame. One remarked, [...] "the man who withdraws from the whirling currents of active life is speedily forgotten". This obituary also stated that Americans [...] "will ever remember and cherish Nathaniel P. Willis as one worthy to stand with Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving". In 1946, the centennial issue of Town & Country reported that Willis [...] "led a generation of Americans through a gate where weeds gave way to horticulture". More modern scholars have dismissed Willis's work as [...] "sentimental prattle" [...] or refer to him only as an obstacle in the progress of his sister as well as Harriet Jacobs. As biographer Thomas N. Baker wrote, Willis is today only referred to as a footnote in relation to other authors.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the truth}} of the {{accounts}} has been disputed by some historians; in 1984, Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton concluded that there were probably attempts to play organised matches which failed due to the state of the ground, but that the contemporary reports were either hearsay or refer to [...] "kick-about" [...] matches with [...] "made-up footballs" [...] such as a bully-beef tin. Chris Baker, former chairman of The Western Front Association and author of The Truce: The Day the War Stopped is also sceptical, but says that although there is little hard evidence, the most likely place that an organised match could have taken place was near the village of Messines: [...] "There are two references to a game being played on the British side, but nothing from the Germans. If somebody one day found a letter from a German soldier who was in that area, then we would have something credible." [...] In fact, there is a German reference. Leutnant Kurt Zehmisch of Germany's 134th Saxons Infantry Regiment said that the English [...] "brought a soccer ball from their trenches, and pretty soon a lively game ensued. How marvelously wonderful, yet <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> it was". In 2011, Mike Dash concluded that [...] "there is plenty of evidence that football was played that Christmas Day—mostly by men of the same nationality, but in at least three or four places between troops from the opposing armies".|$|E
500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, and I want the feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit on a park bench like bookends", and ponder <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> it feels to be nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E

Most people don't know that Sally was Martha's {{half-sister}} and that, by written accounts, she looked like Martha.

50|$|Lindmer tells Strange {{that his}} ignorance {{is a form}} of protection, and asks him whether he wants to know the truth or remain ignorant. Strange demands to know the truth, and Lindmer says that he knows about <b>how</b> <b>Strange's</b> parents died when he was eighteen. He says Strange is special, and that his parents died {{protecting}} him. He says there are different realms, and that Lake is trapped in them and only Strange can save her. Strange is dispatched to the astral plane and confronts and defeats the demon Balzaroth, who had been sent by le Fay to stop Strange from rescuing Lake. Strange and Lake return to the physical world.|$|R

2500|$|One of the {{signature}} scenes in Notorious is the two-and-a-half-minute kiss that Hitchcock interrupted every three seconds to slip the scene through the three-second-rule {{crack in the}} Production Code. [...] "The two stars worried about <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> it felt," [...] writes biographer McGilligan. [...] "Walking along, nuzzling each other with the camera trailing behind them, seemed 'very awkward' to the actors during filming, according to Bergman. 'Don't worry', Hitchcock assured her. 'It'll look right on the screen.|$|E
2500|$|Originally called Breaker Morant, Explosions in the Sky {{was formed}} in Austin, Texas in 1999. Drummer Chris Hrasky is from Rockford, Illinois, {{and the rest of}} the band hails from Midland, Texas. The new name of [...] "Explosions in the Sky" [...] came from a comment Hrasky made in {{reference}} to the noise or sight of fireworks when they left KVRX on the night they played their first set and recorded their first track, [...] "Remember Me as a Time of Day", that would be released on a compilation. Their 2000 debut album, <b>How</b> <b>Strange,</b> Innocence, was locally distributed in the form of CD-Rs. Rehearsal footage is featured on the feature film Cicadas, which won an Austin Film Festival award.|$|E
2500|$|A {{friend told}} me the world was shaking. I believe it is, not only the {{physical}} world, but the mental world. There never {{was a time when}} mind was so agitated as the present, not only in this continent, but the Old World is shaken. Witness the revolution in Spain. [...] Human bondage soon will exist only in history, and religious intolerance be a dream of the past, and mind will constitute manhood, not physical types or color of skin. And happy are they who live in this agitation, and assist in its development! <b>How</b> <b>strange</b> that great lessons of truth must be forced upon the mind by error as the contrast, and a startling wrong perpetrated to ensure right, and a long lethargic sleep to produce a full awakening! ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Director Lewis Milestone {{is quoted}} {{in an article}} in the Los Angeles Sun Mirror on 8 December 1946 as having said that he would never make another picture with {{producer}} Hal Wallis because Wallis wanted to reshoot scenes in this film for more close-ups of Lizabeth Scott; Milestone reportedly told Wallis to shoot them himself—which he did." [...] Wallis ended up adding extra footage of Scott at the expense of Stanwyck's screen time, which later led to a contretemps between Stanwyck and Wallis. Concerning her first film noir, Scott recalled <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> it was to be in a film with Stanwyck and only have one brief scene together. The screenplay by Robert Rossen depicts two separate story lines running in parallel—one dominated by Martha Ivers (Stanwyck) and the other by Antonia [...] "Toni" [...] Marachek (Scott). The Heflin character, Sam, is the connection between the story lines, which only overlap in the one scene where femme fatale Martha and Toni meet.|$|E
2500|$|Most of Haruki Murakami's works use first-person {{narrative}} {{in the tradition}} of the Japanese I Novel. He states that because family plays a significant role in traditional Japanese literature, any main character who is independent becomes a man who values freedom and solitude over intimacy. Also notable is Murakami's unique humor, as seen in his 2000 short story collection, After the Quake. In the story [...] "Superfrog Saves Tokyo", the protagonist is confronted with a 6-foot tall frog that talks about the destruction of Tokyo over a cup of tea. In spite of the story's sober tone, Murakami feels the reader should be entertained once the seriousness of a subject has been broached. Another notable feature of Murakami's stories are the comments that come from the main characters as to <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> the story presents itself. Murakami explains that his characters experience what he experiences as he writes, which could be compared to a movie set where the walls and props are all fake.|$|E
2500|$|I {{have always}} been {{of the opinion that}} we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter <b>how</b> <b>strange</b> it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in {{utilizing}} the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideals may be to ours ... Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to what we like to call [...] "our free institutions." [...] Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy. That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishis is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East. It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions ... To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism. I see no reason why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else it may be, to solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime.|$|E

The premise of the song came from a joke told by the child of a friend of Wooley's; Wooley finished composing it within an hour.|$|R
