50|$|In Australian law <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> {{is used in}} two senses. The {{predominant}} use is {{to refer}} to an <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> hearing, being one which is heard {{in the absence of}} one or more parties. Where proceedings are heard <b>ex</b> <b>parte,</b> a high degree of candour is required, including full and fair disclosure of facts adverse to the moving party.

2500|$|An {{instance}} of {{the application of the}} anxious scrutiny level of review is the 1995 case of R. v.

In <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> Smith, Smith and three other individuals appealed a Ministry of Defence ruling that mandated the discharge of homosexuals from the service. The court accepted that [...] "he more substantial the interference with human rights, the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable".

40|$|This Article {{will examine}} the {{validity}} of the District of Columbia Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s approach to <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> communications in off-the-record proceedings. It begins with a theoretical discussion of the compatability of <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> communications with the judicial and legislative models of decisionmaking that underlie the administrative system. The Article argues that although a judicial model of decisionmaking requires the prohibition of <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> communications, this model should rarely be applied to off-the-record agency proceedings due to the distinctive purposes of administrative action. Following this overview of the problem, the Article reviews the court 2 ̆ 7 s changing approach to <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> communications in off-the-record proceedings, identifying the analytical themes and distinctions that have been relied upon by the court to determine the resolution of particular cases...|$|R
