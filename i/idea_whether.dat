25|$|Animation for A Charlie Brown Christmas {{was created}} by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had no <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> or not {{completing}} a half-hour's worth of animation would be possible given the production's six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility. In actuality, animation was only completed {{in the final four}} months of production. CBS initially wanted an hour's worth of animation, but Melendez talked them down to a half-hour special, believing an hour of television animation was too much. Having never worked on a half-hour special before, Melendez phoned Bill Hanna of Hanna-Barbera for advice, who declined to give any. CBS gave a budget of $76,000 to produce the show, and it went over budget, costing $96,000. The first step in creating the animation was to make a pencil drawing, afterwards inking and painting the drawing onto a cel. The cel was then placed onto a painted background. There are 13,000 drawings in the special, with 12 frames per second to create the illusion of movement.|$|E
500|$|Perowne's {{world view}} is rebutted by his daughter, Daisy, a young poet. In the book's climax in chapter four, while {{he struggles to}} remain calm {{offering}} medical solutions to Baxter's illness, she quotes Matthew Arnold's poem Dover Beach, which calls for civilised values in the world, temporarily placating the assailant's violent mood. McEwan described his intention as wanting to [...] "play with this <b>idea,</b> <b>whether</b> we need stories". Brian Bethune interpreted McEwan's approach to Perowne as [...] "mercilessly [...] his own protagonist...But Perowne's blind spot [...] is less an author's little joke than a plea for the saving grace of literature." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Hervé Villechaize was {{a former}} roommate of co-writer and co-star Matthew Bright, Villechaize had {{previously}} dated co-star Susan Tyrrell, but the two had already broken up by the time production on the film began. According to Richard Elfman, Tyrrell and Villechaize fought periodically throughout the production. The Elfmans' grandfather, Herman Bernstein, also appeared in the film, and Richard Elfman's accountant appeared under the name [...] "Hyman Diamond" [...] because Elfman had no <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> or not {{he wanted to be}} credited. Others who worked on the film include The Kipper Kids (Brian Routh and Martin von Haselberg), Joe Spinell, and former Warhol superstar Viva.|$|E

500|$|This {{film was}} an example of the use of the {{character}} names Jack and May, which were to be repeatedly used by Lonergan in various productions. Bowers writes, [...] "It developed that Lloyd F. Lonergan, ... liked these names, and during the years to come used them again and again. One can imagine that it must have become a studio joke to decide who was to play Jack and who was to play May. In actuality, names such as Jack and May were used in printed synopses to keep track of who was who, but such names were usually not mentioned in the film's subtitles. Patrons watching the picture in a theatre had not the foggiest <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> the hero was named Jack, Bertram, or Ezekiel." [...] The first usage of the two leading character roles was in Dots and Dashes.|$|E
500|$|He {{became a}} minor celebrity {{during the two}} months of {{volcanic}} activity preceding the eruption, giving interviews to reporters and expressing his opinion that the danger from the volcano was exaggerated, saying, [...] "I don't have any <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> it will blow [...] But I don't believe it {{to the point that}} I'm going to pack up." [...] Truman discarded all of his concerns about the volcano and his situation, stating [...] "If the mountain goes, I'm going with it. This area is heavily timbered, Spirit Lake is in between me and the mountain, and the mountain is a mile away, the mountain ain't gonna hurt me." [...] According to The Bulletin, he responded to being knocked from his bed by precursor earthquakes by moving his mattress to his basement. At one point, Truman [...] "scoffed" [...] at the public's concern for his safety. He became something of a [...] "folk hero" [...] and from March until May, was the subject of many songs and poems by children. One group of children from Salem, Oregon, sent him banners inscribed [...] "Harry - We Love You", while Truman received fan letters including several marriage proposals.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{listed the}} song as the weakest effort on MDNA, adding that [...] "its {{position}} as the album's lead single {{seems to have had}} more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody." [...] A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars, writing: [...] "Like most Madonna singles, it skips along at a furious pace with a gleam in its eye, but the self-references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics". Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was [...] "proof that sometimes you can listen to something many, many times and still not have any <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> it's any good or not." [...] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics, which he found to be meaningless, while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as [...] "trite and disposable". Alex Macpherson from Fact found the song to be [...] "sheer misconceived awfulness".|$|E

On Burgess's death in 1932, Briggs was nominated by US President Herbert C. Hoover to Burgess {{as director of the}} National Bureau of Standards. However, none of Hoover's nominations were acted on by the US Congress before he left office. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president in 1933 he was pressed to name [...] "a good Democrat" [...] as director of the National Bureau of Standards. Roosevelt, not wishing to make a patronage appointment, replied, [...] "I haven't the slightest <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> Briggs is a Republican or a Democrat; all I know is that he is the best qualified man for the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Insider was Rao's {{first novel}} {{and had been}} in the making for 20 years before it was {{published}} in 1998 by Penguin India. The book largely received negative reviews from both reviewers and politicians. Reviewing Indian roman à clefs in 2010, Nilanjana Roy noted that [...] "This 1998 novel by a former Indian PM is now justly forgotten [...] At 767 pages, [...] suffered from the defects of a great deal of Indian political writing—the gossip wasn’t good enough to justify the prolixity". Similarly, Sunanda Ray of The Telegraph noted that [...] "though grateful for the gift, I did not find the book gripping reading. Therefore, I have no <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> Anand, the central figure, matches Narasimha Rao in every detail". A revised and expanded edition of the book that was published by Penguin in 2000 was reviewed by The Hindu as [...] "a book making heavy demands on the doggedness of a reader for withstanding an 833-page infliction from a former Prime Minister". On political grounds members of the Congress Party including Najma Heptullah were critical of Rao's novel while many BJP supporters dismissed it as a piece of sleazy writing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incremental}} research techniques developed at IBM eventually became {{dominant in the}} field after DARPA, in the mid-80s, returned to NLP research and imposed that methodology to participating teams, shared common goals, data, and precise evaluation metrics. The Continuous Speech Recognition Group's research, which required large amounts of data to train the algorithms, {{eventually led to the}} creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium. In the 1980s, although the broader problem of speech recognition remained unsolved, they sought to apply the methods developed to other problems; machine translation and stock value prediction were both seen as options. A group of IBM researchers went on to work for Renaissance Technologies. Jelinek wrote, [...] "The performance of the Renaissance fund is legendary, but I have no <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> any methods we pioneered at IBM have ever been used. My former colleagues will not tell me: theirs is a very hush-hush operation!" [...] Methods very similar to those developed for achieving speech recognition are at the base of most machine translation systems in use today. Observers have said that Pierce's paradigm, according to which engineering achievements in this area would be built on scientific progress, has been inverted, with the achievements in engineering being at the base of a number of scientific findings.|$|E
