40|$|We report {{characteristics}} of <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in over five million full text articles from two large databases - the PubMed Central Open Access subset and Elsevier journals - as functions of time, textual progression, and scientific field. The {{purpose of this}} study is to understand the {{characteristics of}} <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in a detailed way prior to pursuing other studies focused on answering more substantive research questions. As such, we have analyzed <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> in several ways and report many findings here. Perhaps most significantly, we find that there are large field-level differences that are reflected in position within the text, citation interval (or reference age), and citation counts of references. In general, the fields of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering have similar reference distributions, although they vary in their specifics. The two remaining fields, Mathematics and Computer Science and Social Science and Humanities, have different reference distributions from the other three fields and between themselves. We also show that in all fields the numbers of sentences, references, and in-text mentions per article have increased over time, and that there are field-level and temporal differences in the numbers of in-text mentions per reference. A final finding is that references mentioned only once tend to be much more highly cited than those mentioned multiple times. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

Also, her rough draft lacked <b>in-text</b> <b>citation</b> of external voices, and the source texts were integrated via paraphrasing. Unlike Wes, Mara had clear arguments on the topic she was writing about. The changes in her final draft reveal ways in which Mara creates and then joins in on a dialogue with the external voices by changing {{the ways in which the}} external voices are integrated into the text. Specifically, Mara uses linguistic moves including quotations to identify the boundaries of voices, including her own. The changes made in the final draft also demonstrate the ways in which she endorses the external voices and uses them to support her own ideas in an appeal to authority. Discussions with Mara on these changes reveal a mixture of her struggle both with distinguishing her voice and ideas from the external voices and also conforming to standard academic writing practices.|$|E

For an overview of related key topics on working with documentation styles, visit the videos and quizzes in this tutorial. Explore It By documenting your sources carefully—in your text and in your bibliography—you give readers of your research project a map to the sources you use. While reading your paper, readers should be able to identify specific types of information about the sources you use. When your in-text references are accurate and formatted correctly, they will point readers to the complete citation on your bibliography page. All documentation styles call on you to include citations of sources in your text that are connected to entries in the bibliography that accompanies your research project. Though the requirements and styles differ, MLA, APA, and Chicago styles all require basic citations in your text that identify the author and indicate which of your sources is being cited. And when you cite a particular passage in your draft all these documentation styles require you to note, often by giving a page number, where the material appears in the source. The citations in the text of your research paper point readers to a particular entry in your bibliography. Here are several example sentences showing <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> of paraphrased material from a source. Each example is accompanied by an entry for citing the source in the works cited (MLA), references (APA), or in a note and on the bibliography page (Chicago). mla Teenagers may experience loneliness, depression, and a decline in “real world ” social activity as a result of overexposure to chat rooms and excessive Web surfing (Johnson) ...|$|R

40|$|Despite English {{being the}} {{dominant}} language in HK tertiary education, expectations regarding {{the effectiveness of}} initial EAP programs are ‘unrealistic’ (Bruce & Hamp-Lyons, 2015). EAP course effectiveness is typically measured via the triangulation of test scores and student-led post-course evaluations of course and teacher performance, which are [unfortunately] both summative and subjective in nature and do not generally take into account assessment of the actual linguistic data that was produced over time, tracking student production from pre- to post- training. Such an investigation would constitute a new 'affordance' among the 'multiple affordances' (Leńko-Szymańska & Boulton, 2015) of language corpora currently available to educators, and would be particularly useful if course teachers {{were involved in the}} corpus design (e. g. Urzúa, 2015). The methodology involved the construction, annotation and analysis of a pilot learner corpora according to the principles of Granger's (2015) Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA 2), where 350, 000 words were taken longitudinally (pre-, mid- and post-EAP training) from written academic essays and reports. The corpus' annotation scheme was derived from EAP course content alongside consultation with course teachers, and includes annotation for over 20 error categories, the use of interpersonal and intertextual metadiscursive language (following Hyland, 2000), and the use of <b>in-text</b> <b>citation</b> / reference lists. Post-hoc analysis also includes multidimensional analysis (e. g. Biber, 1988) using the MAT program, (Nini, 2014). Corpus building and annotation was performed using UAMCorpustool (O'Donnell, 2008). Results There is little impact of instruction on common L 2 errors found between pre- and post-training data in most (but not all) categories. Variation in the use of key stance features including hedging, boosting, epistemic nouns, attitude markers and self-mentions suggests our L 2 writers are able to produce more nuanced positions on an academic topic. The results of the multidimensional analysis exhibit considerable variation between data points in the direction of academic discourse across all five dimensions analysed, including a drop in the use of first person pronouns and the mechanical use of discourse connectives, alongside an increased emphasis on nominalisation. The results provide one of the first quantitative, corpus-driven measures of EAP course effectiveness. The findings suggest a warmly positive effect of EAP instruction on learner production after only a single semester. A number of pedagogical opportunities for the data are also outlined including the benefits of such analysis for written corrective feedback and future analysis of discipline-specific L 2 discourse. The results will hopefully lead to improved data-driven course provision (e. g. Johns, 1991), and as such are likely to be of great importance for ELT course administrators and teachers...|$|E

40|$|Citation {{is a very}} {{important}} aspect of writing. When an author uses another author's ideas or information, credit must be given, whether the original author's words are used as a direct quote or not. The older, more traditional styles of citation relied on the author listing the full citation of each source on the page where the information was actually used, usually in a footnote. Later, the footnotes were collected {{at the end of the}} paper or chapter and called endnotes. However, both of these formats were awkward and clumsy for the writer. Therefore, both the MLA (Modern Language Association) and the APA (American Psychiatric Association) decided to create new systems that were easier to use for the writer, and yet still gave the reader as much information as they needed to know. MLA and APA styles of citation are designed around two different, yet related functions: <b>in-text</b> parenthetical <b>citation</b> and the list of sources. Both are absolutely necessary in order for either one to work. The <b>in-text</b> <b>citations</b> make reference to the list of sources, and the list of sources tells you the necessary information about the sources cited in the text of the essay. In this guide, we will deal with both functions, but separately. <b>IN-TEXT</b> CITATIONS <b>In-text</b> <b>citations</b> are used whenever a writer has used information from another source, whether that information is a direct quote or a paraphrase. The rule of thumb is that if the writer didn't know the information before beginning the research, it needs to be cited. The one exception to this rule is general knowledge. Any information found in a general encyclopedia or found in a majority of sources is not considered unique enough to need to be cited. The author CAN cite it, but they are not required to do so...|$|R
