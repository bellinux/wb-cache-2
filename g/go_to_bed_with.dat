David took Donna on a trip {{because he wanted to}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> her, but she told him again that she would wait. On their graduation evening, Donna David tells her that she is ready and after many years of waiting, they go to bed together.|$|E

However, she will be allowed to graduate later.|$|E
500|$|... "My Love" [...] {{was criticized}} {{for some of the}} lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh {{reported}} that Timberlake [...] "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" [...] with the lyrics [...] "If I told you you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?". Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to say he would like you to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> him". Vaughan, however, was positive towards [...] "My Love", stating that the song, along with [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", sounded considerably {{different from the rest of}} the album.|$|E

500|$|Aubrey {{announced}} plans for faster and cheaper movies, none of which would have a budget above $1 million, {{but many of these}} inexpensive films bombed with critics and audiences. [...] One notable success was the Richard Roundtree film Shaft, which cost $1 million and grossed around $12 million at the box office. Agent Sue Mengers said he was a very tough dealmaker. [...] "I'd rather <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> him than negotiate with him." [...] Upon assuming his MGM post, Aubrey almost immediately canceled production on two Julie Andrews pictures, She Loves Me and Say It With Music, the late 1960s fad for musicals having ended. He also clashed with David Lean, whose production of Ryan's Daughter was running overbudget, in early 1970, attempting to cancel or at least scale down the film; but Lean held too much sway for Aubrey's actions to have any effect.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{called for}} a first {{appearance}} at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who {{was director of the}} Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas {{for the first time since}} their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he [...] "looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self". Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{is noted}} for {{frequently}} appearing in nude scenes in her films, such as The Heartbreak Kid and Watchmen. She {{has stated that}} she feels comfortable {{as long as the}} scenes are not gratuitous. In an interview for Daily Mail, she commented, [...] "I {{spent a lot of time}} as a child in Sweden; it’s natural there ... I don't know many women who <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> their husband at night and have sex with a bra on ... So let's make it real in the movies." [...] In 2008, she made her first appearance on AskMen.com's [...] "99 Most Desirable Women" [...] list at number 60. The same year, men's magazine Maxim placed her at number 59 in their annual [...] "Hot 100" [...] rankings. The following year, the magazine ranked her at number four. Although admitting that sex appeal is one of the [...] "best assets", Åkerman considers being beautiful both [...] "a blessing and a curse", stating, [...] "I tend to get a lot of scripts in which people want me to play the trophy wife, which is frustrating because I want the interesting, meaty roles." ...|$|E

500|$|No one {{doubted that}} Lim, Tan, and Hoe {{had killed the}} children. [...] Their defence was based on convincing the judges that medically, the accused were not in total control of {{themselves}} during the crimes. [...] The bulk of the trial was therefore a battle between expert witnesses called by both sides. [...] Dr Wong Yip Chong, a senior psychiatrist in private practice, believed that Lim was mentally ill {{at the time of}} the crimes. [...] Claiming to be [...] "judging by the big picture, and not fussing over contradictions", he said that Lim's voracious sexual appetite and deluded belief in Kali were characteristics of a mild manic depression. [...] The doctor also said that only an unsound mind would dump the bodies close to his home when his plan was to distract the police. [...] In rebuttal, the prosecution's expert witness, Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital, said that Lim was [...] "purposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure". [...] In Dr Chee's opinion, Lim had indulged in sex because through his role as a [...] medium he obtained a supply of women who were willing to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> him. [...] Furthermore, his belief in Kali was religious in nature, not delusional. [...] Lim's use of religion for personal benefit indicated full self-control. [...] Lastly, Lim had consulted doctors and freely taken sedatives to alleviate his insomnia, a condition which, according to Dr Chee, sufferers from manic depression fail to recognise.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, Hayworth {{said she}} was {{the antithesis of the}} {{characters}} she played. [...] "I naturally am very shy… and I suffer from an inferiority complex." [...] Her provocative role in Gilda, in particular, was responsible for people expecting her to be what she was not. Hayworth once said, with some bitterness, [...] "Men <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> Gilda, but wake up with me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, Lord!' said Midmore, and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a {{book called}} Handley Cross under his arm, and a lonelier Columbus into a {{stranger}} world the wet-ringed moon never looked upon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Especially if he <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a brandy bottle {{under his}} head; eh, doctor? But, mind, that's a medical secret, you know; {{not a word}} of {{that out of the}} bedroom." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{had a fine}} rock boa to {{play the}} title-rôle, a snake which was the pride of my heart, so one can imagine my disgust when I saw that one critic ended his disparaging review by the words, 'The crisis of the play was {{produced}} {{by the appearance of}} a palpably artificial serpent.' I was inclined to offer him a goodly sum if he would undertake to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> it. The real fault of the play was that in trying to give Holmes a worthy antagonist I overdid it and produced a more interesting personality in the villain. The terrible ending was also against it." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{account of}} Murdoch's {{life with a}} {{different}} ambition is given by A. N. Wilson in his 2003 book Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her. The work was described by Galen Strawson in The Guardian as [...] "mischievously revelatory" [...] and labelled by Wilson himself as an [...] "anti-biography". Wilson eschews objectivity, but is careful to stress his affection for his subject. Wilson remarks that Murdoch [...] "had clearly {{been one of those}} delightful young women... who was prepared to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> almost anyone". [...] While Murdoch's thought is an inspiration for Conradi, Wilson treats Murdoch's philosophical work as at best a distraction. [...] In a BBC Radio 4 discussion of Murdoch and her work in 2009, Wilson stated his opinion, with which he acknowledged that [...] "no doctor would agree", that Murdoch's struggle to complete her late philosophical book, Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals, reduced her to despair and precipitated her into Alzheimer's.|$|E
2500|$|On February 11, 1970 Cavett {{hosted a}} tribute to the life and works of Sir Noël Coward, who had just been knighted in December 1969. Along with Coward, the other guests were Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, [...] and Tammy Grimes, and Brian Bedford (who were enjoying a {{successful}} run on Broadway in the revival of Coward's play Private Lives). In reviewing the show for The New York Times, television critic Jack Gould said [...] "The age of youth? Balder dash! The over‐70 set walked off yesterday morning with a television program that combined the engaging qualities of lightly recalled nostalgia, the sophisticated stiletto, and a demonstration of genuine affection that had more substance than adolescent wails on how love will save the world. Sir Noel Coward, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, friends of a lifetime, met on Dick Cavett's show on the American Broadcasting Company network. They exchanged quips, pleasantries and thoughts about the theater with the beguiling charm of talented luminaries. Mr. Cavett was clearly overawed, and for once, the ad libs frequently went over his head. It was an enchanting show…and the badinage was warm and delightful...a fun night, and to take out of context a line or here or there could not convey the whole. To <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a chuckle provided by gifted and nice people, onstage as off, is review enough." [...] (Jack Gould, The New York Times, February 12, 1970, p.59) ...|$|E

60|$|He dined alone, {{and spent}} the hours that {{followed}} in reading. By some chance {{he was able to}} find no one he knew, and he felt rather bored. He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a headache, feeling already the dreariness of London without friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] said Peter Rabbit, [...] "it's {{probably}} {{as old as}} the hills to me. You folks who <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> the sun don't hear the news until it's old. What is it?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{these were}} my robbers and gamblers?

60|$|He got gaily {{away before}} his mother could amplify a {{suggestion}} which spoiled {{a little of}} his pleasure in the praises--he thought they were unqualified and enthusiastic praises--she had been heaping upon Alice.

60|$|The missionaries {{were now}} {{thoroughly}} alarmed, and knew not what to do.
