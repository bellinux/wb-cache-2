The common-ly used technique is the Etchecopar method (e. g. Laurent et al., 1981), based on testing of 500 - 1000 randomly generated reduced stress tensors using a penalization function fL.

30|$|The {{results of}} the paleostress {{analysis}} with mechanical <b>e-twins</b> will be described below. While the occurrence of <b>e-twins</b> with a certain width in calcite grains is obvious in sample CV- 1 (Figure  2 c), their occurrence is not so clear in sample CV- 2 under a petrographic microscope at low magnifications (Figure  2 d). However, the very fine hair-like microstructures, which are oblique to the vein wall at low angles, can be clearly observed at high magnifications in sample CV- 2 (Figure  2 g). While these linear structures usually occur {{as a set of}} parallel lines in each of the fibrous grains, two sets of parallel lines in the different directions are sometimes developed in single grains in sample CV- 2 (Figure  2 d,g). Similarly, two sets of <b>e-twins</b> are sometimes developed in single grains in sample CV- 1 (Figure  2 c). These structural elements are in fact mechanical <b>e-twins,</b> which have been verified {{by the fact that the}} measured host c-axis and pole to <b>e-twin</b> orientations make an angle close to the fixed orientation of 26.25 °. Here, mechanical <b>e-twins</b> were even formed at shear stresses as low as 10 MPa at room temperatures, and no other slip systems such as r-slip systems that can be activated at conditions higher than 100 MPa (Turner et al.[1954]) were in operation, as evidenced by the absence of wavy extinction. Hence, the magnitude of shear stresses, which is inferred to have varied between 10 to 100 MPa, cannot be constrained to a narrow range in the present calcite veins. Alternatively, Rybacki et al. ([2011]) proposed a paleopiezometer as a function of <b>e-twin</b> density in calcite based on deformation experiments. According to their results, the measured twin densities of c. 100 /mm and c. 140 /mm in calcite grains from samples CV- 1 and CV- 2 are converted to very high differential stresses of c. 200 MPa and c. 230 MPa, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Conversely, the {{mechanical}} <b>e-twins</b> {{with the pole}} orientation that makes small angles to the fibers long axis in the calcite grains, which is nearly parallel to the c-axis, were formed in CV- 2, which indicates extension parallel to the fibers long axis. Therefore, it can be inferred that the fibrous grains in CV- 2 were first formed by vein opening followed by precipitation of fibrous calcite grains, which was further followed by the formation of <b>e-twins</b> under extension perpendicular to the vein wall. Subsequently, the veins were compressed in the direction perpendicular to the vein wall, and kink bands and brittle fractures were formed along the axial plane of the kink folds, which indicates that the stress direction perpendicular the vein wall was reversed. In fact, the orientations of mechanical <b>e-twins</b> are rotated more than 10 ° about the axis of kink bands, thus showing {{the validity of the}} inferred order of microstructural development.|$|R

Brecciation, fracturing and calcite <b>e-twinning</b> occur below the floors of all the craters and results from the hydrocode modelling show that the twins start to form at shock pressures of ∼ 110 to 480 MPa, which is at least a factor of ten higher than the 10 MPa that is considered to be required to produce calcite twins in low strain rate terrestrial settings. These pressures are equivalent to shock stage S 1 as determined by olivine microstructures and consistent with calcite twinning in carbonaceous chondrites being a result of impact gardening in shallow levels of their asteroidal parent bodies...|$|E

This chapter examines how an online learning community can support teachers’ continuous professional development within a social network. The Community of Inquiry framework is used to investigate: the development of teachers’ competence in online collaboration, how social aspects contribute to learning and how online tutors influence the development of critical thinking and meta-cognition. This action research study was undertaken within the European Community’s <b>e-Twinning</b> initiative, where Learning Events are short duration, non-formal learning opportunities for teachers. The participants teach a range of subjects at primary and secondary school level in general and vocational education. The research suggests that teachers need to have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in practice and to reflect on that practice with peers in order to develop knowledge-in-practice. As a result they gain belief in the value of the changes being applied and develop knowledge-of-practice that is seen as essential for long-term change. The research also highlights the essential role of the tutor in designing activities that engender collaboration, encourage critical thinking and foster mutual support amongst peers. Finally, the research emphasises that social presence is essential for effective collaboration and that sufficient time, space and activities should be included in online learning communities. The research has implications for Community of Inquiry theory and future Learning Events. An emerging model may be useful for designing and moderating future online learning communities for continuous professional development of teachers, and other professional groups...|$|E
40|$|Carrara marble is a greenschist facies {{metamorphic}} marble {{from the}} Alpi Apuane, Tuscany, Italy. It is widely {{known for its}} chemical purity, its homogenous microstructure and isotropic texture (crystallographic preferred orientation). During two deformation events (D 1 and D 2) the Liassic sedimentary precursor of Carrara marble was metamorphosed and deformed. Besides statically recrystallized microstructures, two end members of dynamically recrystallized microstructures are preserved in Carrara marble (Molli et al. 1997, Molli & Heilbronner 1999, Molli et al. 2000). Both end members can be related either to sub grain rotation (SGR) recrystallization or to grain boundary migration (GBM) recrystallization, respectively. In order to characterize the different dynamically recrystallized microstructures and to relate them to mesoscopical structures of D 1 and D 2 a combined study of structural field geology and microstructural analysis was carried out. On {{the basis of a}} detailed structural mapping overprinting relationships between D 1 and D 2 were investigated and typical deformation structures were sampled. The microstructural analysis of theses shear zones and folds revealed that D 1 structures are generally characterized by GBM microstructures and D 2 structures by SGR microstructures. Systematic determination of deformation temperatures of D 1 and D 2 shear zones along a profile parallel to the main tectonic transport direction by calcite-dolomite thermometry shows two individual temperature trends for D 1 and D 2. The D 1 deformation temperatures decrease from West to East from 430 °C to 370 °C and those of D 2 decrease from 370 °C in the East to 295 °C in the West. This continuous temperature gradient makes it possible to study dynamic recrystallization microstructures over a temperature range of approximately 150 °C. In order to investigate the influence of strain on the formation of microstructure and texture in naturally deformed Carrara marble a mm-scaled D 2 shear zone was analyzed. The shear zone was active at a constant temperature of 325 °C and cross-cut the S 1 main foliation, which acted as a passive strain marker. Therefore, the observed variations of microstructure and texture are solely a function of the accommodated strain and the strain rate. The protolith is characterized by a core-mantle microstructure with coarse porphyroclasts, which are embedded in a matrix of small recrystallized grains. With increasing strain the microstructure becomes progressively recrystallized, so that the center of the shear zone is completely recrystallized and a fine-grained matrix of equally shaped recrystallized grains is developed. At the same time the texture changes from an <b>e-twinning</b> type (single c-axes point maximum parallel to the compression direction) in the protolith to a basal texture (single c-axes maximum perpendicular to the shear plane) {{in the center of the}} shear zone. This texture transition is caused by SGR recrystallization, which forms continuously new grains with slightly rotated crystallographic orientations in the same sense as the overall shear deformation. Strain rate estimates on the basis of experimentally derived flow laws suggest that the shear zone is highly localized in space and in time. Localization of deformation was probably caused by the presence of a pre-existing coarse-grained calcite vein. According to the Hall-Petch relationship dislocation glide is favoured by coarse-grained materials, which is why deformation may started in the vein calcite by twining. After a certain amount of strain twinning is exhausted and the deformation continued by dislocation creep associated by dynamic recrystallization. Many calcite shear zones in the Alpi Apuane contain substantial amounts of dolomite, representing a second phase in ‘pure’ Carrara marble. Second phases are considered to influence the mechanical behaviour of a mono-mineralic rock, so that the strength of the phase mixture deviates from the one of the pure end members (Tullis et al. 1991, Dresen et al. 1998, Bruhn et al. 1999). In order to investigate the influence of dolomite on microstructure, texture and the dominant deformation mechanism of calcite a shear zone from the Eastern Alpi Apuane was analyzed. The shear zone is composed of alternating calcite and dolomite rich layers. Dolomite is presumably derived from dolomite veins, which become progressively fractured and sheared so that at the highest strains completely mixed layers of calcite and dolomite are developed. Pure calcite layers are characterized by a GBM microstructure and a strong basal texture, indicating that they have deformed dominantly by dislocation creep. With increasing dolomite content the calcite grains become smaller and less lobate, while the dolomite grains maintain their initial size and shape. Also the texture of calcite becomes weaker and the initial orthorhombic symmetry (with respect to the shear plane) is almost randomized at a dolomite content of 50 vol...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} from observations on natural calcite tectonites that intracrystalline plastic mechanisms are important during the deformation of calcite rocks in nature. In this thesis, new data are presented on fundamental aspects of deformation behaviour of calcite under conditions where 'dislocation creep' mechanisms dominate. The data provide {{a better understanding of}} the rheological behaviour of calcite rocks, and provide a basis for meaningful texture (crystallographic preferred orientation) modelling for calcite polycrystals. In chapter 1, previous work on intracrystalline plastic mechanisms in calcite is summarized. Aspects of deformation behaviour hitherto insufficiently understood are highlighted, thus defining the scope for the present study. Chapter 2 describes uniaxial compression experiments performed on optical quality calcite single crystals at temperatures and constant strain rates in the range 400 to 800 °C and 3 x 10 - 4 to 3 x 10 - 8 sec- 1 respectively (mostly under controlled CO 2 pressure). The tests were carried out with the compression direction parallel to [4041], Le. parallel to the intersection of two cleavage rhombs. At temperatures below - 600 °C, the crystals deformed largely bye-twinning. At higher temperatures, deformation occurred by slip on a single r system plus a single f system in the so-called positive sense, as identified by slip line analysis. The effective slip direction within the active f-plane was of type rather than the type reported previously. In the slip dominated regime, the samples exhibited steady state flow behaviour. The flow stresses were found to be relatively insensitive to strain rate and can be empirically described by a power law creep equation with a stress exponent ranging from - 13 at 550 - 600 °C to - 9. 5 at 700 - 800 °C. Irregular dislocation networks, observed in TEM, are prominent features of the dislocation substructure. These networks may have developed from dislocation interactions involving double cross slip. A related network recovery mechanism is implied by the steady state flow behaviour of the single crystals. In chapter 3, results are presented for uniaxial compression experiments on calcite single crystals in a second orientation, namely with the compression direction at 30 ° to the c-axis and 23 ° to the pole on a cleavage rhomb (Le. subparallel to [2243]). The tests were performed at temperatures in the range 300 - 800 °C, mostly at a constant strain rate of 3 x 10 - 5 sec- 1. The stress-strain curves exhibited multistage hardening behaviour, steady state only being approached at higher temperatures and/or high strains (> 10 %). The active glide systems were found to be two r systems and one single f system, all in the so-called negative sense. In addition, at T;::: 600 °C, definitive evidence was found for slip on the basal plane. The observed work hardening behaviour is attributed to the absence of a network-related recovery mechanism. Chapter 4 compares the strength characteristics of the r, f and c glide systems in calcite. Based on yield data obtained from multi-stage stress-strain curves, it is shown that no significant difference exists in strength between positive and negative glide on the r and 1 systems. Considering present results as well as previous data, it is also concluded that two regimes of slip system activity exist: 1) a low temperature regime involving <b>e-twinning,</b> r glide and 1 glide, and 2) a higher temperature regime characterized by r, 1 and c slip. A major texture transition is to be expected passing between these regimes In chapter 5, the stress (0 ") vs. dislocation density (p) relation for calcite single crystals is experimentally determined. The relationship obtained is found to be in good agreement with the well-known theoretical relation, 0 " DC pO. 5, based on theory of dislocation interaction. Data on calcite polycrystals, however, deviate from this. Using a concept of non-homogeneous deformation related to grain size, a simple model is put forward to account for this. In chapter 6, the flow data obtained for single crystals compressed in the [4041] orientation (chapter 2) are fitted to various microphysical models of dislocation creep. By considering the fitting results and microstructural observations, and comparing these with existing data on other materials, it is proposed that the steady state deformation of single crystals is best explained by a dislocation cross slip controlled creep mechanism. Mechanical behaviour and microstructures characteristic of calcite polycrystals, deformed at roughly identical conditions, show various similarities with the single crystals, and their creep behaviour may well be rate-controlled by the same mechanism. Finally, chapter 7 reports observations on deformed limestones from a small scale shear zone in SW Wales, UK, where maximum PT conditions were 130 MPa, and 200 °C respectively. Flattened, strained calcite grains, high dislocation densities and a weak but distinct crystallographic preferred orientation indicate that deformation occurred predominantly by intracrystalline mechanisms. Using conventional paleopiezometers (dislocation density, recrystallized grain size, twinning frequency) and failure criteria, a paleostress within the range 70 - 410 MPa was inferred for the shear zone. Values computed by extrapolating various experimentally determined flow equations for calcite materials show a far wider range of stresses. Notably, power laws are unsuccesful in reliably predicting paleostresses in deformed calcite rocks at low metamorphic grade. In contrast, the cross slip controlled creep equation established for single crystals in the [4041] orientation may offer a method for estimating minimum flow stresses in limestones deformed at low temperature...|$|E

30|$|For sample CV- 2, it {{has been}} shown that two microstructures, kink bands and {{mechanical}} <b>e-twins,</b> are developed in calcite grains. The kink bands were developed by the compression parallel to the long axis of fibrous calcite grains (i.e., buckling, Ramsay, [1967]), and hence, it is perpendicular to the vein wall. The fact that fluid inclusions are concentrated in some parts of the kinked bands elongated parallel to the fiber long axis suggests that dilation occurred normal to the fiber long axis, thereby providing evidence that these microstructures that are correlated with dilation veins in a kink band (Ramsay, [1967]) are in fact caused by kinking. Further, brittle fractures were formed along the axial plane of kink folds (Figure  2 d), which indicates that the formation of kink bands (or folds) was accommodated by brittle fractures under very low temperatures. Therefore, the possibility that the apparently curved fiber veins were formed by a change in the opening direction of the veins (e.g., Passchier and Trouw, [2005]; Bons et al. [2012]) can be completely rejected.|$|R
40|$|Twinning of the e-plane is the {{dominant}} crystal–plastic deformation mechanism in calcite deformed below about 400 °C. Calcite in a twin domain has a different crystallographic orientation from the host calcite grain. So-called thin twins appear as thin black lines when viewed parallel to the twin plane at 200 – 320 × magnification under a petrographic microscope. Thick twins viewed {{in the same way}} have a microscopically visible width of twinned material between black lines. Calcite <b>e-twin</b> width and morphology has been correlated with temperature of deformation in naturally deformed coarse-grained calcite. In this paper, we present a compilation and analysis of data from limestones of the frontal Alps (France and Switzerland) and the Appalachian Valley and Ridge and Plateau provinces (eastern United States) to document this temperature dependence. Mean calcite twin width correlates directly with temperature of deformation such that thin twins dominate below 170 °C and thick twins dominate above 200 °C. Above 250 °C dynamic recrystallization is an important deformation mechanism in calcite. Mean twin intensity (twin planes/mm) correlates negatively with temperature, and a cross plot of twin intensity with twin width can yield information about both strain and temperature of deformation.

40|$|The Orgueil CI {{carbonaceous}} chondrite is a breccia {{and some of}} its constituent clasts contain Ca-carbonate grains whose mineralogy is undetermined, but may yield new information on the history of its asteroidal or cometary parent body. Characterisation of one such clast shows that in addition to Ca-carbonate it contains magnetite, olivine and orthopyroxene grains that are supported within a finely crystalline saponite–serpentine–ferrihydrite groundmass. The Ca-carbonate grains are typically rounded, less than 10 μm in diameter, and backscatter Kikuchi patterns identify all those analysed as calcite. Electron backscatter diffraction orientation contrast maps show that most calcites have sub-μm sized <b>e-twins,</b> some of which are cut by corroded grain margins. These microstructures demonstrate that the clast experienced very mild shock during aqueous alteration and probably accompanying impact ‘gardening’ of the parent body regolith. The sample studied hosts several other millimeter sized clasts and a fine grained clastic matrix that are free of Ca-carbonate, olivine and orthopyroxene although can contain apatite, dolomite and pyrrhotite. Within one of these clasts is a network of phyllosilicate–magnetite veins that are inferred to have acted as fluid flow conduits during parent body aqueous alteration.

The results suggest {{that at least two}} events of calcite crystallization have taken place during aqueous alteration, and at least three episodes of deformation are recorded by the calcite. The first event of calcite crystallization produced calcite grains scattered throughout the matrix, and the second event formed a calcite vein via localized fluid flow.
