40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the representation of}} linguistic variation in the Finnish translations of four Swedish coming-of-age stories depicting migrant or minority perspectives: Mikael Niemi’s 2000 Popular Music from Vittula, Jonas Hassen Khemiri’s 2003 Ett öga rött, Marjaneh Bakhtiari’s 2005 Kalla det vad <b>fan</b> <b>du</b> vill, and Susanna Alakoski’s 2006 Svinalängorna. Through an analysis of speech and thought representation techniques and focalization, the article explores {{the role played by}} literature and translation in the materialization of dialects and sociolects as bounded entities. The paper argues that linguistic and social hybridity, on which the reception of minority and migrant literatures often focuses, is accompanied by the reification of new varieties conceived as authentic expressions of migrant and minority experience. Literature and translation are active agents in such processes, which are largely based on cultural, discursive, and cognitive constraints that condition the interpretation of each text...|$|E

40|$|The {{understanding}} of Swedish ‘immigrant literature’ {{as an expression}} or illustration of ethnicity is, for several reasons, deeply problematic. For the representation of ethnic experiences and identities in ‘immigrant literature’ {{is a product of}} the discursive construction of this kind of literature, rather than by the authors’ ethnic cultures. And this construction generates extremely narrow, and often othering and exoticizing, representations of non-Swedish ethnicities, since it is conditioned by the emerging self-image of Sweden as a multicultural society – a self-image underpinned by a rigid opposition between Swedish and immigrant culture. Futhermore, the view of ‘immigrant literature’ as a literature expressing ethnic experiences runs counter to an {{understanding of}} ethnicity as a cultural construct, since it presupposes that ethnicities exist outside of, and prior to, cultural representations. Thereby this view is indicative of (or, even, contributing to) the dominating Swedish discourse about ethnicity – a discourse which racializes non-Swedish ethnicities. In addition to this, the view of ‘immigrant literature’ as a literature expressing ethnicity is at odds with the representation of the relationship between cultural texts and ethnicity put forward in at least some ‘immigrant novels’. Works such as Jonas Hassen Khemiri’s Ett öga rött and Marjaneh Bakhtiari’s Kalla det vad <b>fan</b> <b>du</b> vill, for example, criticize both the construction of ‘immigrant literature’ as a source of information about non-Swedish ethnicities and the understanding of ethnicity as a pre-cultural category underpinning this view. By deconstructing the idea that literature and other cultural practices can express ethnic experiences, and by arguing that these practices should rather be viewed as constitutive of such experiences, Bakhtiari and Khemiri not only criticize the dominant view of ‘immigrant literature’. They also point out how the study of this literature – as well as literary criticism in general – could contribute to the understanding of ethnicity, namely by critically investigating how this phenomenon is constructed in literary texts...|$|E
50|$|The lake {{is within}} open country and readily {{accessible}} to walkers. A popular path up to Pen y Fan runs southwards up Cwm Llwch, passing by the outlet of the lake.

5000|$|Pen y Fan [...] is {{the highest}} peak in south Wales, {{situated}} in the Brecon Beacons National Park. At 886 m above sea-level, {{it is also the}} highest British peak south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia. The twin summits of Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du</b> at 873 m (2,864 ft) were formerly referred to as Cadair Arthur or 'Arthur's Seat'.|$|R
50|$|Picws Du is {{the second}} highest peak of the Carmarthen Fans (or, in Welsh Bannau Sir Gaer) in the Carmarthenshire section of the Black Mountain in {{the west of the}} Brecon Beacons National Park in south Wales. The highest peak is Fan Foel {{immediately}} next along the ridge and it is a subsidiary summit of <b>Fan</b> Brycheiniog.Picws <b>Du</b> falls within Fforest Fawr Geopark and its prominent summit is marked by a large Bronze Age round barrow at a height of 2457 feet above sea level. Waun Lefrith is the other, lower summit of the Bannau Sir Gaer / Carmarthen Fans situated to the west. The peak overlooks the glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach in the cwm below. As the peak {{sits on the edge of}} the escarpment on a ridge which juts out into the valley below, the views from the summit are panoramic and extensive. The views to the north are especially impressive when the weather is clear, looking towards the Cambrian Mountains, Mynydd Epynt and Brecon. Swansea and the Bristol Channel can just be seen on the horizon to the south, across the gently falling dip slope. Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du</b> are distinctive landmarks seen directly to the east across Fforest Fawr.|$|R

30|$|The Homework Distraction Scale (HDS; Xu, 2015) assesses one {{specific}} aspect of self-regulation in homework completion: the (in)ability to suppress distractors {{and maintain the}} attention in the homework task. The HDS is composed of six items that the students must rate using a Likert-type scale and that are organized into two dimensions: (a) conventional distraction (e.g. Start conversations unrelated to what I’m doing) and (b) tech-related distraction (e.g. Stop math homework to play online games or video games). Xu, <b>Fan,</b> and <b>Du</b> (2015) tested the two-factor structure and its measurement invariance across gender using a sample of 796 Chinese 8 th graders. They found evidence {{for the existence of}} metric invariance between boys and girls. However, given that scalar invariance was not tested, no mean comparisons between both gender groups were performed.|$|R
50|$|The {{view from}} the summit covers the Black Mountains to the north, the Cotswolds to the east, {{as far as the}} Brecon Beacons {{including}} Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du</b> to the west and the Bristol Channel to the south. The Skirrid is easily visible to the immediate east, including its spectacular landslip at its northern end.On a clear day it is possible to see hills as far north as Shropshire and as far south as Somerset.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} {{inhabited}} during the Neolithic and the succeeding Bronze Age, {{the most obvious}} legacy of the latter being the numerous burial cairns which adorn the hills of the centre and west of the National Park. There are especially good examples of round barrows on Fan Brycheiniog, Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du.</b> The former was excavated in 2002-4 and the ashes in the central cist dated to about 2000 BC using radiocarbon dating. A wreath of meadowsweet was likely placed in the burial.|$|R
50|$|The peak is {{prominent}} on {{the north}} facing escarpment of {{the central part of}} the Brecon Beacons and several footpaths cross the summit. All the surrounding land is open access and so walkers can go where they wish. In poor weather however, the paths are the safest route for access. The peak is often crossed by hikers aiming for Cribyn, Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du,</b> and also forms part of the Fan dance, or Horseshoe Walk, a circular route that traverses four peaks.|$|R
50|$|From Crickhowell http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/645201 the Beacons Way skirts {{the mass}} of Pen Cerrig-calch to reach Cwmdu in the Rhiangoll valley then heads up onto the {{southern}} ridge of Mynydd Llangorse which it then follows southwards {{to the village of}} Bwlch. The Way crosses the River Usk to enter Llangynidr and heads up around Tor y Foel making for the head of Glyn Collwn above Talybont Reservoir. The route then crosses the highest peaks in the central Beacons : Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du.</b> In good weather, the peaks are usually crowded with visitors.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is situated}} in part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. It is situated to {{the western end of}} the park, sitting below the Black Mountain (range), and most of the summits in the range are visible from the reservoir, especially (from left to right in the image) Fan Hir, Fan Brycheiniog, <b>Fan</b> Foel, Picws <b>Du</b> and Waun Lefrith. It lies about six miles {{to the north of the}} centre of the escarpment at Fan Foel, and is an important landmark for walkers on the mountain range.|$|R
5000|$|Admission to {{the centre}} itself is free. There is a pay and display car park. A shop sells maps and guides and items of walking equipment. A {{cafeteria}} provides food and drinks throughout the year. The Centre hosts {{a variety of}} events, including guided walks, some of which explore the common of Mynydd Illtud beside which the Centre is situated. [...] From the grounds and in particular from the terrace there are good views of the two highest peaks in the Brecon Beacons, Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du.</b>|$|R
50|$|The route then {{follows a}} section of the Roman road known as Sarn Helen before cutting off west through the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu {{national}} nature reserve to Penwyllt. The Beacons Way passes by Craig-y-Nos Castle, once home to Adelina Patti, and up along Fan Hir and Fan Brycheiniog, significant eastern peaks of the Black Mountain rising above Llyn y Fan Fawr, before entering Carmarthenshire. It traverses the three main summits of the Carmarthen Fans, these being <b>Fan</b> Foel, Picws <b>Du</b> and Waun Lefrith, passing above Llyn y Fan Fach before dropping down to Llanddeusant.|$|R
5000|$|The eunuchs {{were not}} content with just {{removing}} the partisans from government. In 169, they persuaded the 13-year-old Emperor Ling that the partisans were intent on rebellion. [...] The leading partisans, including Li, <b>Du,</b> <b>Fan</b> Pang (范滂), were arrested and executed. Overall, about 100 people lost their lives. Many partisans hid, {{with the assistance of}} an underground network who largely renamed anonymous even later, but included such eventually-important figures as Yuan Shao and Kong Rong. The partisans who were not on the arrest rolls had their liberties further restricted.|$|R
50|$|Pollen {{analysis}} of the buried soil under the barrow showed that a grass-heath vegetation community dominated the summit of Fan Foel immediately prior to construction of the barrow, with hazel scrub on the lower slopes and mixed woodland with oak especially at lower levels. Charcoal was {{also found in the}} buried soil, and may indicate burning to improve soil cultivation, or alternatively, local use of fire as a beacon, as suggested by the name of the range of the Brecon Beacons. Both Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du</b> are visible on the horizon about 15 miles away.|$|R
50|$|The Old Red Sandstone (ORS) {{forms the}} {{principal}} summits which have attracted walkers {{to the area}} for decades. Walks on Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du</b> and over the Carmarthen Fans / Bannau Brycheiniog are amongst the most popular. Carboniferous Limestone forms an east-west belt of country {{to the south of}} the ORS which sports some of the country’s longest and deepest cave networks such as Ogof Ffynnon Ddu and the impressive Porth yr Ogof into which the Afon Mellte flows. Further south again is a Millstone Grit landscape, the most visited part of which is Waterfall Country which boasts the finest collection of waterfalls in the UK.|$|R
50|$|When Du Ya (杜亞) {{served as}} the defender of the eastern capital Luoyang, {{as he had been}} {{friendly}} with Li Cheng, he invited Li Fan to serve as a secretary under him.

False accusations were laid against Du's officer Linghu Yun (令狐運), and Du believed the accusations, tortured Linghu, and extracted a confession. Li Fan knew that Linghu was innocent and argued on his behalf; when his arguments were rejected, he resigned. When the real robber, Song Jutan (宋瞿曇), was eventually captured, Li Fan became famous.|$|R
50|$|Llyn Cwm Llwch is a {{small lake}} or pool in the Brecon Beacons National Park in Powys, Wales. It is between 1 and 2 acres: {{much smaller than the}} two glacial lakes in the west of the Black Mountain (range): Llyn y Fan Fawr and Llyn y Fan Fach. It is of glacial origin, occupying a rock hollow beneath the peaks of Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du</b> in the central Brecon Beacons. It is drained by the Nant Cwm Llwch which empties into the Afon Tarell, which itself enters the River Usk at Brecon.Tommy Jones' obelisk, a {{memorial}} in granite to a young boy who died near this spot in 1900, overlooks the lake.|$|R
50|$|The entire hill is {{open country}} and thus {{available}} for walkers to roam at will, {{although there is}} much peat bog off route, which {{can be difficult to}} cross. The path along the ridge is popular and forms a part of a circuit. The views {{from the edge of the}} escarpment are spectacular with Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du</b> visible on the skyline to the east, and Fan Gyhirych closer in Fforest Fawr. The Beacons Way long distance footpath runs beneath Fan Hir on the east affording close-up views of this impressive hill. The path leads to the glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fawr and then climbs up the escarpment via a stone staircase of even gradient to the bwlch below Fan Brycheiniog. The stone path is well drained and dry, and there is little exposure to steep drops.|$|R
40|$|Aim and {{objectives}} To study {{the effect of}} two Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) formulae in treating acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), diagnosed by Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), compared to placebo. Design Two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials nested {{in a study of}} 327 patients who were diagnosed with URTIs in Hong Kong. Subjects were classified into one of two TCM syndrome groups by a Chinese medicine practitioner and randomized to receive the corresponding CHM formulae or placebo up to maximum of 10 days. The proportions of patients who had resolution of illness on Days 4 and 7 were the primary outcomes. The duration of symptom resolution, health-related quality of life scores measured by the SF- 36 and ChQOL, and adverse effects were secondary outcomes. Results There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo in resolution rates at Day 4 or 7. The mean time of resolution of symptoms was Day 10, for either wind-cold or wind-heat syndrome. Both patients in treatment and placebo had significantly improved in health-related quality of life with time, but patients in wind-cold group had significantly more improvement in the SF- 36 general health score (P = 0. 01) than placebo. Conclusions Two CHM formulae commonly used for URTIs were not found to be more effective than placebo in either cure or reduction of symptoms of URTIs. However, Jing <b>Fan</b> Bai <b>Du</b> san might be able to improve general health more than placebo for patients with wind-cold syndrome. Both formulae were not associated with any more side effects. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|There is a Bronze Age burial cairn at {{the summit}} of Fan Foel, and it was {{excavated}} in 2002-4 with the results published in 2014 in Archaeologia Cambrensis. The round barrow was about 16 metres (about 52 feet) wide and was badly eroded with stones from the structure removed to build a central cairn by passing walkers. Excavation of the barrow showed that it contained two separate burials, the central one in a stone cist contained the burnt bones of an adult woman and two children carbon dated to about 2000 BC. The ground surface beneath the barrow was carbon dated to about 2300 BC. The cist also contained a broken pottery food vessel decorated {{in the style of}} the Beaker people as well as a chert knife. The second burial was somewhat later and contained a broken collared urn with a rare belt hook, indicating a wealthy person. The remains of meadowsweet flowers were found in the primary cist, and may represent a wreath left with the burnt bones. The large capstone which covers the cist has been left in place in the current state of the barrow (as of October 2015). The outer kerb stones are still exposed, and show how the barrow was built. There is great similarity to the early Bronze Age barrows on the summits of Pen y <b>Fan</b> and Corn <b>Du,</b> which are also exposed to show the internal cists and outer kerbstones.|$|R

[...] In any case, the Du clan claimed original ancestry from the Zhou Dynasty states Tang and Du and traced its ancestry to officials of Lu, Chu, Qin Dynasty, Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Sui Dynasty, and Tang. Neither Du Yuanying's great-grandfather Du Ziyuan (杜自遠) nor grandfather <b>Du</b> <b>Fan</b> (杜繁) was listed with any offices, although Du Yuanying's father Du Zuo (杜佐) served as a judge at the supreme court. Du Yuanying had at least one younger brother, Du Yuanjiang (杜元絳).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the performance of the solid low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) disposal units located on a mesa top at TA- 54, Area G, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM, and to provide in-situ (vadose zone) site characterization information to Area G`s Performance Assessment. The vadose zone beneath an active disposal unit (DU 37), was accessed by utilizing low-impact, air-rotary horizontal drilling technology. Core samples were pulled, via wire-line core method, in 3 horizontal holes <b>fanning</b> out below <b>DU</b> 37 at approximately 5 foot intervals depending on recovery percentage. Samples were surveyed and prepared in-field following Environmental Restoration (ER) guidelines. Samples were transferred from the field to the CST- 9 Radvan for initial radiological screening. Following screening, samples were delivered to CST- 3 analytical lab for analyses including moisture content, 23 inorganics, 60 volatile organic compounds (VOC`s), 68 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC`s), tritium, lead 210, radium 226 & 228, cesium 137, isotopic plutonium, americium 241, strontium 90, isotopic uranium, and isotopic thorium. Other analyses included matric potential, alpha spectroscopy, gamma spectroscopy, and gross alpha/beta. The overall results of the analysis identified only tritium as having migrated from the DU. Am- 241, Eu- 152, and Pu- 238 were possibly identified above background but the results are not definitive. Of all organics analysed for, only ethyl acetate was tentatively identified slightly above background. All inorganics were found to be well below regulatory limits. Based on the results of the above mentioned analyses, it was determined that Area G`s disposal units are performing well and no significant liquid phase migration of contaminants has occurred...|$|R
