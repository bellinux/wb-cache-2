The domain for these equations is commonly a 3 or less Euclidean space, for which an orthogonal coordinate reference frame is usually set to explicit the system of scalar partial differential equations to be solved. In 3D orthogonal coordinate systems are 3: Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical. Expressing the Navier–Stokes vector equation in Cartesian coordinates is quite straightforward and not much influenced {{by the number of}} dimensions of the euclidean space employed, and this is the case also for the first-order terms (like the variation and convection ones) also in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. But for the higher order terms (the two coming from the divergence of the <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stress</b> that distinguish Navier–Stokes equations from Euler equations) some tensor calculus is required for deducing an expression in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems.|$|E

Such tests performed to date favor force models in which ridge pushing forces play a significant role. For such models the general magnitude of regional <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses</b> is comparable to the 200 - 300 bar compressive stress exerted by spreading ridges. An alternative approach to estimating magnitudes of regional <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses</b> from stress orientations is to seek regions of local stress either demonstrably smaller than or larger than the regional stresses.

40|$|Si is a {{promising}} anode material for Li-ion batteries, since it absorbs {{large amounts of}} Li. However, insertion of Li leads to 334 % of volumetric expansion, huge stresses, and fracture; it can be suppressed by utilizing nanoscale anode structures. Continuum approaches to stress relaxation in LixSi, based on plasticity theory, are unrealistic, because the yield strength of LixSi {{is much higher than}} the generated stresses. Here, we suggest that stress relaxation is due to anisotropic (tensorial) compositional straining that occurs during insertion-extraction at any <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses.</b> Developed theory describes known experimental and atomistic simulation data. A method to reduce stresses is predicted and confirmed by known experiments. Chemical potential has an additional contribution due to <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses,</b> which leads to increases in the driving force both for insertion and extraction.

40|$|During ice-structure interaction, ice {{will fail}} in a brittle manner {{dominated}} by two processes. The first {{corresponds to the}} formation of macrocracks and the consequent spalling-off of large ice pieces. The second includes and intense shear-damage process in zones, termed critical zones, where high pressures are transmitted to the structure. The shear-damage process results in microstructural changes including microcrack formation and recrystallization. A range of tests on laboratory-prepared granular ice have been conducted to determine the fundamental behaviour of ice under various stress states and stress history, particularly as it relates to changes of microstructure. The test series was designed to study three aspects: the intrinsic creep properties of intact, undamaged ice; the enhancement of creep and changes in microstructure due to damage; and the effects of different stress paths. Tests on intact ice with triaxial confining pressures and <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses,</b> aimed at defining the intrinsic creep response in the absence of microcracking, showed that an accelerated creep rate occurred at relatively low <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses.</b> Hence, a minimum creep rate occurred under these conditions. Recrystallization to a smaller grain-size and void formation were observed. Ice damaged uniaxially and triaxially prior to testing showed enhancement of creep under both uniaxial and triaxial loading conditions. Creep rates in triaxially damaged ice were found to ben non-linear with high <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses,</b> corresponding to a power-law dependence of creep rate. Uniaxially damaged specimens contained microcracks parallel to the stressed direction which tended to close under triaxial confinement. Damage under triaxial conditions at low confining presses produced small recrystallized grains near zones of microcracking. At high confining pressures, a fine-grained recrystallized structure with no apparent cracking was observed uniformly across the specimen. The recrystallization process contributes significantly to the enhanced creep rates. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Near {{the base of}} ice-sheets, stress {{is proportional to the}} surface slope, at least when averaged over a suitable horizontal distance. At the flow divide, the surface slope is zero, implying that near the base of the ice-sheet, the viscosity increases. This diverts ice flow laterally, and is the cause of the characteristic anticlines, which are in effect draped over the high viscosity area.|$|R

40|$|International audienceExtraction {{of useful}} geochemical, petrologic and {{structural}} information from deformed fluid inclusions {{is still a}} challenge in rocks displaying moderate plastic strain. In order {{to better understand the}} inclusion modifications induced by <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses,</b> six deformation experiments were performed with a Griggs piston-cylinder apparatus. Natural NaCl-H 2 O inclusions in an oriented quartz crystal were subjected to differential stresses of 250 - 470 MPa at 700 - 900 A degrees C and at 700 - 1, 000 MPa confining pressure. Independently of the strain rate and of the crystallographic orientation of the quartz, the inclusions became dismembered and flattened within a crystallographic cleavage plane subperpendicular to sigma (1). The neonate (newly formed) inclusions that result from dismemberment have densities that tend towards equilibrium with P (fluid) = sigma (1) at T (shearing). These results permit ambiguities in earlier deformation experiments on CO 2 -H 2 O-NaCl to be resolved. The results of the two studies converge, indicating that density changes in neonate inclusions are promoted by high differential stresses, long periods at high P and high T, and fluid compositions that maximize quartz solubility. Neonates spawned from large precursor inclusions show greater changes in density that those spawned from small precursors. These findings support the proposal that deformed fluid inclusions can serve as monitors of both the orientation and magnitude of <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses</b> during low-strain, ductile deformation of quartz-bearing rocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of low-angle normal faults {{indicates that the}} ratio of shear stress (TAU) to normal stress (sigma sub N) needed to cause slip on faults is substantially less than would be predicted based on experimental data. Because the tensional strength of rock at a large scale is exceedingly low, the upper plate of a low-angle normal fault cannot be pulled down the fault ramp, but must be driven down it by its own weight. The active or recently active Sevier Desert detachment fault in western Utah dips regionally at 12 deg. The radio of shear stress to normal stress due to {{the weight of the}} upper plate on a 12 deg dipping fault surface is 0. 2. In contrast, laboratory experiments indicate that slip on fracture surfaces occurs with almost all rock types when (tau/sigma) reaches values of 0. 6 to 0. 85, corresponding to normal-fault dips of 30 deg to 40 deg. Seismological data indicate that low <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses</b> are associated with movement on faults of other geometrics and are not unique to low-angle normal faults. It thus appears that approximately planar fault zones with surface areas of hundreds to thousands of square kilometers have different mechanical properties than would be predicted based on laboratory studies of fractured rock.

40|$|The quasiharmonic {{approximation}} (QHA), in its simplest form {{also called}} the statically constrained (SC) QHA, {{has been shown to}} be a straightforward method to compute thermoelastic properties of crystals. Recently we showed that for non-cubic solids SC-QHA calculations develop <b>deviatoric</b> thermal <b>stresses</b> at high temperatures. Relaxation of these stresses leads to a series of corrections to the free energy that may be taken to any desired order, up to self-consistency. Here we show how to correct the elastic constants obtained using the SC-QHA. We exemplify the procedure by correcting to first order the elastic constants of MgSiO$_ 3 $-perovskite and MgSiO$_ 3 $-post-perovskite, the major phases of the Earth's lower mantle. We show that this first order correction is quite satisfactory for obtaining the aggregated elastic averages of these minerals and their velocities in the lower mantle. This type of correction is also shown to be applicable to experimental measurements of elastic constants in situations where <b>deviatoric</b> <b>stresses</b> can develop, such as in diamond anvil cells.
