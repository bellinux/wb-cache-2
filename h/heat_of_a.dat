5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle {{over the course of}} one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E

The results suggest that local <b>heating</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> magnetic loop will lead to the enhancement of the density of the neighboring loops through MHD wave compression.

25|$|Seurat uses {{a variety}} of means to suggest the baking <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> summer’s day at the riverside.

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used on class B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the dry chemical agents developed. In the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store much heat in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of wet chemical agents, but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than wet chemical agents for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective on class A fires.

500|$|The Softwire is {{actually}} a story that Haarsma began imagining in his childhood.

Growing up, Haarsma dreamed of moving to the United States; and in his twenties, he actually did.
