5|$|The current menu {{still has}} {{elements}} {{from the earlier}} days of the restaurant, such as lobster thermidor and grouse. Chef Gueller produces modern French cuisine, with classical elements. Dishes on the restaurant's menu include a terrine of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> served with a salad of smoked eel, alongside apple served both as a jelly and as a purée. <b>Foie</b> <b>gras</b> was temporarily taken off the menu in 2008 following threats of protests from animal rights activists. The dish was later restored to the menu, and <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> has also since been served with a duck terrine and pistachios.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, geese {{and ducks}} are force-fed to produce livers with an {{exceptionally}} high fat {{content for the}} production of <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China. <b>Foie</b> <b>gras</b> is considered a luxury {{in many parts of the}} world, but the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries on animal welfare grounds.|$|E
5|$|A typical French Christmas dish is {{turkey with}} chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> The Yule log {{is a very}} French {{tradition}} during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal {{in reference to the}} twelve apostles and Christ.|$|E
5|$|Varieties of meat {{consumed}} include poulet (chicken), pigeon (squab), canard (duck), oie (goose, {{the source}} of <b>foie</b> <b>gras),</b> bœuf (beef), veau (veal), porc (pork), agneau (lamb), mouton (mutton), caille (quail), cheval (horse), grenouille (frog), and escargot (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include cod, canned sardines, fresh sardines, canned tuna, fresh tuna, salmon, trout, mussels, herring, oysters, shrimp and calamari.|$|E
5|$|Although not a vegetarian, Winslet, in 2010, narrated a {{video for}} PETA that showed animal cruelty in the {{production}} of <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> She encouraged chefs to remove the item from their menu and urged consumers to boycott it. In 2015, Winslet lent her support to the UNICEF campaign World’s Largest Lesson, which creates awareness among children about sustainable development and global citizenship. Teased as a child for her weight, Winslet takes a stand against body-shaming and bullying. She narrated an Australian animated short film named Daisy Chain (2015), about a victim of cyber-bullying. In 2017, Winslet teamed with Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental foundation for a fundraiser on global warming. Also that year, DiCaprio and Winslet auctioned off a private dinner with themselves to raise money for a British mother's cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{there is}} pâté de <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> mousse de <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> (either must contain 50% or more <b>foie</b> <b>gras),</b> parfait de <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> (must contain 75% or more foie gras); and other {{preparations}} (no legal obligation established).|$|E
25|$|Generally, French {{preparations}} of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{are made}} over low heat, as fat melts faster {{from the traditional}} goose <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> than the duck <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> produced in most {{other parts of the}} world. American and other New World preparations, typically employing duck <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> have more recipes and dish preparations for serving <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> hot, rather than cool or cold.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{the whole}} of the EU {{produced}} approximately 25,000 tonnes of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> – 23,000 tonnes of duck <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> and 2,000 tonnes of goose <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> The same year, France was producing 72% of world <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production of which 97% was from ducks.|$|E
25|$|Hungary is the world's second-largest <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> (libamáj) {{producer}} {{and the largest}} exporter. France is the principal market for Hungarian <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> – mainly exported raw. Approximately 30,000 Hungarian goose farmers are dependent on the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> industry. French food companies spice, process, and cook the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{so it may be}} sold as a French product in its domestic and export markets.|$|E
25|$|In Hungary, goose <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{traditionally}} is fried in goose fat, {{which is}} then poured over the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> and left to cool; it is also eaten warm, after being fried or roasted, with some chefs smoking the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> over a cherry wood fire.|$|E
25|$|Raw <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (poêlé) or (with {{care and}} attention), grilled. As <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> has high fat content, contact with heat {{needs to be}} brief and {{therefore}} at high temperature, lest it burn or melt. Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> to be cut to a thickness between 15 and 25mm (½ – 1inch), resulting in a rare, uncooked center. Some chefs prefer not to devein the <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> as the veins can help preserve {{the integrity of the}} fatty liver. It is increasingly common to sear the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> on one side only, leaving the other side uncooked. Practitioners of molecular gastronomy such as Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck restaurant first flash-freeze <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> in liquid nitrogen as part of the preparation process.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> was {{produced}} from special breeds of geese. However, by 2004, geese accounted {{for less than}} 10% of the total global <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production and by 2014 only 5% of total French production. Goose breeds used in modern <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production are primarily the grey Landes goose (Anser anser) and the Toulouse goose.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{increased}} internationalization of cuisines and food supply, <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is increasingly found in hot preparations {{not only in}} the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> ("foie gras de canard") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to cooking at high temperature than is goose <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> ("foie gras d'oie"), but chefs have been able to cook goose <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{production}} was banned in Brussels - {{the capital of}} Belgium, {{which is one of}} the few remaining countries that produces <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b>|$|E
25|$|The term ethical <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> or humane <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is {{also used}} for gavage-based <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{production}} that {{is more concerned with}} the animal's welfare (using rubber hoses rather than steel pipes for feeding). Others have expressed skepticism at these claims of humane treatment, as earlier attempts to produce fattened livers without gavage have not produced satisfactory results.|$|E
25|$|Duck <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is the {{slightly}} cheaper and, since {{a change of}} production methods in the 1950s to battery, {{by far the most}} common kind, particularly in the US. The taste of duck <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{is often referred to as}} musky with a subtle bitterness. Goose <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is noted for being less gamey and smoother, with a more delicate flavor.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{countries}} do not currently produce <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> nor have they in the past. Thus, these bans have stopped actual <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production in very few countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> in the Far East {{is such that}} China has become a {{sizeable}} producer. Madagascar is a small but rapidly growing producer of high quality <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is served in dishes such as <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> sushi rolls, in various forms of pasta or {{alongside}} steak tartare or atop a steak as a garnish.|$|E
25|$|Traditional low-heat cooking methods {{result in}} terrines, pâtés, parfaits, foams and mousses of <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> often flavored with truffle, {{mushrooms}} or brandy such as cognac or armagnac. These slow-cooked forms of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> are cooled and served {{at or below}} room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Fully cooked {{preparations}} {{are generally}} sold in either glass containers or metal cans for long-term preservation. Whole, fresh <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is usually unavailable in France outside the Christmas period, except in some producers' {{markets in the}} producing regions. Frozen whole <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> sometimes is sold in French supermarkets.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, the {{production}} of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is prohibited.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 8 MEPs {{called for}} <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> to be banned across Europe.|$|E
25|$|In modern gavage-based <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production, force feeding {{takes place}} 12–18 days before slaughter.|$|E
25|$|Raw <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> is also cured in salt ("cru au sel"), served {{slightly}} chilled.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued Hudson Valley <b>Foie</b> <b>Gras</b> {{over its}} {{advertising}} as “the humane choice” for <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b> Hudson Valley settled {{the case and}} dropped this advertising campaign after {{a federal judge in}} California indicated that he would allow the parties to present evidence and decide whether Hudson Valley could prove that its “humane” claims were truthful.|$|E
25|$|Baur {{played a}} role in a California law that went into effect in 2012, banning the {{production}} and sale of <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> which is made by force feeding ducks and geese and causing their livers to expand up to ten times their normal size. He was also involved in passing a 2006 (repealed in 2008) Chicago ordinance banning the sale of <b>foie</b> <b>gras.</b>|$|E
25|$|The force {{feeding of}} animals for non-medical purposes, {{essential}} to current <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production practices, is explicitly prohibited by specific laws in six of nine Austrian provinces, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, or following interpretation of general animal protection laws in Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. However, <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> can still be imported into and purchased in these countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{production}} is illegal in Argentina as a mistreatment or act of cruelty to animals.|$|E
25|$|In modern gavage-based <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> production, {{force-feeding}} {{takes place}} for between 17 and 30 days before slaughter.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the largest}} {{producer}} is Hudson Valley <b>Foie</b> <b>Gras,</b> which uses approximately 350,000 ducks each year.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Mayor Daley's objections on the <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> ban, the City Council overwhelmingly repealed Chicago's ban on May 14, 2008.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, the {{production}} and sale of <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> was banned in São Paulo restaurants. In February 2016, the law was overturned.|$|E
25|$|Typical <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> {{production}} involves force-feeding birds {{more food}} {{than they would}} eat in the wild, and much more than they would voluntarily eat domestically.|$|E
25|$|Since 1997, {{the number}} of European {{countries}} producing <b>foie</b> <b>gras</b> has halved. Only five countries still produce foie gras: Belgium, Romania, Spain, France and Hungary.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Hungary was {{producing}} 80% of the world's goose <b>foie</b> <b>gras,</b> however, production rates {{are likely to}} drop in 2017 due to outbreaks of bird flu.|$|E
