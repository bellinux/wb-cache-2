Having graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1930, Novikov moved to the air force in 1933, and served as chief of operations until 1935, when he took command of a light bomber squadron.|$|E
5|$|The {{funds from}} the robbery were {{originally}} kept {{at the house of}} Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze. The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion. The mattress was moved to another safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, possibly because Stalin had worked there. Some sources claim that Stalin himself <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> the money in the observatory. The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof.|$|E
5|$|The next week's {{game against}} the Pittsburgh Steelers began the longest {{consecutive}} starts streak for a quarterback in NFL history. The game ended in a 17–3 victory and his passer rating was 144.6. During the season, Favre <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> together a six-game winning streak for the Packers, the longest winning streak for the club since 1965. They ended 9–7 that season, missing the playoffs on their last game. Favre finished his first season as a Packer with 3,227yards and a quarterback rating of 85.3, helping him to his first Pro Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Twenty minutes later, the 16 Zuikaku torpedo planes {{arrived and}} split up to attack Enterprise. One group of torpedo bombers was {{attacked}} by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until Smiths commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> out the fires. Smith then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Dom PedroI's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the former Emperor's son, Dom PedroII, soon dissolved into chaos. Paraná formed a political party in 1837 that {{became known as the}} Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order in the early 1840s and in the mid-1850s into the Conservative Party. He and his party's stalwart and unconditional defence of constitutional order allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued by factious disputes and rebellions that might easily have led to a dictatorship. Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro Province in 1841, Paraná <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by PedroII to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first president (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers, but resigned after a quarrel with the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the 22 Floréal coup in France {{undermined}} Delacroix, {{because it}} inspired more sympathy by French foreign minister Talleyrand for the Dutch opposition members who demanded the ambassador's recall. At the same time, Daendels became disaffected {{with the regime}} he had <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> into power because of the depredations of the purging commissions. His French colleague General Joubert was displeased with the radicals because of conflicts about the co-dominion of Flushing. Finally, the newly appointed Agenten were disturbed about the inefficiency of the Uitvoerend Bewind. All these disaffections came together with the putsch on June 12, 1798, of that recidivist, general Daendels, in which he disturbed a dinner party of Delacroix and {{three members of the}} Uitvoerend Bewind, violating the diplomatic immunity of the ambassador by putting pistols to his chest. The members of the Representative Assembly were arrested in session.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was great. The local fire brigades <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> out the {{numerous}} fires and clear up the dead {{in and around the}} station. Mostly foam was used as the main water pipe had burst. Other fire units used water from static water tanks and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but repairable. As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Hart's {{new role}} {{involved}} overseeing the upkeep of the cemeteries and memorials {{established by the}} Commission in the Middle East, Turkey and Greece. Ensuring the maintenance of these places required extensive travel, and his duties also became more difficult when Italy joined in the Second World War in June 1940 and conflict {{broke out in the}} Middle East. This required the creation of an organisation responsible for the graves of Allied personnel killed in the region. Consequently, Hart became Assistant Director, Graves Registration and Inquiry Section for the Middle East, in addition to his existing Commission duties. His new position entailed him becoming a serving officer in the British Army as a lieutenant, but with the acting rank of brigadier. He set up grave registration units, new cemeteries and organised the relocation of existing graves in remote areas to the new cemeteries. This work struck a personal note when his nephew was killed during the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942. Early the following year Hart visited the El Alamein battlefield and the nearby cemetery, the establishment of which was partly due to the infrastructure he <b>helped</b> <b>put</b> in place, to lay flowers at his nephew's grave.|$|E
