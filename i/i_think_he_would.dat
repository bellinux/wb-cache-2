25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} I have seen, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly. A motion picture {{producer}} (I forget who) {{asked him to}} do a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and he had said he would agree to do one but would not commit himself to a series.|$|E
500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group were}} not sociable with reporters, and {{according}} to the book Morrison's drinking habits made him reclusive. [...] "I regret that we couldn't have controlled Morrison better... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been big if he'd been straightened out {{at the beginning of his}} career," [...] comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. [...] "He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke. He was no gift. There weren't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up." [...] says Phil Coulter in the book.|$|E

500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip [...] "I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brian– give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been a good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E
500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arrowverse {{executive}} producer Marc Guggenheim has stated, [...] "I {{would love to}} tackle [...] at some point. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fit really well in our little universe. So we talk about him a lot." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What a shaggy, dusty horse! He's wild, too. Do {{you let him}} {{stand that}} way without being haltered? <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> run off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose not. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{send some}} message. As a rule he is soft-hearted, {{although}} {{to me he}} has become suddenly so inexpressibly cruel." ...|$|R
2500|$|He toured New Zealand at the season's end {{and due to}} his keeping ability, Australia did {{not send}} a reserve for Barry Jarman. Burge said [...] "Cricket had been {{so much a part}} of Dad's life that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have wanted me to go." [...] He started the tour with a 105 against Canterbury and later made 81 not out against Auckland, but did not {{otherwise}} pass 50. New Zealand had Test status at the time, but the Australian Board of Control refused to ratify the matches between the two nations as such. Burge had little impact in three international matches, scoring 115 runs at 28.75 as Australia took the series 10. He ended the New Zealand tour with 310 runs at 38.75.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's possible, Ben, {{although}} I don't see how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{have the}} nerve to come back here after what happened. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> feel like quitting this territory entirely." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{hope your}} uncle Sir Godwin will not {{look down on}} Rosy, Mr. Lydgate. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do {{something}} handsome. A thousand or two can be nothing to a baronet." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'She {{has asked}} him to be her puro--her clergyman--at Saharunpore, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not do that {{on account of his}} River. She did talk.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was bound}} to do that, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> prefer the Monk. I wonder whether you care very much about my {{accepting}} the offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, he {{has plenty}} of sense, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not show it as a clergyman. He would {{be a piece of}} {{professional}} affectation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't wish {{to dislike}} him, Ellen, {{goodness}} knows. But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> care much whether we disliked him or not. I am sure your poor father and I {{would be only}} too glad to like him." ...|$|R

5000|$|His wife noted, [...] "I couldn't be more sad {{losing the}} love of my life and the leader of my family. <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be this brave, but I'm very proud of him for sacrificing for the country." ...|$|R
