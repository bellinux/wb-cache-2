5|$|Although <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> mostly minor, President George W. Bush {{initially}} declared 38counties in Mississippi federal disaster areas, {{making them}} eligible for {{assistance from the}} Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In the city of Meridian, over 300people sought shelter. More than 885people took shelter in Jackson County, and 1,000people were in shelters in neighboring Harrison County. On July 15, three additional counties became eligible for federal assistance, bringing the number of declared disaster areas to 41.|$|E
30|$|The fire {{effluents}} {{may or may}} {{not make}} an impact on the environment depending on the duration of exposure, the means of transmission to the environment, and the susceptibility of the receptor. A clear distinction to differentiate <b>impacts</b> <b>is</b> the differentiation between short term and long term, where short term <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> considered to occur over a few hours or a few days, at most. Long term <b>impacts</b> <b>are</b> <b>impacts</b> beyond immediate, short term impacts.|$|R

5|$|Another <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration. The increasing Irish immigration {{was seen as}} an economic boon by these antipodean countries. One {{of the reasons for the}} increase was due to many Irish deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America.|$|E

5|$|Beryl {{produced}} rough seas {{along the}} northeast United States coastline. In Massachusetts, its <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> limited to light rainfall and gusty winds, with no reported damage.

50|$|The largest, and oldest {{supporters}} {{group for}} the <b>Impact</b> <b>is</b> Ultras Montréal, who are also known as UM02, for the year the supporters club was founded (2002). Additionally, the <b>Impact</b> <b>are</b> supported by 127 Montréal. 127 Montréal formed in 2011, around the time the <b>Impact</b> <b>were</b> in transition from NASL to MLS.

5|$|Bonnie's <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> minimal. Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm's effects {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} light rainfall, and in Florida, the precipitation caused flooding and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States which killed three people and inflicted over $1million (2004USD) in damage. Bonnie made landfall in Florida {{the day before}} Hurricane Charley struck.|$|E
5|$|By late on July3, Ana {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. The storm also lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on July4, over the western Atlantic Ocean. The extratropical remnants persisted until dissipating about twenty-four hours later. Minimal <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> reported {{as a result}} of Ana, other than rip currents in coastal North Carolina. Due to the rough seas, 14rescues and one serious injury occurred at Carolina Beach. In addition, five rescues were made at Kure Beach and at least one person was hospitalized. However, there were no fatalities at either location.|$|E

His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.|$|E

5|$|In August 2017, despite {{not being}} signed to the {{promotion}} at the time, Hennigan appeared for Global Force Wrestling at its live events, teaming with James Storm and Moose to defeat Ethan Carter III, Lashley and Eli Drake on August 4, and Carter, Lashley and Low Ki on August 5. On August 17, a video package was shown at Destination X revealing Hennigan's ring name as Johnny Impact. He made his televised in-ring debut on the August 24 episode of GFW Impact! in a Gauntlet for the Gold {{match for the}} vacant GFW Global Championship, ending in the final three before being eliminated by eventual winner Eli Drake. The following week, he and Eddie Edwards interrupted Drake and Chris Adonis' championship celebration, {{which led to a}} tag team match on the main event, which Drake and Adonis won. On the September 14 edition of GFW Impact!, Johnny Impact defeated Low Ki to become the number one contender to the GFW Global Championship at Victory Road. After the match, <b>Impact</b> <b>was</b> brutally assaulted by Drake and Adonis. The week after, Impact defended his number one contender status in two matches, defeating both KM and Texano in the same night. At Victory Road, <b>Impact</b> <b>was</b> defeated by Drake and failed to win the GFW Global Championship. After the match, he was attacked by Drake and Adonis but was saved by Garza Jr.. However, {{the two of them were}} assaulted by LAX. On the October 12 episode of Impact!, Impact defeated Garza in a number one contendership match to challenge Eli Drake for the Global Championship in the main event of Bound for Glory. At the event, <b>Impact</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful in defeating Drake for the championship after an interference from a returning Alberto El Patrón.|$|E
5|$|In Belize, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the entire country at 0000UTC on October12. It was discontinued about nine hours later. The Government of Belize suspended school classes, as the buildings were being used as storm shelters. Voluntary evacuations were recommended for residents of the coastal cayes. A small craft warning was declared along the coast and advised marines to take precautions. At Punta Negra, the National Guard of Belize evacuated residents on October13. However, no <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> reported in Belize.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch {{due to the}} large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend. As such, {{there was a significant}} drop in tourism, although no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks. High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, but there were no deaths, injuries, or damage from Ella. By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> reported on Canada.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{preparations}} were taken along threatened areas of coastal Florida (mainly the Tampa Bay Area), including the evacuation of thousands of residents. Damage was extensive in Cuba, and five people were killed there. The cyclone's effects in the United States were minor to moderate, and the most significant <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> to citrus crops. No deaths occurred in the country, although high tides caused some flooding of low-lying terrain. The cyclone's structure was extensively observed and investigated.|$|E
5|$|In late September, three {{tropical}} disturbances moved westward {{across the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. One of them organized into a tropical depression on September28. The {{next day the}} depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Monica. The tropical storm initially headed west-northwestward and gradually curved towards the north. It reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on September29. Monica then gradually weakened. It became a tropical depression on October1. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. No <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> reported in association with Tropical Storm Monica.|$|E

As a NATO ally with an air base in Iceland, the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns, rockets and depth charges.|$|E
