They are used as intermediate carrier and wiring device for IC components like logics, memories and sensors.

High density copper filled TSVs with high aspect ratio as well as high density multi layer wiring using <b>electro</b> <b>plated</b> copper as conductive material and low loss dielectrics enable high performance signal transmission at interposer level without serious losses by parasitic effects.

The Works expanded quickly during the 1880s and 1890s with the addition of more grinding wheels and forges, the steam power plant was also enlarged to drive this extra machinery. By 1888 the Atkinson Brothers had taken over the works as manufacturers of steel, cutlery, files and <b>electro</b> <b>plate</b> products. The Atkinsons had considerable success as a company using the trade mark “In Mind”. They exhibited at the 1894 Antwerp World's fair, becoming a registered company on the stock exchange in 1897. Atkinson Brothers were resident at the Beehive Works well into the 20th century. Later the works were taken over by the cutlery manufacturers Gregory Fenton Ltd, a company established in 1968 by the amalgamation of the Gregory Brothers and Joseph Fenton firms. Gregory Fenton Ltd are still resident at the Beehive Works although in a much reduced capacity, their name is still displayed extensively on the frontage of the building (see photograph). Today the works have been divided up into small offices, workshops and storage areas which are rented out.

This reputation helped Gilliéron acquire a position assisting with fresco reconstructions at the excavation at Tiryns from 1910-1912. Gilliéron also became the chief restorer for Arthur Evans at the Palace of Minos at Knossos on Crete. For over three decades, Gilliéron worked with his son, and predecessor, also named Émile, creating reproductions of frescoes and other artifacts for Arthur Evans. The Gilliérons can be recognized as contributing many illustrations to Evan's four-volume book, The Palace of Minos at Knossos. Some of the most famous reconstructions by the Gilliérons include the Priest King fresco, the Ladies in Blue fresco, and the painting of the throne room at the Palace of Minos. Émile Gilliéron and his son formed a family business known as E. Gillieron & Son where they sold original commissioned watercolors and other reproductions made directly from originals on Skoufa Street in Athens. The Gilliérons created replicas of metal artifacts based on molds of the original masks, weapons, and vessels. They also created full-scale copies of Minoan frescoes on watercolor paper and created three-dimensional reconstructions in plaster form. By 1911 the Gilliérons had a catalog of Mycenaean antiquities consisting of over 144 pieces that could be manufactured in Germany by the Wurtemburg <b>Electro</b> <b>Plate</b> Company. The Gilliérons reworked molds taken from original antiquities to recreate an object in its undamaged form. The Gilliérons created two reconstructions of the well-known “Mask of Agamemnon” from Shaft Grave V in Grave Circle A at Mycenae, one which represented how the mask looked when it was found, and one restored to look like the believed original appearance.|$|R
40|$|Biosorption {{treatment}} is a promising technique {{for the removal}} of heavy metals from the industrial waste water. When the pollutant concentration in the waste water is at trace levels, it cannot be easily removed by using the traditional techniques. In such situations biosorption gives a helping hand in removing trace level pollutants. Heavy metals bind to the cell wall of the specific micro organisms which contain metal binding protein in their cell wall. By conducting the experiments on biosorption techniques the ability of the E-Coli can very well be estimated. In this project work E-Coli organism was isolated from domestic sewage. The synthetic cadmium and zinc solutions were prepared for concentration of 40 ppm, 50 ppm, 60 ppm, 70 ppm, 80 ppm, 90 ppm and 100 ppm for the standardization of Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer.

Microcapillary measurements were used to determine the influence of ion dose and species-implanted by IPDS-on the electrochemical behavior of the sample. The measurements show that an optimum implantation dose exists for every ion species; for higher doses amorphization occurs, leading to inhibition of the selective deposition process. Electrochemical selectivity is determined by the amount of damage created and not by the number of implanted ions; heavy ions (such as Xe+) are therefore preferable, as lower doses are needed, leading to shorter exposure times...|$|E

As we descend in the scale from birds and mammals to lizards, amphibia (frogs and toads) and fish, we find cartilage continually more important, and the bony constituent of the skeleton correspondingly less so. In such a type as the dog-fish, the skeleton is entirely cartilaginous, bone only occurs {{in connection with the}} animal's scales; it must have been in connection with scales that bone first appeared in the vertebrate sub-kingdom. In the frog we have a cartilaginous skeleton overlaid by numerous bony scutes (shield-like plates) which, when the student comes to study that type, he will perceive are equivalent to the bony parts of such scales as occur in the dog-fish, sunk inward, and plating over the cartilage; and in the frog the cartilage also is itself, in a few places, replaced by bony tissue. In the adult rabbit these two kinds of bone, the bone overlying what was originally cartilage (membrane bone), and the bone replacing the cartilage (cartilage bone) have, between them, practically superseded the cartilage altogether. The structure of the most characteristic kind of bone will be understood by reference to Figure XVI. It is a simplified diagram of the transverse section of such a bone as the thigh bone. M.C. is the central marrow cavity, H.v., H.v. are cross sections of small bloodvessels, the Haversian vessels running more or less longitudinally through, the bone in canals, the Haversian canals. Arranged round these vessels are circles of the formative elements, the bone corpuscles or osteoblasts (b.c.) each embedded in bony matrix in a little bed, the lacuna, and communicating one with another by fine processes through canaliculi in the matrix, which processes are only to be seen clearly in decalcified bone (See Section 70). The osteoblasts are arranged in concentric series, and the matrix is therefore in concentric layers, or lamellae (c.l.). Without and within the zone of Haversian systems are (o.l. and i.l.), the outer and inner lamellae. The bone is surrounded by connective tissue, the periosteum.

In the literature, a variety of replica techniques for these purposes is described (Grundy in 1971 [12]; Saxton in 1973 [25]). The use of these techniques is limited because of artifacts in the samples, and a restricted resolution power resulting from useful magnifications in the order of 800 x.

In this context we introduce the polyimide material HD 3007 which is suitable for temporary bonding of silicon wafers to carrier wafers by using a thermo compression process. Coating and bonding processes for 200 mm and 150 mm wafers with and without topography as well as two de-bonding concepts which are based on laser assisted and solvent assisted release processes are presented. Based on tests with temporary bonded 200 mm wafers, we found a very high compatibility of the bonded compound wafers with standard WLP process equipment and work flows suitable for backside processing of "via first" TSV wafers. Processes like silicon back grinding to a remaining thickness of 60 mu m, dry etching, wet etching, CMP, PVD, spin coating of resists and polymers, lithography, <b>electro</b> <b>plating</b> and polymer curing were evaluated and are described in detail.

All processes were performed at 200 mm wafer level. For interposer fabrication a standard process flow including silicon blind hole etching, isolation, copper filling, wafer front side redistribution, support wafer bonding, wafer thinning, and TSV backside reveal was applied. As interposer backside metallization, appropriate I/O terminals and seal ring structures were deposited by semi-additive Au and Au+Sn <b>electro</b> <b>plating.</b> Following, getter material was deposited onto the interposer wafers which were 90 m thick and still mounted onto carrier wafers. Subsequently, the I/O terminal pads of the interposer were stud bumped and finally more than 5000 quartz resonator components were assembled onto each interposer wafer by Au-Au direct metal bonding. The cap wafer was equipped with 200 m deep dry etched cavities and electro plated Au seal rings around them. Finally, both cap and interposer wafers were bonded together using a wafer to wafer bonder and an adapted AuSn soldering process scheme.

Thus no transmitting media like oil is needed. The SOI sensor chip consists of a beam with an integrated center-boss which was realized using KOH structuring and DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching/Bosch Process). The SOI technology has the distinct advantage that the piezo-resistors are not isolated by a pn junction from the dielectric substrate but by a buried oxide layer. In combination with a high temperature metallization, the SOI-chip is able to withstand the demands of high temperatures. The high temperature metallization consists of a sputtered Ti/TiWN layer that has been exposed to special RTA (rapid thermal annealing) process. Afterwards a TiWN and an Au layer are sputtered followed by an Au <b>electro</b> <b>plating</b> process. The chip has four piezoresistors that are arranged in pairs of longitudinal and transversal resistors which are compressed when pressure is applied. The four resistors are connected via conductors to a Wheatstone bridge. The sensor chip has a beam thickness of 25 μm and the center-boss has an area of lmm × lmm. The beam has a natural frequency of approx. 20 kHz. The sensor chip is mounted using Flip Chip technology to avoid a wire bond technology. It is mounted on a glass feed through on which stud bumps are located and conducted using thermo-compression process. The pressure range is set by varying the steel membrane thickness.

Anodization is a common technique used to protect the aluminium (Al) from corrosion by creating a thin oxide film on the Al surface. The solar selectivity of the solar absorber materials can be optimized by varying the metal and ceramic constituent elements, thickness, concentration, shape, size, and orientation [1]. Several metal pigments {{can be used to}} deposit into the pores of the film as a solar selective absorber. The thickness of Al 2 O 3 based cermet coatings was considered in previous reports [3, 4, 5], which correlated with spectral selective properties. In addition, variation of the content of pigment or composite coating on the surface has an influence on the spectral selectivity (αsol and εtherm) of the solar selective absorbers [2, 3]. To improve the spectral selectivity of the solar selective absorber and high corrosion resistance, several pigments deposited in the Al 2 O 3 film have been studied with different techniques, e.g. coatings of black Cu–Ni, black Ni–Co by electro-deposition [6, 7], Co–Al 2 O 3 by anodization [8], Cu–CuAl 2 O 4 hybrids deposited in anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) by electrochemical processes [9], carbon nano-particles embedded in SiO 2, ZnO and NiO matrices by a sol–gel technique [10], W–Al 2 O 3 cermet, Mo–Al 2 O 3, Pt–Al 2 O 3, Ag–Al 2 O 3 nanocermet, and CrNxOy/SiO 2 coated with a sputtering technique [11, 12, 13, 14]. Tin (Sn) has been considered a good candidate pigment embedded into the pores of Al 2 O 3 film on Al substrate which has been successfully prepared by the anodization process as Sn–Al 2 O 3 [15, 16]. The corrosion resistance of Sn–Al 2 O 3 is higher than that of the Ni–Al 2 O 3 [16]. Presently, there are a few prior researches on the influence of Sn content on phase, morphology, thermal conductivity, and solar selectivity of Al 2 O 3 -based cermet coatings.|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquids {{and deep}} {{eutectic}} solvents have gained {{a lot of}} interest as solvents in a broad range of different applications. Among the most studied is the (electro) deposition of metals and their alloys. While the main interest in the literature goes to the electrodeposition process itself and its possibilities, this work focuses on the main problems that can be expected when using ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents on a large scale as "green" solvents for the (electro) deposition of metals. Four topics were selected, exemplifying the problems associated with scaling-up of the applications under study. These topics are the production of ionic liquids on a large scale, the bath maintenance through controlling the metal content and the anode reactions, the intrinsic process safety and the recycling of the solvent from rinse water. A key property of the solvent to be selected for (<b>electro)</b> <b>plating</b> is its cost. Currently most ionic liquids are not available on a large scale or still rather expensive. Furthermore, in electroplating the impurity level influences the deposition properties to a large extent. Both of these problems were the driving force to investigate electrodialysis as an alternative ion-exchange process. Electrodialysis offers advantages over other production processes, such as its high yield and its good electrochemical efficiency. The main advantage, however, is the ease of operation and the ability to prepare many combinations of anion and cation in a rather good quality. The longevity of the process bath was investigated through the maintenance of the metal content and the reactions at the electrodes. An existing immersion silver solution for printed circuit boards was used to evaluate the possibility of maintaining the metal content in the deep eutectic solvent. Electrochemical regeneration and regeneration with ion-exchange resins were studied as possible regeneration techniques. The use of ion-exchange resins proved to yield the best results. Both at the cathode and the anode, decomposition of the deep eutectic solvent was observed during electrodeposition. At the cathode the decomposition is small as the main process is the electrodeposition of the metal. At the anode the use of soluble anodes offered the best alternative to prevent decomposition. However, soluble anodes are not always applicable or available. In those cases the addition of sacrificial products was investigated. Unfortunately decomposition of the solvent could not be completely eliminated. The overall process safety was investigated for a deep eutectic solvent based on choline chloride and ethylene glycol. As this solvent is neither harmful, nor (eco) toxic and readily biodegradable, drag-out was determined as the main parameter for the environmental impact of the process. Drag-out is higher compared to aqueous process solutions due to the higher viscosity of the liquids. Classical best available technologies such as ion-exchange can still be applied to remove metals from the rinse water. Recycling of the deep eutectic solvent from the waste water was investigated with membrane technologies. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis failed for the solvent under study. Furthermore, these pressure driven membrane technologies are limited by the osmotic pressure of the solutions. The deep eutectic solvent could neither be recycled using pervaporation due to the presence of a small uncharged organic molecule. However, for genuine ionic liquids, the use of pervaporation can be applied to remove small amounts of water {{at the end of the}} purification. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  status: publishe...|$|E
