25|$|Traditionally, the NFL {{does not}} award Super Bowls to stadiums that {{are located in}} climates with an {{expected}} average daily temperature less than 50°F (10°C) on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof.

Only MetLife Stadium did not have a roof (be <b>it</b> <b>fixed</b> or retractable) but it was still picked as the host stadium for Super Bowl XLVIII in an apparent waiver of the warm-climate rule.
