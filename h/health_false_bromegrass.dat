40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of statutory health assessments in identifying existing mental health disorders in pre-school foster children. It was examined whether a foster carer completed screening instrument could enhance accuracy. A representative sample of 43 pre-schoolers under the care of one inner-city local authority underwent comprehensive multidimensional mental health assessments as the reference standard. Statutory <b>health</b> assessments gave <b>false</b> negative results for 65 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 44 - 82 %) of children diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder according to the reference standard and 18 % (95 % CI 3 - 52 %) of children with developmental delay. The Ages & Stages Questionnaire completed by the foster carers failed to identify 65 % (95 % CI 44 - 82 %) of the children with diagnosed mental health disorders. There was no evidence of selective underreporting by foster carers in relation to specific diagnostic categories. In conclusion, statutory health assessments in their current form may fail to identify the majority of pre-school foster children with mental health disorders.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the reliability of}} the diagnosis of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), and the variation between and within microscopists, from urethral smears at a large London genitourinary medicine clinic. METHODS: A senior microscopist (SM) preselected 60 Gram stained urethral smear slides, 20 negative (20 p/hpf). Ten experienced microscopists, blinded to these initial grades, examined all slides giving each a polymorph score. After relabelling and randomly changing their order, the slides were re-examined by the same microscopists. Finally, the SM determined whether the study had resulted in loss of cells from any of the slides. The SM's initial grading and the consensus among microscopists provide two gold standards for analysis. RESULTS: Nine low grade and five high grade slides were removed from analysis because of loss of cells. By SM standard, considering microscopists' readings as simply non-NGU (or= 5 p/hpf), 97 % from negative slides were correct (variation 93 - 100 across microscopists), 68 % from low grade slides (45 - 95), and 94 % from high grade slides (83 - 100). Consistency between repeat readings by the same microscopist was 96 % for negatives, 75 % for low grade and 89 % for high grade slides. Results were similar by consensus standard. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable variation between and within microscopists in the diagnosis of NGU. Sensitivity was strongly related to grade of urethritis, with an appreciable proportion of low grade urethritis falsely diagnosed as negative. With increasing attendances for sexual <b>health</b> screening, a <b>false</b> positive rate of only 3 % may lead to many false diagnoses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There is no {{consensus}} in the literature regarding the impact of false positive newborn screening results on early health care utilization patterns. We evaluated the impact of false positive newborn screening results for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) in a cohort of Ontario infants. Methods The cohort included all children who received newborn screening in Ontario between April 1, 2006 and March 31, 2010. Newborn screening and diagnostic confirmation results were linked to province-wide health care administrative datasets covering physician visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospitalizations, to determine health service utilization from April 1, 2006 through March 31, 2012. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were used to compare those with false positive results for MCADD to those with negative newborn screening results, stratified by age at service use. Results We identified 43 infants with a false positive newborn screening result for MCADD during the study period. These infants experienced significantly higher rates of physician visits (IRR: 1. 42) and hospitalizations (IRR: 2. 32) {{in the first year}} of life relative to a screen negative cohort in adjusted analyses. Differences in health services use were not observed after the first year of life. Conclusions The higher use of some <b>health</b> services among <b>false</b> positive infants during the first year of life may be explained by a psychosocial impact of false positive results on parental perceptions of infant health, and/or by differences in underlying health status. Understanding the impact of false positive newborn screening results can help to inform newborn screening programs in designing support and education for families. This is particularly important as additional disorders are added to expanded screening panels, yielding important clinical benefits for affected children but also a higher frequency of false positive findings...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesFalse {{child sexual}} abuse {{allegations}} in divorce and custody proceedings are a disconcerting problem in South Africa having devastating effects on the family unit going through a divorce, and on society as a whole. Limited {{research has been done}} in South Africa on the subject matter (Janse Van Rensburg, 2008; McDonald, 1998; Preller, 2014). This study utilize General System's Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Crisis Theory to explore the subject matter. An explorative qualitative approach with a constructivist epistemology was utilised. The participants in this study involved thirty key informants, who included social workers, psychologists, counsellors and other professionals who specialise in divorce, custody and sexual abuse matters. A further five falsely accused parents and five accusing parents formed part of the sample. The data collection method used was that of in-depth interviews and research assistants were trained and appointed to gather the information. Notes were taken and the interviews were recorded to enable the necessary data analysis. Content and thematic data analyses were used to analyse the data and obtain the necessary results. The research findings indicate that false {{child sexual abuse}} allegations have a detrimental effect on the accused parent and explain the agony, severe trauma and emotional distress the falsely accused parent go through. There are various factors contributing towards false child sexual abuse allegations and results show that the impact of such allegations is 11 detrimental to the family system, the child and the falsely accused parent and brings disequilibrium to the family system that is very difficult to restore post-divorce. The mental <b>health</b> perspective on <b>false</b> child sexual abuse paints a rather bleak picture of the legal and social system and on adequately addressing the social issues at hand. Results highlight that false allegations are a complicated phenomenon and not all professionals nor the courts have the necessary skills to deal adequately with these matters. Research recommends amendments to South African Policy and Legislation, changes to the South African court system, and capacity building of mental health professionals. As this research is a ground-breaking study in South Africa, as no scientific research has been published on the subject matter, this study should be used as a basis for future research studies...|$|R
40|$|Drs. Grossman and Goldstone 2 ̆ 7 s [1] {{commentary}} in Contraception {{discussed the}} prescribing requirements of mifepristone and lamented its slow uptake, comparing the United States (USA) with Australia. It suggested that Australia {{was ahead of}} the USA. We support and provide abortion services and legal research in Australia and use our local knowledge to correct this commentary. Sadly the hope that Australia is leading the USA in women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>health</b> care is <b>false.</b> The maps in Grossman and Goldstone 2 ̆ 7 s commentary imply full coverage in the Northern Territory with reference to ‘certified prescribers’ and ‘pharmacist dispensers’. This may be accurate in terms of numbers of professional certification {{at the time the}} maps were produced but it is not accurate in terms of access to mifepristone for early medical abortion. This is for two reasons: firstly, finding professionally qualified health care professionals to work in the Territory is difficult and those who do often stay for short periods of time. Commonly there are fewer than four doctors providing a surgical service. Secondly, current legislation is prohibitive so that mifepristone is not prescribed at all for first trimester abortion [2]. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines on mifepristone use for medical abortion recently removed the requirement that mifepristone be administered {{in the presence of the}} doctor. However, section 208 B of the Northern Territory Criminal Code provides a criminal offence of ‘procuring abortion’. A person is guilty of an offence if the person administers a drug to a woman or causes a drug to be taken by a woman. Explanatory notes in section 11 of the Medical Services Act (MSA) [3] state, it is lawful for a medical practitioner to give medical treatment with the intention of terminating a woman 2 ̆ 7 s pregnancy. However, ‘medical treatment’ is defined to include all forms of surgery. The MSA also specifically provides that the treatment is given in a hospital and other restrictive provisions relating to consent and the opinions for treatment be formed by a gynecologist/obstetrician, thus limiting service provision. In practice surgical termination of pregnancy only occurs in three hospitals located in Darwin and Alice Springs that are 1500 km apart. There is no provision of early medical abortion for suburban, rural or remote communities, whatever their local health provider may have by way of certification. On insurance advice doctors do not prescribe mifepristone for early medical abortion in general practices, remote area clinics or clinical settings such as outpatient or day surgery models. Women need to travel long distances to reach surgical abortion services. Similarly in the state of South Australia, criminal law provisions restrict abortion treatment to prescribed hospitals, only five of which have established medication abortion services. It follows that the Grossman and Goldstone suggestion that large parts of Australia have doctor prescribers and pharmacists widely available who supply mifepristone is misleading. The laws are impediments to best practice. Despite our correction, we join with Drs. Grossman and Goldstone in the disappointment that women 2 ̆ 7 s reproductive health rights are so poorly observed...|$|R
