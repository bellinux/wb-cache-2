The {{interactions}} between transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor (Tfr) as they occur during biosynthesis were {{studied in the}} human hepatoma cell line HepG 2, which synthesizes both. Early during biosynthesis the Tfr monomer is converted to a disulfidelinked Tfr dimer. The Tfr monomer {{is not able to}} bind Tf, but Tf binding is observed as soon as the covalent Tfr dimer is formed and can take place in the ER. The Tf-Tfr complex is transported through the <b>Golgi</b> <b>reticulum</b> and trans-Golgi reticulum (TGR) and is ultimately delivered to an acidic compartment, where Tf releases its Fe 3 ÷. We did not observe conversion of Tf to apoTf in the TGR, showing that the part of the TGR passed by secreted Tf has a pH higher than 5. 5...|$|E

40|$|Phagocytic {{processing}} of heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes by peritoneal macrophages resulted in degradation of these bacteria in phagolysosomal compartments and {{processing of}} bacterial antigens for presentation to T cells by class II MHC molecules. Within 20 min of uptake by macrophages, Listeria peptide antigens were expressed on surface class II MHC molecules, capable of stimulating Listeria- specific T cells. Within this period, degradation of labeled bacteria to acid-soluble {{low molecular weight}} catabolites also commenced. Immunoelectron microscopy {{was used to evaluate}} the compartments involved in this processing. Upon uptake of the bacteria, phagosomes containing Listeria fused rapidly with both lysosomes and endosomes. Class II MHC molecules were present in a tubulo-vesicular lysosome compartment, which appeared to fuse with phagosomes, {{as well as in the}} resulting phagolysosomes containing internalized Listeria; these compartments were all positive for Lamp 1 and cathepsin D and lacked 46 - kD mannose- 6 -phosphate receptors. In addition, class II MHC and Lamp 1 were co-localized in vesicles of the trans <b>Golgi</b> <b>reticulum,</b> where they were segregated from 46 -kD mannose- 6 -phosphate receptors. Vesicles containing both Listeria-derived components and class II MHC molecules were also observed; some of these may represent vesicles recycling from phagolysosomes, potentially bearing processed immunogenic peptides complexed with class II MHC. These results support a central role for lysosomes and phagolysosomes in the processing of bacterial antigens for presentation to T cells. Tubulo-vesicular lysosomes appear to represent an important convergence of endocytic, phagocytic and biosynthetic pathways, where antigens may be processed to allow binding to class II MHC molecules and recycling to the cell surface...|$|E

40|$|Microgemma hepaticus gen. n. sp. n. is {{described}} from the liver of juvenile mullet, Chelon labrosus. Development occurs within xenomas, of diameter 500 µm. These have microvillar surfaces, encircling bands of mitochondria and a reticulate nucleus with many nucleoli. Meronts are plasmodial, divide by plasmotomy and are enclosed within host membranes. Sporonts are {{free in the}} cytoplasm and divide by multiple exogenous budding. In sporogenesis the polar sac is formed from golgi vesicles, the manubrium form a dense golgi body and the coiled polar filament form a spiral cisterna linked with the perinuclear membrane system and <b>golgi</b> <b>reticulum.</b> This was also implicated {{in the formation of}} the endospore. The polaroplast developed from expanded sacs derived from the manubrium. Uninucleate spores (4. 2 x 2. 4 µm) possessed 7 - 9 filament coils and lamellar polaroplast. Foci of infection were associated with liver connective tissue, and histopathological effects limited to adjacent cell necrosis due to pressure atrophy in restricted sites. Host responses result in granuloma formation, with gradual resolution of the lesion. In vitro investigations into spore hatching and viability showed exsporulation was stimulated by oxidising agents and following pretreatment with media of low pH or high osmolarity. Inoculation of spores into RTG cell cultures resulted in observations of a freshly injected sporoplasm, and a plasmodial stage after 72 hours. The ultrastructure of extruded filaments, spore cases and cell penetration {{is described}}. Attempts at transmission of the parasite to mullet by stomach tube, feeding of crustacean spore carriers or intraperitoneal injection were unsuccessful and suggested that larval fishes may be the targets of infection. The possible transmission of the parasite in the marine environment is discussed. On the basis of structural and developmental features the genus Microgemma is placed in the family Unikaryonidae. The affiliation of the genus with other fish microsporidia is noted, and wider implications of life cycles and nuclear behaviour to taxonomy and evolution are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{translocation}} of {{a unique}} facilitative glucose transporter isoform (GLUT 4) from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane accounts for the large insulin-dependent increase in glucose transport observed in muscle and adipose tissue. The intracellular location of GLUT 4 in the basal state and the pathway by which it reaches the cell surface upon insulin stimulation are unclear. Here, we have examined the colocalization of GLUT 4 with the transferrin receptor, a protein which is known to recycle through the endosomal system. Using an anti-GLUT 4 monoclonal antibody we immunoisolated a vesicular fraction from an intracellular membrane fraction of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes that contained > 90 % of the immunoreactive GLUT 4 found in this fraction, but only 40 % of the transferrin receptor (TfR). These results suggest only a limited degree of colocalization of these proteins. Using a technique to cross-link and render insoluble ("ablate') intracellular compartments containing the TfR {{by means of a}} transferrin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Tf-HRP), we further examined the relationship between the endosomal recycling pathway and the intracellular compartment containing GLUT 4 in these cells. Incubation of non-stimulated cells with Tf-HRP for 3 h at 37 degrees C resulted in quantitative ablation of the intracellular TfR, GLUT 1 and mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor and a shift in the density of Rab 5 -positive membranes. In contrast, only 40 % of intracellular GLUT 4 was ablated under the same conditions. Ablation was specific for the endosomal system as there was no significant ablation of either TGN 38 or lgp 120, which are markers for the trans <b>Golgi</b> <b>reticulum</b> and lysosomes respectively. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that most of the ablated pools of GLUT 4 and TfR were found in the intracellular membrane fraction. The extent of ablation of GLUT 4 from the intracellular fraction was unchanged in cells which were insulin-stimulated prior to ablation, whereas GLUT 1 exhibited increased ablation in insulin-stimulated cells. Pretreatment of adipocytes with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of Type-I and -IIa phosphatases, increased GLUT 4 ablation in the presence of insulin, consistent with okadaic acid increasing the internalization of GLUT 4 from the plasma membrane under these conditions. Using a combination of subcellular fractionation, vesicle immunoadsorption and compartment ablation using the Tf-HRP conjugate {{we have been able to}} resolve overlapping but distinct intracellular distributions of the TfR and GLUT 4 in adipocytes. At least three separate compartments were identified: TfR-positive/GLUT 4 -negative. TfR-negative/GLUT 4 -positive, and TfR-positive/GLUT 4 -positive, as defined by the relative abundance of these two markers. We propose that the TfR-negative/GLUT 4 -positive compartment, which contains approximately 60 % of the intracellular GLUT 4, represents a specialized intracellular compartment that is withdrawn from the endosomal system. The biosynthesis and characteristics of this compartment may be fundamental to the unique insulin regulation of GLUT 4...|$|E
