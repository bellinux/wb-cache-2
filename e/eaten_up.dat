5|$|Judy Garland's {{four-year}} {{contract for}} the series called for 26 weekly shows, for which Garland's corporation, Kingsrow Enterprises, would be paid $140,000 per episode. Of that Garland was guaranteed between $25,000 and $30,000 per show. Kingsrow Enterprises would also retain ownership of the tapes, allowing Garland to sell the series into syndication. Although Garland had said as early as 1955 {{that she would never}} do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation. Garland was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the IRS, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the commercial disappointment of the film A Star is Born meant that her share of any profits from that film would be <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> immediately. A successful run on television would secure Garland's financial future.|$|E
25|$|Canol: When Japan {{captured}} {{a pair of}} Aleutian Islands, Americans became concerned {{about the safety of}} their oil tanker routes to Alaska and began looking for an inland oil supply safe from attack. They negotiated with Canada to build a refinery at Whitehorse in the Yukon, with crude oil to come by pipeline from Norman Wells. If tank trucks had tried to haul the oil to Alaska, they would have <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> most of their own load over the vast distance.|$|E
25|$|The {{trackbed}} to {{the east}} of Station Road in East Grinstead to the Lewes Road tunnel was taken over by the A22 road as a relief road, with the two tunnels being opened out. The station's goods yard area was also <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> by the A22 which carved a path running parallel with Railway Approach. This required the removal of the locomotive shed which was demolished in 1976 despite the efforts of the East Grinstead Society which had attempted to raise funds for its preservation as a drama and arts workshop.|$|E

25|$|Corman {{financed the}} picture, {{serving as the}} film's uncredited Executive Producer. The budget was $75,000. Shooting began on April 15, 1965, with a {{production}} crew consisting of only seven individuals. During {{the first two days}} of the production, actual shooting was extremely limited due to near-constant rain which caused severe flooding in the areas they had planned to shoot. Hellman estimated that $5,000 of the already small budget was <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> by the wasted time. Another $10,000 of the budget was for the horse wranglers' salaries, the only union element of the film, apart from the actors. Corman's deal with Hellman and Nicholson was that if the film went over budget, any additional costs would come out of their own pockets. Despite the initial problems, the film was completed for the original budget estimate.|$|E
25|$|Airborne Interception radar (AI) was unreliable. The heavy {{fighting}} in the Battle of Britain had <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> most of Fighter Command's resources, so there was little investment in night fighting. Bombers were flown with airborne search lights out of desperation but to little avail. Of greater potential was the GL (Gunlaying) radar and searchlights with fighter direction from RAF fighter control rooms to begin a GCI system (Ground Control-led Interception) under Group-level control (No. 10 Group RAF, No. 11 Group RAF and No. 12 Group RAF). Whitehall's disquiet at {{the failures of the}} RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61 percent of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1 percent. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it.|$|E
500|$|Animals {{are shown}} {{punishing}} humans, subjecting them to nightmarish torments that may symbolise the seven deadly sins, matching the torment to the sin. Sitting on {{an object that}} may be a toilet or a throne, the panel's centerpiece is a gigantic bird-headed monster feasting on human corpses, which he excretes through a cavity below him, into the transparent chamber pot on which he sits. The monster is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Prince of Hell", a name derived from the cauldron he wears on his head, perhaps representing a debased crown. To his feet a female has her face reflected on the buttocks of a demon. Further to the left, next to a hare-headed demon, a group of naked persons around a toppled gambling table are being massacred with swords and knives. Other brutal violence is shown by a knight torn down and <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> by a pack of wolves {{to the right of the}} tree-man.|$|E

500|$|In 2006 (2007 in North America), Murphy {{starred in}} Ken Loach's {{film about the}} Irish War of Independence and Civil War, The Wind That Shakes the Barley, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and became the most {{successful}} Irish independent film at the Irish box office. Murphy was especially keen on appearing in the film due to his intimate connections to Cork, where it was shot. Murphy had to audition six times {{for the role of}} Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphy considered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was [...] "tremendously proud" [...] of the film, remarking that the [...] "memories run very, very deep– the politics, the divisions and everybody has stories of family members who were caught up in the struggle". Critic Denby noted Murphy's moments of deep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training." [...] GQ UK presented Murphy with their 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in The Wind That Shakes the Barley.|$|E
500|$|To placate anxious fans, Broussard {{decided to}} create another trailer for E3 2001—it was the first public look at the game in three years. The video showed {{a couple of minutes}} of in-game footage, which notably showed the player moving in what appears to be Las Vegas and a certain level of {{interactivity}} (the player buys a sandwich from a vending machine and pushes each individual button on a keypad with Duke's outstretched finger). The trailer was impressive, and Duke Nukem was the talk of the convention; IGN reported on the game's graphics, saying, [...] "Characters come to life with picturesque facial animations that are synced perfectly with speech, hair that swings as they bob their heads, eyes that follow gazes, and more. The particle effects system, meanwhile, boasts impressive explosion effects with shimmering fire, shattered glass, and blood spilt in every direction [...] Add in real-time lighting effects, interactive environments, and a variation in locales unequaled in any other first-person shooter and you begin to see and understand why Duke Nukem Forever {{has been one of the}} most hotly anticipated titles over the last couple of years." [...] Duke Nukem Forever looked as good or better than most games, and staff at 3D Realms recalled a sense of elation after the presentation; [...] "The video was just being <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> by people," [...] one said. [...] "We were so far ahead of other people at the time." [...] While many of the staff expected Broussard to make a push for finishing the game, however, he still did not have a finished product in mind. Following the death of one of Gathering of Developers' co-founders and continuing financial problems, the publishers' Texas-based offices were shut down and absorbed into parent company Take-Two Interactive.|$|E

2500|$|Political Model: There are {{two main}} {{components}} to the Political Model. In the first case, there is the external [...] "Pull" [...] factor. The Pull factor suggests that the weak political bodies of Britain and Western Europe made for an attractive target for Viking raiders. The reasons for these weaknesses vary, but generally can be simplified into decentralized polities, or religious sites. As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. In the second case, there is the internal [...] "Push" [...] factor. The Push factor coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization {{of power in the}} modern day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{portions}} of the increases in Russia's military procurement budget are being <b>eaten</b> <b>up</b> by inflation: while the country's overall inflation rate in 2008 was 13%, in certain weapon categories the figure was more than 30%. Many skilled workers are nearing retirement age, and young graduates are hesitant to enter the industry due to low wages and insufficient career opportunities. In 2009, a senior official said that the Russian military industry had effectively [...] "reached its ceiling" [...] and could not take on any more orders. Further growth will require a serious upgrade of production facilities, as well as investment in skills and training. Yury Solomonov, chief designer of the Topol-M and Bulava ICBMs, has said that Russia is 10–15 years ahead of its rivals {{in the development of}} strategic nuclear weapons, but 30 years behind in the development of conventional arms. After collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's nuclear shipbuilding industry has been transformed into something much smaller. Key enterprises on the Black Sea coast appeared to be on the territory of now-independent Ukraine - which proclaimed non-nuclear status. Admittedly, these enterprises {{had little to do with}} nuclear propulsion technology, except for some ambitions in the late 1980s when the Soviet navy planned the construction of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Russian defence industry proved unequal to the challenge of manufacturing battleships and other BMP-3, BMD heavy combatants T-90 tanks, artillery, missiles, space technology, nuclear technology even lack of funds from state.|$|E
