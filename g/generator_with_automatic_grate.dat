The latter allows for fast polarization tracking.A polarization controller {{can have the}} task of transforming a fixed, known polarization into an arbitrary one. Since polarization states are defined by two degrees of freedom, for example azimuth angle and ellipticity angle of the polarization state, such a polarization controller needs two degrees of freedom. The same holds for the task of transforming an arbitrary polarization into a fixed, known one.|$|R

40|$|Frequency {{regulation}} {{is essential for}} the stability of a power grid with high load fluctuation and integration of new energies. Constrained by the large ramping, a generator alone is not capable of conducting load frequency controls effectively and economically. In this paper, an energy storage system (ESS) is introduced to coordinate <b>with</b> <b>generators</b> in <b>automatic</b> generation control (AGC), where ESS and the <b>generator</b> respectively deal <b>with</b> high-frequency load fluctuation and low-portion. We develop a system configuration framework for such a hybrid system, including the operation strategy and capacity optimization. Due to the complexity of the hybrid system, the operation process is captured by a simulation model which considers practical constraints as well as remaining energy management of ESS. Taking advantage of the gradient-based approximation algorithm, we are then able to optimize the capacity of a hybrid system. According to the numerical experiments with real historical AGC data, the hybrid system is shown to perform well in cost reduction and to achieve the regulation tasks...|$|R

This system would be a dramatic improvement from the current, fixed and manually adjusted diffraction gratings in use, increasing the capability of observatories to conduct autonomous studies of binary systems.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare five different generator systems for wind turbines, namely the doubly-fed induction <b>generator</b> <b>with</b> three-stage gearbox (DFIG 3 G), the direct-drive synchronous <b>generator</b> <b>with</b> electrical excitation (DDSG), the direct-drive permanent-megnet generator (DDPMG), the permanent-magnet <b>generator</b> <b>with</b> single stage gearbox (PMG 1 G), and the doubly-fed induction <b>generator</b> <b>with</b> single-stage gearbox (DFIG 1 G). The comparison is based on cost and annual energy yield for a given wind climate. The DFIG 3 G is a cheap solution using standard components. The DFIG 1 G seems the most attractive in terms of energy yield divided by cost. The DDPMG has the highest energy yield, but although it is cheaper than the DDSG, it is more expensive than the <b>generator</b> systems <b>with</b> gearbox...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, modern {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} electrical and electronic systems that implement highly complex functions such as anti-lock braking or cruise control. The use of such embedded systems in the automotive domain requires a revised development process that addresses their particular features. In this context, architectural models have been introduced in system development as convenient abstractions of the system’s structure represented as interacting components. To enjoy the full benefits of such abstractions, the architectural models should be complemented by an analysis framework that provides means for formal verification, and ideally also model-based testing, tailored to complex automotive systems. One major difficulty in developing such a framework {{lies in the fact}} that architectural models represent the system’s structure as well as inter-component communication, often without the actual description of the behavior. This entails the need to integrate the two “views” (structural and behavioral) in order to integrate them in a formal framework for verification. In this thesis, we propose an integrated formal modeling and analysis methodology for automotive embedded systems that are originally described in the domain-specific architectural language EAST-ADL. Our analysis methodology relies on formal veri- fication of the original EAST-ADL model by model-checking with UPPAAL PORT for component-based analysis, and UPPAAL SMC for statistical model-checking. To enable this, we first propose a formal description of the EAST-ADL components as networks of timed automata (TA), which are UPPAAL’s modeling language. Since C code implementation is in fact what is deployed on the vehicle, it is highly desirable to narrow the gap between the code and the architectural model, but also to test the implementation for various requirements. To accomplish the former, we define an exe- cutable semantics of the UPPAAL PORT components. To be able to support testing of EAST-ADL based implementations, we take advantage of the model-checker’s ability to generate witness traces during verification of reachability properties. Consequently, we employ UPPAAL PORT to generate such traces that become our abstract test-cases. By pairing the automated model-based test-case <b>generator</b> <b>with</b> an <b>automatic</b> transformation from the abstract test-cases to Python scripts, we enable the execution of the generated  Python scripts (our concrete test cases) on the system under test. The entire formal analysis and model-based testing framework is one solution to analyzing EAST-ADL models by model-checking techniques We show the framework’s applicability on an automotive industrial prototype, namely a Brake-by-Wire system. ...|$|R
