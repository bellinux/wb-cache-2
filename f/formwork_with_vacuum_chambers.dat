This work {{presents}} the results of hydrogen diffusion study in macro- and nanocrystalline titanium using the method of combining an electrolytic cell <b>with</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> through the membrane. It has been stated that the formation of nanocrystalline structure, on the one hand, leads to the decrease in the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient and, on the other hand, to the increase in the capability to accumulate hydrogen.

For this purpose dispensing systems are equipped <b>with</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers.</b> To shorten cycle times there can be an airlock at the entrance and one at the exit.

30|$|Concerning droplet nucleation, the fluxes on the {{boundary}} <b>with</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> (solid–gas and liquid–gas interfaces) should be considered. There is an uncompensated arsenic flux from the substrate to the chamber, so arsenic evaporation {{can result in}} the appearance of additional nucleation centers. It is interesting to notice that the droplet densities were 4.3 × 107 and 3.75 × 107 cm- 2 for the deposition rates of 0.04 and 0.16 Ml/s, respectively, so the increase of the deposition rate and time from 12 to 50 s {{does not change the}} droplet density considerably.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{simulation}} {{study of the}} nonlinear interaction of a single bunch and accelerator <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> elements. We numerically solve the Fokker-Planck time-domain equation for the phase-space distribution function. Original implicit finite-difference scheme is used. The method is very stable and free of the "numerical" diffusion, distortion, or modulation. We introduce quasi-Green function to describe the wake field potentials of bunches of any shape. This allows to get high definition resolution of the bunch particle distribution. We present results and comparison for different kind of instabilities. The main effect, which determines {{the stability of the}} beam in a storage ring, is electromagnetic interaction of the beam particles <b>with</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> elements.

30|$|The {{substantial}} resistive {{value of}} distribution lines forces the transformers {{to make their}} contribution in voltage regulation. At primary substations, on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformer maneuvers the voltage downstream according to the sensor and relay commands. Unfortunately, the reverse current flow restricts its reliability. New generations of electronic switches in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> solutions [18], are under research with the premise of significant enhancement of consumer’s voltage profile. Reducing the voltage bandwidth at the distribution transformer, would allow higher PV penetration level with the risk of reaching under voltages in the feeders connected to the transformer. Furthermore, this action would increase the tap change operation frequency and hence, drive some customers to experience power supply difficulties. As a consequence, a second voltage control strategy is necessary.|$|R

Cal Poly’s Space Environments Lab is equipped <b>with</b> multiple <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers,</b> but no thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to incorporate an ATS Chiller system <b>with</b> the HVEC <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> so {{students are able to}} experiment <b>with</b> a thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> The ATS Chiller had leaky pipes that needed to be refurbished and a shroud was implemented to improve thermal capabilities of the system. The full system was able to reach temperatures as low as - 38 ºC and as high as 58 ºC at a pressure of 10 - 6 Torr. The ATS Chiller was able to absorb up to 500 W of heat dissipation from a component mounted to the platen inside of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> Thermal modeling of the apparatus was performed in Thermal Desktop. The model was incorporated with the test data to extract interface resistance information between connected surfaces. Another model is used to analyze a theoretical component inside the apparatus to evaluate mounting methods and determine theoretical temperatures of the component. The model adjusts for material properties, including thermal conductivity and emissivity to accurately simulate testing conditions within +/- 3 ºC. Platen and shroud adjustments were able to accommodate a peak bake out temperature of 130 ± 2. 2 ℃ of any component without damage to the system.

The pulsed measurement results are compared with modeled signal levels. We update the development of a continuous-wave CRDS system using the frequency-quadrupled output of an external cavity diode laser as the light source. Characterizations of the measurement sensitivity show that with integration times of several minutes, the current performance would allow high signal-to-noise erosion measurements for expected thruster conditions.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{particle}} colliders {{begins in the}} early 60 's when an idea previously patented by R. Wideroe in 1953 is constructed. The design of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> in their experimental area became essential {{as it was the}} rst physical barrier that the particles to be detected needed to traverse. The interaction of the products of the collisions <b>with</b> the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> structural materials, hindered the identification of the significative events. This Thesis analyses the historical evolution of the experimental <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers</b> and summarizes the technical criteria that are to be fulfilled. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) presently under construction at CERN is the last generation of particle colliders. Four big experiments will be in operation (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb) in the LHC with diferent physics objectives. In particular, LHCb will be devoted to the study of CP violation and the design of its <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> is the scope of this Thesis. Physics simulations with an initial design consisting of a conical aluminium <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> <b>with</b> stainless steel flanges and bellows expansion joints, foresaw redundancies in the experiment detection channels that would make it inefficient. The reduction of the radiation background generated after the interactions of the products of the proton collisions <b>with</b> the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> materials became essential. Berillium became the ideal candidate as structural material for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> due to its excellent mechanical properties and high transparency to radiation. Nonetheless, its toxicity, difficult machining and complicated weld hampers its use. TIG welding of beryllium to beryllium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications as per ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. On the other hand, beryllium high price led to consider beryllium-aluminium composites for the fabrication of the LHCb <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> The mechanical characterization of the berylliumaluminium HIP AlBeMet AM 162 at the required bakeout temperatures of 200 °C and 250 °C was completed. In turn, the electron beam welding of beryllium-aluminium to beryllium-aluminium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications following ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. Once characterized mechanically the materials and demonstrated the feasibility of the welding, nite element analysis were performed to design the vacuum chamber; as well as to design other special components integrated in it. The fabrication and thorough tests conducted with prototypes is described; in particular, an aluminium AA 6061 OD 860 mm window 2 mm thick that UHV seals one of the detectors, two bellows expansion joint aluminium fabricated in AA 2219 and two optimized aluminium AA 2219 UHV anges. The final design consisting of a TIG welded conical structure 12 m long fabricated in berillium with thickness ranging between 1 and 2. 4 mm, implementing the validated aluminium window, optimized flanges and bellows expansion joints, will allow a factor 5 reduction of the radiation background generated by the initial <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> allowing the study of the physics that the LHCb experiment is designed for...|$|R
