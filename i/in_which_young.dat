5|$|Manchester City {{finished}} the 1966–67 season in mid-table, and continued {{in a similar}} vein {{at the start of the}} 1967–68 season, failing to win in their first three matches. A tactical switch saw Young and Mike Summerbee moved inside, and Young scored two goals in City's first win of the season, 4–2 against Southampton. Four more wins followed immediately, including a 2–0 win against Newcastle United <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> scored a goal and missed a penalty. Young remained at inside-forward for the rest of the season. Following the arrival of striker Francis Lee and a long unbeaten run, Manchester City entered the New Year as potential title contenders. In mid-March, a 5–1 win against Fulham <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> scored two goals took Manchester City top of the table. The lead changed hands several times in the following six weeks, but as the teams entered the final round of fixtures, Manchester City travelled to Newcastle knowing a win would guarantee the championship. Young scored twice and had another disallowed as Manchester City won 4–3 to win the title, the first major honour of Young's career. Young also {{finished the}} season as the club's highest goalscorer with 20 goals.|$|E
5|$|Young's {{first full}} season {{was not a}} {{successful}} one for Manchester City; the team struggled to find form throughout. A four match unbeaten run in April, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> scored a winning goal against Bolton Wanderers, gave hope, but {{on the final day}} of the season Manchester City were relegated to the Second Division. For the following two seasons Young continued to be a regular first team player, though he missed the first two months of the 1964–65 season. Manchester City did not come close to promotion, and their 11th-place finish in 1965 was at that point the lowest in the club's history. Manager George Poyser departed in April 1965, and in July 1965 his replacement, Joe Mercer, joined the club, along with coach Malcolm Allison.|$|E
5|$|Nadanian {{was born}} on 19 September 1972 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, which then {{was part of the}} Soviet Union, to Sergei and Irina, both hairdressers. He was taught to play chess by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>young</b> players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he often went to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers. He remembers that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger {{who turned out to be}} the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E

25|$|During {{the ninth}} century BC, ritual flagellations were {{performed}} in Artemis Orthia, {{one of the}} most important religious areas of ancient Sparta, where the Cult of Orthia, a preolympic religion, was practiced. Here ritual flagellation called diamastigosis took place, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>young</b> adolescent men were whipped in a ceremony overseen by the priestess.

25|$|The years {{leading up}} to the February 26 Incident were marked by a series of outbursts of {{violence}} by the young officers and their fellow nationalists against their political opponents. Most notable was the May 15 Incident of 1932, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>young</b> naval officers assassinated Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. This incident is significant because it convinced the young army officers (who were aware of, but not involved in, the attack) of the need to utilize troops in any potential coup attempt. The ringleaders of the incident, as in the previous March and October incidents, received relatively light punishments.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the process}} of ecdysis is metabolically risky and expensive, it does have some advantages. For one thing it permits a complex {{development}} cycle of metamorphosis <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>young</b> animals may be totally different from older phases, such as the nauplius larvae of crustaceans, the nymphs of say, the Odonata, or the larvae of Endopterygota, such as maggots of flies. Such larval stages commonly have ecological and life cycle roles totally {{different from those of}} the mature animals. Secondly, often a major injury in one phase, such as the loss of a leg from an insect nymph, or a claw from a young crab, can be repaired after one or two stages of ecdysis. Similarly, delicate parts that need periodic replacement, such as the outer surfaces of the eye lenses of spiders, or the urticating hairs of caterpillars, can be shed, making way for new structures.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of a ritual that provides one {{with the ability to}} turn into a wolf. Such a transformation may be related either to lycanthropy itself, a widespread phenomenon, but attested especially in the Balkans-Carpathian region, or a ritual imitation of the behavior and appearance of the wolf. Such a ritual was presumably a military initiation, potentially reserved to a secret brotherhood of warriors (or Männerbünde). To become formidable warriors they would assimilate behavior of the wolf, wearing wolf skins during the ritual. Traces related to wolves as a cult or as totems were found in this area since the Neolithic period, including the Vinča culture artifacts: wolf statues and fairly rudimentary figurines representing dancers with a wolf mask. The items could indicate warrior initiation rites, or ceremonies <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>young</b> people put on their seasonal wolf masks. The element of unity of beliefs about werewolves and lycanthropy exists in the magical-religious experience of mystical solidarity with the wolf by whatever means used to obtain it. But all have one original myth, a primary event.|$|E
500|$|Emer O'Toole of The Guardian {{noted that}} [...] "we {{live in a}} society <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>young</b> women are taught to be ashamed of the changes that their bodies undergo at puberty – to be secretive about them, and even to pretend that they don't exist."

500|$|Private sector {{employers}} {{are reluctant to}} hire women because Chinese law requires that the employer cover maternity leave and childbirth costs.

The development of the sales industry has increased job opportunities for women, but women are also restricted to these gendered professions.|$|E

30|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} defect-free MoS 2 sheet obtained from our simulations with REBO potential is entirely contrary {{to the work of}} Zhao etal. [23] using the SW potential, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Young’s</b> modulus of perfect monolayer MoS 2 obviously decreases with increasing the ambient temperature from 4.2  K to 500  K. They obtained the maximum reduction of Young’s modulus more than 30  %. However, the {{temperature dependence}} of the defect-free MoS 2 with REBO potential in this paper is comparable to that of graphene [29], <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the maximum reduction of Young’s modulus is about 5  % when the system temperature increases from 300  K to 700  K. We believe that such result distinction is mainly derived from the adoption of different interatomic potentials and the processing procedure, as the co-worker of Zhao published another totally different result [30], <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Young’s</b> modulus of perfect MoS 2 is independent to the temperature range from 0 K to 300  K.|$|R
500|$|Young was {{promoted}} to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League in late July and went a perfect 3–0 with a 1.48 ERA in five starts.

He posted four quality starts, and in his fifth start he only allowed two runs. The club was 4–1 in his PCL starts. The only loss was due to a blown save with a 4–2 ninth-inning lead on August 7 against the Tacoma Rainiers in a game <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> allowed no earned runs. He was named Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Week for August 16 to 22 after his last start on August 18 against the Memphis Redbirds.

500|$|For the film's look, the Coens {{wanted to}} avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and {{for it to be}} [...] "consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif {{featured}} predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he [...] "came {{up with the idea of}} just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. [...] "Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a [...] "very Hollywood-looking party <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>young,</b> oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it." ...|$|E
