During this period, the {{financial crisis}} exposed local firms to large depreciations in exchange rates and reduced access to foreign capital. The authors explore the exchange rate hedging practices of firms that hedged exposure to foreign debt in eight East Asian countries between 1996 and 1998. They identify and characterize East Asian companies that used foreign currency <b>derivatives,</b> <b>documenting</b> differences in size, financial characteristics, and exposure to domestic and foreign debt. They investigate the factors improtant {{in the use of}} foreign currency derivatives. Unlike studies of US firms, they find limited support for existing theories of optimal hedging. Instead, they find that firms use foreign earnings as a substitute for hedging with derivatives. And they find evidence that firms engage in"selective"hedging. They investigate the relative performance of hedgers during and after the crisis. They find no evidence that East Asian firms eliminated their foreign exchange exposure by using derivatives. Firms that used derivatives before the crisis performed just as poorly as nonhedgers during the crisis. After the crisis, firms that hedged performed somewhat better than nonhedgers, but this result appears to be explained by a larger post-crisis currency exposure for hedgers (an exchange rate risk premium), which had limited access to derivatives during this period.

Our group has shown that bombesin derivatives modified with this di-tert-butylphenylsilane building block are rather very lipophilic and are cleared predominantly via the hepatobiliary pathway (Hohne et al. 2008). Previous studies with radiolabeled exendin- 4 <b>derivatives</b> have <b>documented</b> high kidney uptake, which potentially make the visualization of the pancreas difficult. We reasoned that by incorporating the rather highly lipophilic di-tert-butylphenylsilane building block in exendin- 4, we could significantly reduce the kidney uptake and thereby shift renal to hepatobiliary clearance.

The remaining six were found to produce three different TEM enzymes, each characterized by a pI value of 6. 0 and specified by new combinations of amino acid substitutions. The amino acid substitutions compared to the TEM- 1 β-lactamase sequence were Gly 238 Ser, Glu 240 Lys, and Thr 265 Met for TEM- 47; Leu 21 Phe, Gly 238 Ser, Glu 240 Lys, and Thr 265 Met for TEM- 48; and Leu 21 Phe, Gly 238 Ser, Glu 240 Lys, Thr 265 Met, and Ser 268 Gly for TEM- 49.

After the removal from the data set of short periods of temperature perturbation that relate to near-equator volcanic eruption, we use <b>derivatives</b> to <b>document</b> {{the presence of a}} 5 - to 7 -month delayed close relationship between SOI and GTTA. Change in SOI accounts for 72 % of the variance in GTTA for the 29 -year-long MSU record and 68 % of the variance in GTTA for the longer 50 -year RATPAC record. Because El Niño−Southern Oscillation is known to exercise a particularly strong influence in the tropics, we also compared the SOI with tropical temperature anomalies between 20 °S and 20 °N. The results showed that SOI accounted for 81 % of the variance in tropospheric temperature anomalies in the tropics. Overall the results suggest that the Southern Oscillation exercises a consistently dominant influence on mean global temperature, with a maximum effect in the tropics, except for periods when equatorial volcanism causes ad hoc cooling. That mean global tropospheric temperature has for the last 50 years fallen and risen in close accord with the SOI of 5 – 7 months earlier shows the potential of natural forcing mechanisms to account for most of the temperature variation...|$|R

Three students with different initial profiles were chosen for full case study analysis. The following major findings emerged from this study: (1) There was a correspondence between students 2 ̆ 7 initial understandings of the three content strands and their understanding of the derivative: strong initial understanding in all three content strands supported a strong understanding of the derivative; while weak rate understanding impeded it. (2) Rate understanding appeared to play the largest role in determining how a student made sense of the derivative. (3) Speed and motion situations presented special obstacles to student understanding, confirming results of other studies both in mathematics education and physics education. (4) Some students regarded graphs as simple pictorial displays of individual data points, rather suggesting lack of understanding of covariation. (5) Strong initial content understanding provided a good foundation for developing a strong understanding of the derivative, but was not sufficient to support learning how to apply calculus; the ability to create and use symbolic representations was needed. (6) Algebraic manipulation skill and use of memorized formulas and procedures created the illusion (both for instructor and student) of learning. (7) Powerful representational ways of thinking about change enabled students to conceptualize variation and covariation, to define a function symbolically, to clearly distinguish a function from its rate of change, and to recognize and articulate pattern in rate of change.

This thesis is in three major parts. In the first (Chapter 2) the photochemical reactions of tetranitromethane with 1, 4, 6, 7 -tetramethylnaphthalene (56), 2, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene (57) and 1, 3 -dimethylnaphthalene (58) are described.

A number of hydroxy/trinitromethyl adducts (84), (98), (102) -(1 04), (114), (115) and nitro/trinitromethyl adducts (75), (94) -(97), (99) -(101), (110) -(113), (122) were isolated as part of this study. In the second part of this thesis (Chapter 3) the analogous reactions of 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene (137), 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetramethylbenzene (134), pentamethylbenzene (135) and hexamethylbenzene (136) are described. In the photolysis of 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene (137) with tetranitromethane a variety of nitronic esters (159) -(162) are formed in addition to "double" adducts (139), (157), (158) which arise by subsequent addition of nitrogen dioxide to initially formed hydroxy/trinitromethyl adducts (176), (177) and nitro/trinitromethyl adducts (152), (175), and the more usual "single" nitro/trinitromethyl adducts (151) -(156). In the reactions of 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetramethylbenzene (134), pentamethylbenzene (135) and hexamethylbenzene (136) evidence was obtained which pointed to increasing instability of initially formed adducts. In particular for pentamethylbenzene (135), nitro/trinitromethyl adducts (244), (245) were formed at - 20, - 50 and - 78 ° in dichloromethane but rearranged rapidly in solution. For hexamethylbenzene (136) direct evidence of the formation of nitro/trinitromethyl adducts could not be obtained because of the insolubility of the substrate, hexamethylbenzene (136), in the photolysis solvents. However rearrangement products (279) -(282), (287), (288), analogous to those from pentamethylbenzene (135), were obtained from the photolysis of hexamethylbenzene (136) with tetranitromethane.

40|$|Abstract. 1 -calcium phosphate-uracil (1 -CP-U), a {{synthetic}} pyrimidine <b>derivative,</b> has been <b>documented</b> {{to demonstrate a}} variety of different biological activities. However, the potency and mechanisms of this agent's anti-cancer activity have not been elucidated to date. In the present study, the anti-cancer effects of 1 -CP-U were examined in a range of in vitro assays. Different cell lines were treated with 1 -CP-U at varied concentrations (0. 7, 1. 0, 1. 4 µmol/l) for indicated durations. The cell proliferation was then examined by MTT assay. The cellular apoptotic effects were detected by Hoechst 33342 and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, while the capacity of 1 -CP-U on invasion and migration were examined by cell invasion and wound healing assays. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase proteins, as well as pro- and antiapoptotic proteins was detected by western blotting analysis. The results identified that 1 ‑CP‑U was able to inhibit the viability of SKOV 3, HeLa, SMMC- 7721 and A 549 cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while it exerted only marginal toxic effects on non-cancerous cells. The IC 50 concentration of 1 -CP-U for tumor cell lines was ~ 1. 0 µmol/l. The growth inhibition induced by 1 -CP-U was accompanied by a broad spectrum of pro-apoptotic activities, in which different cell lines varied in their sensitivity to 1 -CP-U. Meanwhile, the increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma- 2 (Bcl- 2) -associated X and a marked reduction of Bcl- 2 levels were associated with increased 1 -CP-U concentra-tions. Additionally, anti-migration and anti-invasion effects of 1 -CP-U were evidently associated with the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase proteins. Of note, it was observed that 1 ‑CP‑U significantly inhibited both the migration and invasion at a lower concentration, as compared with the dose required to achieve significant inhibition of apoptosis. These results indi-cated that 1 -CP-U appeared to be a more effective inhibitor of cell migration and invasion, rather than of apoptosis. In conclu-sion, the present study was the first, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, to demonstrate the function of 1 -CP-U in tumor proliferation, apoptosis and invasion with specific effects against cancer cells in vitro, suggesting 1 -CP-U as a potential novel anticancer agent...|$|R
40|$|Solid-state organic {{chemistry}} {{is a broad}} topic {{with a wide variety}} of materials applications. This dissertation focuses on two very different applications, and should be considered in two separate parts. Part One focuses on the use of organic compounds as electrode materials in lithium ion batteries (Chapters Two and Three) and Part Two focuses on the design of molecular rotors for their applications in molecular machines (Chapters Four and Five). Part One. The application of organic redox reactions in lithium ion batteries is a relatively unexplored topic. Though first examined in the early 1970 s, the field was quickly abandoned in favor of inorganic insertion compounds, which showed more desirable redox potentials and lower solubility in typical organic electrolyte solvents. As such, these metal oxides have dominated the field ever since. However, while these compounds show impressive performance, they are plagued with unavoidable environmental consequences of their continued use. Organic alternatives provide a useful platform to circumventing this, which has sparked a resurgence of interest in the last decade in addressing the two issues mentioned above. 	Chapter Two. The redox potentials demonstrated in organic redox reactions most often fall approximately halfway between those displayed by traditional cathode and anode materials—meaning that applying these to either would cut the cell voltage in half. However, as this is an effect of the electronics of the process, it follows that controlling the electronics would control this. Naphthalene diimides provide an ideal model to explore the effects of probing the electronics of the material based on their low solubility and redox capabilities. In this chapter, the synthesis and characterization of a family of naphthalene diimide <b>derivatives</b> is <b>documented,</b> along with the tunability of the electronics of the redox process based on substituent effects and the subsequent control that can be exhibited on the experimental discharge potentials. Chapter Three. The motivation for exploring the redox capabilities of organic compounds for electrodes to replace the inorganic insertion compounds that currently dominate the field is largely based on the environmental implications of the current materials. A recent discovery that a furan backbone can be accessed in highly sustainable methods provided an environmentally friendly synthesis of furan dicarbonyl derivatives such that their electrochemical activity could be characterized. Part Two. Analogous to their macroscopic counterparts, a machine on the molecular scale requires the cooperative movement of its parts. The Garcia-Garibay group has developed the design of the molecular gyroscope, which, like a macroscopic gyroscope, has both stationary and rotating parts. However, incorporation of this motion into the solid requires control not just with regard to molecular design, but, also with regard to crystal packing. In the context of the molecular gyroscope, this means that in order for the rotating component to rotate, sufficient free volume around it is required. Chapter Four. While the inability to predict crystal packing remains a major obstacle in the field of crystal engineering, it has been shown that the use of hexamethyl triptycene as the stator portion can allow for an optimal packing arrangement of the rotor molecules. However, closer inspection of the crystal structure revealed that the free volume discussed above, was actually filled by crystallographically defined solvent molecules. Despite this, the system demonstrated impressive rotational dynamics. Given the dynamics of this system in combination with analysis of the crystal structure demonstrated the presence of a correlated motion analogous to a macroscopic “gearing” system. This chapter documents synthetic advances that allow access to this system efficiently such that appreciable quantities of this rotor and a variety of its derivatives can be accessed in order to fully characterize their rotation dynamics. Preliminary data showing qualitative evidence of a correlated motion are presented, but studies are still ongoing. Chapter Five. Inspired by the work discussed in the previous chapter, it followed that while iptycene based stators would often lead to rotors with a tendency to interdigitate, peripheral substitution was a promising strategy to overcome this obstacle. Despite this, traditional strategies of synthesizing these compounds were considerably too long and low yielding to be practical for further study. With this in mind, this chapter documents the development of an efficient, high yielding method for late stage installation of peripheral substitution that can be applied not just to triptycenes, but also to pentiptycenes...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Currently L-DOPA is {{the drug}} most {{commonly}} used {{for the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the long-term use of L-DOPA is associated with the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Treatment mainly addresses the dopaminergic features of the disease and leaves its progressive course unaffected. An optimal treatment would be a combination of both motor and non-motor symptom relief with neuroprotective properties. Two drug targets have attracted the attention for PD treatment, namely monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) and adenosine A 2 A receptors. MAO-B inhibitors enhance the elevation of dopamine levels after L-DOPA treatment, improve motor functions and may also possess neuroprotective properties. The antagonistic interaction between A 2 A and dopamine receptors in the striatopallidal pathway, which modulates motor behaviour, has also become a potential strategy for PD treatment. Blockade of the A 2 A receptor exerts both anti-symptomatic and neuroprotective activities and offer benefit for motor symptoms and motor complications. This thesis seeks to synthesize novel drug treatments for PD by exploring both MAO-B inhibitors and adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists and to assess the prospects for drug modification to increase activity. MAO-B inhibitors - Based on a recent report that the phthalimide moiety may be a useful scaffold for the design of potent MAO-B inhibitors, the present study examines a series of 5 -sulfanylphthalimide analogues as potential inhibitors of both human MAO isoforms. The results document that 5 - sulfanylphthalimides are highly potent and selective MAO-B inhibitors with all of the examined compounds possessing IC 50 values in the nanomolar range. The most potent inhibitor, 5 - (benzylsulfanyl) phthalimide, exhibits an IC 50 value of 0. 0045 μM for the inhibition of MAO-B with a 427 –fold selectivity for MAO-B compared to MAO-A. We conclude that 5 -sulfanylphthalimides represent an interesting class of MAO-B inhibitors and may serve as lead compounds for the design of antiparkinsonian therapy. It has recently been reported that nitrile containing compounds frequently act as potent MAO-B inhibitors. In an attempt to identify additional potent and selective inhibitors of MAO-B and to contribute to the known structure-activity relationships of MAO inhibition by nitrile containing compounds, the present study examined the MAO inhibitory properties of series of novel sulfanylphthalonitriles and sulfanylbenzonitriles. The results document that the evaluated compounds are potent and selective MAO-B inhibitors with most homologues possessing IC 50 values in the nanomolar range. In general, the sulfanylphthalonitriles exhibited higher binding affinities for MAO-B than the corresponding sulfanylbenzonitrile homologues. Among the compounds evaluated, 4 -[(4 -bromobenzyl) sulfanyl]phthalonitrile is a particularly promising inhibitor since it displayed a high degree of selectivity (8720 -fold) for MAO-B over MAO-A, and potent MAO-B inhibition (IC 50 = 0. 025 μM). Based on these observations, this structure may serve as a lead for the development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonism - Most adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists belong to two different chemical classes, the xanthine derivatives and the amino-substituted heterocyclic compounds. In an attempt to discover high affinity A 2 A receptor antagonists for PD and to further explore the structure-activity relationships of A 2 A antagonism by the xanthine class of compounds, this study examines the A 2 A antagonistic properties of series of (E) - 8 -styrylxanthine, 8 -(phenoxymethyl) xanthine and 8 -(3 - phenylpropyl) xanthine <b>derivatives.</b> The results <b>document</b> that among these series, the (E) - 8 - styrylxanthines are the most potent antagonists with the most potent homologue, (E) - 1, 3 -dietyl- 7 -methyl- 8 -[(3 -trifluoromethyl) styryl]xanthine, exhibiting a Ki value of 11. 9 nM. This compound was also effective in reversing haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. The importance of substitution at C 8 with the styryl moiety was demonstrated by the finding that none of the 8 - (phenoxymethyl) xanthines and 8 -(3 -phenylpropyl) xanthines exhibited high binding affinities for the A 2 A receptor. It was also concluded that (E) - 8 -styrylxanthines are potent A 2 A antagonists with particularly the 1, 3 -dietyl- 7 -methylxanthine substitution pattern being most appropriate for high affinity binding. Conclusion - The results of these studies have established that all of the sulfanylphthalimides, sulfanylphthalonitriles and sulfanylbenzonitriles examined display significant MAO-B inhibitory properties in vitro with IC 50 values in the low μM to nM range. Good A 2 A receptor affinity was demonstrated by the xanthines containing a styryl moiety, while the phenoxymethyl and phenylpropyl xanthines exhibited poor activity. Doctora...|$|R
