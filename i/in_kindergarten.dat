5|$|ACS {{refers to}} grade levels as groups, a {{practice}} rooted in progressive education {{that dates back}} at least to the Junior Elementary School. There are three divisions of students: the early school, which includes the early childhood Program (EC) for three-year-olds and junior kindergarten (JK) for four-year-olds; the lower school for kindergarten through group four, and middle school for groups five through eight. Each class <b>in</b> <b>kindergarten</b> through group eight has 32students. Each lower school class is team taught by two teachers. The student-to-teacher ratio in the lower and middle school is 16 to 1, 11 to 1 <b>in</b> <b>kindergarten,</b> 8 to 1 in junior kindergarten, and 7 to 1 in the early childhood program.|$|E

In 1956, another addition nearly doubled the school's size. In 2000, another expansion of the school began, creating distinct wings for students <b>in</b> <b>kindergarten</b> to second grade and students in third to fifth grade.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to draw {{attention}} to the possibilities of the pedagogical approach to the children behaving in aggressive manner <b>in</b> a <b>kindergarten.</b> The theoretical part focuses on the term aggression and on the definition of the acts and causes of the aggressive behaviour of children <b>in</b> <b>kindergartens.</b> On the basis of studying literature it recommends educational approachs to children behaving aggressively <b>in</b> <b>kindergartens.</b> <b>In</b> the practical part a research of the frequency and forms of acts of aggressive behaviour <b>in</b> <b>kindergartens</b> is executed ? it defines as well the methods mostly used by teachers <b>in</b> <b>kindergartens</b> to affect children´s aggression and compares them to the theoretical recommendations in literature...|$|R

5|$|Always a tomboy, James quickly {{developed}} {{an interest in}} sports. Her godfather gave her a baseball bat and glove to celebrate her first holy communion.

Her passion was for hockey, however, and she was constantly playing ball hockey with the neighbourhood boys from the time she was <b>in</b> <b>kindergarten.</b> James first played organized hockey in a Flemingdon Park boys house league at the age of eight, and then only after her mother threatened legal action as officials opposed her inclusion.|$|E

Admission {{is open to the}} public for available slots (after returning students and siblings of existing students are entered) and offers an after school program and summer camp. As the school is a public school, no tuition is charged. Funding comes from the Teaneck Public Schools (and the home districts of non-resident students), which provides 90% of its cost per pupil in the district; the balance of funding comes directly from the state of New Jersey. The school moved to a new building at 563 Chestnut Avenue in the 2009–10 school year, from a space it had rented on Palisade Avenue.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the current debate about {{educational}} quality <b>in</b> <b>Kindergartens</b> that has been taking place in Germany mainly since the 1990 s. Set {{against a background of}} different theoretical conceptions of educational quality <b>in</b> <b>Kindergartens,</b> this paper introduces a common theoretical framework of educational quality (structure-process model) that differentiates between four major components: structural characteristics, educational beliefs, educational processes, and networking with families. Relevant national and international studies about educational quality <b>in</b> <b>Kindergartens</b> refer to this theoretical framework. In addition, the authors present standardized instruments that are also based on the structure-process model of quality. Furthermore, by drawing on the structure-process model of quality <b>in</b> <b>Kindergartens,</b> they report on national and international findings regarding the level of quality, prediction of quality, and effects of quality on child development. Finally, an outlook is given with reference to procedures for the development and improvement of educational quality in Germany...|$|R
