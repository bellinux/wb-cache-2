500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} the first-season finale, while [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was meant to be the third episode. However, NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to run so early in the season: the episode takes place entirely within the squad room and lacked traditional police drama action, which NBC executives felt was not appropriate for an early stage when the series was still trying to woo viewers. As a result, [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was shown out of sequence and made the season finale. This created several notable continuity errors. For example, Officer Chris Thormann has not yet been shot and blinded in [...] "Night of the Dead Living", and Tim Bayliss <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> on the Adena Watson case, which was already ended earlier in the season. These errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words [...] "One hot night, last September..." [...] {{to the beginning of the}} episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order.|$|E
