The album was well received by critics for its blend of genres and influences, its musical accessibility, and its large-scale rock production style.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Tom Tureen (the tribes' lawyer) {{tried to}} {{negotiate}} a cash settlement. At first Maine's governor, James B. Longley, Maine's attorney general, Joseph Brennan, and the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation, the largest landowner in the state, were unwilling to discuss a settlement. With no one to negotiate with, Tureen devoted <b>his</b> <b>energy</b> to assisting the Solicitors Office in researching the legal and historical basis of the claim.|$|E
5|$|His {{political}} {{projects were}} put on hold, and Caragiale instead concentrated <b>his</b> <b>energy</b> on obtaining the French Légion d'honneur order, eventually becoming one of its Chevaliers in December 1929.

5|$|Huntsman {{formally}} {{entered the}} race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980.

5|$|In 729, after a mixed {{performance}} {{against the}} Khazars, Maslamah was replaced yet again {{as governor of}} Armenia and Adharbayjan by al-Jarrah. For all <b>his</b> <b>energy,</b> Maslamah's campaigning failed to produce the desired results: {{by the time of}} his dismissal, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and been thrust once more into the defensive, with al-Jarrah again having to defend Adharbayjan against a Khazar invasion.|$|E

5|$|Yamaguchi {{found the}} Kikuuiki {{recording}} sessions exhausting, {{as if he}} had used all of <b>his</b> <b>energy</b> in the writing process. In an interview with Rockin' On Japan in 2011, Yamaguchi felt that the people who became fans during this period became Sakaction's core fanbase. Because of this, many of Sakanaction's concert set-lists continue to feature songs from Kikuuiki for these people.|$|E

5000|$|According to Fr. John Romanides, Palamas {{considers}} {{the distinction between}} God's essence and <b>his</b> <b>energies</b> to be a [...] "real distinction". Romanides distinguishes this [...] "real distinction" [...] from the Thomistic [...] "virtual distinction" [...] and the Scotist [...] "formal distinction". Romanides suspects that Barlaam accepted a [...] "formal distinction" [...] between God's essence and <b>his</b> <b>energies.</b> Other writers agree that Palamas views {{the distinction between the}} divine essence and the divine energies as a [...] "real" [...] distinction.|$|R

5|$|As a {{minister}} of finance, Banza directed much of <b>his</b> <b>energy</b> and time into lifting the country out of bankruptcy. Banza was also successful {{in his efforts}} to build the government's reputation abroad, all the while establishing himself as a respected and well-liked leader. Many believed that the natural-born leader would not remain as Bokassa's right-hand man for much longer. After Banza was promoted from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel in 1965, Bokassa realized that his greatest political threat wasn't from the remaining group of Dacko supporters, but from Banza himself.|$|E

His son, Tag Bertuzzi, was drafted into the OHL by the Guelph Storm, 2nd overall in 2017.Bertuzzi is a recreational golfer and has credited the sport with allowing him to relax more as a hockey player.

5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Georgia family, Chivers became {{interested}} in poetry at a young age. After he and his first wife separated, he received a medical degree from Transylvania University but focused <b>his</b> <b>energy</b> on publishing rather than medicine. In addition to submitting poems to various magazines and journals, Chivers published several volumes of poetry, including The Lost Pleiad in 1845, as well as plays. Edgar Allan Poe showed {{an interest in the}} young poet and encouraged his work. Chivers spent the last few years of his life defending the reputation of Poe, who had died in 1849, though he also thought Poe had been heavily influenced by his own poetry. Chivers died in Georgia in 1858.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused <b>his</b> <b>energy</b> on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from {{contact with the outside}} world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities {{at the helm of the}} state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked <b>his</b> <b>energy,</b> and new enemies appeared in the form of the Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E
5|$|During a gig with a {{stand-in}} drummer in late April at the Oldfield, {{the band}} first met Keith Moon. Moon {{grew up in}} Wembley, and had been drumming in bands since 1961. He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time. Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with <b>his</b> <b>energy</b> and enthusiasm, and offered him the job. Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.|$|E
