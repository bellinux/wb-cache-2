40|$|Abstract—The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a mechanism of <b>enhanced</b> <b>paging</b> support for the second generation microkernels in the form of explicit support of multi-pager environment for the tasks running in the system. Proposed mechanism is based on the intra-kernel high granularity pagers assignments per virtual address space, which allow efficient and simple dispatching of page faults to the appropriate pagers. The paging is one of the major features of the virtual memory, which is extensively used by advanced operating systems to provide an illusion of elastic memory. Original and present second generation microkernels provide only limited, inflexible and unnatural support for paging. Furthermore, facilities provided by current solutions for multi-pager support on the runtime level introduce an overhead in terms of mode switches and thread context switches which can be significantly reduced. Limited paging support limits the attractiveness of the second generation microkernel based systems use in real-life applications, in which processes usually have concurrent servicing of multiple paging servers. The purpose {{of this paper is to}} present a facilities for the efficient and flexible support of multi-pager environments for the second generation microkernels. A comparison of the proposed solution to the present architecture L 4 + L 4 Re has been made and overhead of the page fault handling critical path has been evaluated. Proposed solution is simple enough and provides a natural and flexible support of multi-pager environments for second generation microkernels in efficient way. It introduces a third less overhead in terms of the mode switches and thread context switches in comparison to the present L 4 + L 4 Re solution implemented in the Fiasco. OC.

40|$|The Web is a {{convenient}} platform to deliver information, but reading web pages {{is not as}} easy as it was in 1990 s. This thesis focuses on investigating techniques to <b>enhance</b> web <b>pages</b> on desktop and mobile browsers for two specific popula-tions: non-native English readers and mobile users. There are three issues ad-dressed in this thesis: web page readability, web page skimmability and continu-ous reading support on mobile devices.

40|$|Abstract: With {{the massive}} and ever {{increasing}} {{pages in the}} Web, incremental crawling has become a promising method to achieve on-line information. Its main advantage is the resource economization, which comes from the avoidance of downloading unchanged pages. For the precision of change prediction, the evolution of Web is generally studied {{to find out how}} pages change. In sum, incremental crawlers often integrate change frequency, change extent, and document quality for each page to determine its relative order as well as its download frequency. In this paper, the researches on Web evolution and incremental crawling in recent years are summarized: First, the change of page is modeled as a Poisson process, and the solutions are given to estimate its parameters, especially the change frequency, and then experimental results are shown. Second, based on the change of pages, three public large-scale incremental crawling systems are introduced, with emphasis on their scheduling policies and strategies to <b>enhance</b> <b>page</b> qualities. Third, theoretical analysis and exploration are performed to find the optimal scheduling policy, three approaches from different points of views are utilized to achieve this object, and a heuristic approximate solution is supplied for the feasibility in practice.

40|$|Buffer caches in {{operating}} systems keep active file blocks in memory to reduce disk accesses. Related {{studies have focused}} on minimizing buffer misses and the resulting performance degradation. However, the side effects and performance implications of accessing the data in buffer caches (i. e. buffer cache hits) have been ignored. In this paper, we show that accessing buffer caches can cause serious performance degradation on multicores, particularly with shared last level caches (LLCs). There are two reasons for this problem. First, data objects in files normally have weaker localities than data objects in virtual memory spaces. Second, due to the shared structure of LLCs on multicore processors, an application accessing the data in a buffer cache may flush the to-be-reused data of its co-running applications from the shared LLC and significantly slow down these applications. The paper proposes a buffer cache design called Selected Region Mapping Buffer (SRM-buffer) for multicore systems to address effectively the cache pollution problem caused by OS buffer. SRM-buffer improves existing OS buffer management with an <b>enhanced</b> <b>page</b> allocation policy that carefully selects mapping physical pages upon buffer misses. For a sequence of blocks accessed by an application, SRMbuffer allocates physical pages that are mapped to a selected region consisting of a small portion of sets in the LLC. Thus, when these blocks are accessed, cache pollution is effectively limited within the small cache region. We have implemented a prototype of SRM-buffer into the Linux kernel, and tested it with extensive workloads. Performance evaluation shows SRM-buffer can improve system performance and decrease the execution times of workloads by up to 36 %...|$|R
