25|$|Bevan Morris was {{appointed}} president {{and chairman of}} Maharishi International University's board of trustees in 1979.

25|$|Graduate {{education}} is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them. Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in pharmaceutical and medical device development, graduate {{education is}} almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a Masters or <b>Doctoral</b> <b>level</b> degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need {{for some kind of}} graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate BME programs will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school afterwards.|$|E
