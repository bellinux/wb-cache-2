40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment for {{congestive}} heart failure (CHF) {{is an important factor}} in rising health care costs especially in patients requiring repeated hospitalisations. Diuretics remain the most frequently utilized drugs in symptomatic patients. In this study the long-term outcome under furosemide and torasemide, two loop diuretics with different pharmacokinetic properties, were evaluated during one year in an ambulatory care setting. AIMS: Comparison of hospitalization rates and estimated costs under long-term treatment with furosemide and torasemide in patients with CHF. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of disease course and resource utilization in 222 ambulatory patients receiving long-term treatment with <b>furosemide</b> (<b>n</b> = 111) or torasemide (n = 111). Data were also compared to those of a similar study including 1000 patients in Germany. RESULTS: Patients receiving long-term treatment with torasemide had a lower hospitalisation rate (3. 6...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} whether torasemide inhibits the enzyme involved in the myocardial extracellular generation of collagen type I molecules (i. e., procollagen type I carboxy-terminal proteinase [PCP]). BACKGROUND: Torasemide {{has been reported to}} reduce myocardial fibrosis in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). METHODS: Chronic HF patients received either 10 to 20 mg/day oral torasemide (n = 11) or 20 to 40 mg/day oral <b>furosemide</b> (<b>n</b> = 11) in addition to their standard HF therapy. At baseline and after 8 months from randomization, right septal endomyocardial biopsies were obtained to analyze the expression of PCP by Western blot and the deposition of collagen fibers (collagen volume fraction [CVF]) with an automated image analysis system. The carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (PICP) released {{as a result of the}} action of PCP on procollagen type I was measured in serum by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: The ratio of PCP active form to PCP zymogen, an index of PCP activation, decreased (p < 0. 05) in torasemide-treated patients and remained unchanged in furosemide-treated patients. A reduction (p < 0. 01) in both CVF and PICP was observed in torasemide-treated but not in furosemide-treated patients. Changes in PCP activation were positively correlated (p < 0. 001) with changes in CVF and changes in PICP in patients receiving torasemide. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the hypothesis that the ability of torasemide to reduce myocardial fibrosis in chronic HF patients is related to a decreased PCP activation. Further studies are required to ascertain whether PCP may represent a new target for antifibrotic strategies in chronic HF...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The role of low-dose {{dopamine}} infusion {{in patients}} with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) remains controversial. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-versus low-dose furosemide with or without low-dose dopamine infusion in this patient population. Methods and results: 161 ADHF patients (78 years; 46 % female; ejection fraction 31 %) were randomized to 8 -hour continuous infusions of: a) high-dose <b>furosemide</b> (HDF, <b>n</b> = 50, 20 mg/h), b) low-dose furosemide and low-dose dopamine (LDFD, n = 56, 5 mg/h and 5 mu g kg(- 1) min(- 1) respectively), or c) low-dose <b>furosemide</b> (LDF, <b>n</b> = 55, <b>furosemide</b> 5 mg/h). The main outcomes were 60 -day and one-year all-cause mortality (ACM) and hospitalization for HF (HHF). Dyspnea relief (Borg index), worsening renal function (WRF, rise in serum creatinine (sCr) >= 0. 3 mg/dL), and length of stay (LOS) were also assessed. The urinary output at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h was not significantly different in the three groups. Neither the ACM at day 60 (4. 0 %, 7. 1 %, and 7. 2 %; P = 0. 74) or at one year (38. 1 %, 33. 9 % and 32. 7 %, P = 0. 84) nor the HHF at day 60 (22. 0 %, 21. 4 %, and 14. 5 %, P = 0. 55) or one year (60. 0 %, 50. 0 %, and 47 %, P = 0. 40) differed between HDF, LDFD, and LDF groups, respectively. No differences in the Borg index or LOS were noted. WRF was higher in the HDF than in LDFD and LDF groups at day 1 (24 % vs. 11 % vs. 7 %, P < 0. 0001) but not at sCr peak (44 % vs. 38 % vs. 29 %, P = 0. 27). No significant differences in adverse events were noted. Conclusions: In ADHF patients, {{there were no significant}} differences in the in-hospital and post-discharge outcomes between high-vs. low-dose furosemide infusion; the addition of low-dose dopamine infusion was not associated with any beneficial effects.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{major cause}} of the hearing loss {{following}} exposure to intense noise involves release of free radicals resulting from the elevated metabolism. The free radicals induce damage to several {{of the components of}} the cochlear amplifier including the outer hair cells and indirectly to the transduction currents. Salicylic acid induces a reversible hearing loss since it binds to the motor protein prestin in the outer hair cells, reducing electromotility. Furosemide also induces a reversible hearing loss since it reduces the endocochlear potential which is a major component of the cochlear transduction currents. On the other hand, each of these drugs also provides protection from a noise induced hearing loss if they are injected just before a noise exposure, probably {{as a result of the}} decreased metabolism induced in their presence, with release of lower levels of free radicals. In this study, both drugs were administered in order to assess whether their protective effects would be additive. Methods The study was conducted on normal hearing albino mice of the Sabra strain. They were injected with either salicylic acid alone (N = 11), or <b>furosemide</b> alone (<b>N</b> = 14), or both together (N = 14), or with saline control (N = 11) and exposed to broad band noise for 3. 5 hours. An additional group of 9 mice was injected with both salicylic acid and furosemide, but not exposed to noise. The degree of the resulting hearing loss was assessed by recording thresholds of the auditory nerve brainstem evoked responses to broad band clicks before the injections and noise, and 7, 14 and 21 days after. Results The noise induced hearing loss in the mice injected with salicylic acid alone or furosemide alone was smaller than in those injected with saline, i. e. these drugs provided protection, as in previous studies in this laboratory. There was no threshold elevation after two weeks in the mice injected with both drugs without noise exposure, i. e. the effects of the two drugs given together was reversible. On the other hand, there was a significant hearing loss (i. e. threshold elevation) in the group which received both drugs and was also exposed to noise, with mean threshold elevations of 38. 8 ± 19. 0 dB and 28. 3 ± 11. 7 dB 7 days after noise exposure. Conclusions This result is very surprising, if not paradoxical. Drugs which provide protection from a noise induced hearing loss when administered alone, not only do not provide protection when given together, but also induce a greater hearing loss when accompanied by noise. This observation may be related to the finding that the depression of the endocochlear potential normally caused by furosemide is reduced in the presence of salicylic acid, so that the protection usually provided by furosemide is not present when it is administered together with salicylic acid. Thus it seems that each drug may interfere with the protective action of the other when coupled with noise. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{individually}} randomized, open-label, parallel-group {{pilot study}} was designed to test the hypothesis that the ability of loop diuretics to interfere with cardiac fibrosis in chronic heart failure (CHF) may be different between compounds. BACKGROUND: The apparent mortality and cardiac benefits seen in studies comparing torasemide with furosemide in CHF suggest that torasemide may have beneficial effects beyond diuresis (e. g., on the process of cardiac fibrosis). METHODS: Patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to IV CHF received diuretic therapy with either 10 to 20 mg/day oral torasemide (n = 19) or 20 to 40 mg/day oral <b>furosemide</b> (<b>n</b> = 17), in addition to their existing standard CHF therapy for eight months. At baseline and after eight months, right septal endomyocardial biopsies were obtained to quantify collagen volume fraction (CVF) with an automated image analysis system. Serum carboxy-terminal peptide of procollagen type I (PIP) and serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP), indexes of collagen type I synthesis and degradation, respectively, were measured by specific radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: In torasemide-treated patients, CVF decreased from 7. 96 +/- 0. 54 % to 4. 48 +/- 0. 26 % (p < 0. 01), and PIP decreased from 143 +/- 7 to 111 +/- 3 microg/l (p < 0. 01). Neither CVF nor PIP changed significantly in furosemide-treated patients. In all patients, CVF was directly correlated with PIP (r = 0. 88, p < 0. 001) before and after treatment. No changes in CITP were observed with treatment in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that loop diuretics possess different abilities to reverse myocardial fibrosis and reduce collagen type I synthesis in patients with CHF...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of this}} work, {{the most}} common {{emergency}} diagnosis and primary diseases of patients in nursing homes were identified and their pharmacotherapy evaluated in detail. Furthermore, the renal function of the patients was determined {{to answer the question}} of whether by using the SCr- and SCysC- concentration the drug selection and dosage of the concomitant pharmacotherapy was adapted to the renal function of the patients. Against this background in a twelve-month, prospective, monocentric study patients were included, for whom out of a caring situation an emergency doctor was called. Emergency patients in a nursing home are older than the above average of age (85. 8 years) and they are predominantly female (75 %). Most common the primary diseases of the studied patients were dementia, HTN and other cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. On average, the patients received 5. 6 prescriptions of drugs. Potentially inappropriate medications were found in 17 % of patients (n = 19). This concerns above all promethazine (n = 7) and digoxin (n = 5). Most often ASA (n = 49), <b>furosemide</b> (<b>n</b> = 32), enalapril (n = 30), metoprolol (n = 28) insulin (n = 22), ISDN (n = 18) and metamizole (n = 16) were prescribed. The treatment of HTN was primarily performed with agents from the group of diuretics (n = 77). Every tenth patient with HTN remained untreated. The prescription of cholesterol-lowering drugs for cardiovascular risk patients was almost completely given up. By estimating the GFR using the formulas according to Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD, Mayo Clinic and Larsson, 72 % of the patients showed an insufficient renal function below 60 ml / min. Of these patients, about two-thirds received at least one drug with predominantly renal elimination. Dosage adjustment of such drugs was only checked at merely 69 % of the patients with insufficient renal function. This monocentric study shows, that during the data collection period more than every tenth intervention of an emergency doctor was carried out in a nursing facility and that for a great number of emergency patients there existed a potential to optimize drug therapies for the primary disease. Against the background of an aging population in Germany and the already critically low primary care physician density in rural areas there is to be expected a supply gap, especially for geriatric patients. Currently {{there is a lack of}} solution concepts. Therefore, it is becoming apparent that in the future this problem can be compensated on a larger scale by the solid and nationwide existing ambulance service system and that the number of interventions of emergency doctors in nursing homes will increase...|$|E
