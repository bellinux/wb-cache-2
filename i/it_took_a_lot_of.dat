Burton cast Ryder upon seeing her in Lucas.

500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{initially}} described Jo as an [...] "innocent {{girl who}} wanted to be a hunter" [...] and who tends to look before she leaps; she is also [...] "enthusiastic" [...] and very [...] "girl-next-door" [...] in her approach to hunting the supernatural. He later regretted writing Jo in this way, as he felt that it was the wrong characterization for a female character on Supernatural. However, Jo grows throughout the second season as she rebels against her mother by running away to be a hunter, which Kripke believed made her harder and tougher. Regarding her character's capture by a vengeful spirit in [...] "No Exit", actress Alona Tal felt that Jo was a [...] "badass" [...] who handled the situation well. Tal commented, [...] "She fought and risked her life and stayed there as bait. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> guts." ...|$|E

As Espanto III, Vázquez was an active wrestler from the 1960s through the early 1980s. In a 1996 {{interview}} Espanto IV revealed that their father never pushed them to become wrestlers, insisting that they learn a trade as well as train for wrestling to make sure they had options in life. Espanto IV also shared the fact that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> convincing from the brothers to allow them to be known as [...] "Espanto IV" [...] and [...] "Espanto V", but the fact that Vázquez and Fernando Cisneros Carrilo (Espanto II) had given Jesús Andrade Salas permission to work as Espanto Jr. finally convinced their father to allow them to become [...] "Espanto IV" [...] and [...] "Espanto V" [...] instead of being a [...] "Junior" [...] or [...] "hijo" [...] ("son").|$|E

500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit to open them up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the console}} used 32-bit {{processing}} and {{was capable of}} better graphics and sound than the Genesis alone, most games for the 32X did {{not take advantage of}} its hardware. Doom for the 32X received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch, but was later noted for being an inferior version of the game compared to releases for the PC and the Atari Jaguar, with the 32X version criticized for missing levels, poor graphic and audio quality, chuggy movement, and running within a window on the screen. Though the system had enhanced audio capabilities, 32X games did not use this, which Franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with the new audio enhancements. [...] One source of these issues was the rush to release games on time for the 32X's launch; former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham explained, in reference to 32X launch title Cosmic Carnage, [...] "We were rushed. [...] We had to get games out for the 32X and {{it was going to be}} such a close cycle. [...] When Cosmic Carnage showed up, we didn't even want to ship it. [...] <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> convincing, you know, to ship that title." [...] Likewise with Doom, id Software's John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time. [...] Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do. In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: [...] "I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered." ...|$|E

It was also revealed the actor voicing Montana, André Sogliuzzo, had been hand-picked by Al Pacino. In July, it was revealed Pacino had turned down the opportunity to lend his likeness to Electronic Arts' Godfather adaptation so he could appear instead in Scarface. It was also explained the reason Pacino himself was not voicing Montana was because he simply didn't sound like Montana anymore. According to Vivendi's Adam Roberts; [...] "He just can't physically do it any more.

2500|$|The {{remainder}} of the line was built over the next month between Annadale and Pleasant Plains as a single-track line (there was a passing siding at Huguenot), passing through mosquito infested-land laced with peat bogs and quicksand. This area was known by the locals as Skunk's Misery. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time and wood to built the sub-roadbed with logs. It likely wasn't viewed as a worthwhile investment to double track the line due to the low passenger volume south of New Dorp. South of Pleasant Plains, the line continued as a double-tracked line. The line was extended to Annadale on May 14, 1860, and the line was completed to Tottenville on June 2, 1860, with a formal opening of the railroad. The completion of the line to Tottenville allowed passengers to transfer to a ferry, which crossed the Arthur Kill, and allowed passengers to go to Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Initially, service made eleven stops between Vanderbilt's Landing and Tottenville. Many stations were named after nearby large farms, such as Garretson's or Gifford's. There were more elaborate structures put in place at Eltingville and Annadale, as their namesakes, the Eltings and Anna Seguine, were influential in paying {{for the construction of}} the rail line. The arrival of the railroad gave dignity to some locations on Staten Island without any of it. [...] "Poverty Hollow" [...] was renamed Rosebank, Heights was added to Oakwood, and various other places were renamed with the coming of the railroad.|$|E
