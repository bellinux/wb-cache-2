Comparative transcriptomics revealed pectinase expression to be enriched in the symbiotic organs, consistent with enzymatic buildup in these structures following immunostaining with pectinase- targeting antibodies. Symbiont elimination results in a drastically reduced host survivorship and a diminished capacity to degrade pectin.

The accumulation of typical autophagosomes and conjugation of LC 3 to phosphatidylethanolamine were observed in Sp-infected cells {{as an indication of}} autophagy. Using the pneumolysin (PLY) mutant, we successfully demonstrated that PLY is involved in initiating autophagy without affecting the expression levels of PI 3 K-III and Beclin 1. PLY-mediated autophagy depends on the inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR) pathway. Furthermore, Sp could also lead to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) hypergeneration in A 549 cells. Taken together, Sp infection-induced autophagy is PLY-mediated through ROS hypergeneration and mTOR inhibition. PI 3 K-I and rapamycin (autophagy inducers) enhanced bacterial clearance, whereas wortmannin (autophagy inhibitor) and acetylcysteine (ROS inhibitor) reduced intracellular bacteria clearance.

40|$|ABSTRACT Invasion of nonphagocytic cells through {{rearrangement}} of the actin cytoskeleton is {{a common}} immune evasion mechanism used by most intracellular bacteria. However, some pathogens modulate host microtubules as well by a still poorly understoodmechanism. In this study, we aim at deciphering the mechanisms by which the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa invades nonphagocytic cells, although it is considered mainly an <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Using confo-cal microscopy and immunofluorescence, we show that the evolved VgrG 2 b effector of P. aeruginosa strain PAO 1 is delivered into epithelial cells by a type VI secretion system, called H 2 -T 6 SS, involving the VgrG 2 a component. An in vivo interactome of VgrG 2 b in host cells allows the identification of microtubule components, including the -tubulin ring complex (TuRC), a multiprotein complex catalyzing microtubule nucleation, as the major host target of VgrG 2 b. This interaction promotes a microtubule-dependent internalization of the bacterium since colchicine and nocodazole, twomicrotubule-destabilizing drugs, prevent VgrG 2 b-mediated P. aeruginosa entry even if the invasion still requires actin. We further validate our findings by dem-onstrating that the type VI injection step can be bypassed by ectopic production of VgrG 2 b inside target cells prior to infection...|$|R
40|$|H. pylori is a Gram-negative <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacterium,</b> first {{discovered}} by the Australian physicians Barry Marshall and Robin Warren in 1982, that colonises the human stomach mucosa. It {{is the leading cause}} of peptic ulcer and commonly infects humans worldwide with prevalence as high as 90 % in some countries. H. pylori infection usually results in asymptomatic chronic gastritis, however 10 - 15 % of cases develop duodenal or gastric ulcers and 1 - 3 % develop stomach cancer. Infection is generally acquired during childhood and persists for life in the absence of antibiotic treatment. H. pylori has had a long period of co-evolution with humans, going back to human migration out of Africa. This prolonged relationship is likely to have shaped the overall host-pathogen interactions and repertoire of virulence strategies which H. pylori employs to establish robust colonisation, escape immune responses and persist in the gastric niche. In this regard, H. pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key surface determinant in establishing colonisation and persistence via host mimicry and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. Thus, elucidation of the H. pylori LPS structure and corresponding biosynthetic pathway represents an important step towards better understanding of H. pylori pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background: In vitro {{investigations}} of human innate immune responses to <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacteria</b> commonly utilise killed preparations in preference to live organisms. The {{effects of the}} bacterial preparation method on the activation of innate signalling pathways by the common opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) are unknown.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) -activating capacity of the preparations was analysed using TLR-transfected human embryonic kidney cells.

Conclusions: Killing of <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacteria</b> has significant qualitative and quantitative effects on key aspects of innate responses in vitro.

40|$|Brucella {{species are}} facultative {{intracellular}} pathogens that infect animals as their natural hosts. Transmission to humans is most commonly caused by {{direct contact with}} infected animals or by ingestion of contaminated food {{and can lead to}} severe chronic infections. Brucella can invade professional and non-professional phagocytic cells and replicates within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -derived vacuoles. The host factors required for Brucella entry into host cells, avoidance of lysosomal degradation, and replication in the ER-like compartment remain largely unknown. Here we describe two assays to identify host factors involved in Brucella entry and replication in HeLa cells. The protocols describe the use of RNA interference, while alternative screening methods could be applied. The assays are based on the detection of fluorescently labeled bacteria in fluorescently labeled host cells using automated wide-field microscopy. The fluorescent images are analyzed using a standardized image analysis pipeline in CellProfiler which allows single cell-based infection scoring. In the endpoint assay, intracellular replication is measured two days after infection. This allows bacteria to traffic to their replicative niche where proliferation is initiated around 12 hr after bacterial entry. Brucella which have successfully established an intracellular niche will thus have strongly proliferated inside host cells. Since intracellular bacteria will greatly outnumber individual extracellular or intracellular non-replicative bacteria, a strain constitutively expressing GFP can be used. The strong GFP signal is then used to identify infected cells. In contrast, for the entry assay it is essential to differentiate between intracellular and <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Here, a strain encoding for a tetracycline-inducible GFP is used. Induction of GFP with simultaneous inactivation of <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacteria</b> by gentamicin enables the differentiation between intracellular and <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacteria</b> based on the GFP signal, with only intracellular bacteria being able to express GFP. This allows the robust detection of single intracellular bacteria before intracellular proliferation is initiated...|$|E

Mechanistic analysis revealed that macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) employ different signaling pathways leading to IFN-beta production.

Nevertheless, here we present conclusive evidence that infection-stimulated fibrin deposition can perform critical protective functions during bacterial infection. Specifically, we demonstrate that coagulation-impaired fibrin(ogen) -deficient mice, in comparison with genetically matched control mice, display increased mortality upon peritoneal infection with the gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. To distinguish effects of fibrinogen from those of fibrin, we treat wild-type mice with warfarin, an anticoagulant that suppresses fibrin formation without impacting fibrinogen levels. Warfarin treatment exacerbates listeriosis, suggesting that fibrin is the key mediator of protection. With regard to the underlying protective mechanisms, we demonstrate that fibrin(ogen) suppresses anemia, reduces hemorrhagic pathology, and limits bacterial growth during listeriosis. Despite confirming a prior report that fibrin(ogen) promotes the peritoneal clearance of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>bacterium</b> Staphylococcal aureus, we demonstrate that fibrin(ogen) plays little role in controlling peritoneal numbers of L. monocytogenes bacteria or the dissemination of L. monocytogenes bacteria from the peritoneal cavity. Rather, fibrin(ogen) primarily limits the growth of these intracellular bacteria within hepatic tissue. While the pathological potential of excessive infection-stimulated fibrin deposition is well appreciated, our findings reveal that fibrin can function protectively, via multiple mechanisms, during bacterial infection...|$|R
