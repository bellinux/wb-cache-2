25|$|Salvor is {{the third}} ship of the {{auxiliary}} rescue and salvage class of vessel constructed for the US Navy. The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make Salvor well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 shaft horsepower with four Caterpillar399 diesel engines coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller within a <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. Salvor is also configured with a bow thruster which provides athwartship thrust for additional control of the bow when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9km/h).|$|E

5000|$|Scale model {{tug boats}} are often built to include scale drive systems. They use {{standard}} propellers and rudder(s), Becker rudders, <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles,</b> steerable <b>kort</b> <b>nozzles,</b> Z-drives or Voith-Schneider cycloidial drives. Clubs will often host maneuvering competitions where participants are tasked {{to run their}} boats in the most realistic manner possible. This can be judged {{with or without a}} [...] "tow" [...] or barge attached.|$|R

500|$|One of {{the issues}} with the yard was {{that the size of}} boats that could be built was {{restricted}} by the locks at either side of the site. Sheffield-sized boats were around , and could leave the yard either by passing through Thorne Lock and on to the Don Navigation, or by travelling to Keadby and entering the Trent. Sloops were restricted to the Keadby route, because of their larger size, and the largest boats built at Thorne before the 1940s were [...] tugs, 300-ton coasters and 300-ton lighters. From 1933, the yard began experimenting with welded rather than riveted construction, and their first all-welded steam tugs were constructed for the Admiralty in 1942. They continued to lead the field with developments in tug propulsion in the 1960s, and by the last 1970s had built seventeen tugs [...] with <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> or Kort rudder steering and twenty tugs with Voith-Schneider propulsion systems at Thorne. With the yard at Hessle on the Humber, bought from Henry Scarr in 1932, they were one of the largest un-nationalised shipbuilders in Britain.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles</b> or ducted {{propellers}} can {{be significantly}} {{more efficient than}} unducted propellers at low speeds, producing greater thrust in a smaller package. Tugboats and fishing trawlers {{are the most common}} application for <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles</b> as highly loaded propellers on slow moving vessels benefit the most. Nozzles have the additional benefits of reducing paddlewheel-effect (e.g. the tendency of a right-hand wheel to back to the left) and reduce bottom suction while operating in shallow water.|$|R
50|$|Alternatives to the Shilling rudder concept include {{conventional}} aerofoil shapes, i.e. {{without the}} flared end, flap rudders, <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles</b> and azimuth thrusters.|$|R

2500|$|France in the 1930s based its ANF- Mureaux BN.4 {{advanced}} night bomber {{design on}} a multi-engine intubed-propeller Stipa design, although the BN.4 was cancelled in 1936 {{before the first}} aircraft could be built. In Germany in 1934, Ludwig Kort designed the <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle,</b> a ducted fan similar to Stipa's intubed propeller and still in use, and the German Heinkel T fighter design bore a similarity to Stipa's concepts. [...] In Italy, none of Stipa's flying wing designs with intubed propellers ever were built, but the Caproni Campini N.1, an experimental but impractical advanced derivative of the intubed propeller idea powered by a motorjet, appeared in 1940.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> is {{a sturdy}} {{cylindrical}} structure around a special propeller having minimum clearance between the propeller blades {{and the inner}} wall of the <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The thrust-to-power ratio is enhanced because the water approaches the propeller in a linear configuration and exits the nozzle the same way. The <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> is named after its inventor, but many brands exist.|$|E

50|$|Shrouding of {{this type}} is also {{beneficial}} to navigation in ice fields since it protects the propeller tips to some extent. However, ice or any other floating object can become jammed between the wheel and nozzle, locking up the wheel. Fouled wheels in <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles</b> are {{much more difficult to}} clear than open wheels.|$|R
50|$|The United States Coast Guard also {{investigated}} the sinking through a Marine Board of Investigation. The Marine Board's Report of Investigation determined a different scenario {{related to the}} cause of the casualty. The Marine Board reviewed thousands of pages of documents and photographs related to the maintenance and repair of the vessel, and examined in-depth the installation of the <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The Marine Board also examined in detail the rudder installation.|$|R
5000|$|The Baltic {{is driven}} by two main engines of the General Electric 16V250MDB3 type which are {{connected}} to two Schottel controllable pitch propellers via transmissions and drive shafts. The engines are 16-cylinder Diesel units which can provide [...] each at a nominal 1,050 revolutions per minute. The propellers are encased in <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles</b> and have a maximum revolution speed of 170 rpm. Two thrusters are installed in the bow and the stern section respectively to improve the ship's manoeuvrability.|$|R
50|$|The Ville-class tugs rotate their <b>kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> for steering. Tillicums nozzles {{are fixed}} and she uses {{conventional}} rudders for steering.|$|E
50|$|Hans Techel {{was built}} with {{traditional}} propeller and rudders (similar to the Type 205 submarines), but Friedrich Schürer had a rotatable <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> instead.|$|E
50|$|A ducted {{propeller}}, {{also known}} as a <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle,</b> is a propeller fitted with a non-rotating nozzle. It is used to improve the efficiency of the propeller and is especially used on heavily loaded propellers or propellers with limited diameter. It was developed by Luigi Stipa (1931) and Ludwig Kort (1934). The <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> is a shrouded propeller assembly for marine propulsion. The hydrodynamic design of the shroud, which is shaped like a foil, offers advantages for certain conditions over bare propellers.|$|E
5000|$|The Type IID had {{additional}} saddle tanks {{fitted to}} the sides of the external hull. These saddle tanks were used to accommodate additional diesel storage tanks. The diesel oil would float atop the saddle tanks and as the oil is consumed, sea water would gradually fill the tanks to compensate for the positive buoyancy. The range was nearly doubled to [...] at 12 kn and enabled the Type II to operate for longer durations around the British Isles. A further development was the propellers were fitted with <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles,</b> intended to improve propulsion efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Tugboats {{are highly}} maneuverable, and various {{propulsion}} {{systems have been}} developed to increase maneuverability and increase safety. The earliest tugs were fitted with paddle wheels, but these were soon replaced by propeller-driven tugs. <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzles</b> have been added to increase thrust per kW/hp. This was followed by the nozzle-rudder, which omitted the need for a conventional rudder. The cycloidal propeller was developed prior to World War II and was occasionally used in tugs because of its maneuverability. After World War II it was also linked to safety due {{to the development of the}} Voith Water Tractor, a tugboat configuration which could not be pulled over by its tow. In the late 1950s, the Z-drive or (azimuth thruster) was developed. Although sometimes referred to as the Aquamaster or Schottel system, many brands exist: Steerprop, Wärtsilä, Berg Propulsion, etc. These propulsion systems are used on tugboats designed for tasks such as ship docking and marine construction. Conventional propeller/rudder configurations are more efficient for port-to-port towing.|$|R

50|$|A ducted {{propeller}} is mounted {{as an integral}} part of the rudder and is fixed to it. The duct is a <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> and enables the propeller to develop more thrust than an un{{ducted propeller}}.|$|E
50|$|A {{propulsor}} is {{a mechanical}} device that gives propulsion. The word {{is commonly used}} in the marine vernacular, and implies a mechanical assembly that {{is more complicated than}} a propeller. The <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> and pump-jet are examples.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of this {{analysis}} the report concludes that [...] "Though the exact initiating event that created the source of flooding is unknown, it was likely related to the poor material condition of the vessel and may have been related to the <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle</b> struts which are believed to have experienced excessive stresses where they were attached to the hull." ...|$|E
50|$|In a <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle,</b> the inflow {{velocity}} is increased, reducing pressure. This lowers thrust and torque of the propeller. At {{the same}} time, a circulation occurs, {{resulting in an}} inward aimed force, that has a forward component. The duct therefore has a positive thrust. This is normally larger than the thrust reduction of the propeller. The small clearance between the propeller and duct reduces tip vortex, increasing efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Ludwig Kort was a German fluid {{dynamicist}} {{known for}} developing the ducted propeller, or <b>Kort</b> <b>nozzle.</b> In an attempt to reduce canal erosion, Kort discovered that directing {{the wake of a}} propeller through a short, stationary nozzle also increased thrust. [...] He submitted a U.S. patent for this technique, which was awarded in 1936. [...] His research showed that the performance of ducted propellers heavily depended on the cross-section and thickness of the duct.|$|E
