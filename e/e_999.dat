Objectives The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of chronic noise exposure on serious workplace injury, and how the timing of exposure influenced risk. Methods The authors examined a cohort of 26 000 workers, who worked between 1950 and 1989. Cases were those hospitalised for a work-related injury (ICD- 9 codes 800 <b>e</b> <b>999,</b> and E codes E 800 eE 999), from April 1989 to December 1998. Cumulative exposure levels were estimated for subjects based on a quantitative retrospective exposure assessment. An internal comparison of cumulative noise exposure and subchronic durations of noise exposure and injury was conducted using Poisson regression. There were 163 cases for the cumulative and 161 cases for the subchronic analysis. Results Cumulative noise exposure were associated with a decreased risk for injuries, with the risk generally decreasing as cumulative noise levels increased, while most durations of subchronic exposure were associated with an increased risk for injury. An inverse U-shaped trend was observed with the time period of 90 days to 1 year demonstrating the most elevated RR compared with 0 e 1 days of exposure. Conclusions Workers highly exposed to noise, or exposed for long periods of time, might develop effective methods of communicating the risk and preventing injuries when exposed to noise...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{reports on}} a {{systematic}} {{review of the literature}} on the post-conflict injury-related mortality of service members who deployed to conflict zones. Methods Literature databases, reference lists of articles, agencies, investigators, and other sources were examined to find studies comparing injury-related mortality of military veterans who had served in conflict zones with that of contemporary veterans who had not served in conflict zones. Injury-related mortality was defined as a cause of death indicated by International Classification of Diseases E-codes E 800 to <b>E</b> <b>999</b> (external causes) or subgroupings within this range of codes. Results Twenty studies met the review criteria; all involved veterans serving during either the Vietnam or Persian Gulf conflict. Meta-analysis indicated that, compared with non-conflict-zone veterans, injury-related mortality was elevated for veterans serving in Vietnam (summary mortality rate ratio (SMRR) = 1. 26, 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) = 1. 08 – 1. 46) during 9 to 18 years of follow-up. Similarly, injury-related mortality was elevated for veterans serving in the Persian Gulf War (SMRR = 1. 26, 95 %CI = 1. 16 – 1. 37) during 3 to 8 years of follow-up. Much of the excess mortality among conflict-zone veterans was associated with motor vehicle events. The excess mortality decreased over time. Hypotheses to account for the excess mortality in conflict-zone veterans included post-traumatic stress, coping behaviors such as substance abuse, ill-defined diseases and symptoms, lower survivability in injury events due to conflict-zone comorbidities, altered perceptions of risk, and/or selection processes leading to the deployment of individuals who were risk-takers. Conclusion Further research on the etiology of the excess mortality in conflict-zone veterans is warranted to develop appropriate interventions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Delay {{in calling}} {{emergency}} medical services following stroke limits access to early treatment that can reduce disability. Emergency medical services contact is mostly initiated by stroke witnesses (often relatives), rather than stroke patients. This study explored appraisal and behavioural factors that are potentially important in influencing witness behaviour in response to stroke. Semi-structured interviews with 26 stroke witnesses were transcribed and theory-guided content analysed was undertaken based on the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (appraisal processes) and Theory Domains Framework (behavioural determinants). Response behaviours were often influenced by heuristics-guided appraisal (i. e. mental rules of thumb). Some witnesses described their responses to the situation as 'automatic' and 'instinctive', rather than products of deliberation. Potential behavioural influences included: environmental context and resources (e. g. time of day), social influence (e. g. prompts from patients) and beliefs about consequences (<b>e.</b> g. <b>999</b> accesses rapid help). Findings are based on retrospective accounts and need further verification in prospective studies. Witnesses {{play a key role}} in patient access to {{emergency medical services}}. Factors that potentially influence witnesses' responses to stroke were identified and could inform behavioural interventions and future research. Interventions might benefit from linking automatic/instinctive threat perceptions with deliberate appraisal of stroke symptoms, prompting action to call emergency medical services...|$|R

This research aimed to use morphological and molecular characters to detect and identify Meloidogyne species on carrot from Malino Highland, Sub-district of Tinggimoncong, District of Gowa, South Sulawesi. Morphological identification was done based on character of the female perineal pattern. Molecular identification was based on amplification of r-DNA by polymerase chain reaction technique using species specific primers (Fjav/Rjav for M. javanica, Far/Rar for M. arenaria, and Finc/Rinc for M. incognita) and multiplex primer (JMV 1 /JMVhapla/JMV 2 for M. hapla, M. chitwoodi, and M. fallax). Two of Meloidogyne species, i. e. M. incognita and M. arenaria were detected associated with the incidence of carrot branched tuber. The specific primers amplified two DNA bands, i. <b>e.</b> ± <b>999</b> bp of M. incognita and ± 420 bp of M. arenaria, while multiplex primer was failed to amplify DNA bands.

We consider both the average bit error probability and the outage probability as performance indicators, and we derive a theoretical approach to evaluate their limits.

METHODS: PET studies were performed using several experimental designs, i. e. test-retest, co-injection with different doses of unlabelled LBT, displacement with GBR 12909 and pre-injection of amphetamine. RESULTS: The uptake of [(18) F]LBT- 999 confirmed its specific binding to the DAT. The non-displaceable uptake (BP(ND)) in the striatum, between 5. 37 and 4. 39, was highly reproducible and reliable, and was decreased by 90 % by acute injection of GBR 12909. In the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), the variability was higher and the reliability was lower. Pre-injection of amphetamine induced decrease of [(18) F]LBT- 999 BP(ND) of 50 % in the striatum. CONCLUSIONS: [(18) F]LBT- 999 allows the quantification of the DAT in living rat brain with high reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity.

40|$|We {{report on}} results of fully {{consistent}} N-body simulations of globular cluster models with N = 100 000 members containing neutron stars and black holes. Using the improved `algorithmic regularization' method of Hellstrom and Mikkola for compact subsystems, the new code NBODY 7 enables {{for the first}} time general relativistic coalescence to be achieved for post-Newtonian terms and realistic parameters. Following an early stage of mass segregation, a few black holes form a small dense core which usually leads to the formation of one dominant binary. The subsequent evolution by dynamical shrinkage involves the competing processes of ejection and mergers by radiation energy loss. Unless the binary is ejected, long-lived triple systems often exhibit Kozai cycles with extremely high inner eccentricity (<b>e</b> > 0. <b>999)</b> which may terminate in coalescence at a few Schwarzschild radii. A characteristic feature is that ordinary stars as well as black holes and even BH binaries are ejected with high velocities. On the basis of the models studied so far, the results suggest a limited growth of a few remaining stellar mass black holes in globular clusters.

In order to identify and characterize limitations of current assessments and identify best practices, this NATO RTG task group examined current measurement and assessment practices by NATO members in current and recent theatres of operations. The task group also conducted a preliminary study to identify a potential set of core indicators that could provide a high-level assessment of macro change over time to compliment campaign assessments aimed at specific interventions. These core indicators, if used to assess all missions, would allow for cross-mission comparison, a capability that currently does not exist. Based on the findings, the task group recommends that NATO develop the policies, plans, infrastructure and procedures to successfully conduct comprehensive assessments. In order to do this NATO must develop standard assessment procedures and frameworks for use throughout NATO/ISAF and other multinational operations.

Specifically, based on a real story about a man who died after hernia surgery, we investigated the extent to which participants revised their liability judgment about the medical staff for not having used heparin, based first on ambiguous numerical information (relative risk reduction: 50 %) and then on unambiguous numerical information (absolute risk reduction), that was framed either in terms of survival (<b>e.</b> g., <b>999</b> vs. 998 out of 1, 000 patients survived) or mortality (1 vs. 2 out of 1, 000 patients died), and presented as either resulting from small (1, 000) or large (10, 000) sample size groups. Method: Participants (N = 160) were students (aged 19 to 45, M = 22. 07, SD = 3. 60) who volunteered {{to take part in the}} experiment. Perceived liability and perceived risk reduction were measured on 7 -point scales. Result: When presented with relative risk information, participants judged the medical staff as more liable (M = 4. 84, SE =. 10) than when presented with absolute risk information (M = 4. 22, SE =. 11, F(1, 156) = 48. 47, p =. 0001, hp 2 =. 24). The change in judged liability depended both on frame and on sample size, which did not interact: Participants’ rated the liability higher in the mortality condition (M = 4. 76, SE =. 13) than in the survival frame condition (M = 4. 31, SE =. 13) F(1, 156) = 5. 61, p =. 02, hp 2 =. 04 (and post-hoc analyses showed that the judgment was revised only in the survival condition), and participants’ ratings were lower in the small- 1, 000 size condition (M = 4. 34, SE =. 13) than in the large- 10, 000 size condition (M = 4. 72, SE =. 13) F(1, 156) = 3. 89, p =. 05, hp 2 =. 02.

The predicted cadmium isotherms for two types of clayey soils using the exponential model were in excellent agreement with experimental results (Shackelford and Daniel, 1991). Sorption isotherm predicted by the exponential model was compared with other existing models such as Freundlich model and Langmuir model. Seven statistical goodness-of-fit measures were used to evaluate prediction accuracy of the exponential model as well as the Langmuir model and the Freundlich model. All seven statistical goodness-of-fit measures indicated that the exponential model has the best prediction accuracy among the sorption isotherm prediction models. For instance, the error norm for the exponential model was Ne = 0. 15 (best value of Ne is zero) for the kaolinite clay, while Ne = 2. 95 and Ne = 6. 1 for Langmuir model and Freundlich model, respectively. Furthermore, for Lufkin clay, the error norm for the exponential model was Ne = 1. 6, while Ne = 264. 4 and Ne = 15. 1 for Langmuir model and Freundlich model, respectively. The modeling efficiency (EF), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient-of-efficiency (E) and the index-of-agreement (d) values (best value for EF, E and d is one for the three measures) are best for the exponential model and for the two considered soils. For example, EF = 0. 992, <b>E</b> = 0. <b>999,</b> and d = 0. 999 for the exponential model (Lufkin clay). However, EF =- 0. 71, E =- 20. 5 and d = 0. 07 for Langmuir model, and EF = 0. 79, E = 0. 93 and d = 0. 95 for Freundlich model for the same clay...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo teve como objetivos conhecer a distribuição do peso de nascimento das crianças de Campinas (SP) e indicar fatores de risco para baixo peso. Realizou-se estudo {{transversal}} no qual foram utilizados dados das 14. 444 Declarações de Nascidos Vivos de 2001. A variável dependente foi o peso de nascimento, e as independentes as características maternas, gestacionais, do parto e do recém-nascido. Na avaliação da associação entre variáveis empregou-se teste de qui-quadrado e calculou-se valores de {{odds ratio}} brutos (OR) e ajustados (ORaj). A média do peso de nascimento foi 3. 142 g, variando de 285 a 5. 890 g; 65, 1 % das crianças pesaram 3. 000 g ou mais, 25, 7 % entre 2. 500 <b>e</b> 2. <b>999</b> g <b>e</b> 9, 1 % menos de 2. 500 g. Os determinantes para baixo peso em prematuros foram cesariana, gemelaridade, recém-nascidos femininos e os de mulheres com menos de sete consultas de pré-natal. Para crianças a termo os riscos foram gestação dupla, tripla ou mais, filhos de mulheres com mais de 34 anos, das com até sete anos de estudo, com oito a onze e das com menos de sete consultas de pré-natal. A distribuição de peso de nascimento em Campinas foi inadequada e a proporção de baixo peso foi mais que o dobro dos países desenvolvidos. Os recém-nascidos prematuros que nasceram por cesariana, os prematuros e os a termo de gestação múltipla, os femininos, os de mulheres com pré-natal inadequado e os a termo daquelas com maior idade e baixa escolaridade apresentaram maior chance de nascer com baixo peso. The distribution of birth weight was determined {{for children in}} Campinas, Brazil, and risk factors for low birth weight were assessed. A cross-sectional study was conducted using the variables from Live Birth Certificates in 2001. The dependent variable was birth weight and the independent ones were mothers' characteristics and those related to their pregnancies and to newborns. The association between variables was assessed by the chi-square test, crude odds-ratio (OR) and adjusted odds-ratio (ORadj) values. The mean birth weight was 3, 142 g, with a distribution varying from 285 to 5, 890 g, in which 65. 1 % of the children weighed 3, 000 g or more, 25. 7 % weighed from 2, 500 to 2, 999 g and 9. 1 % presented low birth weight. The determinants for low birth weight for premature babies were cesarean sections, twin babies, female babies and mothers having less than seven medical visits in prenatal care. For term babies, the risk for low birth weight was increased for twins, triplets or more, mother more than 34 years old, those who studied up to seven years, or 8 - 11 years, and mothers having less than seven medical visits in prenatal care. The {{results indicate that the}} distribution of birth weight in Campinas was inadequate and the proportion of low birth weight was more than two times higher than in developed countries. The likelihood for low birth weight was higher for premature babies born by C-sections, preterm and term babies from a multiple pregnancy, female babies, babies of mothers with inappropriate prenatal care and term babies of older mothers and with a low educational level...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Conhecer a evolução do peso ao nascer e a mortalidade {{hospital}}ar de nascidos vivos em maternidade de Campinas, SP. MÉTODOS: Foram estudados 215. 435 nascimentos ocorridos em maternidade do Município de Campinas, SP, de 1975 a 1996. As informações foram coletadas de livros de registro e relatórios de assistência médica. Foram analisados os óbitos ocorridos antes da alta hospitalar, independentemente da idade. Para a análise dos dados, utilizou-se o programa Epi Info 6. 01. RESULTADOS: O baixo peso se manteve próximo a 9 % desde os anos 70, concentrando 82 % dos óbitos hospitalares em 1996. O peso insuficiente foi observado em 24 % dos nascidos vivos. Em 1975, 13, 3 % dos nascidos com peso entre 1. 000 g e 1. 499 g sobreviveram e 73, 8 % dos nascidos com peso entre 1. 500 g <b>e</b> 1. <b>999</b> g. Em 1996, a sobrevida foi 69, 1 % e 87, 7 %, respectivamente. Houve grande diminuição do número de óbitos especialmente na faixa de 1. 000 g a 1. 499 g (de 867 para 309 por mil nascidos vivos, redução de 64, 5 %) e de 1. 500 g a 1. 999 g (de 264 para 123 por mil nascidos vivos, redução de 53, 4 %). A mortalidade hospitalar entre aqueles de peso abaixo de 1. 000 g permaneceu entre 78, 9 % e 100, 0 %, mesmo nos anos 90. Observou-se queda da mortalidade hospitalar de 17 para 11 por mil nascidos vivos. CONCLUSÕES: Não houve modificação na distribuição do peso ao nascer, a despeito deavanços apresentados por Campinas. Contudo, observou-se queda da mortalidade hospitalar. Outros estudos são necessários para compreender esse perfil. OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} trend of birth weight and hospital mortality rate of newborns, in a maternity hospital of Campinas, SP. METHODS: A total of 215, 435 births of a maternity hospital in Campinas, S. Paulo State, Brazil, was studied between 1976 and 1996. Information was collected from registration files and annual reports of medical care. All the newborns from that period were included. The causes of death that occurred before the discharge, regardless the age, were analyzed. For data analysis, Epi info 6. 01 method was used. RESULTS: Birth weight distribution remained {{the same for the}} 22 years period studied. Low birth weight was seen in about 9 % of newborns, and accounted for 82 % of hospital deaths in 1996. Below average weight was observed in about 24 % of the newborns. We could notice an improvement in survival for those who had a birth weight between 1, 000 g and 1, 999 g. In 1975, 13. 3 % of those with weights between 1, 000 g and 1, 499 g survived and 73. 8 % of those who weighed between 1, 500 g and 1, 999 g. In 1996, survival rates increased to 69. 1 % and 87. 7 % respectively. Hospital mortality rate among infants whose weight was below 1, 000 g remained high, between 78. 9 % and 100 %, even in the 90 's. There was a reduction of hospital mortality rates from 17 to 11 per thousand live births. CONCLUSIONS: There was not any change in the distribution of birth weight despite improvements in life conditions of Campinas population. The decrease in mortality rates is due to improvement in health care which is very expensive. There is a need of other studies to allow why birth weight distribution remained the same...|$|R

MÉTODOS: estudo de corte transversal, de 411 casos consecutivos de macrossomia fetal, ocorridos no período de março de 1998 a março de 2005. Compararam-se os dados obtidos aos de 7. 349 casos de fetos com peso entre 2. 500 <b>e</b> 3. <b>999</b> g ao nascimento, ocorridos no mesmo período. Foram analisadas variáveis maternas (idade, paridade, diabete melito, ocorrência de parto cesáreo, mecônio, desproporção feto-pélvica, principais indicações das cesáreas) e perinatais (ocorrência de tocotraumatismo, índice de Apgar {{inferior}} a sete no 1 º e 5 º minuto, natimortalidade, neomortalidade precoce, necessidade de internação na Unidade de Tratamento Intensivo Neonatal). As avaliações estatísticas foram realizadas com o teste não paramétrico do chi 2 com a correção de Yates e com o teste t de Student. Adotou-se o nível de significância de p PURPOSE: {{to identify}} maternal and perinatal {{factors related to}} neonates with birthweight > 4, 000 g. METHODS: cross-section cohort study with 411 consecutive cases of fetal macrosomia (FM) which occurred from March 1998 to March 2005. Data were compared to 7, 349 cases of fetal birthweight > 2, 500 and < 3, 999 g which occurred in the same period. Maternal variables (maternal age, parity, diabetes, previous cesarean section, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, cephalopelvic disproportion, main cesarean section indications) and perinatal variables (birth injury, < 7 1 -min and 5 -min Apgar score, fetal and early neonatal mortality range, need of neonatal intensive care unit) were analyzed. For statistical analysis the chi 2 test with Yates correction and Student's t test were used {{with the level of}} significance set at 5 %. RESULTS: FM was significantly associated with older mothers, more parous and < 7 1 -min Apgar score (p< 0. 05; OR= 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1, 4 - 2. 5) and < 7 5 -min Apgar score (p< 0, 05; OR= 2. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 4, 1), diabetes mellitus (p< 0. 05; OR= 4. 2; 95 % CI: 2. 7 - 6. 4), meconium-stained amniotic fluid (p< 0. 02; OR= 1. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 7), need of neonatal intensive care unit (p< 0, 05; OR= 2. 0; 95 % CI: 1. 5 - 2. 7), early neonatal mortality (p< 0, 05; OR = 2. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 6. 7), cesarean section (p < 0. 05; OR = 2. 03; 95 % CI: 1, 6 - 2, 5) and cephalopelvic disproportion (p < 0. 05;OR = 2. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 4, 8). There was no statistical difference between birth injury and fetal mortality range. In the FM group the main cesarean section indications were repeat cesarean sections (11. 9 %) and cephalopelvic disproportion (8. 6 %); in the normal birthweight group, repeat cesareans (8. 3 %) and fetal distress during labor (3. 9 %). CONCLUSIONS: in spite of the characteristic limitations of a retrospective evaluation, the analysis demonstrated which complications were associated with large fetal size, being useful in obstetric handling of patients with a diagnosis of extreme fetal growth. FM remains an obstetric problem of difficult solution, associated with important maternal and perinatal health problems, due to the significant observed rates of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in developed and developing countries...|$|R

OBJETIVO: Determinar a ocorrência de casos de tuberculose doença entre contatos intra-domiciliares de tuberculose multirresistente e tuberculose sensível. MÉTODO: Foi realizado um estudo caso-controle, sendo considerado tuberculose multirresistente o caso de portador de bacilo resistente a pelo menos rifampicina e isoniazida, e tuberculose sensível o caso que tivesse feito o primeiro tratamento num período semelhante ao primeiro tratamento do caso de tuberculose multirresistente, estando o paciente curado no momento da entrevista. Contato foi definido como o residente no domicílio do caso índice. Os casos foram selecionados a partir dos resultados dos testes de sensibilidade obtidos pelo método das proporções no Laboratório Central do Estado do Ceará, e os controles constituídos por pacientes bacilíferos registrados no Programa de Controle da Tuberculose, entre 1. 990 <b>e</b> 1. <b>999.</b> RESULTADOS: Foram avaliados 126 portadores de tuberculose multirresistente e 176 de tuberculose sensível. O número de contatos foi de 557 no grupo dos casos, 752 no grupo controle e a média de contatos por caso índice foi de 4, 42 e 4, 27 respectivamente. Entre os casos, 4, 49 % dos contatos (25 / 557) fizeram tratamento para tuberculose após os casos índices. Esse percentual foi de 5, 45 % (41 / 752) entre os controles (p = 0, 4468). Ocorreu micro-epidemia de tuberculose multirresistente confirmada por teste de sensibilidade em oito famílias. CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados deste estudo sugerem que a ocorrência de tratamentos de tuberculose gerados entre contatos intra-domiciliares de tuberculose sensível e tuberculose multirresistente é semelhante. BACKGROUND: Since {{the first}} years of antituberculosis chemotherapy, there has been {{controversy}} regarding the transmissibility, infectiousness, virulence and pathogenicity of susceptible and drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of active tuberculosis (TB) among individuals cohabiting with patients infected with susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). METHODS: A case-control study was conducted. Cases of MDR-TB were defined as those infected with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to at least rifampin and isoniazid. Susceptible TB cases (controls) were defined as those first treated at approximately {{the same time as the}} first treatment of the MDR-TB cases - and cured by the time of the interview. Study cases were selected on the basis of the results of susceptibility tests, using the proportion method, carried out at the Central Laboratory of Public Health of the State of Ceará. The control group consisted of patients enrolled in the Tuberculosis Control Program between 1990 and 1999. RESULTS: We evaluated 126 patients and 176 controls. The number of individuals sharing the household with patients was 557 in the MDR-TB group and 752 in the controls. The average number of exposed individuals per index case was 4. 42 and 4. 27 among patients and controls, respectively. Of the 557 MDR-TB-exposed individuals, 4. 49 % (25) received antituberculosis treatment after the respective index case had begun treatment, compared to 5. 45 % (41 / 752) among the controls (p = 0. 4468). Microepidemics of MDR-TB were confirmed in eight families. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the incidence of active TB is comparable between households inhabited by MDR-TB patients and those inhabited by susceptible-TB patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{establishment}} of the World Alliance for Patient Safety by the World Health Organization in 2004, results from the increased concern about patient safety, with the occurrence of errors being recognized as a major public health problem and a threat to quality of health care. Objective, material and methodsAlthough the Portuguese reality is not yet studied in a systematic way, {{it is possible to}} approach the problem through the study of secondary data sources. Thus, based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification (996 - <b>999,</b> <b>E</b> 870 -E 876 and E 878 - 879 subclasses), this research sought to know the extent of adverse events resulting from health care in Portuguese public hospitals, reported on the patient classification system Diagnosis Related Groups, during the year 2008. Results and discussionAdverse events occurred in 2. 5 % of the hospital admissions and mainly as secondary diagnosis. 2. 6 % of the men and 2. 4 % of the women were harmed by adverse events during inpatient care. The individuals with adverse events were on average five years older than the individuals without adverse events. The length of stay was on average 4. 14 times longer in the cases with adverse events when compared with the average length of stay in the remaining episodes. The costs related to adverse events totals about 4. 436 € per hospital admission, bearing in mind the cost per hospitalization day within the National Health Service. After hospital discharge, the destination to another institution was 2. 5 times more frequent among patients with adverse events, while the number of deaths was 2. 44 times higher in this group when compared with the remaining individuals. It was also possible to verify that patients impaired by adverse events went home less frequently than the other patients. Adverse events occurred more in the Centro of Portugal Region (3. 0 %) and less in the Alentejo Region (1. 7 %). ConclusionAdverse events seem to be related with longer length of stay, higher costs and higher mortality rates. Adverse events occurred mainly in older individuals and the difference between sex or region hospital was not substantial. The results of this study urgently requires a better knowledge of the real impact of adverse events in Portugal, namely through the Portuguese morbidity and mortality indicators...|$|R

40|$|Introdução: A qualidade da diálise oferecida aos pacientes em diálise pode ser mensurada pelo Kt/V, o qual pode ser calculado de diversas maneiras. Objetivo: Comparar os resultados de Kt/V obtidos por meio das fórmulas de Lowrie (L) e de Daugirdas (D) com os resultados mensurados pelo monitor de {{clearence}} on-line – Online Clearence Monitor (OCM). Método: Estudo observacional transversal com 59 pacientes em hemodiálise (HD). Os dados foram coletados na mesma sessão de diálise: (ureia pré-diálise e pós-diálise) e o resultado de Kt/V foi obtido pelo OCM da máquina Fresenius 4008 S (Fresenius Medical Care AG, Bad Homburg, Alemanha). Resultado: Foram analisadas 95 sessões, em que prevaleceu o sexo masculino, 56 % (33), com idade média de 57 + 14 anos. A hipertensão arterial com 42 % (25), diabetes com 12 % (7) e glomerulonefrite com 8 % (5) foram as causas mais frequentes da doença renal crônica (DRC). O Kt/V médio obtido pela fórmula de L, de D e pelo OCM foi de 1, 31; 1, 41 e 1, 32, respectivamente. A comparação entre as fórmulas de L e D mostra que há diferença estatística p = 0, 008 com a correlação de Pearson de 0, 950. Entre D e OCM a diferença também é significativa: p = 0, 011 e r = 0, 346, provavelmente devido a perda convectiva, avaliada pela equação de D e não observadas por OCM e L. A comparação entre L e OCM não foi significativa p = 0, <b>999</b> <b>e</b> r = 0, 577. Conclusão: Os dados sugerem que o OCM pode ser utilizado como um norteador para ajuste da dose de diálise em tempo real. Introduction: The {{quality of}} delivered dialysis {{can be measured}} by the Kt/V ratio, which can be calculated in various ways. Objective: To compare the Kt/V ratio obtained with the formulas of Lowrie (L) and Daugirdas (D) with the results measured by an Online Clearance Monitor (OCM). Method: Observational, cross-sectional study of 59 patients on hemodialysis (HD). Data were collected in the same dialysis session (predialysis and postdialysis urea) and Kt/V was calculated by the OCM of the Fresenius 4008 S machine (Fresenius Medical Care AG, Bad Homburg, Germany). Results: A total of 95 sessions were assessed, with a predominance of males 56 % (33), and a sample mean age of 57 + 14 years. Hypertension (42 %; n = 25), diabetes (12 %; n = 7) and glomerulonephritides (8 %; n = 5) were the most frequent causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Mean Kt/V values obtained with the L and D formulas and the OCM were 1. 31, 1. 41 and 1. 32, respectively. Comparison between the L and D formulas showed {{a statistically significant difference}} (p = 0. 008), with a Pearson`s correlation of 0. 950. The difference between the D formula and the OCM was also significant (p = 0. 011 and r = 0. 346), probably due to convective loss, estimated by the D formula but not by the OCM and L formula. The difference between the L formula and the OCM was not significant (p = 0. 999 and r = 0. 577). Conclusion: These data suggest that the OCM {{can be used as a}} guide to the real-time adjustment of the dialysis dose...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Analyses {{of causes}} of {{mortality}} {{in people with}} diabetes using data form death certificates mentioning diabetes provide unreliable estimates of mortality. Under-recording of diabetes as a cause on death certificates has been widely reported, ranging from 15 - 60 %. Using a population based register on people with diabetes and linking data from another source is a viable alternative. Data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) are the most acceptable mortality data available for such an exercise, as direct comparison with other published mortality rates is then possible. DESIGN [...] A locally maintained population-based mortality register and all insulin-treated diabetes mellitus cases notified to the Leicestershire diabetes register (n = 4680) were linked using record linkage software developed in-house (Lynx). This software has been extensively used in a maintenance and update cycle designed to maximise accuracy and minimise duplication and false registration on the diabetes register. Deaths identified were initially coded locally to the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th revision (ICD 9), and later a linkage was performed to use official OPCS coding. Mortality data identified by the linkage was indirectly standardised using population data for Leicestershire for 1991. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated, with 95 % confidence intervals. Insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM) was defined as diabetes diagnosed before age 30 years with insulin therapy begun within one year of diagnosis. All other types were considered non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM). Analyses were performed for the whole sample and then for the NIDDM subgroup. Results from these analyses were similar and therefore only whole group analyses are presented. MAIN RESULTS [...] A total of 370 deaths were identified {{for the period of}} 1990 - 92 inclusive - 56 % were in men and 44 % in women, median age (range) 71 years (12 - 94). Approximately 90 % of deaths were subjects with NIDDM. Diabetes was mentioned on 215 (58 %) death certificates. The all causes SMRs were significantly raised for men and women for all ages less than 75 years. Ischaemic heart disease (ICD 9) rubrics 410 - 414) accounted for 146 (40 %) deaths - 41 % of male and 38 % of female deaths. Male and female SMRs were significantly raised for the age groups 45 - 64, 65 - 74, and 75 - 84 years. Cerebrovascular disease (ICD 9 rubrics 430 - 438) accounted for 39 (10 %) deaths and the SMR for women the external causes of death (ICD 9 rubrics <b>E</b> 800 -E <b>999)</b> were also significantly raised overall and in age groups 15 - 44 and 45 - 64 years. This was not true for men, although numbers of deaths in this category were small for both men (4) and women (9). CONCLUSION [...] Record linkage has been used successfully to link two local, population based registers. This has enabled an analysis of mortality in people with diabetes to be performed which overcomes the problems associated with using as a sample, death certificates where diabetes is mentioned. The mortality rates and SMRs estimated should more accurately reflect the true rates than would be possible using other methods. The persisting excess mortality identified for people with diabetes is of a similar magnitude and attributable to similar causes as has been reported elsewhere in population based studies...|$|R
40|$|Objetivo: Avaliar o músculo {{masseter}} em indivíduos portadores de esclerose sistêmica (ES), por meio da ressonância magnética, analisando a intensidade dos sinais em T 1, T 2 e a morfologia. Detectar, por meio da espectroscopia de hidrogênio, as alterações das concentrações de creatina, colina, lipídio e lactato no masseter, e relacionar com a presença de osteólise mandibular. Investigar as relações entre a osteólise mandibular com alguns parâmetros clínicos. Métodos: Foram selecionados 25 pacientes, 15 com diagnóstico de ES e 10 indivíduos normais: os pacientes com foram agrupados de acordo com a presença (grupo I) ou ausência (grupo II) de osteólise de mandíbula. Os indivíduos normais perfizeram o controle (grupo III). Todos foram submetidos a exame de ressonância magnética, em aparelho Siemens modelo Sonata®, com campo magnético de 1, 5 T e gradiente de 40 mT, onde foram adquiridas seqüências TSE ponderadas em T 2 no plano coronal e T 1 no plano axial, com e sem supressão de gordura; a concentração dos me tabólitos foi avaliada pela espectroscopia de prótons com técnica PRESS e aquisição tridimensional. Resultados: Não houve diferença entre o sinal T 1 de RM nos grupos I e II (p= 0, 295). O grupo II apresentou maior intensidade do sinal T 2 em relação ao grupo III (p= 0, 033), porém não houve diferença em relação ao grupo I. O estudo dos metabólitos dos três grupos apresentou os mesmos valores absolutos de creatina (p= 0, 424) e lipídio (p= 0, 966), enquanto que os pacientes do grupo I apresentar am maior quantidade de colina em relação ao grupo III (p= 0, 108). Já os grupos I e II apresentaram menor quantidade de lactato em relação aos indivíduos normais (p= 0, 001). Os índices creatina/ lipídio (p= 0, 314) e colina/ lactato (p= 0, 790) foram estatisticamente os mesmos em todos os grupos. Por outro lado, os demais índices mostraram variações significantes, a saber: creatina/ colina (p 0, <b>999),</b> <b>e</b> entre a presença de dentes e o lado da osteólise (p= 0, 143). Conclusão: O masseter está afetado nos pacientes com ES, independente da presença ou não da osteólise. Em relação aos metabólitos, observamos menor quantidade de lactato, enquanto que a colina mostrou-se aumentada na osteólise. A osteólise parece se desenvolver em pacientes com maior tempo de doença, porém não modificou no grau de abertura bucal em relação aos pacientes sem osteólise, e a presença de dentes não foi significante. Por outro lado, nos casos de osteólise, quanto maior o tempo de doença maior a abertura bucal. Objective: {{to evaluate}} the masseter muscle in systemic sclerosis (SS) patients by magnetic resonance (MR), regarding the intensity of T 1 and T 2 tissue signal and the morphology; to detect, by the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the abnormalities of the creatine, choline, lipids and lactate’s concentration in the masseter, and correlate with the mandibular osteolysis; to investigate the correlations of the mandibular osteolysis with some clinical findings. Methods: 25 subjects were selected, 15 with PSS diagnosis and 10 healthy controls. The patients were gathered in concordance with the presence (group I) or absence (group II) of the mandibular osteolysis. The healthy subjects performed the control (group III). All of them were submitted of the magnetic resonance scan, on a 1, 5 T MR imager Siemens Sonata®, 40 mT gradient, and images were obtained in T 2 coronal scans and T 1 axial scan, with and without fat suppression technique. The metabolits concentration were evaluated by the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with PRESS technique and tridimensional acquisition. Results: the study showed no difference between MR T 1 signal in the groups I and II (p= 0, 295). The group II showed increased of MR T 2 signal regarding group III (p= 0, 033), {{but there was no}} difference by group I. The metabolic study of the three groups showed the same absolute values of the creatine (p= 0, 424) and lipids (p= 0, 966), whereas the group I subjects showed high content of choline regarding the group III (p= 0, 108). The groups I and II showed low content f the lactate regarding the healthy subjects (p= 0, 001). The creatine/lipid ratio (p= 0, 314) and choline/lactate ratio (p= 0, 790) were the same in all groups. Otherwise, the others ratios showed variations: creatine/choline (p 0, 999), and among the absence of the teeth and side of the osteolysis (p= 0, 143). Conclusions: the masseter was affected in SS patients, and it no depends of the osteolysis. Regarding the metabolic changes, we observed low concentration of lactate and high concentration of choline in osteolysis’ patients. The osteolysis seems to develop in more duration of disease patient, but did not modified the mouth opening regarding patients without osteolysis, and the presence of the teeth was not signified. Otherwise, in the osteolysis subjects, we observed that if more duration of disease, more mouth opening. BV UNIFESP: Teses e dissertaçõe...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the protective effects of L-alanyl-Glutamine (L-ALN-GLN) through the immunohistochemical detection of proinflammatory mediators (IL- 6, TNF&# 61537;, NF-kB e HO- 1). This {{was achieved by}} means of a experimental and controlled study. Fifty-four male gerbils with a mean weight of 150 g were used. They were divided randomly and equally into 3 groups: saline with ischemia and reperfusion (SIR), saline without ischemia and reperfusion (SSI) and with L-alanyl-glutamine and with ischemia and reperfusion (GIR). They were then redistributed into three subgroups according to time: T 0 (maximum time of ischemia), T 30 (30 minutes of reperfusion) and T 60 (60 minutes of reperfusion), containing 6 animals each. They were pretreated with saline 2. 0 mL 0, 9 % intra-venously (iv) or L-ALN-GLN 0. 75 % G/KG (IV) 30 min {{before the start of the}} experiments. Cerebral ischemia was performed by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (CCAs) for a period of 15 minutes. After all surgical procedures and at the end of the three time periods the animals were sacrificed and brain tissue samples immediately obtained, which were fixed in 10 % formalin solution for 24 hours in order being duly processed prior paraffin embedding. The samples (brain tissue) were collected at the end of each time periods. After this and through using a microtome, tissue sections were made at 4 microns and then placed on glass slides covered with L-polylysine, a proper way for performing immunohistochemistry. The streptavivin-biotin-peroxidase method was used. The quantitative analysis was made by means of counting immunocytochemically-stained cells, both neurons and glial cells, as observed at 400 X magnification under an optical microscope Olympus model BX 41. Ten fields were observed for each section, with a total of 4 sections per sub-group, always at start, looking for the internal pyramidal layer. Comparing the groups (SSI) and (SIR) a significant increase in NFkB-labeled cells in the subgroup SIR T 30 (238, 25 Â 218, 437 versus 1234, 75 Â 144, 857); p= 0, 001 and SIR T 60 (586, 50 Â 141, 210 versus 1286, 25 Â 84, 968); p= 0, 002 was observed. There was also a significant increase in the (SIR) subgroup, of the TNF&# 61537; immunostaining at T 30 and T 60 (263, 75 Â 42, 906 versus 1015, 50 Â 102, 796); p= 0, 01 in comparison to the SSI group. Regarding the cells expressing IL- 6 positive labeling, comparing the groups (SIR) and (GIR), it was observed a significant decrease at T 30 and T 60 in the GIR group (536, 25 Â 119, 837 versus 9, 00 Â 18, 000); p= 0, 033. Comparing the groups (SIR) and (GIR), in relation to the NFkB immunolabeling, there was a significant decrease in group T 30 in the GIR group (1234, 75 Â 144, 857 versus 247, 50 Â 495); p= 0, 001 as well as at T 60 (1286, 25 Â 84, 968 versus 217, 75 Â 435, 500); p= 0, 001. There was also a significant decrease, comparing the groups (SIR) and (GIR), of the TNF&# 61537; expression in (GIR) group at all time periods, chiefly at T 60 (1015, 50 Â 102, 796 versus 3, 50 Â 7, 000); p= 0, 001. Regarding the immunostaining of the enzyme HO- 1, there has been, comparing the groups (SSI) and (SIR), a significant decrease in the expression of this anti-oxidant protein in the SIR group. In the contrary, comparing the groups SIR and GIR, a substantial and significant expression of HO- 1 was documented in the group treated previously by the L-alanil-glutamina, at times T 30 and T 60. In conclusion, the prior administration of L-alanil-glutamina in experiments of ischemia-reperfusion in Gerbils, disclosed a protective outcome, by promoting an in situ reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF&# 61537; and IL- 6) and nuclear transcription factor NFkB. At the same time, there has been an increase in the induction of the expression of the anti-oxidative enzyme HO- 1, supporting a protective role of this preconditioning agent, chiefly against the inflammatory-oxidative stress. caused by the ischemia reperfusion brain injury model, in GerbilsFoi investigado o efeito da administraÃÃo prÃvia de L-alanil-glutamina (L-ALN-GLN) nas lesÃes de isquemia e reperfusÃo em cÃrebros de gerbils atravÃs da detecÃÃo imunohistoquÃmica da expressÃo de mediadores prÃ-inflamatÃrios e da defesa anti-oxidante (IL- 6, TNF&# 61537;, NF-kB e HO- 1). Trata-se de um estudo experimental, controlado, utilizando 54 gerbils machos, com peso mÃdio de 150 g, distribuÃdos aleatoriamente em 3 grupos: salina sem isquemia e reperfusÃo (SSI), salina com isquemia e reperfusÃo (SIR), L-alanil-glutamina com isquemia e reperfusÃo (GIR), redistribuÃdos em 3 subgrupos: T 0 (tempo mÃximo de isquemia), T 30 (30 min de reperfusÃo) e T 60 (60 min de reperfusÃo), com 6 animais por subgrupo. Foram prÃ-tratados com soluÃÃo salina 2, 0 mL 0, 9 % via endovenosa (e. v.) ou L-ALN-GLN 0, 75 g/Kg (e. v.), 30 min antes do inÃcio dos experimentos. A isquemia cerebral foi induzida pela oclusÃo bilateral das artÃrias carÃtidas comuns (ACCs), por um perÃodo de 15 minutos. ApÃs todos os procedimentos cirÃrgicos e ao final dos trÃs tempos 0, 30, 60 minutos, os animais foram sacrificados e tiveram os tecidos cerebrais removidos e fixados em formol a 10 % por 24 horas, a fim de serem devidamente processados para inclusÃo em parafina. ApÃs esse procedimento, foram feitos cortes de 4 Âm em micrÃtomo e colocados em lÃminas de L-polilisina, apropriadas para a realizaÃÃo da imunohistoquÃmica. Foi utilizado o mÃtodo de estreptavidina-biotina-peroxidase. A avaliaÃÃo quantitativa foi feita por meio da contagem das cÃlulas nervosas imunomarcadas, tanto neurÃnios quanto cÃlulas da neuroglia, observadas com aumento de 400 X em microscÃpio Ãptico modelo Olympus BX 41. Foram observados dez campos de cada corte, com um total de 4 cortes por subgrupo, procurando-se sempre iniciar pela camada piramidal interna. Nas comparaÃÃes entre os grupos (SSI) e (SIR) houve um aumento significante nas cÃlulas NFkB-posittivas no grupo SIR nos tempos T 30 (238, 3 Â 218, 4 versus 1234, 8 Â 144, 9); p= 0, 000 e T 60 (586, 5 Â 141, 2 versus 1286, 3 Â 85, 0); p= 0, 000. Verificou-se tambÃm um aumento significante do TN&# 61537; no grupo SIR nos tempos T 30 (214, 0 Â 17, 3 versus 333, 0 Â 395, 6); p= 0, <b>999</b> <b>e</b> fortemente, em T 60 (263, 8 Â 42, 9 versus 1015, 5 Â 102, 8); p= 0, 00 e observou-se um aumento significante da IL- 6 no tempo T 60 no grupo SIR em comparaÃÃo ao grupo SSI, (206, 8 Â 248, 3 versus 316, 0 Â 365, 4); p= 0, 999. Entretanto, as cÃlulas marcadas pela HO- 1, no grupo SIR, comparativamente ao grupo SSI, diminuÃram significativamente nos tempos T 30 (25, 8 Â 3, 9 versus 11, 3 Â 13, 0) p= 1, 000 e T 60 (18, 5 Â 7, 6 versus 9, 8 Â 13, 7) p= 1, 000. Para as cÃlulas expressando marcaÃÃo para as citocinas IL- 6 em T 0 (311, 0 Â 246, 5 versus 14, 8 Â 29, 5); p= 0, 817. T 30 (536, 3 Â 119, 8 versus 9, 0, 3 Â 18, 0); p= 0, 033.

E TNF&# 61537; em T 0 (30, 3 Â 36, 0 versus 3, 5 Â 7, 0); p= 1, 000 e T 30 (333, 0 Â 395, 6 versus 3, 5 Â 7, 0); p= 0, 503, T 60 (1015, 5 Â 102, 8 versus 3, 5 Â 7, 0); p= 0, 000 comparando-se os grupos (SIR) e (GIR), observou-se uma diminuiÃÃo significante, em todos os tempos, no grupo GIR, contrariamente Ã imunomarcaÃÃo da HO- 1, que aumentou significativamente no grupo (GIR) tratado pela L-alanil-glutamina em T 0 (32, 5 Â 9, 7 versus 0, 0 + 0, 0); p= 1, 000. T 30 (11, 3 Â 13, 0 versus 6, 8 Â 13, 5); p= 1, 000 e T 60 (9, 8 Â 13, 7 versus 7, 5 Â 15, 0); p= 1, 000. Nas comparaÃÃes entre os grupos (SIR) e (GIR), em relaÃÃo ao NFkB, houve uma diminuiÃÃo significante no grupo GIR em T 30 (1234, 8 Â 144, 9 versus 247, 5 Â 495, 0); p= 0, 000 e T 60 (1286, 3 Â 85 versus 217, 8 Â 435, 5); p= 0, 000. Em conclusÃo, a administraÃÃo prÃvia de L-alanil-glutamina, no presente experimento de isquemia/reperfusÃo cerebral, em gerbils, revelou efeito protetor da mesma, ao promover reduÃÃo in situ na expressÃo de citocinas e fator de transcriÃÃo de genes prÃ-inflamatÃrios: TNF&# 61537;, IL- 6 e NFkB. Concomitantemente, houve induÃÃo aumentada da expressÃo da enzima antioxidante HO- 1, corroborando a aÃÃo protetora deste nutracÃutico na injÃria de isquemia/reperfusÃo, mormente do estresse inflamatÃrio-oxidativo, em gerbil...|$|R
