5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling {{for an end to}} lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver as a threat to the conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E
25|$|Of all the Founding Fathers, it was Thomas Jefferson {{for whom}} the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> loomed largest.

25|$|By {{the time}} of the early 1970s, the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> began to {{dominate}} all others and the regime started to repress its white opponents. By 1975, although officially democratic, the regime had started to lock up even peaceful opponents of white domination. Black Rhodesians regarded their legal situation as morally unjustifiable and wanted full equality. From August 1964 to December 1974, Robert Mugabe was imprisoned without trial. Although legal, it was emblematic of a regime that disregarded human rights as part of its fight against terrorism.|$|E

25|$|The Fiji Labour Party {{formed an}} electoral {{alliance}} with the Party of National Unity (PANU) and United Peoples Party (UPP) of Mick Beddoes to contest the 2006 general elections. The SDL Party of Prime Minister Qarase had joined a grand coalition of ethnic Fijian parties to unite the indigenous Fijian vote. During the election, the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> was again raised and this galvanised Fijian support behind Qarase. Although the FLP increased its share of votes to 39% and won four more seats to make a total of 31, it was unable to unseat the Qarase Government.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Toronto Police {{were under}} {{scrutiny}} for the fatal shooting of schizophrenic Lester Donaldson. The shooting {{was the first}} of eight over the next four years, and the latest in series of shootings since the late 1970s, in which mostly unarmed Black Canadians were victims. Three days after his death, the Black Action Defence Committee, a group of local activists, was formed. The group made headlines when they introduced the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> in the coroner's inquest into Donaldson's killing. In 1990, Toronto police officer David Deviney was charged with manslaughter in connection with the killing, though he was later acquitted.|$|E
25|$|A Pew Research poll {{conducted}} August 14–17 among 1,000 adults, found stark racial and political divisions in {{reactions to the}} shooting. By about four-to-one, African Americans (80% to 18%) said the shooting raised important issues about race, while whites, by 47% to 37%, said the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> is getting more attention than it deserves. The divide in public opinion was also observed across partisan lines, with 68% of Democrats (including 62% of white Democrats) believing the incident raises important issues about race that merit discussion, compared with 40% of Independents and 22% of Republicans. Republicans {{were also more likely}} than Democrats to view the police response as appropriate (43%), compared with 21% of Democrats; 65% of Republicans expressed confidence in the investigations into the incident, compared with 38% of Democrats.|$|E

The duality of their relationship is expressed not only in skin color but through their personalities. Laura, blond and passionate, contrasts with Tris, who is dark but emotionally detached. Race, in this instance, is a [...] "metaphor for the opposition between inside and outside that govern Bannon's sense of what a lesbian is".|$|E
500|$|A central {{division}} {{within the}} Heathen movement concerns the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race.</b> Some groups adopt a [...] "universalist" [...] perspective {{which holds that}} the religion is open to all, irrespective of ethnic or racial identity, while conversely, others adopt a racialist attitude—termed [...] "folkish" [...] within the community—by viewing Heathenry as a religion with inherent links to a Germanic race that should be reserved explicitly for people of Northern European descent. Some folkish Heathens further combine the religion with explicitly racist and white supremacist perspectives. Although the term [...] "Heathenry" [...] is used widely to describe the religion as a whole, many groups prefer different forms of designation, influenced by their regional focus and their attitude to race. While some groups venerating Scandinavian deities use Ásatrú or Forn Sed, those adopting folkish perspectives tend to favor the terms Odinism, Wotanism, or Odalism.|$|E

500|$|... "The Natural Order" [...] is one {{of several}} 30 Rock episodes to deal with race. In this episode, when Tracy leaves the first {{rehearsal}} accusing Liz of racism he shouts [...] "race card!" [...] and hands Liz a card with [...] "race card" [...] written on it ("playing the race card" [...] is an expression that means introducing the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> into an argument in order to gain the upper hand). During their disagreement Tracy also says that [...] "we have a black president now", referring to Barack Obama, but Liz says that he voted for Ralph Nader. According to J. Jeremy Wisnewski in [...] "Race At The Rock: Race Cards, White Myths, And Postracial America", this plotline is an example of people [...] "want to have race and do away with it too." [...] Tracy wants to be treated equally but also wants to continue behaving the way he is used to. Wisnewski says {{that by the end of}} the episode, Liz and Tracy, in reverting to [...] "the natural order", have come to understand the concept of equality; rather than forcing people [...] "to be equivalent to one another ... considering the different interests of people equally." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilmore {{participated in}} his second debate on May 15 in South Carolina {{broadcast}} by Fox News. His first question concerned the perceived growing threat of a nuclear armed Iran. Gilmore thanked the questioner {{on the basis that}} he believed the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] should be looked at beyond Iraq. He stated that as president he would join with American allies to put [...] "serious mandatory sanctions" [...] on the regime to let them know [...] "that it is better for them to give up this sort of plan (Nuclear proliferation)." [...] After receiving a question about Social Security, Gilmore changed the subject to address his record of cutting taxes as Governor of Virginia. He would later attack fellow candidates: Rudy Giuliani for his pro-choice positions, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for his record on taxes, and Mitt Romney for his position on health care. When asked about potential terrorist attacks, Gilmore reminded the audience that he was governor when The Pentagon was attacked on 9/11 and that he has [...] "the experience to deal with these issues." [...] At the end of the debate, Gilmore addressed the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> when asked why no minorities where present on the stage running for the presidency, he reacted to this question by declaring that the Republican Party has [...] "people that are prepared to [...] in the immediate future". He also cited his own credentials on race stating that as attorney general of Virginia he faced the issue when he {{had to deal with the}} burning of African-American churches, which gave him a good standing with the African-American community in his own judgment.|$|E
500|$|Julia Ward AOL's TV Squad {{said that}} while the episode [...] "delivered plenty of funny" [...] it [...] "seemed a bit off-kilter. It had fewer laughs-per-minute than the past few episodes, and structurally, I think the writers couldn't decide which story to foreground." [...] She complimented the series for having [...] "an {{interesting}} take" [...] on the hip-hop satire that was featured in [...] "The Source Awards". [...] "From where I sit, it's got to be in the top five, if not three", said TV Guides Matt Mitovich in regards to this episode. Mitovich noted, [...] "...I can only bow with great reverence to the effort that goes into 30 Rock, where in an episode like this week's, every other line is funny and/or fantastically absurd." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning opined than an episode like this one, with its guest stars and taking on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> got [...] "some decent laughs", though it [...] "failed to produce a solid half hour." [...] Canning disliked LL Cool J's guest spot, observing that it was [...] "nothing more than a generic caricature put in the role of a sub-par straight man", but enjoyed Wayne Brady's, as he was [...] "a successful part of the episode's best storyline." [...] Canning said that Tracy as Oprah was [...] "more weird than funny, unfortunately", but liked that Jason Sudeikis made a brief appearance as [...] "Flower Guy" [...] in the episode. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. Mekeisha Madden Toby for The Detroit News found the episode a [...] "side-splitter".|$|E

50|$|The first {{message is}} that “race tends to be {{depicted}} as separate, singular that is relevant only under certain circumstances”. It is simultaneously being concealed as something that has previously been written in institutions. When we discuss race, it often seems to demonstrate an identity that is fixed with comparatively predictable outcomes on one’s outlook or actions. <b>Issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> are also usually constrained to practice and “professional” settings. She suggests that displaying race as a central element in an organization can help by incorporating <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>race</b> within foundational texts.|$|R

2500|$|The BNP often {{received}} a hostile response from other {{sections of the}} British extreme-right. Some extreme-right-wingers, such as the British Freedom Party, expressed frustration at the party's inability to moderate itself further on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>race,</b> while those such as Colin Jordan and the NF accused the BNP—particularly under Griffin's leadership—of being too moderate. This latter view was articulated by an extreme-right groupuscule, the International Third Position, when it claimed that the BNP [...] "has been openly courting the Jewish vote and pumping out material which confirms what most us knew years ago: the BNP has become a multi-racist, Zionist, queer-tolerant anti-Muslim pressure group".|$|E
