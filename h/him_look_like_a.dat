Some of Cole's clothing was changed to suit the new setting of the game. Eric Ladin was also brought in to replace Jason Cottle as the voice of Cole because Sucker Punch felt that they needed someone who could perform Cole's physical reactions as well as his voice with the use of their new motion capture technology.|$|E

Funk, {{it is the}} Jewish elders who {{are to blame for}} Jesus' crucifixion. Augustine of Hippo says that Pilate was not free from blame, since he exercised his power to execute Jesus. The Jewish elders ask the Roman governor Pontius Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus, accusing him of claiming to be the King of the Jews. The use of the word [...] "king" [...] is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate. In [...] Jesus states, [...] "My kingdom is not from this world", but he does not unequivocally deny being the King of the Jews. In [...] Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean, and thus comes under the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea.

500|$|Before any {{director}} {{was attached to}} Hard Target, Universal Pictures saw the film as a potential vehicle for actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme had already been {{a huge fan of}} Woo's films and arranged to meet with him in Hong Kong where the two got along despite both Woo and Van Damme's difficulty with their English. Woo originally wanted actor Kurt Russell for the lead role, but found Russell to be booked for two years with other film projects. On working with Van Damme, Woo stated that he was [...] "sure of [...] abilities and I know how to make an actor look good on screen, make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hero. I thought I could do the same for Van Damme". Despite early misgivings of working with Van Damme, Woo changed many action scenes in the film to make them more spectacular on finding that Van Damme was up for it. While working with Van Damme, Woo stated that Van Damme had [...] "a pretty big ego, but he's still professional and always tries to do a good job." [...] Woo had some control over the film's casting including casting minor characters and finding a cinematographer. Actress Yancy Butler was cast as Natasha Binder in her feature film debut. The role led Butler to other starring roles in action films such as Drop Zone [...] and Fast Money. Actor Lance Henriksen accepted the role of Emil Fouchon stating he was a great fan of Woo, noting that his earlier films [...] "were so creative, so balletic, and had this incredible philosophy in them.

However, Socrates tells Theaetetus in his namesake dialogue that he admires Prodicus and has directed many pupils to him.

2500|$|As {{with their}} batting Australia could muster {{a strong and}} varied bowling attack; Garth McKenzie (29.78), Dennis Lillee (23.92), Alan Connolly (29.22), Ashley Mallett (29.84), John Gleeson (36.20) and Terry Jenner (31.20) with all-rounders Doug Walters (29.08), Kerry O'Keeffe (38.20) and Greg Chappell (40.70). Unfortunately, they were seldom {{given the chance to}} settle into the team and only Gleeson of the regular bowlers played in five Tests. Garth McKenzie had been Australia's premier fast bowler in the 1960s, but had failed spectacularly in South Africa (averaging 333.00), was struck in the face by a John Snow bouncer at Sydney and retired from Test cricket to play for Ray Illingworth's Leicestershire as a professional. Alan Connolly had been a fast bowler in his youth, but slowed his pace to {{increase}} his accuracy and became a reliable support bowler. Alan Thomson - [...] "Froggie" [...] Thomson - was a fast-medium paceman with a [...] "strange, whirlwind, running-through sort of action" [...] in which he loosed the ball while both feet were in the air. He was a non-smoking, non-drinking, physical education teacher whose shaggy red hair make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 'Wild Man of Borneo'. He frequently bounced the England batsmen, took 6/80 against the MCC for Victoria and was called up for the First Test. 'He can't last' predicted Richard Whitington, 'He doesn't even know where he's aiming', and he averaged 54.50 in the Tests. John Gleeson was a mystery bowler who used his bent middle finger to turn the ball either way, but lost control in search of variation and was punished by the England batsmen once they figured out his action. The more orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply and took 28 wickets (19.10) in India in 1969-70. Tom Graveney thought he was the finest Australian off-spinner since the war and he became the spinning arm of Ian Chappell's all-conquering Australians. Historically Australian selectors always preferred a leg-spinner and Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner vied for the place, but they never quite fulfilled their promise. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The greatest Australian bowler of the next decade would be Dennis Lillee, but in 1970 he was a raw, undisciplined fast bowler who had yet to reach his full potential.|$|E
