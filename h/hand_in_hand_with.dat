5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{the increasing use of}} hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century brass bands had a poor {{relationship}} with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{being a member of}} a band. This changed {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and as well as becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two of the more well known brass bands from the Rhondda both started as temperance bands. The more famous, Cory Band from Ton Pentre, started life as Ton Temperance in 1884; while local rivals The Parc and Dare Band were the Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band.|$|E

5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations goes <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months of}} {{pre-production}} {{were required to}} create hundreds of shields, spears, and swords, {{some of which were}} recycled from Troy and Alexander. Creatures were designed by Jordu Schell, and an animatronic wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers. Shaun Smith and Mark Rappaport worked <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> Snyder in pre-production to design the look of the individual characters, and to produce the prosthetic makeup effects, props, weapons and dummy bodies required for the production.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E

25|$|Timber {{has also}} {{long been a}} major industry, {{although}} in recent {{years there has been}} an uneasy balance between forestry for wood and forestry for conservation.

25|$|To further those ends {{he founded}} and edited a journal, Labour World, in September 1890, then {{initiated}} in January 1891 in Cork the Irish Democratic Labour Federation, an organisation which adopted an advanced social programme including proposals for free education, land settlement, worker housing, reduced working hours, labour political representation and universal suffrage. The Federation reflected his conviction, {{to which he}} adhered to all his life, that farmers' land proprietorship must go <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> land nationalisation.|$|E
30|$|These {{observations}} {{fit with}} a broader theme in economic history which argues that {{economic and political}} competition are key complements via the forces unleashed in “open access” orders (North et al. 2009).

2500|$|Two {{different}} endings {{were written}} by Bolt.

25|$|However, the fervour of republicanism tailed {{off in the}} 1890s as {{the labour}} {{movement}} became concerned with the federation of Australia. The republican movement dwindled further during and after World War I. Emotionally, patriotic {{support for the war}} effort went <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> a renewal of loyalty to the monarchy. The Bulletin abandoned republicanism and became a conservative, Empire loyalist paper. The Returned and Services League formed in 1916 and became an important bastion of monarchist sentiment.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{dominant}} process of layering is fractional crystallisation, layering can also {{result in a}} magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks. This will tend to increase the silica content of the melt, which will eventually prompt a mineral to reach the liquidus for that magma composition. Note also that assimilation of wall rocks takes considerable thermal energy, so this process goes <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the natural cooling of the magma body. Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry.|$|E

50|$|Shakespeare’s soliloquies {{are written}} in blank verse of unparalleled variety, {{invention}} and rhythmic flexibility, suggestive of the rapidly changing moods of their speakers. Often, it is through vivid and memorable imagery that an individual registers his unique take on the world: Hamlet’s perception of Elsinore as ‘an unweeded garden that grows to seed’, the frantically deluded Leontes who feels he has ‘drunk and seen the spider’, the self-dramatising murderer, Othello ‘Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse’ or Antony’s transcendent vision of his afterlife with Cleopatra: ‘Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> And <b>with</b> our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze’.|$|R
25|$|English individualism {{developed}} <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> legal equality. American self-reliance, on {{the other}} hand, has been inseparable from an insistence upon economic and social {{as well as political}} equality. The result is that a qualified individualism, with a qualified equality, has prevailed in England, but what has been considered the unalienable right of every American is unrestricted self-reliance and, at least ideally, unrestricted equality. The English, therefore, tend to respect class-based distinctions in birth, wealth, status, manners, and speech, while Americans resent them.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First Mafia War in 1962-63 and the Ciaculli Massacre that prompted the first concerted Antimafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy, Genco Russo was among the many mafiosi arrested (on February 6, 1964, when he turned himself in). He was often seen with DC deputy for Sicily, Calogero Volpe , and the future Minister of Public Works, Antonino Gullotti , was photographed <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> Genco Russo at the time when he was secretary for the DC in Sicily.

25|$|Kristi N. Scott and M. Heather Dragoo {{note that}} another {{recurring}} {{theme in the}} “image-obsessed society,” is beauty, and its recurring relationship with individuality. Gough agreed, commenting that “when everyone is equal, beauty loses its meaning”. Beauty went <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> identity: Uglies were taught to think of their bodies and faces as “temporary”, {{something that would be}} replaced later with cosmetic surgery.
