In addition to a new Batwoman series, DC released Voodoo, which featured an African American bisexual woman as the title character. Additionally, The New 52 also introduced Bunker, the first openly-gay superhero ever to be featured in the Teen Titans ongoing series. Another of the changes brought about with the DC reboot was the reinvention of a classic character as an out <b>gay</b> <b>man,</b> with DC as of 2012 depicting its longtime Green Lantern Alan Scott as a <b>gay</b> <b>man</b> in stories set on the parallel world of Earth-2.|$|E
5|$|Police {{issued a}} {{statement}} declaring that they were searching for two men whom Chambers had observed at Williamson's apartment prior to his death. Corporal Devon Hugh Williams of the Constabulary Communication Network (CCN) informed press that the police suspected that the motive of the attack had been robbery, as evidence pointing {{to the fact that}} Williamson's apartment had been ransacked and a safe removed. However, both friends of Williamson and human rights organisations suggested that – given Williamson's status as an openly <b>gay</b> <b>man</b> – robbery might have been a secondary issue, with homophobia being the main motive behind the crime.|$|E

2500|$|Comparing the {{happiness}} of homosexuals to that of heterosexuals, Bell and Weinberg found that while [...] "close coupled" [...] <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> reported more happiness than straight men, [...] "asexual" [...] and [...] "dysfunctional" [...] <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> were less happy on average than straight men. 20 per cent of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> had attempted suicide, and another 20 per cent had seriously considered suicide.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that discrimination directed toward <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> from some heterosexual men is partially driven by heterosexual men attempting {{to distance themselves from}} gay men’s perceived femininity. There is also evidence that many <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> wish they were more masculine than they currently are and will distance themselves from other <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> perceived as being feminine. This persisting stereotype that <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> are insufficiently masculine was theorized to lead <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> to be vulnerable to threats to their masculinity so that they would react to such threats by distancing themselves from feminine-stereotyped <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and by attempting to present themselves as more masculine. The current study subjected 58 Italian <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> (mean age of 29. 10 years, SD = 8. 25) to either a threat or an affirmation of their masculinity, and observed reactions to vignettes describing masculine- and feminine-stereotyped <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> It was hypothesized that those subjected to a threat to their masculinity would report less liking for, less comfort with, and less desire to interact with feminine <b>gay</b> <b>men,</b> while reporting greater similarity to masculine <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> These hypotheses were partially supported: participants who were threatened in their masculinity reported being more similar to masculine <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> (η 2 =. 09), and showed less interest in interacting with feminine <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> (η 2 =. 09) than participants whose masculinity was affirmed. These findings suggest that, {{despite the fact that they}} are often stereotyped as feminine, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> may still feel pressure to conform to masculine role norms.

Dayse tires of being Wellington's mistress and tells Dunga about the relationship.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who {{began his career as a}} charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly <b>gay</b> <b>man</b> to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|People {{often are}} members of {{multiple}} communities, and which community {{they want to be}} most closely associated with may vary. [...] For some <b>gay</b> <b>men,</b> the primary self-categorization is their identity as <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> [...] To achieve recognition as such, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> may recognize and imitate forms of language that reflect the social identity of <b>gay</b> <b>men,</b> or which are stereotypically considered to be characteristic to <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> [...] For example, the use of female pronouns dissociates <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> from heterosexual norms and designates them in opposition to heterosexual masculinity. [...] The reason for using female pronouns and the frequency of use may vary, however. For example, they may be used only in jest, or may be used more seriously to stabilize a group of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and bond its members together.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} Filipino American <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> experience with coming out. Current literature argues that religious beliefs, familial pressures, and individual shame {{make it difficult}} for Asian American gays to come out. My research question asks: What are the challenges Filipino American <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> face when coming out? This research utilizes a qualitative research methodology to understand the correlations between racial/ethnic, religious, and age identification and coming out processes among Filipino American <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> in the San Francisco Bay Area. In my findings, there were three key points: 1) Filipino American <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> denied their sexuality despite knowing their attractions to men at a young age, 2) Filipino American <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> had to reject Catholicism to accept themselves as <b>gay</b> <b>men,</b> and 3) Filipino American <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> reported that their parents had difficulty accepting their son???s choice of lifestyle. My research will invite scholars to see the coming out process as the building block to understand a <b>gay</b> <b>man???s</b> worldview within the fields of Ethnic Studies, Asian American Studies, and Queer Studies...|$|R
5|$|By then, Manning {{was living}} as an openly <b>gay</b> <b>man.</b> Her {{relationship}} with her father was apparently good, but there were problems between Manning and her stepmother. In March 2006, Manning reportedly threatened her stepmother with a knife during an argument about Manning's failure to get another job; the stepmother called the police, and Manning was asked to leave the house. Manning drove to Tulsa in a pickup truck her father had given her, at first slept in it, then moved in with a friend from school. The two got jobs at Incredible Pizza in April. Manning moved on to Chicago before {{running out of money}} and again having nowhere to stay. Her mother arranged for Brian's sister, Debra, a lawyer in Potomac, Maryland, to take Manning in. Nicks wrote that the 15 months Manning spent with her aunt were among the most stable of her life. Chelsea had a boyfriend, took several low-paid jobs, and spent a semester studying history and English at Montgomery College, but left after failing an exam.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{moved into}} writing adult {{television}} dramas in 1994. His early scripts generally explored concepts {{of religion and}} sexuality among various backdrops: Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool; The Grand explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period; and Queer as Folk, his first prolific series, recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene. Following this, his adult series in the 2000s include Bob & Rose, which portrayed a <b>gay</b> <b>man</b> who {{fell in love with}} a woman; The Second Coming, which focused on the second coming and deicide of Jesus Christ from a mostly non-religious point of view; Mine All Mine, a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea; and Casanova, an adaptation of the complete memoirs of Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1999, Warnock {{announced}} her departure {{at the next}} election for personal reasons, and threw her support behind former Town of Vincent mayor John Hyde, {{a member of the}} Centre faction of the Labor Party who had the support of the Left faction and some Centre members of Parliament. However, the key Centre unions had backed former ministerial adviser Adele Farina for the post, and Labor's affirmative action policy for candidates in winnable seats meant that failing to pick a female candidate would risk sitting male MPs. A week later, the Centre faction openly split, with a breakaway group endorsing Hyde. On 5 November, Farina withdrew from the contest, leaving Hyde to be preselected unopposed ahead of the 2001 election. He maintained the seat for Labor at the election, becoming the first openly <b>gay</b> <b>man</b> to sit in the Western Australian parliament.|$|E

50|$|An Australian study {{conducted}} by Roffee and Waling in 2016 discovered how some <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> {{felt like they were}} expected to be hyper-sexual. Participants reported how other <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> would automatically assume that any interaction had sexual motivations. Furthermore, if it was then clarified {{that this is not the}} case then these <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> would suddenly feel excluded and ignored by the other <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> with which they had been interacting with. They felt that they could not obtain purely platonic friendships with other <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> One participant reported feeling alienated and disregarded as a person if they were not deemed by other <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> as sexually attractive. This presumption and attitude of hypersexuality is damaging, for it enforces preconceived ideals upon people, who are then ostracised if they do not meet these ideals.|$|R

This chapter explores why tools such as participatory action research and focus groups are appealing to older <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> as a method of sharing their experiences.

40|$|Developmental {{theories}} of the biological basis of sexual orientation suggest that sexually differentiated psychological and behavioural traits should be linked with sexual orientation. Subgroups of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> delineated by anal sex roles differ according {{to at least one}} such trait: gender expression. The present study assessed the hypothesis that handedness, a biologically determined sexually differentiated trait, corresponds to differences in subgroups of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> based on anal sex role. Furthermore, it assessed whether handedness mediates the association between gender nonconformity and male sexual orientation. Straight and <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> (N = 333) completed the Edinburgh Inventory of Handedness and the Recalled Childhood Gender Nonconformity Scale. <b>Gay</b> <b>men</b> also completed measures of anal sex role preference. As in previous studies, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> showed greater non-right-handedness and gender nonconformity than straight <b>men.</b> Also, among <b>gay</b> <b>men,</b> bottoms/versatiles (i. e., <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> who take a receptive anal sex role, or who take on both a receptive and insertive anal sex role) were more gender-nonconforming than tops (i. e., <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> who take an insertive anal sex role). In support of the hypothesis, bottoms/versatiles were more non-right-handed than tops and handedness mediated the male sexual orientation and anal sex role differences in Recalled Childhood Gender Nonconformity. Together, these findings suggest that developmental processes linked to handedness underpin variation among men in sexual orientation and gender nonconformity as well as variation among subgroups of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> that are delineated by anal sex roles...|$|R
