40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to identify and verify the influence of time and temperature on the volatile compounds profile of fresh cut peki. Peki fruits were washed, sanitized, their kernels were extracted, and they were packaged and stored for 15 days at 0, 5, and 10 °C and 6 days at 22 °C. The volatiles compounds were analyzed by GC - MS. Ethyl hexanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> were found in higher percentages, 63 and 16. 3 %, respectively. The determined volatiles were not influenced by the storage period. Hexanoic acid, ethyl 2 -octenoate and ethyl decanoate were not influenced by the different temperatures. The temperatures 0, 5, and 10 °C did not influence ethyl hexanoate, ethyl 2 -hexenoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> either.

Lucknow- 49 by simultaneous steam distillation extraction (SDE) with diethyl ether as extracting solvent. The concentrate was analysed by GC-MS. Acetic, butyric and hexanoic acids were the predominant acids, trans- 2 -hexenal and hexanal the predominant aldehydes and ethyl propanoate, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate, hexyl acetate, methyl benzoate, methyl <b>octanoate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> benzoate, phenylpropyl acetate and cinnamyl acetate, the esters responsible for the characteristic guava flavour were also present. The amount of total volatile substances was about 20 % higher in full ripe fruits. The concentration of acids and most esters increased and that of C 6 aldehydes decreased during ripening. The enzyme analysis showed that the polygalacturonase (PG) activity was lower in the ripe fruit, than in the half ripe one, while the β -galactosidase activity was not influenced by maturity stage.

40|$|Wine aroma is an {{important}} characteristic and {{may be related to}} certain specific parameters, such as raw material and production process. The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) column set, oven temperature offset of 10 ºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. Co-elutions came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines. Differentiation among Merlot wines and wines of other grape varieties were mainly perceived through the following components: ethyl dodecanoate, 1 -hexanol, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, dehydro- 2 -methyl- 3 (2 H) thiophenone, 3 -methyl butanoic acid, <b>ethyl</b> tetradecanoate, methyl <b>octanoate,</b> 1, 4 butanediol, and 6 -methyloctan- 1 -ol. 201...|$|R

40|$|PhD {{dissertation}} thesis "Study of {{correlation of}} quality parameters of wines and wine distillates" {{was done at}} Department of Post-Harvest Technology of Horticultural Products, Faculty of Horticulture, Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno during 2006 - 2012. Samples of wines and samples of distillates made from these wines were analysed using liquid-liquid extraction method (LLE) followed by gas chromatography analysis (GC). Potential characteristics [...] chemical markers were determined: trans-linalool oxide and cislinalool oxide which are typical for Muscat Ottonel and tetradecanote, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate for Pinot Blanc. In wine distillates, ethyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate, 1, 1 -diethoxybutane, diethoxypentane were determined, however none of these substances were found in wines. These substances probably originate {{as a result of}} esterification process during ageing of wine distillates after distillation process. Differences in chemical composition of wine distillates made from red wine grape cultivars were analysed using main component method. Group of substances such as <b>ethyl</b> butanoate, hexanoate, <b>octanoate,</b> decanoate, dodecanoate and diethyl succinate can be considered as possible markers identifying wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars and white grape cultivars. Characteristic aroma of grape variety was recognisable in wine distillates from Muscat Ottonell and Blue Frankish varieties. Samples of wine and wine distillates were analysed using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GCMS). Negative correlation between 1 -hexanol content and intensity of aroma was discovered in wine distillates. Characteristic aroma of grape variety showed significantly in distillates from Pinot Gris (RS_ 2) and in distillates from red wine grape cultivars, particularly Saint Laurent (SV) and Pinot Noir. Based on analysis of samples of wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars, ten major terpentic aromatic substances were determined (o-cymen, limonen, cis-b-ocimen, cislinalool oxid, linalool, isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol, a-terpineol, trans-sabinyl acetate a transkalamenen). All these substances influence aroma of grape variety. Both centred log ratio transform (clr) and main component method were applied and similarity in aroma of wine distillates was found and it was discovered that aroma of wine distillate from varieties Merlot, Pinot Noir and similar ones are influenced by terpenoids cis-linalool oxid, linalool, 94 isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol a a-terpineol. On the other hand, aroma of wine distillates from varieties Blue Portugieser and Cabernet Sauvignon are influenced by o-cymen, limonen, trans-sabinyl acetate and trans-kalamenen. Analysis of terpentic content wine distillates was carried out using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Major terpentic substances identified are limonen, linalool, a-ylangen, b- bourbonen, g-kadinen, trans-nerolidol, 2, 3 -dihydrofarnesol and (2 -cis, 6 -trans) -farnesol. Verifiable differences were discovered between various distillates types. Predominantly mono-terpentic substances were identified in wine distillates; in grappa there were also identified sesquiterpenic substances which are characteristic for these types of distillates...|$|R

The aromatic profiles of wines produced from two white varieties (Blanco lexítimo and Agudelo) and one red variety (Serradelo) from Betanzos, harvested in 2006 and 2007, have been established by gas chromatography (GC/FID). A total of 35 varietal and fermentative aroma compounds were identified and quantified in free volatile form, which include terpenols, C 13 -norisoprenoids, alcohols, esters, volatile fatty acids and volatile phenols.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{a simple and}} {{sensitive}} methodology based on dynamic headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography with quadrupole mass detection (GC–qMSD), was developed and optimized for the determination of volatile (VOCs) and semi-volatile (SVOCs) compounds from different alcoholic beverages: wine, beer and whisky. Key experimental factors influencing the equilibrium of the VOCs and SVOCs between the sample and the SPME fibre, as the type of fibre coating, extraction time and temperature, sample stirring and ionic strength, were optimized. The performance of five commercially available SPME fibres was evaluated and compared, namely polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, 100 μm); polyacrylate (PA, 85 μm); polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB, 65 μm); carboxen™/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS, 75 μm) and the divinylbenzene/carboxen on polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS, 50 / 30 μm) (StableFlex). An objective comparison among different alcoholic beverages {{has been established in}} terms of qualitative and semi-quantitative differences on volatile and semi-volatile compounds. These compounds belong to several chemical families, including higher alcohols, ethyl esters, fatty acids, higher alcohol acetates, isoamyl esters, carbonyl compounds, furanic compounds, terpenoids, C 13 -norisoprenoids and volatile phenols. The optimized extraction conditions and GC–qMSD, lead to the successful identification of 44 compounds in white wines, 64 in beers and 104 in whiskys. Some of these compounds were found in all of the examined beverage samples. The main components of the HS-SPME found in white wines were <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (46. 9 %), ethyl decanoate (30. 3 %), ethyl 9 -decenoate (10. 7 %), ethyl hexanoate (3. 1 %), and isoamyl octanoate (2. 7 %).

Volatile compounds (49) of caninha samples not aged and aged in oak or balsam barrels {{were determined by}} GC/FID, GC/MS and GC/Sniffing/aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). Esters represented the largest group, followed by alcohols and acids. The concentrations of ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate found in the caninha aged in oak were higher than those from samples not aged and aged in balsam. 2 -Methylpropanol and 3 -methylbutanol, and decanoic and dodecanoic were the major alcohols and acids, respectively, present in caninha samples. GC/Sniffing/ AEDA analysis indicated a lower content of off-odour notes in aged caninha (31 – 35 %) when compared with not aged one (57 %).

Extracts of non-mature tequila were characterized by 26 odour-active regions, which included ethyl hexanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> 2 -phenylethyl acetate, β-damascenone, isoamyl alcohol and octanoic acid as the most odour-active compounds (flavour dilution, FD, factor ≥ 6561). In contrast, extracts of the mature spirit showed 36 odour-active zones, where the compounds with the highest FD factors (6561) were ethyl hexanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> 2 -phenylethyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, guaiacol, 4 -ethyl guaiacol, vanillin, cis/trans whisky lactones, β-damascenone and octanoic acid. The aromagram of mature tequila was thus differentiated from that of the non-mature spirit owing to the presence of cask-extractive compounds and the increased FD factors of certain terpenes, higher alcohols and acetals.

30|$|Medium chain {{volatile}} esters are important molecules that deliver fruity and pleasant aromas such as isoamyl acetate (banana), ethyl acetate (solvent-like aroma), phenyl ethyl acetate (flowery, roses), ethyl hexanoate (sour apple) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (sour apple) (Van Laere et al. 2008; Lorenzoni et al. 2012). Biosynthesis of these compounds by alcoholysis is catalysed {{by a family}} of acyl-CoA:ethanol O-acyltransferases (AEATases), which proceed the transfer of fatty acyl groups from acylglycerols or acyl-CoA derivatives to alcohols (Mason and Dufour 2000; Saerens et al. 2006). Two such enzymes {{have been identified in}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, namely Eht 1 and Eeb 1 (gene name EHT 1 and EEB 1, respectively) (Saerens et al. 2006). Deletion experiments have shown that the loss of gene EEB 1 resulted in a severe reduction in ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and ethyl decanoate compared to wild-type, whereas detection of EHT 1 only resulted in minor decrease in ethyl hexanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> relative to wild-type. In addition, deletion of both genes produced these flavours at a similar level to the eeb 1 Δ single detection strain, indicating Eeb 1 played a comparatively major role in the enzymatic bioprocess. Furthermore, Saerens and colleagues also reported performance of recombinant Eeb 1 and Eht 1 purified from E. coli as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in the same paper. It has been proposed that both recombinant enzymes exhibited esterase activity, as well as AEATases function with different substrate specificity. For the latter, GST-tagged Eeb 1 displayed a preference for octanoyl-CoA as a substrate whereas GST-tagged Eht 1 preferred shorter chain acyl-CoA (butyryl-CoA) as a substrate (Saerens et al. 2006). In addition to this research, the same group studied the production of ethyl esters during fermentation by analysis of process parameters (Saerens et al. 2008 a, b) and gene expression levels (Saerens et al. 2008 b). It has been proposed that fatty acid precursor availability rather than the AEATases enzyme activity is a major limiting factor for ethyl ester production (Saerens et al. 2008 a, b). They also demonstrated certain correlations between the gene expression levels and relevant flavour compounds during high gravity brewing fermentations, where the maximum expression level of EEB 1 was only correlated with the end concentration of ethyl hexanoate while expression level of EHT 1 showed a strong negative correlation with the levels of <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and decanoate (Saerens et al. 2008 b). More recently, Chen et al. (2014) reported an elevated production of ethyl caproate in Chinese liquor using a recombinant yeast overexpressing EHT 1 with deleted FAA 1 encoding for acyl-CoA synthetases. All these findings ultimately suggested the creation of promising recombinant strains that can be applied for medium-chain ester production by exploiting the yeast enzymes Eht 1 and Eeb 1.|$|E

The effects of early leaf removal performed manually and mechanically at two different phenological stages, pre-bloom and fruit set, on the volatile composition of Tempranillo (Vitis vinifera L.) wines were studied. Volatiles were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. RESULTS: Early leaf removal only modified the total concentrations of C 6 compounds and acetates, whereas total alcohols, esters, volatile acids and terpenes remained generally unaffected. Early defoliation induced {{a significant reduction in}} C 6 compounds and increased the concentrations of acetates in Tempranillo wines. An effect of timing (pre-bloom vs fruit set) alone was observed for all acetates analysed. Regarding the method of defoliation (manual vs mechanical), significant differences in some ethyl ester (ethyl- 2 -methylbutyrate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate)</b> and volatile acid concentrations were observed among treatments. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> 2 -phenylethyl acetate, 3 -methylbutyl acetate and hexanoic acid, with OAV (odour activity value) > 1 and mainly fruity and floral odour descriptors, showed higher levels after early defoliation treatments compared with non-defoliated vines. Principal component analysis illustrated the difference in wines from defoliated and non-defoliated treatments based on their volatile composition. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that early leaf removal significantly modified the wine aroma compounds, increasing or decreasing several of these compounds...|$|E

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two model {{systems of}} {{molecular}} biology, interact in the wild, but the chemical {{basis of this}} interaction is largely unknown. This thesis details an effort to understand the molecular basis of this ecological co-localization. Results: 	While screening a collection of wild and laboratory yeast strains {{for their ability to}} attract adult D. melanogaster (Raleigh 437), I noticed a large difference in fly preference for two nearly isogenic strains of S. cerevisiae, BY 4741 and BY 4742. Using standard genetic analyses, I tracked the difference in preference to lack of mitochondria in BY 4742. I used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to examine the volatile compounds produced by BY 4741 and the mitochondria-deficient BY 4742, and found that they differed in their production of many known fly attractants, including ethyl hexanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> which were produced at much higher levels in yeast strains with mitochondria during aerobic fermentation, a metabolic strategy that distinguishes S. cerevisiae from most other microbes. Through a detailed investigation of the volatile profiles and RNA expression patterns produced by yeast under multiple nutritional scenarios, I determined that the production of ethyl hexanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> during aerobic fermentation depends on the level and type of nitrogen present in the substrate. Fermentative growth on nitrogen-limited substrates requires mitochondrial engagement and the metabolic configuration employed by S. cerevisiae to contend with this nutritional scenario results in the production of these ester attractants. This nutritional scenario – high sugar but limited nitrogen – matches the composition of fruit, the natural co-localization environment for flies and yeast, suggesting that these volatiles are ecologically relevant cues for D. melanogaster. D. melanogaster sense ethyl hexanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> via the odorant receptor genes Or 22 a and Or 22 b. A single gene version of this locus, which is a chimera of the two ancestral copies, is segregating in natural D. melanogaster populations. I found that D. melanogaster lines harboring the chimeric locus (including Raleigh 437) show more robust preference for ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate-producing S. cerevisiae cultures. This provides an ecological basis, and possibly selective advantage, for the maintenance of this allele in D. melanogaster...|$|E

Cachaca produced in copper and hybrid alembic present a higher content of ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate than those produced in a stainless-steel column, whereas cachaca produced by distillation in a stainless-steel column present a higher content of <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> ethyl decanoate, and ethyl laurate. As expected, ethyl acetate is the major ester in whiskey and rum, followed by ethyl lactate for samples of rum. Nevertheless, whiskey samples exhibit ethyl lactate at contents lower or at the same order of magnitude of the fatty esters...|$|E

Three solid phase microextraction fiber coatings (DVB/CAR/PDMS, CAR/PDMS, and PDMS/DVB) were tested {{for evaluation of}} volatile compounds. DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber showed a strong extraction capacity for volatile compounds and produced the best result in case of total peak areas. A total of 133 volatile compounds were identified in fruit pulp; among them 1 -hexanol (6. 86 %), eucalyptol (6. 66 %), ethyl butanoate (6. 47 %), <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (4. 01 %), ethyl decanoate (3. 39 %), 4 -terpineol (3. 27 %), and 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol (3. 10 %) were the major {{components in}} the sample extracts...|$|E
30|$|The {{recombinant}} P. pastoris expressing EHT 1 or EEB 1, {{as well as}} P. pastoris containing empty vector (control), were cultivated on brewer’s wort. After 12  h methanol induction, {{formation of}} volatile compounds was assessed by SPME GC–MS analysis. Phenethyl alcohol was detected from all the cell cultures, indicating this compound is an endogenous metabolite derived from P. pastoris yeast itself from wort medium used. Apart from phenethyl alcohol, none of volatile ester compounds was observed from the control strain. For the recombinant strains, production of ethyl esters was observed to increase with the increasing chain length from C 6 to C 10. As shown in Fig.  2, recombinant yeast P. pastoris-EHT 1 produced fatty acid ethyl esters including ethyl hexanoate (C 6), <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), corresponding to 2, 10 and 11  % of total volatiles, respectively. Similarly, during fermentation with the P. pastoris-EEB 1, the levels were 1, 7 and 13  % of total volatiles for ethyl hexanoate (C 6), <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), respectively. In addition, {{it is interesting to}} note that ethyl laurate (C 12) and ethyl myristate (C 14) were produced by P. pastoris-EHT 1, but not by P. pastoris-EEB 1, although they were only present in relatively small quantities. It should be noted that the value above was expressed in relative abundance of the gas phase, and an overall quantification of these compounds indicated that P. pastoris-EEB 1 produced higher amounts of esters compared to P. pastoris-EHT 1 expect for ethyl hexanoate (see Additional file 3), probably due to higher expression level of yeast enzyme Eeb 1 extracellularly.|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} {{profiles of}} tomato wine before and 90 days after storage at 10  and 15  were determined. The {{results indicate that}} storage temperature significantly influences the volatile composition of tomato wine. A total of 75 volatile compounds are identified, iz. 38 esters, 7 carbonyls, 1 furan, 4 sulphur-containing compounds, 18 higher alcohols, 6 fatty acids and 1 terpene. Twenty-five volatile compounds are present beyond their odour threshold, but the major contributors to the overall aroma of tomato wine are <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> ethyl hexanoate and isoamyl acetate, which are characterised by fruity notes. The potent odoriferous volatile compound, linalool, contributes much to the wine stored at 15  than at 10 . Storage significantly improves the fruitiness of tomato wine...|$|E
40|$|Early {{defoliation}} {{is a very}} innovative {{technique in}} viticulture used for yield management. The effects of early leaf removal performed manually and mechanically at two different phenological stages, pre-bloom and fruit set, on the volatile composition of Tempranillo (Vitis vinifera L.) wines were studied. Volatiles were identified and quantified by gas chromatography Early leaf removal only modified the total concentrations of C 6 compounds and acetates, whereas total alcohols, esters, volatile acids and terpenes remained generally unaffected. Early defoliation induced {{a significant reduction in}} C 6 compounds and increased the concentrations of acetates in Tempranillo wines. An effect of timing (pre-bloom vs fruit set) alone was observed for all acetates analysed. Regarding the method of defoliation (manual vs mechanical), significant differences in some ethyl ester (ethyl- 2 -methylbutyrate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate)</b> and volatile acid concentrations were observed among treatments. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> 2 -phenylethyl acetate, 3 -methylbutyl acetate and hexanoic acid, with OAV (odour activity value) > 1 and mainly fruity and floral odour descriptors, showed higher levels after early defoliation treatments compared with non-defoliated vines. Principal component analysis illustrated the difference in wines from defoliated and non-defoliated treatments based on their volatile composition. It can be concluded that early leaf removal significantly modified the wine aroma compounds, increasing or decreasing several of these compounds.

40|$|There {{are four}} main Pinot noir wine regions in New Zealand: Central Otago, Marlborough, Martinborough and Waipara. These regions {{specialize}} in this variety as the soil, climate and other conditions are {{well suited to}} this grape. Beside being grown in these regions the wines are also marketed as regional products. Place of origin labelling implies that wines from one region will have different aroma and flavour characteristics from wines from other regions. This project determined the characteristics that best differentiate the regional styles of New Zealand Pinot noir. Marlborough Pinot noir was characterized by greater raspberry, red cherry, red fruit and red berry aromas, longer finish length and more harmonious balance. Martinborough Pinot noir was characterized by greater black cherry, chocolate, oak and spice aromas and oak tannin. Waipara Pinot noir was characterized by greater barnyard, herbal and violet aromas and in-mouth fruit density/concentration. Central Otago Pinot noir was characterized by fuller body. As regional wines {{were found to be}} stylistically different, the ability of tasters to discriminate regional wines was tested using paired comparison and sorting analysis. Tasters were not successful at discriminating regional wine examples using these techniques. This may be due to conceptual models that are not representative of the regional wines. In order to determine the possible causes of these regional differences the chemical composition of the wines was also investigated. Three HS-SPME-GC-MS methods were developed specifically for Pinot noir wine to measure 34 different volatile organic compounds. One method measured compounds found at higher concentrations, namely esters and alcohols, the second method measured volatile fatty acids and the third measured trace compounds present at very low concentrations. With the two sets of information, sensory and chemical, it was possible to find relationships using canonical correlation analysis. Results indicated four aroma compounds of particular importance: <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> ethyl decanoate, 2 -phenyl ethanol and benzaldehyde. Addition/omission tests were used to determine the influence of each compound on Pinot noir aroma. The compounds were added in combination and at varying concentrations to a wine matrix, which consisted of a commerical Pinot noir that contained low levels of the compounds of interest. In 8 of 10 triangle tests panellists were able to successfully identify samples with different concentrations of the components. Panellists also used descriptive analysis to determine the influence of these compounds. From the descriptive analysis results it was found the 2 -phenyl ethanol influenced the perception of violet aroma, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> influenced red cherry aroma and the combination of <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and ethyl decanoate influenced black cherry aroma. The measurement of the effect of these aroma compounds is a first step to understanding some factors of regional style since red cherry, black cherry and violets were descriptors that characterize the regional styles of New Zealand Pinot noir...|$|E
40|$|Abstracts Effect of {{volatile}} compounds ’ {{contribution to}} the overall aroma of Chardonnay wines from Changli County was first investigated in this research. Wine aroma compounds were extracted by solid-phase micro-extraction fibers, then they were submitted to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). A total of 41 volatile com-pounds were identified and quantified. In the volatiles detected, higher alcohols, esters and fatty acids are the main chemicals. According to their odor active values (OAVs), 13 volatile compounds {{were considered to be}} the powerful impact odorants of this wine. They are b-dama-scenone, isopentyl acetate, phenethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> ethyl lactate, ethyl decanoate, isopentyl alcohol, 2 -phenyl-ethanol, hex-anoic acid, octanoic acid and n-decanoic acid.

Ninety-six compounds were identified, from which octanoic acid (70 % of total extract) and hexanoic acid (8 % of total extract) {{were found to}} be the major constituents. Due to noni maturation, octanoic acid, decanoic acid and 2 E-nonenal decreased their concentrations, while some esters (methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> and methyl 4 E-decenoate), which their fruity odor notes, increased their contents. Two unsaturated esters, reported {{for the first time in}} this fruit, 3 -methyl- 3 -buten- 1 -yl hexanoate and 3 -methyl- 3 -buten- 1 -yl octanoate, significantly decreased their concentration in the ripe to over-ripe fruits...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{aroma of}} wine determines its {{acceptability}} by consumers. Thus, {{it is important}} to know the nature and quantities of the compounds present in the wine mixtures. Analysis of aromatic compounds highly depends on the extraction methods. The extraction method adopted for this study is the Micro Extraction in Solid Phase (SPME), using a Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber type. This task requires first the optimization of the SPME extraction through a central composite design. The factors considered are extraction time, extraction temperature and amount of NaCl added. After optimization, 5 vintages of wine Syrah-Adyar were analyzed using gaz chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in order to study vintage effect. Digital chromatogram simulator has been used and treated by chemometrics. Results showed that three flavors seem to differ from vintage to another: ethyl acetate, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate...</b>|$|E

These esters are a light fraction present in biodiesel derived from palmist oil and copra oil (Ballerini and Alazard-Toux, Les biocarburants; IFP Publications: Paris, 2006). The experimental data (P-T) were smoothed using the Antoine equation and compared with the available literature values.

The {{results indicated that the}} addition of pectase was in favor of pH decrease and clarification. The pectase-treated wines had significantly higher concentrations of acetic acid, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> and isoamyl acetate than the non-enzyme-treated wines. Furthermore, the nonextracted wines had significantly higher concentrations of isoamyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, ethyl lactate, and isoamyl acetate than the extracted wines. The first principal component separated the wine from the nonextracted juice with pectase from other samples based on the higher concentrations of isoamyl acetate (0. 14 [*]μg/g), diethyl butanedioate (0. 07 [*]μg/g), 2 -phenylethyl acetate (0. 23 [*]μg/g), and acetoin (1. 47 [*]μg/g).

The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of an additional phase on the distribution of the volatile and less volatile analytes. The adsorption of six probe molecules, namely isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate (ethyl caproate), phenylethyl alcohol, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> (ethyl caprilate), 2 -phenylethyl acetate, and ethyl decanoate, was monitored by detecting the desorbed amount on a DVD-CAR-PDMS fiber from Pilsen beer. The microextraction process involved the presence of different silica-based phases produced via different methods: xerogel produced by hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic routes, aerogel, pyrogenic, and precipitated silica. The resulting data are discussed in correlation with sorbent texture properties (specific area and pore diameter). The modification of silica with alkyl groups also affects the preconcentrated amount of the target molecules in the headspace. The presence of sorbents was shown to affect the analyte signal more than the addition of NaCl or the use of ultrasound...|$|E

Using SPME-GCMS, this study provides evidence that purified O. oeni esterases have the ability to both synthesise and hydrolyse esters. Two purified esterases (EstA 2 and EstB 28) synthesised ethyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate to varying degrees. Both purified esterases hydrolysed ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>octanoate.</b> Once this dual activity was confirmed, malolactic fermentation (MLF) trials were conducted in wine with O. oeni strains that had been previously observed to have either high or low esterase activity against artificial substrates.
