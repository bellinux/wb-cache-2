40|$|Brand {{extension}} {{strategy is}} an effort to extend a succesfull brand name to launch new or modified products or lines. Brand extension attitudes are influenced by the percieved quality of the core brand and the fit between the <b>extended</b> <b>products.</b> The similarity is important for brand extension because the greater perceived similarity between the current and new product leads to a greater transfer of positive or negative effect to the new product. Furthermore, higher levels of perceived fit between core brand and extension will lead to more favorable evaluations of the extension. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the effects of brand extension strategies on consumers' attitudes regarding the product similarity. Three different brands are used for the statistical analysis. According to the results, there is a relationship between the favorable opinion about core brand and the evaluation of similarity for <b>extended</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, there is a relationship between the similarity of <b>extended</b> <b>products</b> and extension evaluations...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of cold forming, an aluminum-based {{laminate}} film is simply pressed into a mold {{by means of a}} stamp. The aluminum will be elongated and maintain the formed shape. In the industry these blisters are called cold form foil (CFF) blisters. The principal advantage of cold form foil blisters is that the use of aluminum offers a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an <b>extended</b> <b>product</b> expiry date. The principal disadvantages of cold form foil blisters are: the slower speed of production compared to thermoforming; the lack of transparency of the package (a therapy compliance disadvantage); and the larger size of the blister card (aluminum can not be formed with near 90 degree angles).In cold forming aluminium is offering a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an <b>extended</b> <b>product</b> expiry date.|$|E

40|$|<b>Extended</b> <b>Product</b> Responsibility {{embodies the}} notion that agents along a product chain should share {{responsibility}} for the life-cycle environmental impacts of the product, including those associated with ultimate disposal. Extended Producer Responsibility is a narrower concept which places responsibility on producers and focuses primarily on post-consumer waste disposal. Manufacturer "take-back" requirements are the policy lever most often associated with Extended Producer Responsibility. In this paper, the authors discuss alternative incentive-based policies {{that are consistent with}} the objectives of <b>Extended</b> <b>Product</b> and Producer Responsibility. They argue that an upstream combined product tax and recycling subsidy (UCTS) is generally more cost-effective and imposes fewer transactions costs than the take-back approach. They also consider {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a policy not targeted at producers: unit-based pricing of residential waste collection and disposal. The authors find that this option shows potential for achieving non-trivial reductions in solid waste. Widespread application in the U. S. of a $ 1. 00 charge per 32 -gallon bag could reduce total municipal solid waste disposed by approximately 13 percent per year. ...|$|E
