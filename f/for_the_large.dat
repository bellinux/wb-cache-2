5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.

In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again.

5|$|In July 1848, not {{too long}} after James Marshall's famous gold find at Sutter's Mill – which started the California Gold Rush – Major Reading {{discovered}} gold on the Trinity River. The find attracted thousands of miners to the area and created boomtowns such as Douglas City, Francis, Hoboken, Lake City, Lewiston, Junction City and Quimby. Weaverville, located {{at the end of}} the trail Reading had established from the Sacramento Valley to the Trinity, prospered as the main trade center through which gold was exchanged for imported supplies and services. The initial discoveries were placer deposits, carried by the river to settle in gravel bars. The Trinity River gold rush is also noted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of Chinese miners attracted to the area, as many as 2,500 by 1854.
