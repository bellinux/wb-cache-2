5000|$|The Sunnah is for {{the imam}} {{to stand in front}} of the worshippers, because this is what is proven in the Sunnah.Ibn Abi ‘Umar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Sunnah {{is for the}} worshippers to stand behind the imam. If there are a number of worshippers, the Sunnah is for them to stand behind the imam, whether they are men or women, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to lead his companions in prayer and they stood behind him. When Jaabir and Jabbaar stood on his right and left, he pushed them until they were behind him, even though they were two. Similarly, Jaabir narrated: I {{travelled}} with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on a campaign. He stood up to pray, and I did wudoo’, then I came and stood on his left. He took me by the hand and pulled me around until he made me stand on his right. Then Jabbaar ibn Sakhr came and stood on his left, and he took both of us by the hand and made us stand behind him. Narrated by Abu Dawood. This is also the view of ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Jaabir ibn Zayd, al-Hasan, Maalik, ash-Shaafa‘i, and ashaab ar-ra’y. <b>End</b> <b>quote</b> from ash-Sharh al-Kabeer (2/61) ...|$|E
