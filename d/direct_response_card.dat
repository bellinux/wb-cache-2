DESCRIPTORS: academic behavior, college teaching, higher education, <b>response</b> <b>cards</b> Despite much debate on the issue, lectur-ing continues {{to be one of the}} most com-mon methods of instruction in college courses. One of the most frequent criticisms of lecturing has been that the instructor typ-ically does the majority of the teaching and the students may only passively attend. In other words, students rarely become actively involved with instruction during most lec-tures. Research has shown that interaction with instructors increases learning (Greenwood, Delquadri, & Hall, 1985; Martin, Pear, & Martin, 2002).
