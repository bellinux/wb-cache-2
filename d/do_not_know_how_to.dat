5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E

Dogs and cats {{have been known}} to die from drowning, either because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> swim, or because they tire out from overexposure or old age, or have a medical complication such as a seizure, or become unconscious.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, is a core deficit in Autism. Children with Autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent any other way. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping {{a child with}} Autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal. Children with Autism require intensive intervention {{to learn how to}} communicate their intent.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{includes}} wearing {{sunglasses and}} not smoking. Early on the symptoms may be improved with glasses. If {{this does not}} help, surgery to remove the cloudy lens {{and replace it with}} an artificial lens is the only effective treatment. Surgery is needed only if the cataracts are causing problems and generally results in an improved quality of life. Cataract surgery is not readily available in many countries, which is especially true for women, those living in rural areas, and those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read.|$|E

25|$|Although {{ubiquitous}} in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (’) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since {{it does not}} have its own key on a standard keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, many people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> enter this character and instead use the typewriter apostrophe ('). The typewriter apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of Web publishing, the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is {{extracted}} {{from the town of}} Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be enough to put authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful because many people, especially foreign tourists, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> determine what is real. However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer.|$|E
25|$|Romanization is not {{normally}} taught in Taiwan's public schools at any level. Consequently, most Taiwanese <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> romanize their names or addresses. Teachers use only Zhuyin ("bopomofo") {{for teaching and}} annotating the pronunciation of Mandarin. There have been sporadic discussions about using a romanization system during early education to teach children Mandarin pronunciation (like how students in Mainland China learn Mandarin using Hanyu Pinyin). However, like all other aspects of romanization in Taiwan, this is a controversial issue. The plan in the early 2000s to adopt Pinyin was delayed due to disagreements over which form to use (Tongyong or Hanyu). The move {{is complicated by the}} massive effort needed to produce new instructional materials and retrain teachers.|$|E

25|$|About corrupting Athenian youth, Socrates {{explained}} that the young, rich men {{of the city of}} Athens {{have little to do with}} their time. They therefore follow him about the city, observing his questioning of intellectual arguments in dialogue with other intellectual men. In turn, the young men imitate the method of Socrates. Moreover, the embarrassed men, whose arguments Socrates examined and found wanting, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> avoid the ridicule of exposure as pretenders to wisdom. To not lose face, the beardless lads re-state the prejudicial, stock accusations against Socrates, that he is a morally abominable man who corrupts the youth of Athens with sophistry and atheism. In his defence, Socrates said, “For those who are examined, instead of being angry with themselves, are angry with me!” Hence is Socrates considered a wise man, yet has acquired a bad reputation among the politically powerful personages of Athens.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting {{can be much}} faster than server-side scripting {{because it does not}} need to connect to a remote server and the page or frame {{does not need to be}} reloaded). Another problem with script blocking is that many users do not understand it, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> properly secure their browsers. Yet another drawback is that many sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others on the same page. For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run on the same page could be disallowed.|$|E
25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E
