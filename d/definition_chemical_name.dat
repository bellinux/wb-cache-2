2500|$|It's {{generally}} {{understood that}} the aims of lexicography versus chemical nomenclature vary and are to an extent at odds. Dictionaries of words, whether in traditional print or on the web, collect and report the meanings of words as their uses appear and change over time. For web dictionaries with limited or no formal editorial process, definitions—in this case, <b>definitions</b> of <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> and terms—can change rapidly without concern for the formal or historical meanings. Chemical nomenclature {{on the other hand}} (with IUPAC nomenclature as the best example) is necessarily more restrictive: It aims to standardize communication and practice so that, when a chemical term is used it has a fixed meaning relating to chemical structure, thereby giving insights into chemical properties and derived molecular functions. These differing aims can have profound effects on valid understanding in chemistry, especially with regard to chemical classes that have achieved mass attention. Examples of the impact of these can be seen in considering the examples of: ...|$|R

40|$|End users use {{chemical}} {{search engines}} {{to search for}} chemical formulae and <b>chemical</b> <b>names.</b> <b>Chemical</b> search engines identify and index chemical formulae and <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> appearing in text documents to support e±cient search and retrieval in the future. Identifying chemical formulae and <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> in text automatically has been a hard problem that has met {{with varying degrees of}} success in the past. We propose algorithms for chemical formula and <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> tagging using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that achieve higher accuracy than existing (published) methods. After chemical entities have been identi¯ed in text documents, they must be indexed. In order to support user-provided search queries that require a partial match between the <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> segment used as a keyword or a partial chemical formula, all possible (or a signi¯cant number of) sub-formulae of formulae that appear in any document and all possible sub-terms (e. g., `methyl') of <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> (e. g., `methylethyl ketone') must be indexed. Indexing all possible sub-formulae and sub-terms results in an exponential increase in the storage and memory requirements, and the time taken to process the indices. We propose techniques to prune the indices signi¯cantly without reducing the quality of the returned results signi¯cantly. Finally, we propose multiple query semantics to allow user...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Term clustering, by {{measuring}} the string similarities between terms, is known within the natural language processing community {{to be an effective}} method for improving the quality of texts and dictionaries. However, we have observed that <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> are difficult to cluster using string similarity measures. In order to clearly demonstrate this difficulty, we compared the string similarities determined using the edit distance, the Monge-Elkan score, SoftTFIDF, and the bigram Dice coefficient for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> with those for non-chemical names. Results Our experimental results revealed the following: (1) The edit distance had the best performance in the matching of full forms, whereas Cohen et al. reported that SoftTFIDF with the Jaro-Winkler distance would yield the best measure for matching pairs of terms for their experiments. (2) For each of the string similarity measures above, the best threshold for term matching differs for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> and for non-chemical names; the difference is especially large for the edit distance. (3) Although the matching results obtained for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> using the edit distance, Monge-Elkan scores, or the bigram Dice coefficients are better than the result obtained for non-chemical names, the results were contrary when using SoftTFIDF. (4) A suitable weight for <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> varies substantially from one for non-chemical names. In particular, a weight vector that has been optimized for non-chemical names is not suitable for <b>chemical</b> <b>names.</b> (5) The matching results using the edit distances improve further by dividing a set of full forms into two subsets, according to whether a full form is a <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> or not. These results show that our hypothesis is acceptable, and that we can significantly improve the performance of abbreviation-full form clustering by computing <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> and non-chemical names separately. Conclusions In conclusion, the discriminative application of string similarity methods to <b>chemical</b> and non-chemical <b>names</b> may be a simple yet effective way to improve the performance of term clustering. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> are the {{scientific}} names, {{based on the}} molecular structure of the drug. There are various systems of chemical nomenclature and thus various <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> for any one substance.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{significant}} portion of the biomedical and chemical literature refers to small molecules. The accurate identification and annotation of compound name that are relevant to the topic of the given literature can establish links between scientific publications and various chemical and life science databases. Manual annotation is the preferred method for these works because well-trained indexers can understand the paper topics as well as recognize key terms. However, considering {{the hundreds of thousands of}} new papers published annually, an automatic annotation system with high precision and relevance can be a useful complement to manual annotation. Results An automated <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> annotation system, MeSH Automated Annotations (MAA), was developed to annotate small molecule names in scientific abstracts with tunable accuracy. This system aims to reproduce the MeSH term annotations on biomedical and chemical literature that would be created by indexers. When comparing automated free text matching to those indexed manually of 26 thousand MEDLINE abstracts, more than 40 % of the annotations were false-positive (FP) cases. To reduce the FP rate, MAA incorporated several filters to remove "incorrect" annotations caused by nonspecific, partial, and low relevance <b>chemical</b> <b>names.</b> In part, relevance was measured by the position of the <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> in the text. Tunable accuracy was obtained by adding or restricting the sections of the text scanned for <b>chemical</b> <b>names.</b> The best precision obtained was 96 % with a 28 % recall rate. The best performance of MAA, as measured with the F statistic was 66 %, which favorably compares to other <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> annotation systems. Conclusions Accurate <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> annotation can help researchers not only identify important <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> in abstracts, but also match unindexed and unstructured abstracts to chemical records. The current work is tested against MEDLINE, but the algorithm is not specific to this corpus and it is possible that the algorithm can be applied to papers from chemical physics, material, polymer and environmental science, as well as patents, biological assay descriptions and other textual data. </p...|$|R
