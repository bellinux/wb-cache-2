25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. {{for the fact that}} the world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, is that it was {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will <b>enable</b> <b>you</b> to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And it is part of the price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E

2500|$|Davis's draft {{proclamation}} did {{not reach}} his generals until after they had issued proclamations of their own. They stressed that they had come as liberators, not conquerors, to these border states, {{but they did not}} address the larger issue of the Confederate strategy shift as Davis had desired. Lee's proclamation announced to the people of Maryland that his army had come [...] "with the deepest sympathy [...] the wrongs that have been inflicted upon the citizens of the commonwealth allied to the States of the South by the strongest social, political, and commercial ties ... to aid you in throwing off this foreign yoke, to <b>enable</b> <b>you</b> again to enjoy the inalienable rights of freemen." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war, Cooper was {{a farmer}} at his home, Cameron, near Alexandria, Virginia. His {{house had been}} taken over by the U.S. {{government}} during the war and turned into a fort, but he was able to move into what had been an overseer's house. Due to his age Cooper earned a meager living. On August 4, 1870, Robert E. Lee, on the behalf of other former Confederates, sent Cooper $300. Lee wrote to him saying, [...] "To this sum I have only been able to add $100, but I hope it may <b>enable</b> <b>you</b> to supply some immediate want and prevent you from taxing your strength too much." [...] Samuel Cooper died at his home in 1876, and is buried in Alexandria's Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} Gilman's presidency, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Press, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum {{had been}} founded, [...] the latter by the trustees, and {{the others in the}} order listed under the Gilman administration. [...] "Sex" [...] and [...] "color" [...] were major issues in the early history of the Johns Hopkins Institutions. The {{founding}} of the School of Nursing is usually linked to Johns Hopkins' statements in his March 1873 instruction letter to the trustees that [...] "I desire you to establish, in connection with the hospital, a training school for female nurses. This provision will secure the services of women competent to care for those sick in the hospital wards, and will <b>enable</b> <b>you</b> to benefit the whole community by supplying it with a class of trained and experienced nurses".|$|E
2500|$|Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of {{supporting}} Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as {{a criticism of}} blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; {{at the end of}} the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros [...] Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: [...] "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there". [...] Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, [...] "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would <b>enable</b> <b>you</b> to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, [...] "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".|$|E
