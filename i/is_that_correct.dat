Our method can discover a group of events (called macro-events) that best describes a sentence. We evaluate our method on our novel dataset of professional soccer commentaries. The empirical results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-ofthe-art. ...|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{computing}} {{continues to}} be an alphabet-soup of services and protocols. No single system for managing CPUs or I/O devices has emerged (or is likely to emerge) as a universal solution. Therefore, distributed applications require adapters in order to plug themselves into existing systems. The difficulty of building such adapters lies not in normal operations, but in the complications of failures and other unusual situations. We demonstrate this with the Pluggable File System, an adapter for connecting POSIX applications to remote I/O services. We offer a detailed discussion of the construction of the system while dealing with failures and other events that are not trivially mapped into the application's expectations. The key insight <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> I/O management requires coordination with CPU management. We conclude with some practical advice for others constructing similar software...|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that word segmentation accuracy is monotonically related to retrieval performance in Chinese information retrieval. In this paper we show that, for Chinese, {{the relationship between}} segmentation and retrieval performance is in fact nonmonotonic; that is, at around 70 % word segmentation accuracy an over-segmentation phenomenon begins to occur {{which leads to a}} reduction in information retrieval performance. We demonstrate this e ect by presenting an empirical investigation of information retrieval on Chinese TREC data, using a wide variety of word segmentation algorithms with word segmentation accuracies ranging from 44 % to 95 %. It appears that the main reason for the drop in retrieval performance <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> compounds and collocations are preserved by accurate segmenters, while they are broken up by less accurate (but reasonable) segmenters, to a surprising advantage.

40|$|Before pouring more {{resources}} into our health system, {{we need to}} make better use of what 2 ̆ 7 s already there, writes Denis King. The cargo cults that developed in Melanesia in the late 19 th century based their culture on goods that would arrive from supernatural sources, and ignored or abandoned their traditional ways. They developed a view that {{there was no need to}} ensure that they looked after the resources that had sustained them over the years, on the basis that sustenance would fall from the sky. Health in Australia is a little like those cults, in that our community, including health professionals, continues to expect more money for health without looking seriously at how we consume the resources we currently use. That is not responsible use of public funds, or sustainable. We constantly hear that there is not enough money in health, but <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>correct?</b> I suspect not, although no-one can be certain. What is certain is that the cost of health funding can be a bottomless pit, as a result of the march of technology, the ageing of the population, and continually increasing public expectations. We need to concentrate on at least three basic areas: efficient and appropriate use of existing resources, effective workforce planning, and developing a rational set of community expectations of the health system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} {{fundamental}} problem of matching in two static images. The remaining challenges are related to occlusion and lack of texture. Our approach addresses these difficulties within a perceptual organization framework, considering both binocular and monocular cues. Initially, matching candidates for all pixels are generated {{by a combination of}} matching techniques. The matching candidates are then embedded in disparity space, where perceptual organization takes place in 3 D neighborhoods and, thus, does not suffer from problems associated with scanline or image neighborhoods. The assumption <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> matches produce salient, coherent surfaces, while wrong ones do not. Matching candidates that are consistent with the surfaces are kept and grouped into smooth layers. Thus, we achieve surface segmentation based on geometric and not photometric properties. Surface overextensions, which are due to occlusion, can be corrected by removing matches whose projections are not consistent in color with their neighbors of the same surface in both images. Finally, the projections of the refined surfaces on both images are used to obtain disparity hypotheses for unmatched pixels. The final disparities are selected after a second tensor voting stage, during which information is propagated from more reliable pixels to less reliable ones. We present results on widely used benchmark stereo pairs. Index Terms—Stereo, occlusion, pixel correspondence, computer vision, perceptual organization, tensor voting. ...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{assessment}} procedure based on knowledge space theory (KST) is presented {{along with a}} complete implementation of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) {{that has been used}} to test our theor- etical findings. The key idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>correct</b> assessment of the student knowledge is strictly related to the structure of the domain ontology. Suitable relationships between the concepts must be present to allow the creation of a reverse path from the ‘‘knowledge state’’ representing the student goal to the one that contains her actual knowledge about this topic. Knowledge space theory is a very good framework to guide the process of building the ontology used by the artificial tutor. The system we present uses a conversational agent to assess the student knowledge through a natural language question=answer procedure. The system exploits a Cyc-based common sense ontology about the spe- cific domain of interest to select the concepts needed to explain unknown topics emerging from the dialogue. Besides, the latent semantic analysis (LSA) technique is used to determine the correctness of the student sentences in order to establish which concepts she knows. As a result, the system sup- plies learning material arranged as a path between the unknown topics resulting from the student assessment. The learning path is presented to the student by a user-friendly graphical interface, which allows to access documents browsing a visual map. The procedure is explained in detail {{along with the rest of}} the system, and the assessment validation results are presented...|$|E
