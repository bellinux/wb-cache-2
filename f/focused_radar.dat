40|$|An {{integrated}} approach for generating <b>focused</b> <b>radar</b> images of multiple moving targets illuminated by a radar beam is presented. The proposed approach {{is based on}} time-varying filtering and is applied to time-frequency signatures of targets that do not overlap. The time-frequency technique {{to be used for}} this purpose is discussed in detail. Most of this work involves the development of filtering and reconstruction processes that allow for individual target motion compensation. The implementation of this approach when using the Gabor wavelet transform is discussed. It is shown that blur-ring caused by translational motion can not be avoided by using short integration times. Finally, an image enhancement technique via sidelobe apodization is incorporated. The sidelobe apodization technique is generalized so that higher resolution images are obtained using multiple parametric windows. The use of the proposed sidelobe apodization technique and selective motion compensation scheme generates high-resolution <b>focused</b> <b>radar</b> images that can not be obtained using conventional radar processors. The imaging of moving targets that appear within the same target image frame permits the identification of each target. The different methodologies presented in this dissertation allow for the generation and identification of simulated and real aircraft images. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the phase shift {{migration}} based Syn-thetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is described and applied on radar imaging for dual polarized {{ground penetrating radar}} system (GPR). Conventional techniques for SAR imaging focusing use the matched filter concept and convolve the measurement data with a filter impulse response (convolution kernel) which is modified by the range. In fact, conventional techniques for SAR imaging technique {{can be considered as}} ray-tracing based SAR imaging technique. It is an efficient technique to obtain <b>focused</b> <b>radar</b> images, when the medium is homogeneous so that the rays of EM wave propagation can be treated as straight lines. However, in case of layered materials the waves are refracted on the interface between two different materials. In contrast, phase shift migration based SAR imaging technique is through EM field extrapolation by phase shift to obtain the reflected EM intensity and radar imaging of scatterers ’ reflectivity in the radar illumination area. Although EM wave is refracted on the interface of different materials, the EM wave phase is unchanged. Compared to conventional SAR imaging technique, phase shift migration based SAR imaging approach is more suited to obtain <b>focused</b> <b>radar</b> subsurface imaging for GPR systems. In this paper the phase shift migration approach is applied to experimental data as well as practical measurement data. Meanwhile, a background removal algorithm and a spreading and exponential correcting technique is applied to improve the achievement. The presented focused subsurface and scatters radar imaging results show that phase shift migration based SAR technique is satisfied for radar subsurface imaging and inhomogeneous medium imaging.

40|$|For high {{resolution}} space-borne P-band SAR system, ionospheric effects could cause serious phase errors. These errors are causally {{related to the}} radar frequency and the TEC of ionosphere and make the image quality degraded. To guarantee the image quality, the ionosphere errors must be emended. Based on the mismatched filter model caused by ionosphere, it is pointed out that accurate ionosphere TEC is the key for phase error correction, a high precision ionosphere TEC measurement method is further put forward by using the phase errors of SAR echoes, which is validated by processing the data of a ground based P-band radar with well <b>focused</b> <b>radar</b> image of {{the international space station}} obtained.

40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of the atmosphere on a frequency-modulated electromagnetic wave traversing the ionosphere is becoming increasingly important for recent and upcoming low-frequency and wide-bandwidth spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. The ionized ionosphere induces Faraday rotation (FR) at these frequencies that affects radar polarimetry and causes signal path delays resulting in a reduced range res-olution. The work at hand introduces a simulation model of SAR signals passing through the atmosphere, including both frequency-dependent FR and path delays. Based on simulation results from this model [proven with real Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data], estimation of FR in quad-polarized SAR data using the given approach is shown for raw, range-compressed, and <b>focused</b> <b>radar</b> images.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging (ISAR) algorithm {{based on a}} new sparse prior, known as the logarithmic Laplacian prior. The newly proposed logarithmic Laplacian prior has a narrower main lobe with higher tail values than the Laplacian prior, which helps to achieve performance improvement on sparse representation. The logarithmic Laplacian prior is used for ISAR imaging within the Bayesian framework to achieve better <b>focused</b> <b>radar</b> image. In the proposed method of ISAR imaging, the phase errors are jointly estimated based on the minimum entropy criterion to accomplish autofocusing. The maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are utilized to estimate the model parameters to avoid manually tuning process. Additionally, the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Hadamard product are used to minimize the required computational efficiency. Experimental results based on both simulated and measured data validate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional sparse ISAR imaging algorithms in terms of resolution improvement and noise suppression...|$|E

Our method {{is based on}} a rotating monostatic radar network, which determines the positions of objects around the scanner via a continuously running lateration algorithm. The estimation of surfaces with ultrawideband radar networks has been studied experimentally in lab environments, especially with lateration, envelopes of spheres, and SEABED algorithms.

40|$|Time-reversal {{is a novel}} {{method to}} utilize the {{multipath}} components in a cluttered environment for super-resolution focusing. The conventional thought about the adverse effects of multipaths on communication systems has been changing based on recent findings showing how to use multipath components to create independent paths between transmitter and receiver. Time-reversal schemes are one of these recent techniques which can convert the traditionally hostile multipaths into performance-boosting elements in a two-way communication system as well as target detection, and localization systems in a cluttered channel. Time-reversal techniques utilize the scattering of waves in the medium to improve the resolution of focusing in multipath rich channels. The successful demonstrations of time-reversal experiments using low frequency waveforms in acoustics and ultrasonics have generated interest in time-reversal methods using radio-frequency electromagnetic waves. The wide-range of possible applications have ignited extensive research on this area. The work studied in this thesis is based on experimental investigation of time-reversal methods using electromagnetic waves. The ultimate aim is to demonstrate by experiments the gains achieved by electromagnetic time-reversal techniques over conventional <b>radar</b> methods to <b>focus</b> <b>radar</b> beams, to null the clutter environment and finally to detect targets in highly scattering environments...|$|R
30|$|Beam <b>focusing</b> of the <b>radar</b> {{itself could}} be used to cause {{ionisation}} and even breakdown in the stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower ionosphere. Such experiments have the potential to give information on a range of atmospheric properties and constituents that are not accessible by natural excitations. A somewhat related topic in the literature is microwave discharge in the stratosphere, which has been suggested for the mitigation of ozone depletion (Akmedzhanov et al. 1995). The transmit antenna of EISCAT_ 3 D needs to be designed appropriately to enable sufficient focusing for experiments on ionisation and breakdown in the upper atmosphere. The capability to <b>focus</b> the <b>radar</b> beam for Joule heating studies would also be useful to the development of solar power satellites, which would beam the energy back to Earth by microwaves (Leyser and Wong 2009).
