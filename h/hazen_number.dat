40|$|The {{removal of}} sewer solids at {{combined}} sewer overflow locations depends on the flow patterns inside the overflow structure {{on the one hand}} and on the sediment characteristics on the other hand. Flow conditions can be described by the residence time distribution; sewer sediments can be characterised by their settling velocity distribution. The combination of both distributions leads to a dimensionless efficiency curve, which gives the removal efficiency as a function of the <b>Hazen</b> <b>number.</b> For field conditions this efficiency curve is mainly influenced by the settling velocity distribution of the sewer sediments and, as a consequence, nearly identical efficiency curves are found for different types of prototype CSO structure. For design purposes, a methodology using return frequently analysis is proposed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model is presented and applied {{in the design of}} the secondary settling tanks of Psyttalia Wastewater Treatment Plant in Athens, Europe's largest sewage treatment facility. The tanks are of the Gould Type II consisting of the following regions: an inlet-flocculation chamber with an inlet baffle, two zones of settling separated by an intermediate baffle, an outlet region, and a sludge collection region. The number of tanks and their dimensions were determined with an empirical design procedure. Then, theoretical considerations, information from similar existing tanks, and preliminary CFD calculations were combined to determine the dimensions of the main regions and the positions of the baffles. Finally, detailed CFD calculations were performed to examine the performance of the tanks for various design conditions. Computations showed that the flow in the inlet-flocculation region was completely mixed; while in the settling regions a ""three-layer"" structure with relatively constant layer heights was observed. CFD results were processed to determine parameters of practical interest, including the heights of the sludge blankets and the effluent suspended solids concentrations; these parameters were correlated satisfactorily with the <b>Hazen</b> <b>number,</b> which is used as a scaling parameter in primary settling tanks.

500|$|Because the Canadians in the {{regiment}} {{were unable to}} return to their homes, many of them settled in camps near Albany and Fishkill, where they subsisted on handouts from Congress. General Hazen appealed to Congress to give them land grants, but this effort failed. [...] The state of New York eventually granted <b>Hazen</b> and a <b>number</b> of his men land {{in the northern part of}} the state near Lake Champlain.|$|R
