40|$|AbstractHeat waves pose {{serious health}} risks, and are {{expected}} to become more frequent, longer lasting, and more intense in the future under a changing climate. Yet, people in the UK seem to feel positive when thinking about hot weather. According to research on the affect heuristic, any positive or negative emotions evoked by potentially risky experiences may be used as cues to inform concerns about risk protection. If so, then their positive feelings toward hot weather might lead UK residents to lower intentions to adopt <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> behaviors. Here, we examine the relationships between <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> behaviors during the July 2013 UK heat wave and self-reports of having heard <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> recommendations, feeling positive affect about <b>heat,</b> seeing <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> measures as effective, and trusting the organizations making those recommendations. Responses to a national survey revealed that 55. 1 % of participants had heard <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> recommendations during the 2013 UK heat wave. Those who reported having heard recommendations also indicated having implemented more <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> behaviors, perceiving <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> behaviors as more effective, feeling more positive about heat, and intending to implement more protection behaviors in future hot summers. Mediation analyses suggested that <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> recommendations may motivate <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> behaviors by increasing their perceived effectiveness, but undermine their implementation by evoking positive affect about hot weather. We discuss our findings {{in the context of the}} affect heuristic and its implications for <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> communications...|$|R

40|$|Fabric {{assemblies}} for firefighting clothing {{have been}} tested for <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> and comfort. The constituent materials and fabric structures have been specifically selected and tailored for firefighters’ clothing. In order to do this, four types of outer shell fabrics, four types of moisture barrier fabrics, and four types of heat barriers with different weights and material compositions were {{used to make a}} multilayered fabric assembly. Heat transfer (flame), heat transfer (radiant), and water vapour resistance tests were conducted according to the latest EN 469 test standard which also recommends washing tests. These tests reveal that material content and material brand have considerable effect on the required performance levels of <b>heat</b> <b>protection.</b> In addition, while washing tests have improved water vapor transfer properties, they have a deteriorating effect on <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> performance.

IMCO added another coating - an aluminum-chromium-nitride (AlCrNX) formula - with the POW-R-FEED M924 end mill introduced in 2012.

40|$|The thermal {{protection}} required for decelerating and maneuvering spacecraft by aerodynamic forces is determined for return missions from geosynchronous to low Earth orbits. The effect of vehicle configuration on surface heating rates and selection of heat shield materials is analyzed. The {{effects of the}} current widespread estimates {{in the structure of}} atmospheric density are also evaluated. It is shown that nonequilibrium radiation can be a major source of surface heating during atmospheric entry and a significant factor for heat shielding requirements. It is also demonstrated that drag-brake concepts have application to a broad range of orbital transfer missions because of the favorable tradeoffs with aeromaneuvering vehicles in volumetric efficiency, retrothrust plane-change capability, and <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> requirements. In addition, {{the results of this study}} indicate that the aeroassist technique produces acceptable penalties in vehicle payload capacity for drag-brake concepts, because of the system's <b>heat</b> <b>protection</b> requirements, and is highly attractive relative to all-propulsive orbital change maneuvers...|$|R
