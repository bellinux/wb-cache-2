40|$|The goal of my {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to confirm}} or falsify the hypothesis if public relations activities are really the necessity for the government, specifically for the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic and to clarify their meaning. The theoretical part is focused on definitions, which are relating to public relations in <b>general</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions,</b> which are relating to public relations in the government. The practical part is dedicated to {{a description of the}} activities of the Communications Department of the Ministry of Finance, which provides the PR activities and then to a questionnaire survey and the analysis of its results. The thesis is mainly focused on the function of PR activities in the state administration, which are essential for the functioning of a modern democratic society as the government must be responsible for their activities to the citizens. The result of this thesis is, that public relations are really necessary for the Ministry of Finance...|$|E

Using the dynamic field theory as an illustrative example, we explain why one may want to perform such asynchronous computation and how one can implement it since this computational scheme draws several consequences on both the trajectories and the stability of the whole system. After giving an unequivocal definition of asynchronous computation, we present a few practically usable methods and quantitative bounds that can guarantee most of the mesoscopic properties of the system...|$|R
