5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials. In most cases, the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> {{in the form of a}} rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed <b>filler</b> <b>metal,</b> which often is stored on spools or coils.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E

All five braze <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> evaluated are considered suitable for joining TD-NiCrAl in terms of wettability and flow. Also, the braze alloys appear to be tolerant of slight variations in brazing procedures since joints prepared by three sources using three of the braze <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> exhibited similar brazing characteristics and essentially equivalent 1100 C stress-rupture properties in a brazed butt-joint configuration.

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. <b>Filler</b> <b>metal</b> is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as it is needed.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. <b>Filler</b> <b>metal</b> alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
40|$|The {{weld metal}} corrodes {{much faster than}} the parent metal, if Type 316 L welded with a {{matching}} filler is exposed to hot organic acids. Nine commercial <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> were evaluated by preparing welded coupons, and exposing these to different plant environments (with different organic acid mixtures and temperatures) for several months. The <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> were chosen to yield different solidification modes, and to vary chromium, molybdenum and nickel contents. Only <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> which are much more highly alloyed than the parent metal gave lower corrosion rates than the parent metal. Partitioning during and after solidification, and the average alloy content, both affect weld bead corrosion.

5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding <b>filler</b> <b>metal.</b> The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
25|$|The welder must add {{the filler}} rod to the molten puddle. The welder must also keep the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> {{in the hot}} outer flame zone when not adding it to the puddle to protect <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> from oxidation. Do not let the welding flame burn off the <b>filler</b> <b>metal.</b> The metal will not wet into the base metal and will look {{like a series of}} cold dots on the base metal. There is very little {{strength}} in a cold weld. When the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> is properly added to the molten puddle, the resulting weld will be stronger than the original base metal.|$|E
25|$|Undercutting is {{when the}} weld reduces the {{cross-sectional}} thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces {{the strength of the}} weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression {{along the length of the}} weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect <b>filler</b> <b>metal,</b> because it will create greater temperature gradients between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.|$|E

The conditions of experiments were made possibly close to those existing in a molten metal drop in the welding processes. Findings: Based on the models of nitrogen absorption during levitation and arc melting of Fe-C-Mn <b>filler</b> <b>metals,</b> the time-dependent changes of nitrogen content were determined as well as the mass transfer coefficients b and the rates of nitrogen absorption. Nitrogen absorption rate decreases along with the increase of oxygen content in the Fe-C-Mn <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> arc-melted in the Ar+N 2 atmosphere. Research limitations/implications: Investigation of the Fe-C-Mn complex alloys with the specified amount of impurities makes the detailed analysis of the elementary stages of nitrogen dissolution more difficult, yet brings the experiment conditions closer to those occurring in the actual welding processes. Practical implications: Recognizing the mechanisms of nitrogen absorption under arc and non-arc melting to make possible the control of nitrogen level in the welds.

25|$|Lugged steel {{construction}} uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs, external fittings made {{of pieces of}} steel (sometimes stainless steel) which fit over {{the ends of the}} tubing. Before assembly, the builder cuts the tubes to the desired length and precisely mitres their ends, providing a tight fit. The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently brazed with a silver or brass <b>filler</b> <b>metal.</b> The lug greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may use a small positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Filler</b> <b>metal</b> (electrode material) {{improperly}} {{chosen for}} the environmental conditions can make them corrosion-sensitive as well. There are also issues of galvanic corrosion if the electrode composition is sufficiently dissimilar to the materials welded, or the materials are dissimilar themselves. Even between different grades of nickel-based stainless steels, corrosion of welded joints can be severe, despite that they rarely undergo galvanic corrosion when mechanically joined.|$|E
500|$|Welding {{dissimilar}} metals often introduces new difficulties to GTAW welding, {{because most}} materials do not easily fuse {{to form a}} strong bond. However, welds of dissimilar materials have numerous applications in manufacturing, repair work, and the prevention of corrosion and oxidation. In some joints, a compatible <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> is chosen to help form the bond, and this <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> can {{be the same as}} one of the base materials (for example, using a stainless steel <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> with stainless steel and carbon steel as base materials), or a different metal (such as the use of a nickel <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> for joining steel and cast iron).

500|$|Manual gas {{tungsten}} arc welding {{is a relatively}} difficult welding method, due to the coordination required by the welder. [...] Similar to torch welding, GTAW normally requires two hands, since most applications require that the welder manually feed a <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> into the weld area with one hand while manipulating the welding torch in the other. Maintaining a short arc length, while preventing contact between the electrode and the workpiece, is also important.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} {{electrode}} for SMAW {{depends on a}} number of factors, including the weld material, welding position and the desired weld properties. The electrode is coated in a metal mixture called flux, which gives off gases as it decomposes to prevent weld contamination, introduces deoxidizers to purify the weld, causes weld-protecting slag to form, improves the arc stability, and provides alloying elements to improve the weld quality. Electrodes can be divided into three groupsthose designed to melt quickly are called [...] "fast-fill" [...] electrodes, those designed to solidify quickly are called [...] "fast-freeze" [...] electrodes, and intermediate electrodes go by the name [...] "fill-freeze" [...] or [...] "fast-follow" [...] electrodes. Fast-fill electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the welding speed can be maximized, while fast-freeze electrodes supply <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> that solidifies quickly, making welding in a variety of positions possible by preventing the weld pool from shifting significantly before solidifying.|$|E
500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, the electrode {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|E
30|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{in-service}} life, oxide formation poses considerable difficulties. When the joint is exposed to the environment, Al easily oxidises, which results in resistance to the electric current flow. Moreover, the brittle intermetallic compounds grow while in service, degrading the weld properties. Brittle intermetallic compounds can be avoided by utilising the phase diagram of Al and Cu to select appropriate welding processes and parameters and suitable <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> and by controlling the dilution effect between the base <b>metals</b> and <b>filler</b> <b>metals.</b> Hence, to reduce manufacturing costs, there is a need to examine further factors that influence intermetallic compound formation and its effect on the joint.|$|R

2500|$|Brazing is a joining {{process in}} which a <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> is melted and drawn into a {{capillary}} formed by the assembly {{of two or more}} work pieces.

[...] Brazing is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of [...] [...] Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because alloying elements can not segregate and precipitate.|$|E

2500|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{commonly}} called MIG (for metal/inert-gas), is a semi-automatic or automatic welding process with a continuously fed consumable wire acting as both electrode and <b>filler</b> <b>metal,</b> along with an inert or semi-inert shielding gas flowed around the wire to protect the weld site from contamination. [...] Constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current alternating current are used as well.

[...] Originally developed for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s, GMAW was soon economically applied to steels. Today, GMAW is commonly used in industries such as the automobile industry for its quality, versatility and speed. [...] Because of the need to maintain a stable shroud of shielding gas around the weld site, it can be problematic to use the GMAW process in areas of high air movement such as outdoors.|$|E
