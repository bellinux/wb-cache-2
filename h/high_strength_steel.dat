5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced <b>High</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Steel</b> (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steel.</b> Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E

This thesis consists of four parts. In Part I, the emphasis was put on the effects of the material imperfections on the fatigue strength of materials and this part consists of an extensive literature study and a microscopic examination of the fracture surfaces of the base material of very <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels.</b> Part II presents a literature survey on the fatigue crack repair methods and the results of the experimental programme of the current study.

In Part III, fatigue strength prediction models were evaluated and a comparison was made between the fatigue strength curves from the prediction models and the fatigue strength curves of the test results.

Corresponding to this trend, POSCO is developing various automotive steel products with advanced performance. Conventional advanced <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> such as DP and TRIP steels are now expanding their application since the <b>steels</b> exhibit <b>higher</b> <b>strength</b> and ductility than those of conventional solution and precipitation strengthened <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels.</b> Efforts {{have been made to}} enhance the mechanical performance of these steels such as ductility, hole expansion ratio, deep drawability, etc. Current research is focused on development of extra- and ultra-AHSS. Extra-AHSS are designed to utilize nano-scale retained austenite embedded in fine bainite and martensite. Ultra-AHSS are designed to have austenite as the major phase, and the ductility is enhanced primarily by continuous strain hardening generated during forming. These steels including extra- and ultra-AHSS are believed to be the next generation automotive steels which will replace the existing <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> due to their extremely <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> and ductility combinations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} a big demand for {{increased}} vehicle safety and weight reduction of auto-bodies. An extensive use of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> is one of the ways to answer the requirement. Since the crashworthiness is improved by applications of <b>higher</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> to crashworthiness conscious structural components, various types of advanced <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> have been developed. The crash energy during frontal collisions is absorbed by the buckling and bending deformations of thin wall tube structures of the crushable zone of auto-bodies. In the case of side collision, on the other hand, a limited length of crushable zone requires the components to minimize the deformation during the collision. The lower the strength during press forming, the better the press formability is expected. However, the <b>higher</b> the <b>strength</b> at a collision event, the better the crashworthiness can be obtained. It can, therefore, be concluded that steels with higher strain rate sensitivities are desired. Combinations of soft ferrite phase and other hard phases were found to improve the strain rate sensitivity of flow stresses. Bake hardening {{is also one of the}} ways to improve the strain rate sensitivity of flow stresses...|$|R

It {{is still an}} open question what the highest fatigue limits are and how to increase them further in <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels.</b> A thermomechanical treatment (TMT) in the temperature range of maximal dynamic strain ageing is an auspicious way to increase the fatigue limit of bearing steel SAE 52100. Successful attempts have been published for various materials states. The present investigation deals with the influence of non-metallic inclusions on the fatigue limit and the possibility to increase the fatigue limit by TMT. The fatigue limit of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> increases by reducing {{the size of the}} non-metallic inclusions during steelmaking. We found that TMT increases the fatigue limit of a <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> materials state only in cases in which the non-metallic inclusions are the starting points of the fatigue cracks. In the case of high cleanliness of the steel the origin of the fatigue cracks may be at any position in the matrix. If there are no critical non-metallic inclusions a TMT did not increase the fatigue limit further. The reasons for this behaviour will be explained and the border of the fatigue limit of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steels</b> will be discussed...|$|R
