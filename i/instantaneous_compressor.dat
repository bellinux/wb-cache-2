40|$|An {{approximate}} {{theory is}} presented for post-stall transients in multistage axial compression systems. The theory {{leads to a}} set of three simultaneous nonlinear third-order partial differential equations for pressure rise, and average and disturbed values of flow coefficient, as functions of time and angle around the compressor. By a Galerkin procedure, angular dependence is averaged, and the equations become first order in time. These final equations are capable of describing the growth and possible decay of a rotating-stall cell during a compressor mass-flow transient. It is shown how rotating-stall-like and surgelike motions are coupled through these equations, and also how the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>compressor</b> pumping characteristic changes during the transient stall process...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the theory}} {{developed}} in Part I, calculations {{have been carried}} out to show the evolution of the mass flow, pressure rise, and rotating-stall cell amplitude during compression system post-stall transients. In particular, it is shown that the unsteady growth or decay of the stall cell can {{have a significant effect on}} the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>compressor</b> pumping characteristic and hence on the overall system behavior. A limited parametric study is carried out to illustrate the impact of different system features on transient behavior. It is shown, for example, that the ultimate mode of system response, surge or stable rotating stall, depends not only on the B parameter, but also on the compressor length-to-radius ratio. Small values of this latter quantity tend to favor the occurrence of surge, as do large values of B. Based on the analytical and numerical results, several specific topics are suggested for future research on post-stall transients...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of two faoilities at N. P. L. designed to produce short-duration, high-enthalpy flows. These facilities tie both shock tubes, the first driven electrically, the second gasdynsmically using an adiabatic piston <b>compressor.</b> <b>Instantaneous</b> and streak photographs of the flow show that, although the electromagnetic shock tube is capable of producing higher enthalpies, the resulting flow is not of the ideal one-dimensional blast-wave form. The piston-compression shock tube produces a length of shock-heated gas of almost constant velooity, which would be more useful for most aerodynamic studies...|$|R

To obtain a high temporal resolution of mass flow data, a flowmeter based on the differential pressure method has been developed. It is capable of detecting negative flow for investigations of dynamic effects in small centrifugal compressors used for turbocharging automotive internal combustion engines. Experiments were performed at a hot gas test bench focusing on the surge characteristics at different turbocharger speeds {{and the influence of}} volume modifications downstream of the <b>compressor.</b> <b>Instantaneous</b> operating points could be traced in the compressor map including the typical orbits at deep surge resulting from the cyclic character of the phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The flow in {{turbocharger}} compressors and turbines for automotive {{engine application}} is highly unsteady in nature, as it {{responds to the}} intake and exhaust manifolds of the internal combustion engine. The optimization of the turbocharger system is therefore a very difficult task, since only steady flow maps are generally provided by turbocharger manufacturer. For several years a specialized components test facility operates at the University of Genoa, particularly suitable to test turbochargers under steady and unsteady flow conditions. The test bench has been continuously upgraded in order to study components under pulsating flow condition by using different layout configurations. A recent set-up {{makes it possible to}} study turbocharger compressor under unsteady flow condition by using a rotating valve pulse generator system. Measurements of pressure signals downstream the <b>compressor,</b> <b>instantaneous</b> mass flow rate and turbocharger rotational speed are performed. In the paper the effect of both pulse characteristics (frequency - i. e., engine rotational speed -, amplitude and mean value) on compressor performance is analyzed. In particular the attention is focused on the surge limit position under unsteady flow operation...|$|R
40|$|Detailed time {{resolved}} {{measurements of}} centrifugal compressor surge has been obtained on an automotive turbocharger for {{two very different}} compression systems one with a large downstream volume and one with a much smaller downstream volume. These measurements show impeller stall at the inducer tips {{to be a key}} phenomena in initiating surge. The inducer tip stall, which is dominant over other types of stall in the compressor, is observed to be non-rotating and asymmetric due to the presence of an asymmetric downstream volute. The most severe stalling of the impeller occurs at a circumferential position nearest the volute tongue position and is due to a circumferential flow distortion set up by the. volute. The vaneless diffuser is seen to be destabilizing but does not initiate surge by abrupt stalling. Rotating stall was found to be unimportant in surge initiation. New evidence is presented concerning the dynamic behavior of the compressor characteristics in surge operation. <b>Instantaneous</b> <b>compressor</b> characteristics in surge when operating in a large volume(large B-parameter) system are found to be flatter than the time averaged ones for a small volume(small B-parameter) stabilized system. A physical mechanism accounting for {{the difference between the two}} measured characteristics is the slow development time and differing circumferential extent of the inducer stall present. The flatness of the large B characteristic contrasts with the characteristic of an axial. compressor operating in surge and leads to slow growth of the surge massflow instability. A dynamic model has been developed which includes effects of speed variations, compressibility, and time lags. The inclusion of speed variations changes the time domain behavior of the compression system substantially from the results obtained with constant speed. A precursor period of mild surge whose length depends on the amount of throttling is shown to be present before deep surge and is due to the speed variations. Both speed variations and time lags in compressor behavior are shown to introduce a stabilizing effect on compressor behavior in mild surge. The results of this model agree qualitatively as well as quantitatively with the measured experimental system dynamic behavior. The dynamic behavior observed has some properties of importance for the new field of active control of surge instabilities in centrifugal compressors. The flatness of the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>compressor</b> characteristic, the existence of a mild surge precursor period, and slow growth of the surge instability are favorable conditions for a relatively simple active control strategy to stabilize the compression system and eliminate surge. Also the dynamic model developed may be useful for exploring alternative active control strategies.

40|$|Downsizing with {{turbocharging}} is {{the most}} promising way, {{especially in terms of}} cost, to get reduced fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions particularly in the case of Spark Ignition engines. In automotive applications the turbocharger turbine usually operates under heavy unsteady flow conditions due to the opening and closing of engine valves. However, in the case of extremely downsized engines with a reduced number of cylinders and a small intake circuit volume also the compressor performance can be affected by the unsteady flow generated by the engine intake valves. To make simulation models able to accurately predict engine performance, a better understanding of compressor and turbine pulsating flow performance can be accomplished through measurements performed on specialized test facilities, using suitable measuring equipment. As regards the turbocharger compressor, the surge line position under pulsating flow conditions is another important aspect to be considered. In the paper the results of a broad experimental investigation performed on a small turbocharger compressor matched to a downsized gasoline engine are presented. Measurements were developed on the test facility operating at the University of Genoa, which allows investigations on automotive turbochargers both under steady and unsteady flow conditions. Tested turbocharger compressor was coupled to the automotive engine intake circuit and the pulsating flow was generated by a motor-driven cylinder head fitted with a variable valve actuation system. Different levels of turbocharger rotational speed and different intake valve opening strategies were considered. For each operating condition compressor unsteady performance was evaluated starting from measurement of several instantaneous parameters (inlet and outlet static pressure, mass flow rate and turbocharger rotational speed). A significant deviation of <b>compressor</b> <b>instantaneous</b> performance from steady state was observed, resulting in a hysteresis loop surrounding the steady state curve...|$|R
