5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to harass Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had been raped in prison. The brutality of Noriega's activities led to him being suspended for ten days, an <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that was picked up by the U.S. intelligence services.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{legitimate}} {{e-mail messages}} from companies {{to their customers}} contain an <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion ("Dear PayPal customer") {{it is likely to}} be an attempt at phishing. Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers. However, recent research has shown that the public do not typically distinguish between the first few digits and the last few digits of an account number—a significant problem since the first few digits are often the same for all clients of a financial institution.|$|E
25|$|A good map has to {{compromise}} between portraying the items of interest (or themes) {{in the right}} place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. A good example from the late 1980s was the Ordnance Survey's first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from ground truth, when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.|$|E

5000|$|The {{possibility}} {{exists that}} the majority <b>of</b> <b>information</b> known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but {{that the majority}} <b>of</b> <b>information</b> known to each member individually, supports {{the other side of}} the issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware <b>of</b> 3 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> supporting job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> supporting job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> supporting candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware <b>of</b> more <b>information</b> supporting B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job. This circumstance, first studied by Stasser and Titus, is known as a [...] "hidden profile" [...] and is more likely to occur as group size increases and as the proportion of shared versus unshared <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> increases.|$|R

50|$|Collation {{differs from}} {{classification}} in that classification {{is concerned with}} arranging information into logical categories, while collation {{is concerned with the}} ordering <b>of</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> usually based on the form of their identifiers. Formally speaking, a collation method typically defines a total order on a set of possible identifiers, called sort keys, which consequently produces a total preorder on the set <b>of</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (<b>items</b> with the same identifier are not placed in any defined order).|$|R

60|$|This <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> was {{imparted}} {{to us by}} a {{most extraordinary}} individual, a genuine South Sea vagabond, who came alongside of us in a whale-boat {{as soon as we}} entered the bay, and, by the aid of some benevolent persons at the gangway, was assisted on board, for our visitor was in that interesting stage of intoxication when a man is amiable and helpless. Although he was utterly unable to stand erect, or to navigate his body across the deck, he still magnanimously proffered his services to pilot the ship to a good and secure anchorage. Our captain, however, rather distrusted his ability in this respect, and refused to recognise his claim to the character he assumed; but our gentleman was determined to play his part, for, by dint of much scrambling, he succeeded in getting into the weather-quarter boat, where he steadied himself by holding on to a shroud, and then commenced issuing his commands with amazing volubility and very peculiar gestures. Of course, no one obeyed his orders; but as it was impossible to quiet him, we swept by the ships of the squadron with this strange fellow performing his antics in full view of all the French officers.|$|E
