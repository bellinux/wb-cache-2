5|$|The writers {{intended}} to play off {{the idea of}} a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie—on whose birthday the episode would be set—absent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that her head was in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake; they noted that the prop cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers upped the drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> do not in the final version.|$|E

500|$|Vigilantism in pre-{{territorial}} {{and territorial}} Montana {{has been written}} about, romanticized and chronicled in personal memoirs, biographies, documentary and scholarly works, film and fiction {{for well over a}} century. The first book published in Montana was Thomas J. Dimsdale's 1866 first edition of The Vigilantes of Montana, [...] which was compiled from a series of newspaper articles he wrote for the Montana Post in 1865. [...] Historical analysis of the period ranges from disrepute to heroism, with debates over whether the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time meant the vigilantes acted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> thought was best for their communities or if modern standards of due process should govern analysis of their actions.|$|E
500|$|In a {{departure}} from previous Fringe trailers, Fox created and premiered a [...] "grandiose movie-style" [...] trailer at Entertainment Weeklys website to celebrate the airing of [...] "Entrada".

As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in [...] "Entrada", with the intention of having [...] "students learn about scientific intuition and how it can facilitate the scientific method of collecting data through experimentation and observation in order to formulate and test a hypothesis".|$|E

[...] He concluded by saying [...] "Overall, Spiritual Machines is a lovely album from start to finish, and even better, it is an album {{that will make you}} wonder." [...] Cheryl Hunter of the Hartford Courant [...] said that [...] "It may sound formulaic, yet Maida's intelligent songwriting and nasally, but forthright vocals make Our Lady Peace more than just another faceless modern rock band." [...] Bartley Kives of Winnipeg Free Press gave the album 3 stars out of 5, saying that Our Lady Peace had finally gotten control of their sound and calling it [...] "easily the finest thing they've ever created." ...|$|E

500|$|Marquis {{first took}} up writing {{around the turn}} of the century, writing {{newspaper}} articles. [...] In 1922 he was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He resigned after only ten weeks, but he was there long enough to realize that several participants of the Custer battle were still alive. Between 1923 and 1926 Marquis practiced medicine privately on the Crow Reservation but then tried to make writing his permanent career. Throughout his life Marquis was often in debt; his writing was sometimes interrupted by the need to earn money at medicine, or even his original career of typesetting. From 1926 he returned to his contacts among the Cheyenne, interviewing them in depth. The trust he developed with them allowed them to open up to him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had not with any other outsiders. The result formed the bulk of Marquis' most important works.|$|E
500|$|With the {{dissolution}} of the Fasci, the unrest on Sicily did not subside. In January 1898, peasants demanding work and bread ransacked the town hall in Siculiana. In the fall of 1901, Sicilian peasants – following the example of numerous agrarian strikes that were affecting the whole of Italy – again set off a wave of agrarian unrest, conscious of the fact that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> resumed [...] "the march abruptly interrupted in 1894 by the repression of the Fasci." [...] Just as the Fasci movement, one of the main goals of the 1901 strikes and was a revision of the land leases to undermine the economic power of the gabellotti. After the First World War the communist movement In Sicily built on the incipient organisational structures of the Fasci, such as during the Biennio Rosso. The Fasci inspired social struggle in Sicily well into the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Another account, not {{published}} until 1982, {{is that of}} former Montana Supreme Court Justice (1922–1935) Lew L. Callaway. [...] Edited by his son Lew Callaway Jr., Montana's Righteous Hangmen:The Vigilantes in Action stems from Callaway's association with vigilante Captain James William in the late 1800s. [...] Lew Callaway wrote extensively about the vigilantes and his stories which add more intimate details about how the vigilantes operated are captured in this volume. Although some vigilante activities during this period were criticized by citizens and civic leaders, {{there was a general}} affirmation of their purpose and contribution to law and order in a growing territory. [...] Mark C. Dillon's Montana Vigilantes 1863–1870 Gold, Guns and Gallows (2013) concludes that given the lawless environment and criminal activity in Alder Gulch and Helena at the time, the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time, the vigilantes acted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> thought was best for their communities. [...] He contends that judging the vigilantes by today's understanding and standards of due process is problematic.|$|E

500|$|In a November 2007 {{interview}} with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated {{that a couple}} of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street [...] "were just too Odyssey Number Five based", and that the first track, [...] "Rockin' Rocks", was [...] "probably the start of where we were heading" [...] with the album". Cashmere stated that the album was [...] "the toughest [...] heard Powderfinger sound". Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, he described Vulture Street as [...] "a rawer, louder" [...] album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five; it highlighted Fanning's [...] "talent as a lyricist" [...] and stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> haven't since their 1994 debut".

500|$|Meanwhile, James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) {{is upset}} that Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{cross-dressing}} on TGS {{because it is}} demeaning to African-Americans. After a bit of objection, Toofer convinces Tracy to stop, handing the female character over to Josh Girard (Lonny Ross). Once Josh's character is successful, Tracy is upset with Toofer. Liz convinces Toofer to work with Tracy. As they work together, Tracy gets upset with Toofer's supposed lack of blackness, and endearingly calls Toofer a racial slur. The next morning, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), Liz, Toofer, and Tracy {{sit down for a}} meeting about Tracy's vocabulary from the previous night. Tracy and Jack point out that the African-American community has adopted the word to deprive it of its meaning. In trying to reach out to Tracy, Toofer says the word again but because of his perceived cultural whiteness, everyone, including Tracy, is offended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> weren't when Tracy used the term. Tracy and Toofer attend sensitivity training, start arguing, and in the process develop a new sketch for TGS. When show starts running short on time, Liz offers Tracy the option to either air the sketch or one from the Star Jones cooking show, Tracy chooses the latter. Toofer is initially upset, but agrees with Tracy's decision when he finds the sketch funny.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the songs}} on Sucker Punch are {{highlighted}} with orchestrations and a rock edge. De Vries said that during the songs' production [...] "there was {{a substantial amount of}} reinvention, in several different directions", helped by Snyder giving the composers free reins. Bates added that there was an attempt to [...] "expand the scope of the songs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were never heard before", with [...] "crazy electronic" [...] and [...] "alternative guitar work" [...] - [...] "it's a bit over the top, but so is everything on screen." [...] The versions of the songs tried to match the action on-screen: Bates detailed that [...] "White Rabbit" [...] "starts out very ethereal, getting [...] into the mindset of the dance, and once the girls have their assignment, once they delve in with machineguns and other weapons, the song starts to bloom into this epic, rich, full orchestral choral fanfare." [...] This correspondence lead to the tracks getting longer and alternating between the songs themselves and [...] "a score that is reminiscent of songs sometimes", which Bates described as [...] "playing in the consciousness of the characters [...]" [...] For instance, [...] "White Rabbit" [...] features a choir of 150 voices playing the vocal melody of the first verse of the song, and tracks such as [...] "Search & Destroy" [...] have [...] "moments where Zach really wanted to blow it up into [...] huge orchestra".|$|E

500|$|Powderfinger's Vulture Street was {{released}} on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No.1 in Australia; while in New Zealand it reached No.17. Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for {{the location of the}} band's first recording room in West End, Brisbane. The Sydney Morning Heralds music critic Bernard Zuel approved of [...] "a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album" [...] with [...] "a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect"; he felt it had Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had not since their 1994 debut" [...] album. Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having [...] "opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs". Middleton described the band's aim was to [...] "get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie, Zeppelin, Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s. We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record. It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape, of course. It's fairly organic in that sense". Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003: [...] "Album of the Year", [...] "Best Group", [...] "Best Rock Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art" [...] (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are: [...] "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind", [...] "Since You've Been Gone", [...] "Love Your Way", and [...] "Sunsets".

500|$|Following the {{commercial}} and critical success of her 1986 album, Control, Jackson was motivated to continue songwriting and took {{a larger role in}} the creative production of her new album. Executives at A requested that she expand on the ideas presented on Control, suggesting a concept album entitled Scandal that would have been about the Jackson family. She wrote a song titled [...] "You Need Me" [...] which was directed at her father Joseph, but was unwilling to devote an entire album to the subject and substituted her own concept for theirs. She commented that [...] " [...] lot of people wanted me to do another album like Control and that's what I didn't want to do. I wanted to do something [...] that I really believed in and that I really felt strong about." [...] The concept of Rhythm Nation emerged as Jackson was a TV watcher, [...] "We would watch BET, MTV... then switched over to CNN, and there'd always be something messed-up happening. It was never good news, always bad news", producer James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris recalled. [...] "State of the World" [...] was one of these songs, influenced by TV and news. Jam recalled that with the song, they were trying to do something like Marvin Gaye's song [...] "What's Going On" [...] although we never could hope to achieve that, but still wanted to make people aware of what was happening <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could dance to it.
