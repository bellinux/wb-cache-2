40|$|A rotary {{coupling}} for connecting a driven part to {{a source}} of rotary force is described. This device transmits rotary force in one direction only and disengages to permit the driven part to <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> when the input member is stopped and precludes the backdriving of rotary force from output member to input member. The coupling includes an input member having a splined shaft, a coupling member connected to the splined shaft, and a coaxial output member. The coupling member and the output member having complementary sets of axially facing clutch teeth. Guides {{in the form of}} helical grooves on the coupling member and spring loaded followers acting with the guides affect the engagement and disengagement of the clutch teeth by moving the coupling member toward and away from output member, the followers and guides themselves disengaging to permit <b>free</b> <b>wheeling</b> of output member when input member is stopped...|$|R

50|$|The car was {{designed}} by magazine editor F.J. Camm and G.A. Broomfield and powered by an air-cooled Johnson 192 cc two-stroke flat twin engine, driving the single rear wheel by a chain. The engine was more commonly found in outboard motors and mopeds. There was no reverse, but a <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> mechanism was fitted to help manoeuvring the machine by hand.|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} indicates that intrinsic differences and induced changes in aerobic capacity are probably to {{play a critical role}} in the development of chronic diseases like cancer. This study was initiated: (i) to determine how citrate synthase activity, which is routinely used as a marker of aerobic capacity and mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle, was affected by voluntary running on either a motorized activity wheel or a non-motorized <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> and (ii) to investigate the association between aerobic capacity and the carcinogenic response induced in the mammary gland by intraperitoneal injection of 1 -methyl- 1 -nitrosurea. Overall, wheel running reduced cancer incidence (96 versus 72 %, P =[*] 0. 0006) and the number of cancers per animal (2. 84 versus 1. 78, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and induced citrate synthase activity (276 versus 353 U/mg, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001, sedentary control versus wheel running,respectively). Both motorized and <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> running increased citrate synthase activity (373 [*]±[*] 24, 329 [*]±[*] 11 and 276 [*]±[*] 9 U/mg protein, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and reduced the average number of cancers per rat (2. 84, 1. 96 and 1. 63, P[*]<[*] 0. 01), sedentary control, <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> and motorized wheel, respectively. However, regression analyses failed to provide evidence of a significant association between citrate synthase activity and either cancer incidence or cancer multiplicity. Citrate synthase activity is a single measure in a complex pathway that determines aerobic capacity. The multifaceted nature of intrinsic and inducible aerobic capacity limits the usefulness of citrate synthase activity alone in elucidating the relationship between aerobic capacity and the carcinogenic response...|$|R

25|$|Descending any {{significant}} gradient {{is more difficult}} as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down.
