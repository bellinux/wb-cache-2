5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very <b>dark</b> <b>night,</b> the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|At {{least four}} of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of {{spectral}} class K. The second brightest star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, an orange subgiant of spectral type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 512 times its luminosity. Located 127 light years away from Earth, it {{has been described as}} yellow or reddish in appearance. Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system: the brighter component, Epsilon Telescopii A, is an orange giant of spectral type K0III with an apparent magnitude of +4.52, while the 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21 arcseconds away from the primary, and just visible with a 15cm aperture telescope on a <b>dark</b> <b>night.</b> The system is 417 light-years away. Iota Telescopii and HD 169405—magnitude 5 orange giants of spectral types K0III and K0.5III respectively—make up the quartet. They are around 370 and 497 light-years away from the Sun respectively. Another ageing star, Kappa Telescopii is a yellow giant with a spectral type G9III and apparent magnitude of 5.18. Around 1.87 billion years old, this star of around 1.6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun's diameter. It is approximately 293 light-years from Earth, and is another optical double.|$|E

25|$|The Ascent of Mount Carmel {{is a more}} {{systematic}} study of the ascetical endeavour of a soul looking for perfect union, God and the mystical events happening along the way. Although it begins as a commentary on the poem The <b>Dark</b> <b>Night,</b> it rapidly drops this format, having commented {{on the first two}} stanzas of the poem, and becomes a treatise. It was composed sometime between 1581 and 1585.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> {{the bow of}} the Helena floated {{for some}} time with the ship number 50 showing. It became a {{lifeboat}} of sorts, until friendly forces not knowing what it was almost fired at it. But the USS Radford illuminated the unknown object and identified it as a ship's prow. Finally the destroyer put a searchlight on the floating wreckage and it was identified as the remains of the Helena. The bow would sink later the next day.|$|E

In 2017 the Studio Theatre was named in honor of Pitt alumnus Richard E. Raugh who donated $1 million to support it and the university's theater productions.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic dust {{is widely}} present in space, where {{gas and dust}} clouds are primary {{precursors}} for planetary systems. The zodiacal light, as seen in a <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> sky, is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the Sun. The tails of comets are produced by emissions of dust and ionized gas {{from the body of}} the comet. Dust also covers solid planetary bodies, and vast dust storms occur on Mars that cover almost the entire planet. Interstellar dust is found between the stars, and high concentrations produce diffuse nebulae and reflection nebulae.|$|E

25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren heard the sound of the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett's flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. The <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> hid the size of Bartlett's force from close scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s {{there were}} a spate of film dealing with various aspects of heavenly administration: Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Heaven Can Wait (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and It’s a Wonderful Life (1946). Beckett {{may or may not}} have seen any of these; at the very least he would have likely read about them. Significantly the opening camera shot of It’s a Wonderful Life dissolves slowly upward into the star-filled, <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> sky where two {{pulsating}} galaxies of light come into view. Two heavenly angels are conversing together in the film's otherworldly opening. In Rough for Theatre II, Bertrand and Morvan take time out to specifically discuss the starry night sky.|$|E
25|$|Although Kammhuber was sceptical about radar, he {{established}} Kombinierte Nachtjagdgebiete (Combined Night Fighting Zones) around prime targets in which fighters cooperated with Würzburg sets supported by AAA. Although not successful at first, results soon improved. It was halted around October 1940, {{as a lack}} of long-range radar made it an unsuitable method. A second system, suggested by Diehl, involved a Freya married to a searchlight (Parasitanlage, or Parasite installation). It was designated Dunkelnachtjagd (<b>Dark</b> <b>Night</b> Fighting). It proved difficult to implement owing to production delays with the Freya. Kammhuber began to realise the potential of airborne radar at this time. After consulting Wolfgang Martini, a technical specialist in the Luftwaffe, the development of Lichtenstein radar began.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} the parable describes normal men, experiencing a large statue on a <b>dark</b> <b>night,</b> or with blindfold masking their eyes experiencing a large object by feeling it. They then describe {{what it is they}} experienced. In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts of 1st millennium CE or before. The story also appears in 2nd millennium Sufi and Bahá’í lore. The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet John Godfrey Saxe creating his own version as a poem. The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted in a variety of ways.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Dark</b> <b>Night</b> (from {{which the}} spiritual term takes its name) narrates {{the journey of}} the soul from its bodily home to union with God. It happens during the night, which {{represents}} the hardships and difficulties met in detachment from the world and reaching {{the light of the}} union with the Creator. There are several steps in this night, which are related in successive stanzas. The main idea of the poem {{can be seen as the}} painful experience that people endure as they seek to grow in spiritual maturity and union with God. The poem of this title was likely written in 1578 or 1579. In 1584-5, John wrote a commentary on the first two stanzas and first line of the third stanza of the poem.|$|E
25|$|Diwali or Deepavali is the Hindu {{festival of}} lights celebrated {{every year in}} autumn in the {{northern}} hemisphere (spring in southern hemisphere). It is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. One {{of the most popular}} festivals of Hinduism, it spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair. Its celebration includes millions of lights shining on housetops, outside doors and windows, around temples and other buildings in the communities and countries where it is observed. The festival preparations and rituals typically extend over a five-day period, but the main festival night of Diwali coincides with the <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> of the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika in Bikram Sambat calendar (the month of Aippasi in Tamil Calendar), on the 15th of the month. In the Gregorian calendar, Diwali night falls between mid-October and mid-November.|$|E
