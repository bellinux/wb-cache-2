40|$|Nanofibres {{prepared}} by electrospinning have shown enormous potential for various applications. They are obtained predominantly {{in the form}} of nonwoven <b>fibre</b> <b>webs.</b> The 2 -dimensional nonwoven feature and fragility have considerably confined their further processing into fabrics through knitting or weaving. Nanofibre yarns, which are nanofibre bundles with continuous length and a twist feature, show improved tensile strength, offering opportunities for making 3 -dimensional fibrous materials with precisely controlled fibrous architecture, porous features and fabric dimensions. Despite a few techniques having been developed for electrospinning nanofibre yarns, they are chiefly based on the needle electrospinning technique, which often has low nanofibre productivity. In this study, we for the first time report a nanofibre yarn electrospinning technique which combines both needle and needleless electrospinning. A rotating intermediate ring collector was employed to directly collect freshly-electrospun nanofibres into a fibrous cone, which was further drawn and twisted into a nanofibre yarn. This novel system was able to produce high tenacity yarn (tensile strength 128. 9 MPa and max strain 222. 1 %) at a production rate of 240 m h - 1, with a twist level up to 4700 twists per metre.

Electrospun fibres were produced from PVdF (polyvinylidene fluoride) and nanomagnetite (Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles) from solutions of PVdF in dimethylacetamide containing Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle contents ranging from 3 to 10 [*]wt%.

40|$|Nonwoven fabrics are web {{structures}} of randomly-oriented fibres, bonded {{by means of}} mechanical, thermal or chemical techniques. This paper focuses on nonwovens manufactured with polymer-based fibres and bonded thermally. During thermal bonding of such fibres, as a hot calender with an engraved pattern contacts the <b>fibre</b> <b>web,</b> bond spots are formed by melting of the polymer material. As {{a result of this}} bonding process, a pattern of bond points connected with randomly oriented polymer-based fibres form the nonwoven web. Due to their manufacturing-induced composite microstructure and random orientation of fibres, nonwovens demonstrate a complex mechanical behaviour. Two distinct modelling approaches were introduced to simulate the non-trivial mechanical response of thermally bonded nonwovens based on their planar density. The first modelling approach was developed to simulate the mechanical behaviour of high-density nonwovens, and the respective fabric was modelled with shell elements with thicknesses identical to those of the bond points and the fibre matrix having distinct anisotropic mechanical properties. Random orientation of individual fibres was introduced into the model in terms of the orientation distribution function {{in order to determine the}} material’s anisotropy. The second modelling approach was introduced to simulate low-density nonwovens, and it treated the nonwoven media as a structure composed of fibres acting as truss links between bond points...|$|E

Artifacts and limitations inherent to these techniques {{in the study of}} microfibrils, pulp fibres and paper are discussed. AFM images of the surface of the highly crystalline cellulose microfibrils, Ventricaria and M. d., were obtained at molecular resolution under ambient conditions; the molecular images showed periodicities along the microfibril axis that correspond to those of the fibre and glucose unit repeat distances of cellulose, respectively. Images of the section surface of Black Spruce (Picea mariana) wood clearly show features of the underlying cell wall structure. The apparent lamellation, with periodicities from tens or nanometers down to 15 nm, were observed in radial sections of the middle secondary wall (S 2). However, transverse sections of the same S 2 layer did not show a lamellation independent of the knife direction.

Pressureand wire position measurements have been carried out in anexperimental facility, the KTH-Former,which models the rollforming zone of a paper machine. Measurements are carried out with pure water for threedifferent wires (fabrics) : A non-permeable,a semi-permeable anda conventional wire. Although not used in paper making,thenon-permeable wire is useful when trying to understand thefundamental mechanics of roll forming. The semi-permeable wirewith finite but low permeability is used to model the effectsof the <b>fibre</b> <b>web</b> on the drainage. Tests have mainly been carried out for different wiretensions and different jet speeds. It is shown that the localcurvature of the wire is strongly correlated to the dewateringpressure. The conventiona wire shows a single pressure peak causingcomplete de- watering {{in the first part of}} the dewateringzone. The pressure distributions for the non-and semi-permeablewires are found to show two consecutive pressure peaks followedby a suction peak where the wire is taken of the roll. Thisoscillating behaviour is due to capillary waves where the wiretension plays the role of surface tension on a free surface. Thewavy behaviour of the wire is recovered from an analyticalmodel and the effect is governed by a dimensionless Webernumber. The measured wave lengths correspond well to thosegiven by the theory. When the wire tension is high,i. e. a high dewateringpressure,the flow in the impingement region collapses when thedynamic pressure of the headbox jet is about half of thedewatering pressure. It is shown experimentally that the localdrainage shows a correlation to the dewatering pressure andhence to the wire curvature. NR 2014080...|$|E

Fibres were produced at 72 C with jet head rotation speeds from 7000 to 15, 000 r min- 1. The fibres were characterised by means of SEM, XRD and DSC. Adsorption behaviour was investigated by means of an isothermal bottle point adsorption study using a commercial disperse dye, Dianix AC-E. Through centrifugal spinning nanofibers and microfibers could be produced with individual fibres as fine as 200 – 300 nm and mean fibre diameters of ca. 1 – 2 lm. The PVP/TA fibres were mechanically brittle with characteristic brittle tensile fracture regions observed at the fibre ends. DSC and XRD analyses suggested that this brittleness was linked to the graft chain crystallisation where the PVP/TA was {{in the form of a}} radial brush copolymer. In this structure, the triacontene branches interlock and form small lateral crystals around an amorphous backbone. As an adsorbent, the PVP/TA fibres were found to adsorb 35. 4 mg g- 1 compared to a benchmark figure of 30. 0 mg g- 1 for a granular-activated carbon adsorbent under the same application conditions.

Single-fibre webs of longitudinally arranged fibres put into layers one onto another to comprise a multilayer structure of seven single-fibre webs. The number of F <b>fibre</b> <b>webs</b> {{in the lap}} influenced the percentage of flax fibres evaluated by mass. Each kind of the laps was needled at the density 80, 120, and 200 cm– 2. As a result, 18 samples of needle-bonded nonwovens of similar morphological and comfort properties but different bulk electrical resistance were prepared. The maximum bulk electrical resistance at dry conditions, {{of the order of}} 7 · 1014 Ω, was characteristic for the samples made entirely of PP fibres, while the minimum resistance, of the order of 1010 Ω, was characteristic for the samples made entirely of F fibres. Insert of flax fibres into the nonwoven structure at amount ~ 14 % resulted in 20 – 100 times decrease of electrical bulk resistance.

40|$|Digital image {{analysis}} provides methods for automatic, fast, and reproducible analysis of images. The main contribution of this thesis is new {{image analysis}} methods for volumetric characterisation of microstructure with application {{in the field}} of material science. The methods can be used as tools to characterise material microstructure, in particular the structure of fibre-based materials, such as paper, wood fibre composites, and press felts. More information about the material microstructure enables design of new materials with more specialised properties. Volume images have recently become available to characterise material microstructure. Manual inspection of material properties using volume images is both non-reproducible and expensive. The methods presented in this thesis are developed to meet the growing need for automated analysis. The focus has been on 3 D methods for high-resolution volume images, such as X-ray microtomography images. New methods for characterisation of both the fibre structure and pore structure in fibre-based materials are presented. The fibre structure can be characterised by measuring either individual fibres or the local structure of the material. A method for tracking individual fibres in volume images is presented. The method is designed for wood fibres, but can also be applied to other types or fibres or in other areas where tubular or elongated structures are analysed in volume images. A method for estimating 3 D fibre orientation of both tubular and solid fibres is also presented. Both methods have been evaluated on real volume images acquired using X-ray microtomography with good results. Two new pore structure representations and corresponding measurements are introduced. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated on real data. A method for estimating the pore volume at the interface between press felt and <b>fibre</b> <b>web</b> is presented. It has been applied in a case study of press felts under load using confocal microscopy images.

40|$|Most of {{the water}} fed into a paper machine is removedmechanically in the forming and press sections. One of thefactor which has an {{important}} influence on mechanicaldewatering, i. e. in both forming and pressing, is thestress-strain behaviour of the fibre network. The focus of this thesis is {{on the development of}} improvedmathematical descriptions of the stress-strain behaviourexhibited by fibre networks in the forming and press sections. The first part of the thesis presents a physically based modelof the forming and densification of fibre mats in twin-wireformers. The model can calculate the ecect of the applicationof a varied load through the forming section. It was developedfrom mass and momentum balances of the fibre and liquid phases,the fibre mat stress-porosity relation and an expression forthe permeability {{as a function of the}} porosity. The fibre-matstress-porosity relation used is rate-independent and presentshysteresis. Simulations have been conducted to study theeffects of roll pressure, blade pulses, wire tension andbeating. The effect of sequential blade pressure pulses afterthe forming roll on the dewatering and the concentrationgradients could be characterised. The simulations alsoexhibited rewetting by expansion when the fibre mats left theforming roll. Increasing wire tension resulted in increaseddewatering, but the rate of increase diminished rapidly withincreasing tension. The simulation results also indicated thatbeating has a large influence on dewatering. The second part of the thesis presents two models of therate-dependent stress-strain behaviour of the fibre networkthat is observed in wet pressing. The first model was based onthe approach pioneered by Perzyna (1966) for strain-ratedependent plasticity and was quite satisfactory for calculatingthe stress-strain behaviour of the fibre network in singlepress nips. It was successfully applied for studyingdensification and dewatering in both normal wet pressing andhigh temperature wet pressing. However, the first model onlyincludes rate dependence in the compression phase of thecompressionexpansion cycle; the expansion phase is treated asbeing rate independent The second model of the stress-strain behaviour of the fibrenetwork treats both compression and expansion as being ratedependent, according to experimental observations. It is basedon the idea that the wet <b>fibre</b> <b>web</b> may be conceived as alayered network of restricted swelling gels. A swollen fibre isa restricted gel, the inner swelling pressure in a swollenfibre wall being balanced by the stresses in the fibre wallstructure. The observed rate dependence of wet webs in bothcompression and expansion phases was attributed to the flow ofwater out of and into the fibre walls. The second model gavepredictions that are in good agreement with results fromuniaxial experiments using pressure pulses of arbitrary shapefor both a single pulse and a sequence of pulses. It maytherefore be used as a general model for the rheologicalbehaviour of the wet fibre network in wet pressing, providedthe model parameters are estimated from experimental data withsmall experimental error.

40|$|Since January 2009 Innventia AB {{has been}} running a {{research}} cluster called ‘Future papyrus’. This cluster is aiming to reduce fibre and energy consumption in the papermaking process. One strategy for achieving this aim {{is to increase the}} filler content in paper through pre-flocculation. Pre-flocculation of fillers is a technique which means that fillers are flocculated with chemicals (flocculants/retention aids) in a preceding step, before being added to the stock. This enables the formation of larger flocs which are more easily retained in the <b>fibre</b> <b>web</b> and cause less reduction of the paper strength than fillers normally do. Therefore, a larger amount of fibres can be replaced with fillers. Raising the filler content is a way of reducing the consumption of expensive fibres, which is highly prioritized as the paper making industry is trying to reduce manufacturing costs and energy consumption, without lowering the quality of the paper. One of the main difficulties with pre-flocculation is to create stable filler flocs that can withstand the shear forces in a paper machine. It is not necessarily the largest filler flocs that retain the largest size after all the process steps. Therefore, it is important to investigate how different conditions during pre-flocculation affect the floc size and to which extent this size is being kept after shear exposure. The different conditions are for instance the type of retention aid added and its corresponding flocculation mechanism, amount of retention aid (dosage), reaction time, pH and conductivity, amount of fines at preflocculation as well as amount of microparticles added to the system of chemicals. This thesis was carried out within the Future Papyrus cluster. The main purpose was to investigate how pre-flocculation and consumption of retention aid is affected by various parameters such as pH and conductivity as well as concentration of filler, fines and microparticles. The thesis work has also included development of the technique for measuring floc size. As a result of the work with measurement technology, a new method for particle size measurements with OptoPlatform was found. The new method is intended to minimize the shear exposure and is based on a small circulating hose system allowing the sample to pass through the OptoPlatform several times until proper mixing is achieved. The floc size measurements have resulted in some important conclusions regarding pre-flocculation of fillers. One of the most evident results is that the filler concentration at pre-flocculation has an impact on floc size. It was found that high filler concentrations are favourable for build-up of larger filler flocs. Furthermore, the fines content at pre-flocculation affects the particle size vs. dosage correlation. The fines content consumes (neutralizes) some of the retention aid, which results in small flocs at low dosages. However, fines also seem to co-flocculate with the filler, so that the flocs become larger at high dosages. Similarly, the presence of microparticles during pre-flocculation proved to result in larger floc sizes at higher quotients (microparticles/retention aid) and high dosages. When combining fines and microparticles, there was an additive increase in floc size. However, the pH and conductivity conditions in a paper machine proved to have no influence on preflocculation, compared to tap water conditions. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

The 11 -residue family of peptides (P 11 -X), are able to self-assemble hierarchically into β-sheet tapes with higher order structures (ribbons, fibrils and fibres) being produced depending on peptide concentration. Previous studies of P 11 -X peptides aimed at tissue repair focused on hydrogel formats where their potential for deposition of hard tissue minerals in vivo was demonstrated {{due in part to}} their ability to mimic the physiochemical properties of natural extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone. However, SAP hydrogels are often associated with inherently weak and transient mechanical properties, which make their handling and fixation challenging in large load-bearing tissue defects. Accordingly, to engineer a more robust scaffold, the present research demonstrates the feasibility of producing electrospun webs composed of a biodegradable polymer, poly (e-caprolactone) (PCL) commixed with either P 11 - 4 (Ac-QQRFEWEFEQQ-Am) or P 11 - 8 (Ac QQRFOWOFEQQ-Am) self-assembling peptides.

Variations of this basic {{technology has been}} used to form ultrafine fibres from: polypropylene (PP), ubiquitous in the nonwovens industry and a key material for nonwovens; polycaprolactone (PCL), a biocompatible polymer used previously as a biological scaffold; and polyvinylpyrrolidone with 1 -triacontane (PVP/TA), a copolymer found in the cosmetics industry. This work demonstrated the melt centrifugal spinning of PP into sub-micron fibres ≤ 500 nm in diameter, and PCL fibres ≤ 900 nm in diameter. The influences of material properties and processing conditions on the <b>fibre</b> and <b>webs</b> properties were investigated and relationships established. For melt spinning, increasing the rotational speed will reduce the average fibre diameter and when solution spinning PCL a binary solvent produced finer fibres with increased surface textures. The spinning of PVP/TA into fibres demonstrated in this work has been previously unreported. PVP/TA fibres were created by centrifugal spinning at low temperatures were as fine as 1. 5 µm on average. These fibres were used as an adsorbent and showed an affinity for the capture and retention of disperse dyes and hydrocarbons on the fibre surface. Carbon nanotube composite fibres were created by dispersing the nanotubes in both PP and PCL polymers using ultrasonic waves. The addition of carbon nanotubes significantly increased the level of beading during spinning in both PP and PCL as their presence causing an increase in Rayleigh instabilities. The addition of nanotubes did not improve web strength of the products compared to virgin polymer. Overall, centrifugal spinning {{has proven to be a}} highly versatile technique, capable of producing ultrafine fibres from a range of polymer feed materials which have potential to be utilised in a range of specialist applications...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} Fibre Cement Felts (FCF), which is a non-woven textile substrate acting as a conveyor belt for the manufacturing of Fibre Cement Sheets (FCS). Fibre Cement Felts are a valued component required in the manufacturing process of Fibre Cement Sheets, used in construction for today’s building industry. Identifying the key factors that most influence FCF will assist in {{understanding of the relationship}} between <b>fibre</b> diameters, carded <b>web,</b> and mechanical bonding. As these factors {{have an effect on the}} performance requirements and characteristics of FCF, this will ultimately impact the production of Fibre Cement Products. The main purpose of this research was to investigate the influence fibres types and parameters selected for manufacturing FCF. In addition the effects of the needling sequence, and the influence of these parameters on the final physical and performance characteristics of FCF. This research recognised that the mechanical properties of the fibre, and the manufacturing methods used both have an effect on the physical parameters and performance attributes of a FCF. These factors affect the performance requirements and characteristics of FCF for the end application for the production of FCS on a Fibre Cement Machine...|$|R
40|$|Steel fibres in {{concrete}} beams {{have proven to}} be efficient with regards to take shear forces,and could become a competitor to today?s stirrups. This master?s thesis evaluates positiveand negative effects of having fibre reinforced cross sections with different web widths. I-beams are often used in the precast concrete industry to slimmer the structure and production cost. Using fibres as shear reinforcement instead of stirrups would rationalize the production, resulting in less labour needed and decreased production costs. A total of five beams have been used in the experiment and for the comparison. Each beam has been tested in two sections, giving two sets of data for each beam in the analysis. All beams were 400 mm high, 250 mm wide and 4000 mm long. One of the beams were reinforced with conventional stirrups, the rest had a fibre amount of 1, 0 vol% of the type Dramix 65 / 50. The web width for the beams varied from 250 mm to 80 mm. Each beam was reinforced with longitudinal reinforcement such that it would withstand twice the loading in bending than for shear. On this basis, the effect of having different web widths were examined and evaluated. The making of moulds and casting went out in Spenncon?s factory in Verdal. The testing afterwards took place on NTNU at Gløshaugen. In addition to the I-beams, standard beams and cylinders were casted and tested according to the design rules to find the correct concrete and fibre properties. This report is mainly related to the four main chapters Literature Theory, Beam Compilation, Laboratory Activity and Results and Discussion. Literature Theory examines various relevant topics related to the comprehension of fibre reinforced concrete. The chapter Beam Compilation describes how the final test beams are put together based on calculation models from the literature theory. The casting and testing procedure is described in Laboratory Activity, while the outcome from the Laboratory Activity is thoroughly reviewed in the chapter of Results and Discussion. Different design rules have been presented in this study. They have been evaluated up against the test results and against each other, with the aim of finding similarities and differences between them. The results show that a concrete beam with 1 vol% fibres can withstand higher shear forces than a corresponding beam with stirrups that meets the requirements of minimum shear reinforcement in EC 2. The tested beams generated satisfactory results to the hypothesis of increased shear efficiency for slim <b>webs.</b> <b>Fibre</b> counting indicates a linear increased trend of <b>fibres</b> as the <b>web</b> becomes slimmer. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} about the development of antimicrobial active nanofibres. The objective was to generate these nanofibres from aqueous spinning solutions via electrospinning. By this, organic solvents were avoided so that electrospinning was performed at environmentally friendly conditions. Electrospinning of aqueous spinning solutions necessitated the application of water soluble polymers so that the gained nanofibres exhibited nearly no water stability. Further content of this thesis was therewith the development of different stabilisation techniques for the nanofibres. The formation of antimicrobial poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibre webs containing spherical nano-Ag via electrospinning with special regard to utilise these nanofibres in filter media was studied. Aqueous PVA solutions with addition of silver nitrate were electrospun. Afterwards, the gained nanofibres were UV irradiated {{in order to reduce the}} silver ions within the fibre matrix to elemental nano-sized silver. The resulting nanofibre webs were stabilised towards aqueous surroundings by a heat induced crystallisation. Furthermore, the influence of spinning and solution parameters on the resulting fibre morphology was investigated and antimicrobial functionality of the nanofibres was proven. Here, the minimum efficient nano-Ag content as well as the release behaviour of silver ions from the fibre matrix in comparison to that of silver salts was studied. The nanofibres were examined concerning their potential usage in filters by electrospinning them directly on support fleeces and application of standardised test dust onto the nanofibre webs. Thereby, the deposition behaviour of the test dust on the nanofibres and its potential impact on antimicrobial activity were investigated. In the next chapter, PVA nanofibres were provided with the quaternary ammonium silane 3 (trimethoxysilyl) -propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride (TMS QAC 18) in order to achieve i) antimicrobial activity and ii) water stability of the nanofibres. Homogeneous PVA/TMS-QAC 18 composite nanofibres were generated by electrospinning of an aqueous PVA solution with addition of TMS-QAC 18. Furthermore, as second method coating of pure PVA nanofibres with the organosilane was performed. The organosilane was permanently bond to the PVA by heat treatment of the nanofibres. Thereby, the surface properties of the fibres changed. Inhibition of the bacterial growth of B. subtilis was proven, though the <b>fibre</b> <b>webs</b> exhibited no significant antimicrobial effect on E. coli. Furthermore, water stabilities of the nanofibre webs were investigated. In the following chapter, three different photo-induced chemical crosslinking strategies for PVA nanofibres were investigated. Crosslinking was performed i) by formation of a semi-interpenetrating network consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) within the PVA matrix, ii) in the presence of sodium benzoate as sensitizer and iii) by previous reaction of PVA with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) resulting in a crosslinkable and electrospinnable product (PVA-MA). All strategies were optimised, investigated and examined with regard to their efficiency for stabilisation of the nanofibres towards water. Furthermore PVA/silica hybrid nanofibres were prepared by electrospinning. The inorganic/organic hybrid fibres possessed excellent intrinsic water stability. The spinning process was optimised regarding the fibre diameter and homogeneity. Ag-nanoparticles were incorporated into the fibre matrix in order to achieve antimicrobial activity. For that, silver nitrate was used as add-on to the spinning solution and subsequently reduced by UV-irradiation within the electrospun fibres to elemental, spherical nanoparticles. Antimicrobial activity of these fibres against E. coli and B. subtilis was proven. Fibres were tested for thermal stability. Exposed to high temperature the nano-Ag exhibited changed particle morphology and reduced antimicrobial activity. In last chapter, PVA/silica hybrid nanofibres were provided with TiO 2 nanoparticles; the hybrid nanofibres were gained from an aqueous silica sol/PVA mixture without usage of organic solvents. The TiO 2 particles were deposited onto the fibres’ surface subsequently electrospinning. For that, an aqueous, commercial available TiO 2 dispersion (VP Disp. W 740 X, Degussa) was sprayed onto the nanofibre webs. For the TiO 2 -equipped PVA/silica nanofibres a good photocatalytic activity was proven. Additionally, pure silica nanofibres were prepared from a silica sol-gel and also equipped with TiO 2 -particles at the same procedure. Attachment and binding durability of TiO 2 particles onto both fibre types were investigated by electron microscopy (FESEM, TEM). Thereby, for the hybrid nanofibres good durability of TiO 2 was attested whereas nearly no attachment of the particles onto the silica nanofibres could be detected...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E: Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering and the definitive published version is available at [URL] continuum model of the melting process in porous fibrous media is introduced. The fluid flow, heat transfer and phase change within the porous nonwoven web is numerically solved using computational fluid dynamics. Boundary conditions from an experimentally validated whole system model of a typical industrial machine, producing fibrous webs are incorporated. The presented model shows the capability to investigate the phase change during heating of the thermoplastic <b>fibres</b> during nonwoven <b>web</b> formation. Moreover, the fibres' geometrical information and constitutive equations, describing the material behaviour are included. The approach considers the fibre thickness, sheath fraction, and thermophysical properties like melting temperature, {{latent heat of fusion}} and the liquid fraction, enabling the assessment of different fibre types and to determine the properties of the fabric. The model results reveal that the web porosity has the most significant effect on the melting process among the considered parameters. Thermal gradients that occur inside the web are due to the combined convection and latent heat of fusion effect, which stores heat to melt the fibres. The model is applicable {{to a wide variety of}} systems ranging from textiles, fibrous beds, ceramics, membranes and porous composite materials. © IMechE 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub. co. uk/ journalsPermissions. nav...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{measurement}} of micro-scale stressvariations of press felt surfaces were developed. The methodswere based on a thin plastic film that was coated with anopaque stress-sensitive layer (Cronapress conversion film). Thefilm was compressed between a felt and a smooth surface. Uponapplication of load the opaque layer became partiallytransparent at the locations where load was applied by thesurface fibres of the felt. The degree of transparency was afunction of the locally applied stress. The spatial resolutionof the method was 6. 3 µm, which means that even details ofthe order of the diameter of a batt fibre diameter can beresolved. Parameters characterising the stress variations were used toquantitatively describe {{the extent of the}} stress variations,the size of the contact areas and the distance between them. The applicability of these contact characterisation parameterswas evaluated in laboratory wet pressing experiments and inpilot paper machine trials for two sets of specially designedpress felts. In general, the dewatering result was mainlyinfluenced by the diameter of the felt surface batt <b>fibres</b> andby the <b>web</b> grammage. For a specific pulp type and operatingconditions a multivariate model was formulated based on themeasured web dryness, web grammage and each contactcharacterisation parameter. The model was able to describe thedewatering capability of the different felts tested. Contactcharacterisation parameters related to contact properties (e. g. contact area ratio) gave the best prediction for low grammagewebs, while parameters related to flow properties (e. g. size ofopenings) gave the best prediction for high grammage webs. Furthermore it was found that at a certain web grammage, thesurface batt fibre diameter did not have an influence on thedewatering result. This grammage was termed "transitiongrammage". Below the transition grammage a fine surface gavesignificantly better dewatering, while the opposite trend wasobserved above the transition grammage. Based on these results,a modified dewatering hypothesis was formulated. Thishypothesis links the non-uniform compression of the wet webwith different dewatering situations for low and high grammagewebs.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for flexible modelling of multi-component twin-wire blade formers. Features such as suction devices, loadable blades, curved blades, and partial contact between the blades and the forming fabrics are easily incorporated. New results include a series of calculations demonstrating the non-trivial interaction between the pressure pulses when the blades are positioned successively closer together, the effects of suction on the pressure pulse generated by a blade applied to the opposing wire, and how blades of modest curvature do not necessarily stay {{in contact with the}} fabric along their full width and the implications of this on the pressure gradients in the machine direction. The behaviour of the fibre mats as they experience the first of the blade pulses (after having been formed over a roll) is then considered in detail. Typically, the thickness of the mats decreases during the pulse, which reduces the rate of deposition of new <b>fibres</b> onto the <b>webs.</b> The amount of fibres in the sheets therefore changes marginally. Nevertheless, the resistance to drainage presented by the fibre network is seen to increase significantly due to the low permeability in highly compressed layers of the mat. As a result of the pressure gradients in the machine direction, the shear stresses in the plane of the fibre sheets can attain several hundred Pascal next to the forming fabrics. Further, a model for sheared consolidation of flocculated suspensions is presented that extends the concept of a concentration dependent yield stress, previously employed in studies of uniaxial consolidation, to comprise flocculated phase shear strength. Rate-dependent viscous stresses are also incorporated. The theory is applied to the problem of combined compression and shearing of a strongly flocculated suspension contained between two plates, one being fixed and acting as a perfectly permeable filter, the other movable and acting as a piston by which the load is applied. Qualitatively, the evolution of the volume fraction of solids exhibits the same behaviour as during uniaxial consolidation without shear. Applying shear is however predicted to increase the rate of the drainage process, due to a reduced load bearing capacity of the flocculated phase, and correspondingly higher pore pressures.
