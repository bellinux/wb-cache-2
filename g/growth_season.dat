25|$|Cumin is a drought-tolerant, tropical, or {{subtropical}} crop. It has a <b>growth</b> <b>season</b> of 100 – 120 days. The optimum growth temperature ranges {{are between}} 25 and 30° C. The Mediterranean climate is {{most suitable for}} its growth. Cultivation of cumin requires a long, hot summer of three to four months. At low temperatures, leaf colour changes from green to purple. High temperature might reduce growth period and induce early ripening. In India, cumin is sown from October {{until the beginning of}} December, and harvesting starts in February. In Syria and Iran, cumin is sown from mid-November until mid-December (extensions up to mid-January are possible) and harvested in June/July.|$|E

They {{should be}} preferably potted on well drained vegetable fiber because their roots and pseudobulbs rot easily when kept humid for long periods. One of three different environments is needed depending on the species' origin to successfully grow these plants. The larger species need more light than the others. The smaller species from Southeast Brazil may be cultivated at the same medium temperature but under less than 10-20% luminosity. Bifrenaria from the Amazon Forest require higher and more constant temperature and humidity than other species.

The AM root length colonization rates were different {{among the five}} plant species and were generally high in early (May and June) and late (September) <b>growth</b> <b>seasons</b> and low in August. A total of 18 AM fungal species representing five genera were isolated from rhizosphere soils of the five plant species, and most AM fungi had not host specificity, except that Acaulospora sp., Glomus constrictum, G. diaphanum and Glomus sp. showed {{a certain degree of}} host preference. Glomus albidum, G. etunicatum and G. geosporum were the dominant species and showed various sporulation patterns in the five plants during the <b>growth</b> <b>seasons.</b> The AM fungal spore densities and species richness increased from May to September and decreased in October and were different in the same month in the five plants. Multivariate analyses revealed that season and host significantly co-affected the AM fungal spore density, species richness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and the season had higher influence than the host...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{works have}} shown that mixed mating systems often evolve despite strong {{inbreeding}} depression and reproductive assurance, {{which is one of}} the widely accepted explanations for the evolution of selfing. However, there have been few empirical studies on the relationship between mixed mating and reproductive assurance in perennial plants. In the herbaceous perennial, Kosteletzkya virginica, delayed selfing induced from context-dependent style curvature offers reproductive assurance, and adverse weather conditions significantly reduce pollinator visitation rates. In this study, our goals were (i) to experimentally evaluate pollinator failure rate, reproductive assurance, selfing rate and the relationships between them, and (ii) to measure inbreeding depression across multiple <b>growth</b> <b>seasons.</b> Results indicate that both population selfing rates and reproductive assurance are significantly and positively correlated with field estimates of pollinator failure rates, and there is a strong relationship between selfing rates and reproductive assurance. Inbreeding depression across multiple <b>growth</b> <b>seasons</b> ranged from 0. 621 to 0. 665, and there were no significant differences among different seasons. Our data demonstrates that a mixed mating system is beneficial because frequent pollinator failure has allowed reproductive assurance to evolve through delayed selfing which minimizes the risk of seed discounting and is still advantageous despite high inbreeding depression...|$|R

50|$|Fire {{is a big}} {{component}} {{to the success of}} grasslands, large or small. Controlled burns, with a permit, are recommended every 4-8 years (after two <b>growth</b> <b>seasons)</b> to burn away dead plants; prevent certain other plants from encroaching (such as trees) and release nutrients into the ground to encourage new growth. A much more wildlife habitat friendly alternative to burning every 4-8 years is to burn 1/4 to 1/8 of a tract every year. This will leave wildlife a home every year and still accomplish the task of burning. The Native Americans may also have used the burns to control pests such as ticks.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} during the period extended from spring 2011 to autumn 2012 at Sidi-Barrani in the North Western Coast of Egypt under rainfed conditions. The objective of this {{investigation was}} to study the natural vegetation qualitatively and quantitatively in relation to the effect of some ecological factors, i. e., plant communities and <b>growth</b> <b>seasons</b> on some range measurements, i. e., botanical composition, plant density, coverage, frequency, importance value, foliage yield and nutritive value of some perennial species. Thirty-eight plant species belonging to 16 families were found; the highest number of plant families, number of plant species and palatable plant species were obtained under Artemisia herba-alba community. The highest values of plant density, coverage % and forage yield were recorded under A. herba-alba community in spring season during both years. Meanwhile, the lowest values of all studied traits were recorded under Anabasis articulata community in autumn season. Significant differences were found between plant communities, <b>growth</b> <b>seasons</b> and their interaction. Among perennial species, the highest figure of importance value (IV) was contributed by A. articulata, A. herba-alba and Gymnocarpos decandrum in both years. While, Trigonella stellata and Aegilops kotschyi have the highest values (IV) among the annual species in the first year. Meanwhile, Hippocrepis bicontorta, Scorpiurus muricatus gave the highest (IV) during spring season in the second year. Highest digestible crude protein percentage (DCP) was recorded in Helianthemum lippii species followed by A. herba-alba. The highest TDN % were achieved by Noaea mucronata and G. decandrum. A. herba-alba and H. lippii gave the maximum values of digestible energy (DE), metabolized energy (ME) and net energy (NE). Deverra tortuosus recorded the highest value of gross energy (GE) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the eco-physiological adaptation of indigenous woody species to their habitats in karst areas of southwestern China. Two contrasting forest habitats were studied: a degraded habitat in Daxiagu and a well-developed habitat in Tianlongshan, and the eco-physiological characteristics of the trees were measured for three <b>growth</b> <b>seasons.</b> Photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration rate (Tr) of the tree species in Daxiagu were 2 - 3 times higher than those in Tianlongshan under ambient conditions. However, this habitat effect was not significant when measurements were taken under controlled conditions. Under controlled conditions, Pn, gs, and Tr of the deciduous species were markedly higher than those for the evergreen species. Habitat had no significant effect on water use efficiency (WUE) or photochemical characteristics of PSII. The stomatal sensitivity of woody species in the degraded habitat was much higher than that in the well-developed habitat. Similarly, the leaf total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents expressed on the basis of either dry mass or leaf area were also much higher in Daxiagu than they were in Tianlongshan. The mass-based leaf total N content of deciduous species was much higher than that of evergreen species, while leaf area-based total N and P contents of evergreens were significantly higher than those of deciduous species. The photosynthetic nitrogen- and phosphorus-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) of deciduous species were much higher than those of evergreens. Further, the PPUE of the woody species in Tianlongshan was much higher than that  of the woody species in Daxiagu. The results from three <b>growth</b> <b>seasons</b> imply that the tree species were able to adapt well to their growth habitats. Furthermore, it seems that so-called “temporary drought stress” may not occur, or may not be severe for most woody plants in karst areas of southwestern China...|$|R
