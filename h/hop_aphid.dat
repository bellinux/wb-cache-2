The published article is copyrighted by the Entomological Society of America and can be found at: [URL] temporal development of biological control of arthropod pests in perennial cropping systems is largely unreported. In this study, the development of biological control of twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, and <b>hop</b> <b>aphid,</b> Phorodon humuli (Schrank), in a new planting of hop in Oregon is described over a period of 9 yr (2005 - 2013). Both the abundance and diversity of natural enemies increased over time. Known predators of <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> (Coccinellidae and Anthocoridae) were present in all years; however, stable biological control of <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> was not achieved in most years and aphicides were required to suppress populations at commercially acceptable levels in 5 of 9 yr. Populations of aphidophagous coccinellids developed synchronously with <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> populations, and temporal correlations indicated these are the primary predatory insect associated with <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> regulation. However, sampling methods did not assess levels of aphid parasitoids and hyperparasitoids and their contribution to biological control was unquantified. Spider mite biological control was associated primarily with predatory mites (Phytoseiidae) and Stethorus spp. (Coccinellidae). The magnitude of temporal correlations of abundance of these predators with spider mites was found to be greatest on the same sampling dates and at lags of 7 - 14 d. Stable biological control of spider mites occurred after four field seasons, suppressing spider mites to levels similar to those commonly achieved with chemical control. A survey of 11 commercial hop yards in Oregon documented pest and natural enemy densities under commercial management practices over a period of 4 yr (2008 - 2011). Natural enemy abundance in commercial hop yards was similar to that of a 2 - to 3 -yr-old hop yard with limited disturbance. Whereas total reliance on biological control for <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> is unlikely to be successful, there appears to be unrealized potential for biological control of spider mites in commercial production. Dynamic action thresholds that consider the value of natural enemies are needed for both pests...|$|E
50|$|These {{insects are}} so small (a few {{millimeters}} in length), that winds can transport them for fairly long distances. They are often green, but might be red or brown, as well. They move quite slowly and cannot jump or <b>hop.</b> <b>Aphids</b> excrete a sugary liquid called honeydew, because the plant sap from which they feed contains excess carbohydrates relative to its low protein content. To satisfy their protein needs, they absorb large amounts of sap and excrete the excess carbohydrates. Honeydew is used as food by ants, honeybees, and many other insects.|$|R
500|$|In 1891, a blight of <b>hop</b> <b>aphids</b> {{struck the}} hop-growing West Coast from British Columbia to California. [...] Although sprays of various liquids {{were used in}} an attempt to defeat the insects, use of such {{pesticides}} damaged the hops. In 1892, the crop decreased to half of what it had been before the infestation. [...] Meeker had advanced money to many growers, who were unable to repay him. [...] The problems in the valley were made worse by the Panic of 1893, a severe worldwide depression. Business after business in which Meeker had invested failed, such as the Puyallup Electric Light Company. [...] He was overextended, and lost much of his fortune, and eventually his lands to foreclosure.|$|R
5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of <b>hop</b> <b>aphids</b> destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush.|$|R
40|$|The <b>hop</b> <b>aphid,</b> Phorodon humuli (Schrank), flies from hop, Humulus lupulus L., to its {{overwintering}} Prunus spp. hosts in the fall. The {{sources of}} these aphids were not known {{because much of}} the aphid flight occurs after hop plants are removed from fields during harvest. We found that the bottoms of hop plants remaining alive in harvested hop yards averaged 1. 7 to 5. 8 hop aphids per leaf in three years of sampling. Unharvested hop plants remaining after harvest averaged 32. 8 to 127. 1 aphids per leaf in two years. Feral hops were also infested with hop aphids in late summer and early fall. Sources for the spring aphid flight from Prunus spp. to hop included Prunus cerasifera Ehrhart, which averaged 44. 0 to 105. 1 aphids per shoot in two years of sampling. Fruit-type Prunus spp. trees growing on residential properties averaged 0. 9 and 11. 3 aphids per shoot in the same years but few of these trees were found. Plum and prune orchards averaged 0 to 5. 5 aphids per shoot in two years and estimates indicate that orchard trees are much more numerous than other <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> host trees. Potential alternative management strate-gies for <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> control are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is a {{worldwide}} pest of numerous agronomic and horticultural plants. Conservation biological {{control of this}} pest can be unreliable due to asynchrony of natural enemies and certain horticultural practices that have a direct or indirect affect on natural enemies and the pest, such as sulfur fungicides applied for control of powdery mildew diseases. In this research, means to enhance the reliability of conservation biological control in hop through deployment of synthetic herbivore-induced plant volatiles and altered sulfur fungicide timing were investigated. Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is an herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) that is attractive to several key predators of twospotted spider mite and <b>hop</b> <b>aphid,</b> Phorodon humuli (Schrank) (Homoptera: Aphididae). A two-year {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the recommended commercial use of synthetic MeSA in hop yards in Oregon. Slow-release MeSA dispensers were stapled to supporting poles in 0. 5 ha plots and these plots were compared to a paired non-treated plot on each of three farms in 2008 and 2009. Across both years, there was a trend for reduced (range 40 to 91...|$|E
40|$|Das Wirtswahlverhalten von Blattläusen wird neben primären Nahrungskomponenten auch durch sekundäre Pflanzeninhaltsstoffe gesteuert (Klingauf & al. 1978; Singh 1980; Powell & al. 1999; Campo & al. 2003). Häufig entziehen sich diese jedoch einer gezielten Untersuchung ihrer Wirkung auf die Aphiden, da sie als Substanzgemisch vorliegen. Beziehungen zwischen Substanzkonzentration und Verhaltensmustern aus Electrical Penetration Graphs (EPG) sind nur mit mäßigem Erfolg über statistische Verfahren darzustellen. Eine Versuchsanordnung zur gezielten Prüfung verhaltensbeeinflussender Substanzen mittels EPG wäre in diesem Falle hilfreich. Ein geeignetes einfaches Testsystem müsste {{mindestens}} folgende Komponenten beinhalten: – eine von den Aphiden akzeptierte Oberfläche, welche die Kutikula / Epidermis eines natürlichen Systems nachbildet – diese Oberfläche sollte evtl. durch den Versuchsansteller manipulierbar sein – eine dem Parenchym entsprechende Schicht, in welche die Testsubstanzen einzubringen wären – eine flüssige Phase, die dem Phloem entspricht und ebenfalls in ihrer Zusammensetzung variiert werden kann. In {{this work}} the behaviour of Phorodon humuli (Schrank) during feeding on artificial, semi-solid diets was examined by Electrical Penetration Graph {{in order to}} test the biological effects of secondary plant substances. Components of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) assumed to affect host selection (a mixture of the bitter substances humulone and lupulone) were added to the diet in different concentrations (0; 100; 300; 625; 1250; 2500; 5000; 7500 &# 956;l/ml deion. H 2 O). For comparison additional recordings were taken with the aphids being offered the non-hop component resveratrol, in concentrations of 0; 0, 4; 0, 75; 1, 5; 3; 6; 12 &# 956;l/ml deionized water. The results clearly show an influence of the bitter substances on the <b>hop</b> <b>aphid’s</b> feeding behaviour. Depending on concentrations, the animals reacted to bitter substances with differences in probing frequency and -time, sucking activity and other parameters. The probing activity was positively correlated with the resveratrol, a substance foreign to hop, whereas the sucking activity was notedly negatively correlated. So the resveratrol distinctively plays the role of an allomone, the bitter substances from hop, however, more that of kairomones. The combination of artificial diets with the EPG-method is a suitable technique for examining the specific gustatory effects of substances on aphids...|$|R
40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{performed}} in a hop yard throughout 2002, 2003 and 2004 {{in order to determine}} the within-field distribution of Phorodon humuli (Schrank) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and its natural enemies. The distribution of P. humuli was directly affected by the position of the hop plants in the garden, with significantly higher concentrations of aphids (p= 0. 0122 in 2002 and p= 0. 0006 in 2003) observed along the edge. However, in 2004 the plants located on the marginal plots had similar populations to those on the more inner plots. This can be explained by a higher wind speed which made it more difficult to land on edge plants first. The hop aphid’s main natural enemy was Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), whose population was greatest where the aphids were most abundant with a significantly greater number of eggs (p= 0. 0230) and adults (p= 0. 0245) in 2003. Lacewing eggs were also frequently observed, with a significantly higher population (p= 0. 0221 in 2003 and p= 0. 0046 in 2004) where the aphid numbers were high. The number of winged aphids was greatest towards the margins of the garden in 2003. It is argued that the spatial distribution of the <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> and its natural enemies could be used to plan a sampling program and to estimate the population densities of these insects for use in integrated pest management programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} locally sourced hops from Northeastern microbreweries began the recent {{resurgence}} in local hop production. The farming community has increased acreage and improved {{the quality of}} hops grown and processed in the Northeast region {{over the past five}} years. There was a sharp {{increase in the number of}} Northeast hop producers from six in 2009 to over 175 in 2014. Hop growers in the Northeast are new to the crop and have limited experience with pest identification and management. This dissertation encompasses three research projects that were conducted over the 2012 - 2014 growing seasons. These projects were the first critical steps taken to develop arthropod integrated pest management (IPM) tactics for Northeastern hop growers. First, the arthropod community in seven Vermont hop yards was evaluated. The objectives of Chapter 2 are to 1) present current hop pest biology and management strategies, 2) report the phenology of arthropod pests observed over three growing seasons, 3) report abundance and peak date for each pest, and 4) document natural enemy abundance in Vermont hop yards. The survey indicates that in cool, wet seasons <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> (Phorodon humuli Schrank) is expected to be a pest of concern. Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) is expected to be a pest of concern in hot, dry conditions. Potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae Harris) is an unpredictable pest of special concern for first year hop plants. When <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> or potato leafhopper are sprayed for with broad-spectrum insecticide, two-spotted spider mite secondary outbreak can be expected. Second, the abundance of major arthropod pests and their natural enemy groups were evaluated under drive row flowering cover crop treatments. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the effect of cover crops on natural enemy group abundance, 2) measure the effect of cover crops on the three major Northeastern hop pests, and 3) measure the effect of cover crop presence on hop yield and quality. Natural enemy groups and pests were positively correlated yet cover crop treatments had no significant effect on natural enemy abundance. Red clover cover crop treatments served as a trap crop for potato leafhopper. No significant difference in hop yield or quality was observed between flowering cover crop treatments. Finally, potato leafhopper is a documented but understudied regional pest of hops. The objectives of this study were to 1) measure the physiological response of eight hop cultivars to adult potato leafhopper feeding and 2) measure hop leaf recovery from potato leafhopper injury. Gas exchange (net photosynthesis and transpiration) and chlorophyll content were measured to quantify injury by adult potato leafhopper to first year hop leaves in field and greenhouse studies. Cultivars did not vary significantly in their physiological response to potato leafhopper feeding. Injury significantly reduced gas exchange measures in the field (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and greenhouse (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and when leafhoppers were removed, gas exchange was restored...|$|E
40|$|The <b>hop</b> <b>aphid</b> Phorodon humuli (Schrank) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is {{a serious}} pest in most areas where hops are grown. A field trial was {{performed}} on a hop yard throughout 2002, 2003 and 2004 in León (Spain) in order to analyse the population development of Phorodon humuli and its natural enemies, {{as well as to}} determine the most effective integrated program of insecticide treatments. The basic population development pattern of P. humuli was similar in the three years: the population peaked between mid to late June, and then decreased in late June/early July, rising again and reaching another peak in mid-July, after which it began to decline, rising once more in late August; this last rise is characteristic of Spain and has not been recorded in the rest of Europe. The hop aphid’s main natural enemy found on the leaves was Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). The multiple regression analysis showed that aphids are positively related with the presence of beetle eggs and mean daily temperatures and negatively related with maximum daily temperature integral above 27 ºC in plots without insecticide treatment. The most effective program of insecticide (imidacloprid) treatments consisted of an initial treatment in June and a second treatment {{in the second half of}} July or at the beginning of August. However, a single treatment in June would be sufficient when in this last period the maximum daily temperatures were higher than 27 ºC for at least 15 days, avoiding in this way the harmful effects of imidacloprid on predators...|$|E
