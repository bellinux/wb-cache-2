A common ticketing facility for commuters travelling on Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses and the Metro was introduced in 2011.

2500|$|The MBTA Commuter Rail uses a {{fare zone}} policy whereby origin and <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> are not {{individually}} priced, but assigned a zone based on distance from Boston. There are {{a total of}} eleven zones (1A, then 1 through 10) with an increasing fare to or from Boston the higher the zone number. Zone 1A fares are the least expensive and cost the same as rapid transit ($2.25), while the highest priced Zone 10 fares are $12.50 per ride. Travel between suburban zones without going to Boston is charged an [...] "interzone" [...] fare {{based on the number}} of zones traveled. Seniors, those with a disability, and middle and high school students with proper identification receive a 50% discounted rate; children under eleven travel free with a paying adult. Fares are collected by train conductors; while fare evasion is explicitly illegal, it is not criminal.|$|E

30|$|To {{alleviate}} the hidden station problem, virtual carrier sensing {{has been introduced}} to wireless MAC layers [18]. It {{is based on a}} two-way handshaking that precedes data transmission. One such virtual sensing mechanism is the 802.11 Request To Send/Clear To Send (RTS/CTS) exchange mechanism [19]. In this mechanism, the source station transmits a short control frame, called RTS, to the <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> Upon receiving the RTS frame, the <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> replies by a CTS frame, indicating that it is ready to receive the data frame. Both RTS and CTS frames contain the total time of the data transmission. All stations receiving either RTS or CTS will keep silent during the data transmission period (e.g., station C in Figure 2).|$|R

From the information that was earlier written in these tickets, it is possible to increase the fare according to increments based on approximate distances between stations.|$|E
