30|$|Currently, {{most of the}} WSNs are battery-powered, so the node's {{lifetime}} {{is equal}} to the lifetime of the battery it uses. The vast majority of the research efforts so far have focused on the development of energy-efficient MAC (medium access control) and network protocols to guarantee a lifetime of {{at least a couple of}} years with a single battery pack. Typically, batteries need to be replaced every 3 to 5 years, depending on the application the WSN is designed for. Changing the batteries of hundreds or even thousands of nodes is cumbersome, costly, and environmentally unfriendly. The manufacturing, recylcing, and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> involves a heavy carbon footprint. Traditional battery-operated WSNs will have a tremendous impact on the environment, if large-scale deployments start to roll out. For this reason, most of the deployed battery-operated WSNs are (luckily?) limited to a small number of nodes (64 nodes in [1], 100 nodes in [2]). The cost of changing a node's depleted batteries can outweigh the cost of the node itself. This very high operational cost has to some extent curtailed the proliferation of WSNs.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high energy density}} battery systems is {{expected}} to grow markedly during the next decade due to the advent of new generation of powerful, light-weight portable computers, cellular telephones, and power tools. The prospects of acquiring a larger share of an expanding and indeed highly competitive market have prompted battery producers to search for means of improving the overall performance of rechargeable battery systems, including the possible replacement of conventional electrodes with promising novel materials. In addition to economic considerations, there exists a pressing need to reduce or eliminate the use of toxic metals, which can contaminate the soil and water supplies and jeopardize human welfare, and thus comply with stringent constraints imposed by environmental regulatory agencies. The risks associated with this latter problem could be greatly alleviated by establishing programs, such as those in effect in some countries in western Europe, to control the indiscriminate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> into refuse processing facilities and landfills.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present both the {{political}} and educational actions that are the major subjects of bill on management of batteries in Rio Claro city, SP, Brazil. While the political actions refer to the furthering of a bill approved recently in the local Youth Parliament  for presentation in the Board of Aldermen, the educational actions relate to the creation of an environmental education program to orient the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> at the municipal level. The National Policy on Solid Waste (Law 12, 305 passed in 2010) introduced mechanisms to accomplish the shared responsibility for the lifecycle of batteries (and other products) and reverse logistics. This law classified batteries into the category of toxic waste. The study that supported the writing of the bill included an analysis of the existing public and private initiatives on batteries´ collection in Rio Claro seeking treatment in major urban centers having the reverse logistics as a premise. In recognition of the importance of the environmental education program, the local Education Secretariat, supported by Sepladema, has defined a schedule for the lectures to be given in public schools.

40|$|A unique safety flasher {{powered by}} {{photovoltaic}} cells and ultracapacitors has been developed. Safety flashers are used wherever there are needs to mark actually or potentially hazardous locations. Examples of such locations include construction sites, highway work sites, and locations of hazardous operations. Heretofore, safety flashers have been powered by batteries, {{the use of}} which entails several disadvantages: Batteries must be kept adequately charged, and must {{not be allowed to}} become completely discharged. Batteries have rather short cycle lives, and their internal constituents that react chemically to generate electricity deteriorate (and hence power-generating capacities decrease) over time. The performances of batteries are very poor at low temperatures, which often occur in the circumstances in which safety flashers are most needed. The <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>batteries</b> poses a threat to the environment. The development of the present photovoltaic/ultracapacitor- powered safety flasher, in which the ultracapacitors are used to store energy, overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages of using batteries to store energy. The ultracapacitors in this flasher are electrochemical units that have extremely high volumetric capacitances because they contain large-surface-area electrodes separated by very small gaps. Ultracapacitors have extremely long cycle lives, as compared to batteries; consequently, it will never be necessary to replace the ultracapacitors in the safety flasher. The reliability of the flasher is correspondingly increased, and the life-of-system cost and the adverse environmental effects of the flasher are correspondingly reduced. Moreover, ultracapacitors have excellent low-temperature characteristics, are maintenance-free, and provide consistent performance over time...|$|E

A reference case <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> used <b>batteries</b> in a large mine cavern shows that isolating the waste with expandable clay gives acceptable water quality for any period of time.
