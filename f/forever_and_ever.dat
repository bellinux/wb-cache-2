Annie states that Selk {{is the language of}} the selkie. Circus stammers that his lobsters hear her sing, which makes Annie curious as to whose story this is, and she secretly follows him to the caravan.

Also our fuel resources which are mostly made up of fossil fuels are not renewable in nature. In the present study hydrogen at a constant flow rate of 4 lpm was inducted in the suction, at some distance away from the intake manifold, along with air. Two different fuels on volume basis were tested as main fuels in a single cylinder, 4 -stroke, air cooled, direct injection diesel engine developing a power of 4. 4 kW, at a rated speed of 1500 rpm. One fuel was the sole used transformer oil (UTO/UTO 100) and the other one was the UTO at 40 % blended with 60 % diesel fuel (UTO 40). The combustion, performance, and emission parameters of the engine were obtained in the investigation and compared with the baseline diesel fuel. The results indicated increase in brake thermal efficiency for both the main fuels when hydrogen is inducted and also high reduction in smoke levels...|$|R
500|$|In Final Fantasy X the [...] is an {{important}} song. Its fictional history started as a song of defiance turned scripture and has numerous variations that is played throughout the game throughout Yuna's journey; primarily as {{the music of the}} temples. Though the Hymn's words apparently have no discernible meaning within the context of Spira, the lyricist and scenario writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a small puzzle with the lyrics, using Japanese syllables. When properly deciphered, they form sentences that translates thus: Pray to Yu Yevon. [...] Dream, fayth. [...] <b>Forever</b> <b>and</b> <b>ever,</b> grant us prosperity. The hymn was composed and arranged by Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Josh Modell of The A.V.

It was like half an idea stretched out <b>forever</b> <b>and</b> <b>ever,</b> and {{with very little}} payoff." [...] Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: [...] "All in all, I was left feeling a little cheated. [...] "Pinewood Derby" [...] wasn’t funny, it was just weird." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was told with [...] "the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of South Parks best". Travis Fickett of IGN said {{he was happy to}} see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of [...] "Pinewood Derby", [...] "This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the South Park tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on." ...|$|E

50|$|From the {{perspective}} of inclusive fitness, unfamiliar others are potential free-riders and, out of a concern {{that they will be}} exploited by others, people reduce considerably their altruistic attitudes and behavior in a general way in more diverse communities. This loss of trust is a symptom of a breakdown in social cohesion and is surely a forerunner of the sort of ethnic conflict that is always likely to break out if allowed to do so. This is undoubtedly the reason why multicultural nation-states are <b>forever</b> promoting tolerance <b>and</b> <b>ever</b> more punitive sanctions for the expression of ethnic hostility, even going so far to as to discourage the expression of opinion about the reality of ethnic and racial differences. Currently these measures are directed at the host population when they express reservations about the wisdom of mass immigration, but this will surely change as it becomes ever more obvious that it is the presence of competing ethnic groups that is creating the tension and not the expressed reservations of the majority population. The real danger for modern democracies is that in their zeal to promote multicultural societies, they will be forced to resort to the means that have characterized all empires attempting to maintain their hegemony over disparate peoples.|$|R

2500|$|In 2015 it was {{announced}} that Adult Swim had cancelled Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

The double-length episode [...] "The Last One <b>Forever</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ever</b> (For Real This Time) (We Fucking Mean It)" [...] was falsely promoted as the series finale and aired on August 23, 2015.

5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding <b>forever,</b> <b>and</b> if he <b>ever</b> betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|R

2500|$|Soon after arriving, Cameron, {{impressed}} by the courage of the garrison, decided {{to give them the}} opportunity to surrender. Two interpreters were sent {{to the head of the}} sap with a white flag and Major William Mair called out the offer in Māori, which was passed to Rewi, within the pa. Although there are several versions of Rewi's reply, he is reputed to have declared through his messenger, [...] "Ka whawhai tonu ahau ki a koe, ake, ake" [...] ("I shall fight you <b>forever,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ever,</b> and ever") When a shot was fired at Mair as he withdrew, grazing his shoulder, the British forces responded with a heavier hail of grenades, artillery and gunfire. The Ōrākau garrison repulsed two more attempts by the Waikato militia to rush the north-west outworks, but at 4:00 pm the chiefs, realising the end was near, decided to break out. Placing women and children in the middle of the group and their best warriors in front, the Māori broke through the earthworks at the south-east corner of the pa and [...] ran downhill without opposition 200 metres towards a ridge to the south, behind which the some men of the 40th were sheltering. They then dropped down a sloping 10-metre bank, surprising members of the 40th Regiment, who formed the south eastern edge of the cordon before running for cover in a nearby swamp. The group, many of them holding empty shotguns or tomahawks, was pursued by sword-bearing cavalry and hundreds of soldiers who fired on and bayoneted the fleeing Māori; Forest Rangers kept up the chase until dusk. Back at Ōrākau, meanwhile, soldiers stormed the pa as the garrison fled, bayoneting and shooting many of the wounded, including women and children. One of the women was Hine-i-turama Ngatiki.|$|E
