The authorities in Vienna became worried and imperial troops hunted down the preacher. He was arrested by the authorities and jailed in Bobâlna, a village in the <b>Hunedoara</b> <b>county.</b> On 13 February 1760, Sofronie was forcibly released, after the revolt of some 600 Romanian peasants led by the Orthodox priest from Cioara, Ioan.|$|E

25|$|Dacians had {{developed}} the murus dacicus (double-skinned ashlar-masonry with rubble fill and tie beams) characteristic to their complexes of fortified cities, like their capital Sarmisegetuza Regia {{in what is}} today <b>Hunedoara</b> <b>County,</b> Romania.

The degree of their urban development was displayed on Trajan's Column and in the account of how Sarmizegetusa Regia was defeated by the Romans. The Romans were given by treachery the locations of aqueducts and pipelines of the Dacian capital, only after destroying the water supply being able to end the long siege of Sarmisegetuza.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 August, the leading {{authorities}} of <b>Hunedoara</b> <b>County</b> came to Lupeni, accompanied by 80 troops from the 4th frontier guards regiment and some 20 gendarmes. The mining company attempted to start the power station with strike-breakers {{in order to prevent}} the mines from being flooded and those underground from being asphyxiated, but the strikers maintained a cordon around the works. (A prosecutor later reported that the men inside the power station were [...] "armed with stakes, iron bars, bludgeons and revolvers and were awaiting the authorities with aggressive poses".) The public prosecutor made a final demand that the strikers withdraw from the power station; the strikers replied with a howl of defiance. Some 40 gendarmes now present advanced, trying to intimidate the strikers. According to later testimony, the workers then threw objects toward the gendarmes, wounding those in the first line. When a striker fired a revolver, the 80 troops fired warning shots into the air. As the miners' aggressiveness was undiminished, the troops fired 78 bullets into the crowd (without orders, as established by an enquiry), some lodging in the power station's chimney. When the firing ceased, dozens of men lay on the ground; the rest, panic-stricken, fled quickly. Work at the station resumed immediately; troops and gendarmes guarded the station and all mine buildings.|$|E

2500|$|Poet and folklorist Ioan Șerb, who {{included}} Caragiale's text in his Antologia basmului cult ("The Anthology of Cultured Fairy Tales"), {{placed it}} in direct comparison not just to Machiavelli's text, but also to an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights and an anecdote in Romanian folklore (collected by Ovidiu Bârlea in <b>Hunedoara</b> <b>County).</b> In Șerb's assessment, {{the main difference between}} such prose and Caragiale's text was the latter's [...] "progressive tendency" [...] and move toward [...] "rehabilitating women". This perspective was received with reserve by Cioculescu: [...] "kir Ianulea's wife, far from suggesting an intent for rehabilitation on Caragiale's part, illustrates the unbearable, exasperating character of a woman who is almost literally infernal. Only the fact that she does not resort to murder imposes the reserve of this 'almost'." [...] In addition to her many psychological defects, Cioculescu argues, Caragiale hinted to Acrivița's innate negativity by mentioning her esotropia, exploiting the Romanian tradition according to which distinct marks on one's face are bad omens. Cioculescu wrote: [...] "Actually, Caragiale builds his theme without misogynistic hatred, with the euphoria of the storyteller and the playwright who knows how to stage a situation for his characters [...] But the lack of misogyny does not at all imply that the author, who so well depicts the circumstances of kir Ianulea's exasperation, is an advocate of women. [...] That Acrivița is 'fundamentally evil' is instantly apparent to any reader; that she is not a typical representative of all women is also very correctly assessed." ...|$|E

Water pollution by pesticides {{results from the}} plantprotection products industry and also from massive application of these resourcesin agriculture and other branches of economy. Pesticides can reach surface wateralong with dripping waters and by infiltration may reach the groundwater layers,{{organochlorine pesticides}} are most often found in the water sources (dieldrin,endrin, DDT, aldrin, lindane, heptachlor, etc.) due to their increased persistence inthe external environment. This study followed up the determination oforganochlorine pesticides in 14 drinking water samples collected from the outputof water treatment plants in Cluj and <b>Hunedoara</b> <b>counties</b> that process surfacewater and deep-water sources. For identification of organochlorine pesticides, thegas chromatographic method after liquid-liquid extraction was used, by a gascromatograph Shimadzu GC 2010 with detector ECD (Electron CaptureDetection). There were not detected higher values than the method detection limit(0. 01 μg/l) in the drinking water samples collected and analyzed for both totalorganochlorine pesticides and components, which were well below the maximumconcentration admitted by Law 452 / 2002 regarding drinking water quality. Resultsare correlated with the sanitary protection areas for water sources and with the useof agricultural lands in the area.

40|$|AbstractPorcine proliferative {{enteritis}} (PPE) is {{an important}} enteric disease and is widespread in intensive pig production. It is caused by Lawsoniaintracellularis, intracellular bacteria which affect more frequently postweaned pigs between 6 and 20 weeks of age. The aim of the study described in this paper was to obtain data on the prevalence of Lawsoniaintracellularis infections in Romanian pig herds. To realize this we used “Lawsonia FIRST test™” kit (MicroCoatBiotechnologie GmbH), a qualitative single-use test designed {{to be used for}} the detection of Lawsoniaintracelluaris in porcine feces. The samples were collected from four wean-to-finish herds from the west part of Romania, 15 samples/herd, from pigs with ages between 90 and 140 days. These herds were from different counties as it follows: Timis – 2 herds, Bihor and Hunedoara – one herd from each one. This study showed that Lawsoniaintracellularis infection percent is different between herds, varying between 0 % (herd 1 from Timiscounty) and 80 % (herd 2 from Timis county). In herds from Bihor and <b>Hunedoara</b> <b>counties</b> the infection percent was 60, respectively 46. 6 %. The results indicate that infection with Lawsoniaintracelluaris is very widespread in investigated pig herds– 46. 6 % of samples were positive – and it occurs in herds with digestive disorders and in herds without clinical symptoms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRural {{areas have}} been {{modified}} during centuries of agriculture practice and, in the last decades, of other economic activities like mineral extractions and processing industry, including also touristic activity. A challenge for ensuring sustainable development in rural areas is to cover the development needs of the community. Tourism has been indicated as a good development strategy for Romanian rural areas. The article is presenting the advantages and limits in supporting touristic activity {{in the framework of}} Leader approach at the level of a Local Group of Action in Romania, Alba and <b>Hunedoara</b> <b>Counties.</b> Leader approach is offering limited support for rural area in order to encourage cultural activities, architecture rehabilitation, valorizing natural landscape and rural tourism. Through its direct and indirect impacts, tourism attracts significant foreign exchange, investment and know-how and stimulates the local economy, with a significant multiplier effect on many other areas of the economy. In the same time, it has to be paid a great attention to the effects generated upon the rural communities by the tourists’ activities. Certainly, tourism development should be considered with all financial, material and human efforts that have to be done in order to support it. Tourism development in rural area should be strategically planned and its negative effects on nature and social-cultural environment of tourism areas should be limited...|$|R
