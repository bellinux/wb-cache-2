40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{systematic}} x-ray scattering study of the charge and orbital ordering in the manganite series Pr 1 −xCaxMnO 3 with x= 0. 25, 0. 4 and 0. 5. The temperature dependence of the scattering at the charge and orbital wavevectors, and of the lattice constants, was characterized throughout the ordered phase of each sample. It was found that the charge and orbital order wavevectors are commensurate with the lattice, in striking contrast to the results of earlier electron diffraction studies of samples with x= 0. 5. High momentum-transfer resolution studies of the x= 0. 4 and 0. 5 samples further revealed that while long-range charge order is present, long-range orbital order is never established. Above the charge/orbital ordering tem- 1 perature To, the charge order fluctuations are more highly correlated than the orbital fluctuations. This suggests that charge order drives orbital order in these samples. In addition, a longitudinal modulation of the lattice with the same periodicity as the charge and orbital ordering was discovered in the x= 0. 4 and 0. 5 samples. For x= 0. 25, only long-range orbital order was observed with no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> ordering, nor of an additional lattice modulation.

40|$|This thesis work {{contributes}} to two fields of research: Schottky diode characterisation and dielectric material characterisation, both for millimeter wave and THz applications. Schottky diodes are characterised for their electrical, thermal, noise and RF properties with various measurement techniques, and an easy-to-use method is introduced for {{the extraction of}} the dielectric material properties at millimeter wave frequencies. In addition, the applications of the developed thermal characterisation method for THz Schottky diodes and of the material characterisation method are presented. Schottky diode is a key component in almost all non-cryogenic mixer and frequency multiplier applications at 100 − 3000 GHz. In this work, a novel thermal characterisation method suitable for small THz Schottky diodes is introduced. This method {{is based on the}} transient current measurement and it enables the extraction of thermal resistances, thermal time-constants, and peak junction temperatures. The accuracy of the transient measurement setup is ensured with a developed verification routine and the characterization results are compared against an in-house measurement-based method and also against simulation results of two commercial 3 -D thermal simulators. As an application, the developed characterisation method is applied to obtain the thermal performance of the Schottky based mixer and multiplier prototypes for the MetOp-SG satellite instruments. Besides thermal performance, Schottky diodes are also characterised for their low-frequency noise and RF properties. Experimental investigations are carried out to study the <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> trapping in the THz Schottky diodes with a small anode area. Various measurement techniques are applied including I-V, capacitance and low-frequency noise measurements. Furthermore, low-barrier Schottky diodes from ACST GmbH are characterised to study their suitability for millimeter wave mixing applications because the low-barrier height enables low LO power requirement for the mixers. The performance of such diodes is evaluated, in terms of the conversion loss and the noise temperature, in a fundamental mixing configuration with measurements and simulations. The last part of this thesis work presents the characterisation of dielectric material at millimeter wave frequencies. An easy-to-use method is introduced for the extraction of the permittivity and the loss tangent of the material sample from reflection and transmission coefficient measurements. Extraction of the material parameters are performed with two approaches. First, by using the direct comparison with the simulated S-parameter results and second, from the analytical calculations. As an application, this extraction technique is used to characterise potential substrate materials for printing millimeter wave components, e. g., antennas...|$|E
40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of the Kondo lattice Hamiltonian with {{ferromagnetic}} Hund's coupling in the limit where the spin of the localized t_ 2 g electrons is classical is analyzed in one dimension {{as a function of}} temperature, electronic density, and a direct antiferromagnetic coupling J' between the localized spins. Studying static and dynamical properties, a behavior that qualitatively resembles experimental results for manganites occurs for J' smaller than 0. 11 in units of the e_g hopping amplitude. In particular a coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic excitations is observed at low-hole density in agreement with neutron scattering experiments on La_ 2 - 2 xSr_ 1 + 2 xMn_ 2 O_ 7 withx= 0. 4. This effect is caused by the recently reported tendency to phase separation between hole-rich ferromagnetic and hole-undoped antiferromagnetic domains in electronic models for manganites. As J' increases metal-insulator transitions are detected by monitoring the optical conductivity and the density of states.

Sunlight charging occurs relatively slowly: with 30 minutes <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> simulations, in none of the configurations modeled did the most negative surface cell reach half its equilibrium potential in eclipse.
