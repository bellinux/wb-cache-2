500|$|International Master Anthony Saidy {{recalled}} his last round {{encounter with the}} undefeated Fischer:Going into the final game <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not expect to upset Fischer. I hardly knew the opening but played simply, and he {{went along with the}} scenario, opting for a N-v-B [...] endgame with a minimal edge. In the corridor, Evans said to me, 'Good. Show him we're not all children.' ...|$|E
500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's the great thing about this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E
2500|$|Naipaul {{has been}} accused of misogyny, and of {{committing}} acts of [...] "chronic physical abuse" [...] against his mistress of 25 years, Margaret Murray, who {{wrote in a letter to}} The New York Review of Books: [...] "Vidia says I didn’t mind the abuse. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I--Well, Mary, I feel a {{good deal}} as you do: <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do.</b> It seems strange, too, so strange. I never could have {{believed}} it--never." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not {{remember}} anyone saying that thousands or even {{hundreds of people}} were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember.|$|R

60|$|ANNA--Yes, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do!</b> He's {{a regular}} man, {{no matter what}} faults he's got. One of his fingers is worth all the {{hundreds}} of men I met out there--inland.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, yes; <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{think it}} probable. I am sure he admires her, and I think it {{very likely to}} come to more. Would there be any objection?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it is, in a sense. But <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{not expect}} to meet Mr. Fuller. We are told that his people mean to {{preserve}} a strict neutrality." ...|$|E

60|$|Give {{yourself}} no uneasiness on {{the subject}} mentioned in that of the 22d. My note to you <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not expect to see in print, yet I have not been much shocked by the newspaper comments upon it.|$|E
60|$|For a long time, though <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{my best to}} listen, I {{could hear}} nothing but a low gabbling; but at last the voices began to grow higher, and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.|$|E
