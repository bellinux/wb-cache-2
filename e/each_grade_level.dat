5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level</b> to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music {{in other areas of the}} curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E
25|$|LSGH holds plays, {{concerts and}} {{activity}} days in <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level</b> (where students recite {{short stories and}} poems, and give speeches in English and Filipino). Most of these events are held at the now Bro. Rafael Donato Center for the Performing Arts, or in the old St. Joseph's Auditorium (the name of the Bro. Donato Center before renovation).|$|E
25|$|Elementary {{and junior}} high school {{district}} academic meets may be held in either the fall or the spring, but not both. Elementary {{and junior high}} students competing in academic events cannot advance beyond the district level. Events that are available for four or more grade levels are divided into two or three divisions based on grade level, though district executive committees may create separate divisions for <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level</b> if they wish. Rules allow students {{to compete in a}} division for older students if they wish. Science I is for 7th-graders and Science II is for 8th-graders; while students in 6th grade may enter Science I and students in 7th grade may enter Science II, no student can compete in Science I or II for more than one year.|$|E

50|$|Lowell's Primary School {{curriculum}} integrates academics, arts, technology, {{and physical}} education, and uses Essential Themes as its organizing principle. These powerful themes or concepts, such as Patterns, Interdependence, Identity, and Systems, generate overarching essential questions to shape and unify <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level's</b> curriculum. They provide {{a deep and}} rich context for inquiry and learning, and encourage asking questions, discovering connections and relationships, and comparing, analyzing and synthesizing knowledge.|$|R

500|$|A general English {{class for}} <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level</b> is {{required}} for graduation. [...] Required English courses are full-year classes {{that can be taken}} at the comprehensive, college preparatory, or advanced levels with Advanced Placement available in 12th grade. [...] Additional elective English classes include those in African American literature, women's studies and literature, public speaking, poetry, journalism, short story writing, writing research papers, and the works of William Shakespeare. [...] A news magazine production class produces The Colonel, the school magazine published 10 times per academic year. [...] The school yearbook, the Rough Rider, is produced by the yearbook production course. [...] Staff members of The Colonel have won a number of awards at state competitions, including the All-Ohio Award for best overall news magazine from the Ohio Scholastic Media Association in 2010. [...] English electives last one semester, except the full-year news magazine and yearbook production classes, and can only be taken along with the required English classes.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{academic}} subjects are introduced through up to two-hour morning lesson blocks that last for several weeks. [...] These lesson blocks are horizontally integrated at <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level</b> {{in that the}} topic of the block will be infused into many of the activities of the classroom and vertically integrated in that each subject will be revisited {{over the course of the}} education with increasing complexity as students develop their skills, reasoning capacities and individual sense of self. This has been described as a spiral curriculum.|$|E

2500|$|The Texas Education Agency, Pearson, and Texas {{educators}} collaborate to make TAKS. [...] First, teachers {{reviewed the}} Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (state-mandated curriculum) {{to determine the}} objectives to assess on <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level.</b> [...] Then educators determined how the objectives could be best assessed and developed guidelines outlining eligible test content and test-item formats. [...] TEA created a test blueprint. [...] Each year Pearson develops test items based on the objectives and guidelines, and the TEA reviews those items. Teacher committees are brought to Austin to review the proposed test items, and finally the items are field-tested on Texas students. [...] Using the input of the teacher committee {{and the results of}} field-testing, TEA and Pearson build the TAKS.

2500|$|The Texas Education Agency, Pearson Education (Texas' state {{assessment}} contractor), and Texas {{public school}} educators collaborate {{to create a}} STAAR assessment. First, educators from all over Texas review the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (the statewide curriculum)(state-mandated curriculum) to determine the objectives to assess on <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>level.</b> However, there are usually guidelines to which questions should be tested more or not as much. Then educators determined how the objectives could be best assessed and developed guidelines outlining eligible test content and test-item formats. This information is transferred to the TEA and given to Pearson Education, who develops test items based on the objectives and guidelines, and the TEA reviews those items. Teacher committees are brought to Austin to review the proposed test items, and finally the items are field-tested on some Texas students, called a [...] "mock test." [...] Using the input of the teacher committee {{and the results of}} field-testing, TEA and Pearson build the real STAAR. Very hard questions are usually removed from the test. A more detailed explanation is available from the Student Assessment Division of TEA. Most of the procedure follows the TAKS' development procedure.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} was twofold: (a) {{to sample the}} incidence of autism among students in kindergarten, primary and secondary levels (b) to identify the most frequently occurring social skills deficits among autisms at <b>each</b> of the <b>grade</b> <b>levels.</b> Survey {{research was}} used and {{the data were collected}} from teachers of 145 autistic students in inclusive schools. The research tool was a social skill survey form, covering three aspects of social skills, (a) self control, (b) communication with others, and (c) playing and working with others. The questions at the early childhood level totaled 38 items, at primary level 70 items and at secondary 67 items. Research found that most autistic students in inclusive schools were boys (78. 62 %). The most frequently observed deficits in social skills of autistic children at <b>each</b> <b>grade</b> <b>levels</b> were Not sharing toys/articles that they are interested in, Not able {{to play a role in}} a story with beginning, progression, and ending and Doing activities or playing alone during leisure time or at lunch time...|$|R
