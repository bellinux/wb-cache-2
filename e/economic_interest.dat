5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice <b>Economic</b> <b>Interest</b> Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Xinjiang, {{considered}} part of the Turkestan region, consists of an amalgamation of deserts, oases, and dry steppe barely suitable for agriculture. When influence from the steppe powers of Mongolia waned, the various Central Asian oasis kingdoms and nomadic clans like the Göktürks and Uyghurs were able to form their own states and confederations that threatened China at times. China proper is connected to this area by the Hexi Corridor, a narrow string of oases bounded by the Gobi Desert to the north and the high Tibetan Plateau to the south. In addition to considerations of frontier defence, the Hexi Corridor also formed {{an important part of the}} Silk Road trade route. Thus it was also in China's <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> to control this stretch of land, and hence the Great Wall's western terminus is in this corridor—the Yumen Pass during Han times and the Jiayu Pass during the Ming dynasty and thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the Allen {{brothers}} and high <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> in the town, first few years of Houston's existence were plagued by yellow fever epidemics, flooding, searing heat, inadequate infrastructure, and crime.

As a result, in 1839 the Texas Capitol was moved to Austin.|$|E

25|$|According to the 1860 census, 331,726 {{people were}} enslaved, nearly 47% of the state's total {{population}} of 708,002. The strong <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> of elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to Louisiana's decision to secede from the Union in 1861. It followed other Southern states in seceding after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States. Louisiana's secession was announced on January 26, 1861, and it {{became part of the}} Confederate States of America.|$|E

25|$|The Social Democratic Party's {{position}} has a theoretical base within Marxist revisionism. Its party programme interchangeably calls their ideology democratic socialism, or social democracy, though few high-level representatives have invoked socialism since Olof Palme (prime minister 1969-76, and again 1982-1986, assassinated 1986). The party supports social welfare provision {{paid for by}} progressive taxation. The party supports a social corporatist economy involving the institutionalization of a social partnership system between capital and labour <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> groups, with government oversight to resolve disputes between the two factions. In recent times they have become strong supporters of egalitarianism, and maintain a strong opposition to discrimination and racism.|$|E

25|$|Toward the end, the {{population}} suddenly dropped to initial levels, though {{much of the}} arable land was still available. The investigators concluded cattle were the main <b>economic</b> <b>interest</b> and available grazing land was the limiting factor in settlement. The Neolithic of the Middle East featured urban concentrations of people subsisting mainly on grain. Beef and dairy products, however, were the mainstay of LBK diet. When the grazing lands were all in use, they moved elsewhere in search of them. As the relatively brief window of the LBK falls roughly in {{the centre of the}} Atlantic climate period, a maximum of temperature and rainfall, a conclusion that the spread of wetlands at that time encouraged the growth and spreading of the LBK is to some degree justified.|$|E
25|$|The Phosphoria Formation and its {{equivalents}} of Permian age are {{unlike any}} other Paleozoic rocks because of their extraordinary content of uncommon elements. The formation consists of sandy dolomite, widespread black phosphate beds and black shale that is unusually rich not only in phosphorus, but also in vanadium, uranium, chromium, zinc, selenium, molybdenum, cobalt, and silver. The formation is mined extensively in nearby parts of Idaho and in Wyoming for phosphatic fertilizer, for the chemical element phosphorus, and {{for some of the}} metals that can be derived from the rocks as by-products. These elements and compounds are not everywhere concentrated enough to be of <b>economic</b> <b>interest,</b> but their dollar-value is, in a regional sense, comparable to that of some of the world's greatest mineral deposits.|$|E
