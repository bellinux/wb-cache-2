6000|$|... "Why, yes, sir. Since we had {{our recent}} {{conversation}} I fancy I have found what may prove a solution. I {{do not wish to}} appear to be taking a liberty, sir, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> overlooked his grace's potentialities as a source of revenue." ...|$|E

She has shown herself a very fast boat the few times she has been raced, but so have we, and taking the line through boats <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have both sailed against, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to be able to}} beat her." ...|$|R

[...] "Mr. Grooten," [...] I continued, turning towards him, [...] "you {{are the best}} judge as to whether your {{presence}} {{in this country is}} altogether wise, but I can assure you that for the last six months we have looked for you every day, and for this same reason. We want that question answered. The time has come when, in common justice to us and the child, the whole thing should be cleared up. Whatever knowledge rests with you is safe also with us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> proved that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> earned our right to your complete confidence. Mabane and I you can consider as one in this matter. You can speak before him as though we were alone. Now tell us the whole truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good. Then I {{presume that}} you will write officially to Cossey and Son stating that {{the money will be}} {{forthcoming}} to meet their various charges and the overdue interest. And now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had about enough of this business for once, so with your permission I will pay my respects to Miss de la Molle before I go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have known}} for some time that a clever gang was at work," [...] said the inspector. [...] "They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got them right enough." ...|$|E

Of course, I do not want to say anything that would pain you, Edna, and I won't do it, but people can't help thinking, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> waited as long as our consciences have any right to ask us to wait." ...|$|E

She has gone through a tornado without having {{suffered}} the slightest damage, except the loss of the dinghy. I shall be getting the topmast up in another hour. You see, I have got her number-two jib on her and shifted the mizzen, but she is still a bit too lively to make it safe to get up the spar. Like as not, if we did, it would snap off before we could get the stays taut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} true," [...] Nat said earnestly. [...] "We are {{certainly}} {{going to try to}} get them, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a good chance of doing so. Much will depend, of course, upon whether we can reach the hut where they are confined before being discovered. You see, we have only twenty-five men, or, counting us all, including the quarter-master, steward, and cook, thirty-one. It is a small force, and though we might bring all the prisoners off in safety if we once got them into our hands, it would be a serious thing if the negroes had time to rally round the hut before we got there. How does it stand, is it surrounded by trees?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not necessarily, Mr. Renshaw. We cannot {{get away}} now; for {{although}} we can defend ourselves well enough here, we could not make our way down through the woods to Mitford's without great risks. They are accustomed to bush fighting, and as they are still five to one against us, {{it would be a}} very serious matter to try to fight our way down. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no choice but to remain where we are until we are either relieved or are perfectly certain that they have made off. In either case we should then have ample time to make our preparations for retiring, and could strip the house and send everything down in boats or bullock-carts, and might even get up the potatoes, and cut such of the crops as are ripe, or nearly ripe, and send them down also.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I suppose {{one never}} {{knows what is}} g'ood for one, Sankey. Now as I look back <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been {{extraordinarily}} fortunate. We have had some fights, just {{in the way we}} had expected, and, thanks principally to our being so well mounted, we have done very well. We have lived well; I don't say we have not had a certain amount of discomfort, but of course we expected that. What I am most pleased at is that not one of us has been killed, and only a few of us wounded, the only serious one being Willesden, and he is fairly on the way to recovery. For boys we have done a very good share, and I expect that now we have driven the Boers back here, and Kimberley has been relieved, and there is a tremendous force gathering on that side, it will soon be over." ...|$|E
60|$|Thursday, November 24th.--This is Thanksgiving Day, a {{good old}} festival, and we have kept it with our hearts, and, besides, have made good cheer upon our turkey and pudding, and pies and custards, {{although}} none sat at our board but our two selves. There was a new and livelier sense, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> at last found a home, and that a new family has been gathered since the last Thanksgiving Day. There have been many bright cold days latterly,--so cold that it has required a pretty rapid pace to keep one's self warm a-walking. Day before yesterday I saw a party of boys skating on a pond of water that has overflowed a neighboring meadow. Running water has not yet frozen. Vegetation has quite come to a stand, except in a few sheltered spots. In a deep ditch we found a tall plant of the freshest and healthiest green, which {{looked as if it}} must have grown within the last few weeks. We wander among the wood-paths, which are very pleasant in the sunshine of the afternoons, the trees looking rich and warm,--such of them, I mean, as have retained their russet leaves; and where the leaves are strewn along the paths, or heaped plentifully in some hollow of the hills, the effect is not without a charm. To-day the morning rose with rain, which has since changed to snow and sleet; and now the landscape is as dreary as can well be imagined,--white, with the brownness of the soil and withered grass everywhere peeping out. The swollen river, of a leaden hue, drags itself sullenly along; and this may be termed the first winter's day.|$|E
6000|$|... "The circumstances," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "are peculiar. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{should do}} well to consult together--you and I, Felix, and Raoul here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had better}} take only nine. If we {{overload}} her she will row so heavily <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall {{be a long}} time overhauling them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. Perhaps {{they would}} hardly do <b>that.</b> However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to make}} it legal now--as soon as {{you are able to}} go out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, Colonel," [...] Hilda said, trying to repress a smile. [...] "I was {{quite sure that}} from your {{friendship}} for my dear uncle you {{would be ready to}} give us your assistance, but so far there has been no way in which you could have aided us in the inquiries that we have made. Indeed, as Dr. Leeds has impressed upon us, the fewer there are engaged in the matter the better; for if this man knew that we were making all sorts of inquiries about him, he might think it necessary for his safety either to put Walter out of the way altogether, or to send him to some place so distant that there would be practically no hope whatever of our ever discovering him. At present <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> fairly satisfied ourselves that this man is an impostor, and that the real John Simcoe was drowned, as supposed, in the ship in which he sailed from India. Who this man is, and how he became acquainted with the fact that John Simcoe saved my uncle's life in India, are mysteries that so far we have no clew to; but these matters are at present of minor importance to us. Before anything else we want to find where Walter is hidden, and to do this {{we are going to have}} this man watched. He cannot have carried off Walter by himself, and, no doubt, he meets occasionally the people who helped him, and who are now hiding Walter. It is scarcely probable that they come to his lodgings. He is not likely to put himself into anyone's power, and no doubt goes by night in some disguise to meet them. As, of course, he knows you perfectly well, it would be worse than useless for you to try to follow him. That is going to be done by Tom Roberts." ...|$|E

5000|$|Palencia can {{boast of}} being one of the places where best Castilian Spanish is spoken. For this reason and the others I have {{mentioned}} before, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a great potential to host overseas students who would like to learn Spanish. Thus, we are presently working on a project called Learn Spanish in Palencia.|$|E

5000|$|Newly {{appointed}} {{prime minister}} Theresa May {{made clear that}} negotiations with the EU required a [...] "UK-wide approach". On 15 July 2016, she said: [...] "I have already said that I won't be triggering article 50 until <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a UK approach and objectives for negotiations - I {{think it is important}} that we establish that before we trigger article 50." ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{given how}} {{far down the}} road the Bush Administration has taken us, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no {{realistic}} {{choice but to go}} to war this year. And yet I think the Administration has handled the diplomacy and public diplomacy of coalition building very poorly, and I am deeply concerned about the impact this will have both on postwar reconstruction and on our ability to garner allies for the inevitable next crisis.|$|E
5000|$|Phil Labonte stated {{about the}} album: [...] "I think this record is {{far and away}} better than our last one. It's, in my opinion, far and away better than 'Overcome'." [...] Personally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a lot of songs on the new album that are better. He also stated: [...] "I think the record overall is {{probably}} leaning 'sing-y.' We've got 12 songs, and there's probably four or five songs that are beginning to end singing. There's some screaming worked into two or three." ...|$|E
