5|$|Born in Swetes, Antigua, Ambrose came to cricket at a {{relatively}} late age, having preferred basketball in his youth, but quickly made an impression as a fast bowler. Progressing through regional and national teams, he was first chosen <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies in 1988. He was almost immediately successful and remained in the team {{until his retirement in}} 2000. On many occasions, his bowling was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies winning matches which seemed lost, particularly in association with Courtney Walsh. Against Australia in 1993, he took seven wickets while conceding a single run; in 1994 he was largely responsible for bowling England out for 46 runs, taking six for 24 (six wickets for 24 runs).|$|E
5|$|The 1969 {{tour was}} a three Test series. The captains were Ray Illingworth for England and Sobers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies. The West Indies had an ageing team and, with Sobers {{suffering}} {{a loss of}} form, were always the weaker side.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan for Regional Eurostar services to destinations north of London was abandoned, the significantly improved journey times available since the opening of High Speed 1 — which is physically connected to both the East Coast Main Line and the North London Line (<b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Coast Main Line) at St Pancras — and the recently increased maximum speeds on the West Coast Main Line may make potential Regional Eurostar services more commercially viable. This {{would be even more}} likely if proposals are adopted for a new high-speed line from London to the north of Britain.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Flintoff was {{the leading}} {{performer}} for England, averaging 64.50 with the bat and claiming 14 wickets. Ashley Giles {{was the leading}} wicket taker in the series with 22. This series saw Ian Bell make his Test debut in the final Test of the series, where he compiled his maiden half-century. The main highlights <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies were Chanderpaul's batting performance in scoring 437 runs {{at an average of}} 72.83, the highest in the series, and Bravo's 16 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, with the West Indies not the force they had been, and England on the rise. The key players <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies were Lara, Walsh and Bishop while England {{had a strong}} opening pair of Atherton and Graham Thorpe plus the young Dominic Cork who would be decisive in England's two Test {{victories}} in this series.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{was born}} in Plaistow, Essex. He played <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Ham Schools team {{alongside}} Ken Green, who was later to be a Birmingham teammate, and as a youth played for Ilford F.C. The outbreak of the Second World War when Boyd was 15 delayed his entry into football as a career. He joined the Royal Navy, and while serving in Malta was spotted playing for a Navy team by a Plymouth Argyle supporter, who recommended him to the club. After a trial, Boyd signed professional forms in December 1945.|$|E

5|$|By the 1870s, Chicago {{had become}} the main {{financial}} center <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed {{the majority of the}} wooden structures within city. The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new grid network and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood. These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.|$|E
5|$|Cheadle Hulme {{is served}} by a fire station on Turves Road which opened in October 1960. Before this the area made use of a service in Cheadle. An {{ambulance}} station is near the fire station, and the closest public hospital is Stepping Hill Hospital in Hazel Grove. Until the early 2000s the area had a police station which served as the headquarters <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> Stockport area. The building, which opened in 1912, was sold in 2006 and converted into flats.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Saga {{was officially}} {{announced}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo for release {{in the winter}} of that year. It was subsequently delayed into 2005, and a delux edition which would include a box for containing both Digital Devil Saga games was announced as a consolation. The second game's release window was officially announced at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo, to be published in North America by Atlus USA. The game arrived in stores in North America a week earlier than originally scheduled. Both Digital Devil Saga games were published in Europe by Ghostlight.|$|E
50|$|Mears joined <b>the</b> <b>Wests</b> Tigers on {{a one-year}} deal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2002 season.

Mears played <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wests</b> Tigers <b>for</b> two more seasons, playing in 33 more games. He was released from his contract at the end of 2004 due to the emergence of Robbie Farah as a hooker at the Tigers.|$|R

5|$|Early on September19 a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> coast of Florida from Bonita Beach {{to the mouth of}} the Suwannee River, which was upgraded to {{a tropical}} storm warning and hurricane watch the next day. Tropical storm watches were posted for the state's Atlantic coast north of Jupiter Inlet to near Flagler Beach. A tropical storm watch, and later a warning, was issued for the northwestern Bahamas. The advisories were amended several times before being discontinued on September20 through September21.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Lloyd St Hill (9 March 1904– 21 May 1957) was a Trinidadian cricketer {{who played}} two Test matches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies in 1930. His brothers, Wilton and Cyl, also played for Trinidad; in addition, the former played Test matches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies. St Hill first played local cricket in Trinidad {{with some success}} and {{graduated}} to the Trinidad team. He played regularly {{for the next five}} years but was not selected for any representative West Indian teams. His increased success in 1929 attracted the attention of the West Indies selectors, and he played two Test matches against England in 1930. Although not particularly successful, he bowled steadily and was chosen to tour Australia with the West Indies in 1930–31. He was fairly effective in first-class games but the form of the other fast bowlers in the team meant that he was not chosen for any of the Test matches.|$|E
5|$|Garry Sobers was {{the captain}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indies, while England had three captains: Mike Smith (first Test), Cowdrey (second-fourth Test) and Brian Close (fifth Test) during the five Test series. The West Indies team {{was not as}} strong as in the {{previous}} series, but many of their deficiencies were glossed over by Sobers' exceptional all-round performance. He scored centuries in three Test matches and claimed five wicket innings hauls in two Tests.|$|E

Gyorko intends on finishing his bachelor's degree in business.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 the Queen's Park Oval hosted England and saw West Indian {{victory by}} an innings, {{followed}} by a draw against India in 1982. The first One-Day International at the ground took place between India and the West Indies in March 1983, with the hosts taking a comfortable victory. Australia, New Zealand and England all visited the ground for Test and ODI games during 1985 and 1986, faring poorly. The decade ended with tours by Pakistan and India, mixed with matches from the now entitled Red Stripe Cup, the new name <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Indian domestic first-class competition.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the occupation, the Allies {{controlled}} traffic between the zones to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western and Soviet zones in 1946 to stem a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6million Germans left the Soviet zone <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>west.</b>|$|E
