The two men were fierce rivals, their political differences reinforced by personal relationships. Thus two of Loredan's daughters, Maria and Marina, were married to Francesco Barbaro and Ermolao Donà respectively, both of them opponents of Foscari. Furthermore, when Foscari proposed a marriage between his own daughter and one of Loredan's sons, it was rejected.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 July, Ironside {{was summoned}} to the War Office and {{informed}} {{that he was to}} be replaced by Brooke as C-in-C Home Forces, effective immediately. The formal reason was that the Cabinet wished to have someone with recent combat experience in command, and Ironside accepted the dismissal gracefully – [...] "I was quite prepared to be released. I had done my best ... I can't complain. Cabinets <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> in times of stress. I don't suppose that Winston liked doing it, for he is always loyal to his friends". On his arrival at Home Forces HQ, Brooke was astonished that Ironside had not stayed to appraise him of the situation, neither had he left him any notes except for a brief memo to say that he had arranged for Brooke to use his staff car.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{experimental}} economics places {{individuals in}} situations where they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> about questions that affect their real or theoretical pocketbooks. Such experiments are conducted in a controlled laboratory environment. The analysis of the experiments {{is limited to the}} evaluation of market outcomes and questionnaires. The survey provides only subjective impressions. Another issue is that questionnaire answers often follow social norms rather than revealing the subject's real view. Physiological parameters, such as skin conductance, provides additional, objective measurements that allow a deeper insight into the decision making process.|$|E

In their article, West and Zimmerman use examples such as bathrooms, sports, coupling, conversations, professions and {{the division of labor}} to illustrate the ways in which gender is prevalent in many taken for granted activities. West and Zimmerman employ the example of a professional woman in a male-dominated field, through which it becomes apparent that the woman will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> {{as to whether or not}} she should engage in [...] "unfeminine" [...] behavior that would otherwise be an integral part of her identity.|$|E

50|$|A lot of {{strategy}} is used when players <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> and negotiate. Messages always arrive using the data feed style {{to make the}} game more business-like. The game can end with a loss if the wrong decision is made {{at the wrong time}} (similar to dying in an action game). The player {{will have to deal with}} loan sharks in the Caribbean, ruthless corporate executives from rival companies, arbitration sessions, and components that make the game look more like a strategy game at times. There are no items to use and very little action (with moving the guy around a virtual office building).|$|E

50|$|Most {{cards in}} the library can only be used in {{conjunction}} with vampires. Some cards have no cost in resources to play, in other cases to put a card in play it must be paid for using 'pool' or the blood on his vampires. Pool represents the player's influence, and if it is reduced to zero the player is out of the game (each player starts the game with 30 pool). Therefore, players continually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> based on how much they want to invest into assets in play and how much to retain to stay alive, especially against other players capable of sudden dangerous 'bleeds' (direct attacks on the players pool).|$|E

During the early 1960s, he began to turn his attention towards politics.|$|R

This {{relatively}} new concept, {{a sort of}} hybrid notion, has been developed by philosopher Amartya Sen and {{can be thought of}} as [...] "the ability and means to choose our life course should be spread as equally as possible across society." [...] It is an equal shot at empowerment or a chance to develop up to his or her potential rather than equal goods or equal chances. In a teaching guide, equality of autonomy was explained as [...] "equality in the degree of empowerment people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions</b> affecting their lives, how much choice and control they have given their circumstances." [...] Sen's approach requires [...] "active intervention of institutions like the state into people's lives" [...] but with an aim towards [...] "fostering of people's self-creation rather than their living conditions." [...] Sen argued that [...] "the ability to convert incomes into opportunities is affected by a multiplicity of individual and social differences that mean some people will need more than others to achieve the same range of capabilities." ...|$|E
