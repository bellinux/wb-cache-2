50|$|The {{detection}} {{is based}} on a three-dimensional <b>fluxmeter</b> sensor. The <b>fluxmeter</b> element consists of a ring of several thermocouples in series. The corresponding thermopile of high thermal conductivity surrounds the experimental space within the calorimetric block. The radial arrangement of the thermopiles guarantees an almost complete integration of the heat. This is verified by the calculation of the efficiency ratio that indicates that an average value of 94% +/- 1% of heat is transmitted through the sensor on the full range of temperature of the Calvet-type calorimeter. In this setup, the sensitivity of the calorimeter is not affected by the crucible, the type of purgegas, or the flow rate. The main advantage of the setup is the increase of the experimental vessel's size and consequently the size of the sample, without affecting the accuracy of the calorimetric measurement.|$|E

The front wheels of the test vehicle are positioned on a dynamometer and driven by the vehicle engine.

50|$|An {{interesting}} form of {{ballistic galvanometer}} is the Grassot <b>fluxmeter.</b> In order to operate correctly, the discharge time through the regular ballistic galvanometer must be {{shorter than the}} period of oscillation. For some applications, especially those involving inductors, this condition cannot be met. The Grassot <b>fluxmeter</b> solves this. Its construction {{is similar to that}} of a ballistic galvanometer, but its coil is suspended without any restoring forces in the suspension thread or in the current leads. The core (bobbin) of the coil is of a non-conductive material. When an electric charge is connected to the instrument, the coil starts moving in the magnetic field of the galvanometer's magnet, generating an opposing e.m.f. and coming to a stop regardless of the time of the current flow. The change in the coil position is proportional only to the quantity of charge. The coil is returned to the zero position by the reversing of the current or manually.|$|E

However, measurements of anhysteretic magnetization are very sophisticated due to the fact, that the <b>fluxmeter</b> has to keep accuracy of integration during the demagnetization process. As a result, experimental verification of the model of anhysteretic magnetization is possible only for materials with negligible hysteresis loop.Anhysteretic magnetization of typical magnetic material can be calculated as a weighted sum of isotropic and anisotropic anhysteretic magnetization: ...|$|E

Numerical predictions are made by solving the Navier-Stokes equations in a full three-dimensional, time-dependent form using the finite-volume method. Convergence is accelerated using a multigrid algorithm and turbulence modeled using a simple mixing length formulation.

40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of corona {{discharges}} in positive rod/earthed plane systems subjected to impulse voltages up to 200 kV. For this an electrostatic <b>fluxmeter</b> for the examination of electric fields and charge densities present in the corona has been developed and used. Measurements of electric fields and current densities so obtained during the discharge are compared with conventional measurements of total current densities. These show that the transient at {{the centre of the}} plane is a double pulse of time separation 0. 1 to 1. 0 μs. The first pulse is shown by the <b>fluxmeter</b> to be due to induced charge on the plane surface and the second to electron emission from the surface. At the plane electrode the space charge electric field can be as great as 8 kV/cm, and the conduction current density in the corona 45 A/m 2. The duration of the decaying space-charge field is several seconds. The construction, calibration and synchronization of the <b>fluxmeter,</b> which can measure electric fields down to 10 V/cm with a time resolution of 0. 5 ms, are described.

40|$|AbstractStatistics {{reveal that}} people mostly die in {{bedrooms}} or lounges, from smoking-related fires. However, at present, {{little is known}} of this phenomenon, {{especially in terms of}} identifying which fire effects first injure people. Through several real-scale fire tests, two different sets of fire scenarios are explored in a single bedroom apartment. As in everyday life, the test room is equipped with furniture, clothes and items supplied from major retailers. It is heavily instrumented with sensors to record tenability-related data (thermocouples, heat <b>fluxmeters,</b> gas analyzer including 3 FTIRs, opacimeters and several cameras for video recording). The first set of tests explores a bed fire scenario, in which a person has fallen asleep, accidentally lighting its quilt, and then its mattress, e. g. with a cigarette or a small flame. The door and window remain closed during the entire test, and the fire decreases rapidly to become insignificant {{because of a lack of}} oxygen. The second set of tests explores a wastepaper basket fire scenario, with a first person leaving the room quickly, while a second person – who is potentially disabled – cannot leave the room. As the door remains open, there is enough oxygen supply, and the fire grows to flashover. The test results are designated as reference for calculation models validation. In addition, their interpretation in terms of tenability is presented; fire effects are classified and discussed. All this work also highlights the importance of smoke alarms in such premises...|$|R
40|$|Conditions in the internal-air {{system of}} a high- {{pressure}} turbine stage are modelled using a rig comprising an outer pre-swirl chamber {{separated by a}} seal from an inner rotor-stator system. Pre-swirl nozzles in the stator supply the "blade cooling" air, which leaves the system via holes in the rotor, and disc-cooling air enters at {{the centre of the}} system and leaves through clearances in the peripheral seals. The experimental rig is instrumented with thermocouples, <b>fluxmeters,</b> pitot tubes and pressure taps enabling temperatures, heat fluxes, velocities and pressures to be measured at a number of radial locations. For rotational Reynolds numbers, the swirl ratio and the ratios of disc-cooling and blade-cooling flow rates are chosen to be representative of those found inside gas turbines. Measured radial distributions of velocity, temperature and Nusselt number are compared with computations obtained from an axisymmetric elliptic solver, featuring a low-Reynolds-number K-e turbulence model. For the inner rotor-stator system, the computed core temperatures and velocities are in good agreement with measured values, but the Nussel numbers are underpredicted. For the outer pre-swirl chamber, it was possible to make comparisons between the measured and computed values for cooling-air temperatures but not for the Nusselt numbers. As expected, the temperature of the blade-cooling air decreases as the swirl ratio increase, but the computed air temperatures are significantly lower than the measured ones.

Fifteen-minute average of the correla-tions between the fluctuations of the two signals (w ' T ') and later the vertical turbulent heat flux were computed from a Remtech <b>fluxmeter</b> station. Friction velocity u was deduced from the <b>fluxmeter</b> data as well. It was seen particularly on Dhu Al-Hijjah 11 starting from 2100 h until next day at 0200 h on Dhu Al-Hijjah 12, u was attained up to 0. 8 ms– 1 at night. This may be interpreted as the direction was east-erly to south easterly wind. The wind flowed across obstacles such as tents, shelters, high buildings [...] . etc. It was noticed always that even-ings sensible heat had positive values, most probably because at night the long wave radiation doesn’t escape outside the valley but collides with vertical walls and slopes of the valley and then reflects to the ground. Thus the contribution of large amounts of long wave and the resulting excessive heat on the floor in addition to thousands of pilgrims standing there keep the warm lower layer of the valley unstable throughout night...|$|E
40|$|Small island {{developing}} {{states that}} wish {{to sustain their}} freshwater resources face two main challenges: intensification of agriculture and climate change and variability. These topics were studied on the main island of the Kingdom of Tonga, Tongatapu (272 km 2, 175 ° 12 'W, 21 ° 08 'S). In 1987, a squash (Cucurbita maxima L.) industry emerged on Tongatapu that solely exports to the Japanese market during an off-season niche period in November. At a national level, the squash industry has accounted for about 40 % of the total export revenue. With the export of the squash, a ten-fold increase in the importation and use of agri-chemicals has occurred. At the same time an increased population (currently 100. 000) puts pressure on the fresh groundwater resources of the island (there is no surface water on Tongatapu). These pressures include both pollution {{and an increase in}} pumping that leads to salt water intrusion. Coupled with expected sea level rise, and an increase in the frequency of El Niño episodes, this puts the water resources and the environment under pressure. Research was done on two scales, the so-called field scale and the island scale. At the field scale measurements and modelling was carried out of plant transpiration using heat-pulse and meteorological measurements made in this tropical maritime climate, water movement, and nitrate and ammonium transport using a hydraulic characterisation of the soil. The leaching of nitrates and ammonium from the field was quantified using <b>fluxmeters</b> and alternative agricultural strategies were proposed. The hydraulic transfer properties of the limestone aquifer were deduced from the time lag between the variations in rainfall and salinity measurements of the freshwater lens. Using an unique 10 -year dataset of monitored salinity of pumped water and a model, it was shown that the rainfall variations related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation determined the quality of the freshwater in the aquifer. It was also possible to predict the relative salinity of the freshwater 10 months in advance using the Southern Oscillation Index. The pressures on the water resources that result from agricultural and climatic impacts need to be resolved through a balanced management strategy. This management strategy should at one hand account for the benefits and impacts of agriculture to the long-term economical development of the coral atoll, {{and on the other hand}} use climatic information and predictability to harness the islands water resources against impacts of climate variability and change. Finally, the case-study of Tongatapu was used to sketch a framework for the sustainable development of a small island developing state. (AGRO 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the effects of plantar foot pressure on the microcirculation of healthy subjects and patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis was carried out. In the light of no equipment available {{to carry out this}} study a new system was developed. A shoe device was built with a combined pressure/skin blood flow transducer embedded in a three-tier piston mechanism in the heel so that plantar foot pressure could be applied/removed and quantified. The skin blood flow transducer made contact with the skin and was able to collect data about the microcirculatory state of the skin. The first system developed consisted of the laser Doppler <b>Fluxmeter</b> (Moor Instruments Ltd., UK) used to collect skin blood flow information and incorporating a strain gauge (Kyowa Electronic Instruments Co. Ltd., Japan) to quantify plantar foot pressure applied to the centre of the heel. This system was visually/sound synchronised and due to the time delay error it was modified. For the final system developed, the strain gauge was replaced with a custom-made Novel capacitative transducer (Novel, Germany) to quantify pressure. This allowed for the pressure system to be electronically synchronised in real time with the laser Doppler <b>fluxmeter</b> using an electronic synchronisation box. A number of studies were carried out to validate the systems. The developed systems were used to: (a) investigate the effects of the venoarteriolar response in healthy subjects with regards to the effects of plantar foot pressure on skin blood flow. The study concluded that subject positioning (that is, supine or semi-weight bearing) has an effect on how the microcirculation of the skin reacts to applied pressure. Thus, studies investigating the effects of external pressure on skin blood flow must have their subjects in a position that is related to what is being studies; (b) investigate the effects of plantar foot pressure on skin blood flow in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
