The 2012 Volt has seven option packages while the 2011 model had only three.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} received knee airbags, lighted rear-seat vanity mirrors, and new trim selections, including bird's eye maple wood. New options {{included an}} updated navigation system, Bluetooth and a backup camera. A driver-programmable electronic key feature allowed {{the vehicle to}} detect the <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> in the owner's pocket and unlock the doors by touch.|$|E
25|$|Flexible display cards enable {{financial}} payment cardholders {{to generate}} a one-time password to reduce online banking and transaction fraud. Electronic paper offers a flat and thin alternative to existing <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> tokens for data security. The world’s first ISO compliant smart card with an embedded display was developed by Innovative Card Technologies and nCryptone in 2005. The cards were manufactured by Nagra ID.|$|E

25|$|The 2010, 2012, and 2013 models lacked an {{interior}} trunk release mechanism. The trunk was only accessible using the <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> (Remote Keyless Entry) or a touch sensor between the trunk lid and the license plate. The 2011 year model added a remote release button {{at the left}} of the steering wheel on the instrument panel. The 2014 model refresh returned the trunk release button to LaCrosse but placed it on the driver door.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, as part {{of running}} changes {{consistent}} with those of the MY15 Toyota 86 GTS, the Subaru BRZ also featured a new <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> and two new colours, including ‘WR Blue Pearl’ metallic finish. In addition, Subaru also launched special editions both for the United States and Australia markets. For the former, one thousand BRZ Series. Blue editions were marketed at additional cost, half painted in Blue Pearl and the other half in Crystal Pearl White. This model featured STI body kit parts, 17-inch STI black alloy wheels and red brake calipers. For Australia, Subaru launched a similar variant known as the Special Edition, also at additional cost. It featured stripes across the bonnet, boot and roof; 17-inch STI black alloy wheels; STI boot spoiler plus front, side and rear-side under spoilers; a rear diffuser and a push-button starter switch. It was available in every existing BRZ paint hue.|$|E
50|$|Access control <b>key</b> <b>fobs</b> are {{electronic}} <b>key</b> <b>fobs</b> {{that are}} used for controlling access to buildings or vehicles. They are used for activating such things as remote keyless entry systems on motor vehicles. Early electric <b>key</b> <b>fobs</b> operated using infrared and required a clear line-of-sight to function. These could be copied using a programmable remote control. More recent models use challenge-response authentication over radio frequency, so these are harder to copy and do not need line-of-sight to operate. Programming these remotes sometimes requires the automotive dealership to connect a diagnostic tool, {{but many of them}} can be self-programmed by following a sequence of steps in the vehicle and usually requires at least one working key.|$|R

25|$|The {{charge port}} area now {{comes with a}} light not {{provided}} on earlier models, {{and the ability to}} open the port door from inside the car or by using the <b>key</b> <b>fob.</b> The onboard charger in all 2013 Leafs has also been reduced in size and relocated to a new position under the hood, which increases cargo volume. The new base trim level is called the Leaf S model, and {{is the result of a}} strategy for affordability. The S trim replaces the LED headlights with less expensive projector beams, and uses 16-inch steel wheels with plastic covers rather than alloy wheels. The base trim does not include the navigation system and the remote connectivity that allows drivers to turn on the climate control and monitor battery charging remotely using a smartphone. LED headlamps, fog lights, 17-inch alloy wheels and leather seating, are reserved for the higher-end SL trim. Additional premium upgrades to the SL trim include a Bose seven-speaker audio system and around view monitor, which puts cameras in front, in back and on the side mirrors for parking assistance.|$|E
25|$|Between December 1976 and March 1977, Gacy {{is known}} to have killed an {{unidentified}} young man estimated to be around 25 years old. An inscription upon a <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> found among the personal artifacts buried with this unknown victim suggests his first name may have been Greg or Gregory. His body was buried in the crawl space beneath the body of a 20-year-old named Jon Prestidge, a Michigan youth visiting friends in Chicago whom Gacy killed on March 15. After the murder of Prestidge, Gacy is believed to have murdered one further unidentified youth exhumed from his crawl space, although the timing of this particular youth's murder is inconclusive. The youth was buried parallel to the wall of Gacy's crawl space directly beneath the entrance to his home. The two victims murdered on the same day in May 1976 were buried alongside this youth, yet sequential burial patterns of three victims murdered in 1977 leave an equal possibility this particular victim may have been murdered in the spring or summer of 1977. All that is known about this youth is that he was aged between 17 and 21 years old and that he had suffered a fractured left collarbone before his disappearance.|$|E
500|$|MY08: models came in April 2007. The {{horizontal}} {{wood grain}} key line across the dash on the Berlina {{was replaced by}} a matte silver insert.

500|$|More recently, Elgato {{introduced}} {{a line of}} [...] "smart" [...] products, such as a <b>key</b> <b>fob</b> that track's the user's distance from their car or purse and provides notifications to help them find it. In 2014, it {{introduced a}} home monitoring system called Eve, which provides alerts to users regarding things like air pressure, temperature and water use. Elgato also developed light bulbs that can respond to programming on a mobile device and respond to commands over Bluetooth and it produces two Thunderbolt products: a dock for MacBooks and an external hard drive.|$|E

5000|$|The first GeekPwn contest {{was held}} in Beijing, China, from Oct. 24-25 in 2014, {{sponsored}} by technology firms and internet companies including Google, Microsoft, Huawei, Lenovo and Tencent.

BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.|$|E
2500|$|Map {{lights are}} aimed at {{specific}} passenger positions and allow for reading without glare distraction to the driver.

50|$|Cashin instituted the {{inclusion}} of side pockets, coin purses, and brighter colors (as opposed to the usual hues of browns and tans) in the products. Cashin also designed matching shoes, pens, <b>key</b> <b>fobs,</b> and eyewear, and added hardware to both her clothes and accessories-particularly the silver toggle that became the Coach hallmark-declaring {{that she had been}} inspired by a memory of quickly fastening the top on her convertible sports car.|$|R

The Radio Frequency System, powered by a single standard coin cell, and an innovative vehicle-mounted RF transceiver, was developed together by Honda and Continental, and was debuted on the Acura MDX in 2013 and was quickly followed by the Acura TLX and Acura RLX in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Computerized {{authentication}} systems, such as key cards, raise privacy concerns, {{since they}} enable computer surveillance of each entry. RFID cards and <b>key</b> <b>fobs</b> {{are becoming increasingly}} popular due to their ease of use.

Regions Bank of Shreveport, LA generously donated eight community bicycles to Centenary College of Louisiana. To facilitate use of these bicycles students have designed and constructed a prototype system for automated loan and return. The system consists of hardware including a magnetic card swipe, control circuit, lockbox with electric strike, and radio frequency identification (RFID) transmitter/receiver and <b>key</b> <b>fobs.</b> <b>Keys</b> with RFID <b>fobs</b> are stored in the lock-box {{in close proximity to}} the RFID transmitter/receiver.
