5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} questionable. The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical <b>in</b> <b>practice,</b> <b>and</b> the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E

When Hašek recovered and got back into his stride, Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit coach Mike Babcock announced Hašek to start in the 2008 playoffs. Through the first two games against the Nashville Predators, the Red Wings were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was in goal {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs. Despite expressing disappointment at losing his starting position, Hašek maintained his professionalism <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> continued to support his teammates, with Darren McCarty citing a close relationship between Hašek and Osgood. Eventually the Red Wings beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games for the Stanley Cup.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to analyze the insertion and management of people with disabilities in a Brazilian enterprise with more than one thousand of these kinds of workers already hired, verifying the possible relations among the ways in which managers face the disability, the adequacy <b>in</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> work conditions, and the satisfaction of disabled people towards the relevant aspects to maintain the Quality of Working Life. The theoretical references were conceptions of disability, actions of adequacy <b>in</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> work conditions, and quality of working life. The presentation and analysis of data used Descriptive Statistics and Spearman correlation in a quantitative perspective and content analysis of interviews in a qualitative approach. The results confirmed significant relations between conceptions of disability and actions of adequacy <b>in</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> work conditions. Moreover, implications of conceptions of disability and actions of adequacy <b>in</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> work conditions were verified, mainly, concerning the satisfaction of people with disabilities related to the opportunity of personal growth in the job.

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the {{comments}} were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not make the effort to train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused <b>in</b> <b>practice,</b> <b>and</b> a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil radiators. This concept did not work <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} {{makes no}} mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate President will be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E

The Albanian flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If the Albanian flag did have to go up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E

5|$|Limited running <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> a wet {{qualifying}} session {{meant that}} teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled {{much of the}} race from pole position, only relinquishing the lead when he pitted, {{and he went on}} to take his third victory of the season. Lewis Hamilton's one hundredth Grand Prix started with a disaster when he picked up a puncture on the third lap and spent most of the race {{at the tail end of}} the field before retiring on lap 56 with a suspension problem. Confusion briefly reigned when Hamilton, in seventeenth place at the time, began lapping faster than the leaders and sought to unlap himself. Sebastian Vettel later claimed that this was a ploy by McLaren to force both him and Alonso to drive defensively against Hamilton, slowing them down enough to allow team-mate Jenson Button to leap-frog them at the second round of stops; Vettel lost a position to Button, but Alonso was unaffected, as Ferrari pitted him before Hamilton could interfere with his race. Button briefly looked as if he had the pace to pass Alonso for the race lead, but the race was deadlocked in the final twenty laps, and Button began to fade in the final five laps of the race. The race was marked by another technical dispute regarding Red Bull Racing, who were referred to the stewards by FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer for what he felt was an illegal engine map in use on the Red Bull RB8. The stewards elected to take no action against Red Bull, stating that the team had not violated any of the technical regulations, but noted that they did not accept all of the arguments presented by the team when asked to explain. The stewards were less forgiving of Vettel, who ran wide at the hairpin while trying to pass Button and could only complete the pass outside the limits of the circuit. Vettel had twenty seconds added to his race time as a penalty, demoting him to fifth overall. With Button promoted to second, Kimi Räikkönen inherited third place and Kamui Kobayashi was classified a career-best fourth.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} conference season, the Owls won against Fordham 70–51 at the IZOD Center. Fordham last won a conference game on January 28, 2009, but Temple Owls had a 27–22 {{deficit in the}} first half. However, a {{balanced}} offensive attack, led by Juan Fernandez and Ramone Moore's 15 points each, helped Temple Owls to take the lead. Michael Eric scored his first collegiate double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Lavoy Allen was the fourth starter to score in double figures, with 12 points. On January 6, starting point guard Juan Fernandez bruised his knee <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> missed the January 9 game against Saint Louis. Despite shooting 30.6 percent from the field, the Owls won 57–53 behind Ramone Moore's 15 points. Temple Owls was behind 41–32 with 10:13 remaining, then went on an 11–2 run. Moore scored five consecutive points to break a tie at 49, giving the Owls a lead. The Billikens missed all seven three-point shots against the Temple Owls defense. Fernandez also missed the January 12 game against St. Bonaventure, but the Owls defeated the Bonnies nonetheless, 83–55. Ramone Moore led all five starters in double-digit scoring with 19 points. The team shot 30 of 59 {{from the field and}} 9 for 21 from three-point land.|$|E
