5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb <b>glycols,</b> it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{polyester}} polyols {{are based}} on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and <b>glycols,</b> such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols {{are based on}} reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with <b>glycols</b> such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.|$|E

Typically, e-series <b>glycol</b> ethers are found in pharmaceuticals, sunscreens, cosmetics, inks, dyes and water based paints, while p-series <b>glycol</b> ethers are used in degreasers, cleaners, aerosol paints and adhesives. Both E-series <b>glycol</b> ethers and P-series <b>glycol</b> ethers {{can be used as}} intermediates that undergo further chemical reactions, producing <b>glycol</b> diethers and <b>glycol</b> ether acetates.

Instead of removing water, ethylene <b>glycol</b> can also be used to depress the temperature at which hydrates are formed. The purity of <b>glycol</b> used for hydrate suppression (monoethylene <b>glycol)</b> is typically around 80%, whereas the purity of <b>glycol</b> used for dehydration (triethylene <b>glycol)</b> is typically 95 to more than 99%. Moreover, the injection rate for hydrate suppression is much lower than the circulation rate in a <b>glycol</b> dehydration tower.|$|R

25|$|In 1934, Carothers {{turned his}} {{attention}} to fibers again. Now the team substituted diamines for <b>glycols</b> to produce a type of polymer called a polyamide. These substances were much more stable than the polyesters formed by using the <b>glycols.</b> The ability of polyamides to form crystalline domains through hydrogen bonding gives them increased mechanical properties. Therefore, they might produce a synthetic silk that would be practical for everyday use. His research resulted in the invention of a number of new polyamides. The lab work for this project was conducted by Dr. W. R. Peterson and Dr. Donald Coffman. In 1935 Dr. Gerard Berchet was assigned to this polyamide research.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene is {{oxidized}} {{to produce}} ethylene oxide, a {{key raw material}} {{in the production of}} surfactants and detergents by ethoxylation.

25|$|A {{majority}} of body proteins is glycosylated, although {{the proportion of}} carbohydrates in proteins is quite variable. Leblond had shown in earlier studies that the Golgi region in most cell types was dramatically stained by the periodic acid-Schiff staining technique, which is specially directed to carbohydrate-rich proteins carrying 1,2 <b>glycols.</b> In the electron microscope, using the periodic acid silver technique, there was a gradient of staining intensity from the cis to the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that carbohydrate residues were added to proteins at this site.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines flexural, heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these <b>glycols</b> form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity.

25|$|The {{reactivity}} that {{is responsible}} for many of ethylene oxide's hazards also make it useful. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. These products include detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as ethylene glycol, ethanolamines, simple and complex <b>glycols,</b> polyglycol ethers, and other compounds. Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance. At room temperature it is a flammable, carcinogenic, mutagenic, irritating, and anaesthetic gas.|$|E

500|$|Ethylene glycol {{involved}} in aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations is released onto land {{and eventually to}} waterways. A report prepared for the World Health Organization in 2000 stated that laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have shown toxic effects and death (p.12). Field studies {{in the vicinity of}} an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity, although those effects could not definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol (p.12). The process of biodegrading of <b>glycols</b> also increases the risk to organisms, as oxygen levels become depleted in surface waters (p.13). Another study found the toxicity to aquatic and other organisms was relatively low, but the oxygen-depletion effect of biodegradation was more serious (p.245).

50|$|The primary base {{ingredients}} {{of the liquid}} solution is propylene <b>glycol</b> and glycerin. About 20% to 27% of propylene <b>glycol</b> and glycerin-based liquid particles are inhaled. The long-term effects of inhaled propylene <b>glycol</b> has not been studied, and is unknown. The effects of inhaled glycerin are unknown. Being exposed to propylene <b>glycol</b> may cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. The risk from the inhalation of propylene <b>glycol</b> and glycerin is probably low. Propylene <b>glycol</b> and glycerin have not {{been shown to be}} safe. Some research states that propylene <b>glycol</b> emissions may cause respiratory irritation and raise the likelihood to develop asthma.

25|$|Ethylene <b>glycol</b> {{disrupts}} hydrogen bonding when {{dissolved in}} water. Pure ethylene <b>glycol</b> freezes at about 12°C (10.4°F), but when mixed with water, the mixture does not readily crystallize, {{and therefore the}} freezing point of the mixture is depressed. Specifically, a mixture of 60% ethylene <b>glycol</b> and 40% water freezes at 45°C (49°F). Diethylene <b>glycol</b> behaves similarly. It {{is used as a}} de-icing fluid for windshields and aircraft. The antifreeze capabilities of ethylene <b>glycol</b> have made it a component of vitrification (anticrystallization) mixtures for low-temperature preservation of biological tissues and organs. Mixture of ethylene <b>glycol</b> and water can also be chemically termed as <b>glycol</b> concentrate/compound/mixture/solution.|$|R
30|$|The direct {{grafting}} of ethylene <b>glycol</b> chains into lignin from {{woody biomass}} {{was carried out}} by solvolysis using ethylene <b>glycol.</b> Kubo et al.

Following extraction with water, the lignin fraction was obtained as a water-insoluble solid. Ethylene <b>glycol</b> chains were introduced into the lignin primarily on the hydroxyl groups at the α and γ-positions. The average degree of polymerization (DP) was approximately 3.0.

30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} a rapid HS-GC method for simultaneous quantitation of ethylene <b>glycol</b> and propylene <b>glycol</b> in human serum and plasma samples. Previous {{studies have reported}} GC (Balikova & Kohlicek 1988;Houze et al. 1993; Porter & Auansakul 1982; Smith 1984) methods with liquid injections for ethylene <b>glycol.</b> More recently, a GC-MS method has been described for ethylene <b>glycol</b> determination (Porter & Rutter 2010); however, many clinical laboratories {{do not have access}} to GC-MS instrumentation. The method {{we describe}} utilizes HS-GC instrumentation commonly used for measurement of ethanol, methanol, acetone, and isopropanol (‘toxic alcohols’) and allows for HS-GC for the toxic alcohols, ethylene <b>glycol,</b> and propylene <b>glycol.</b> The relatively high boiling points of ethylene <b>glycol</b> (197 °C) and propylene <b>glycol</b> (188 °C) necessitate derivatization prior to HS-GC. We utilize a simple derivitization step with phenylboronic acid prior to HS-GC, adapting from the original phenylboronic acid GC liquid injection method (Porter & Auansakul 1982). We also present a retrospective analysis into determination of ethylene <b>glycol</b> and propylene <b>glycol</b> in specimens at an academic medical center central clinical laboratory.|$|R

2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene <b>glycols</b> in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 {{metric tons of}} flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed [...] polyurethane rigid foams {{to be used as}} high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.|$|E
2500|$|Polyols for {{flexible}} applications use low functionality initiators such as {{dipropylene glycol}} (f=2), glycerine (f=3), or a sorbitol/water solution (f=2.75). Polyols for rigid applications use high functionality initiators such as sucrose (f=8), sorbitol (f=6), toluenediamine (f=4), and Mannich bases (f=4). Propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide {{is added to}} the initiators until the desired molecular weight is achieved. The order of addition and the amounts of each oxide affect many polyol properties, such as compatibility, water-solubility, and reactivity. Polyols made with only propylene oxide are terminated with secondary hydroxyl groups and are less reactive than polyols capped with ethylene oxide, which contain primary hydroxyl groups. Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone. [...] A special class of polyether polyols, poly(tetramethylene ether) <b>glycols,</b> which are made by polymerizing tetrahydrofuran, are used in high performance coating, wetting and elastomer applications.|$|E
30|$|The results {{presented}} here indicate that detection of propylene <b>glycol</b> {{is common in}} hospital patients, particularly those managed from drug overdoses or other toxic ingestions. The major source of propylene <b>glycol</b> comes from iatrogenic administration of poorly water-soluble medications, especially intravenous lorazepam used for sedation. Intravenous formulations of lorazepam may contain up to 80 % (v/v) propylene <b>glycol.</b> Other intravenous medications that may contain propylene <b>glycol</b> include diazepam, etomidate, and phenytoin (Al-Khafaji et al. 2002; Arbour 1999; Chicella et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2002). Another source of propylene <b>glycol</b> is activated charcoal preparations that use propylene <b>glycol</b> as the excipient to make the charcoal less gritty and easier to administer (Krasowski et al. 2012). Although the toxic plasma concentration of propylene <b>glycol</b> is not well-defined, toxicity has been reported with plasma concentrations as low as 100  mg/dL (Zar et al. 2007). However, even if not directly toxic, propylene <b>glycol</b> increases plasma osmolality and complicates the use of osmolal gap in clinical diagnosis and management, especially for patients receiving multiple doses of propylene glycol-containing medication, as may be done in intubated patients requiring extended sedation (Krasowski et al. 2012). Propylene <b>glycol</b> has also been reported as an interferent in enzyme assays for ethylene <b>glycol</b> (Malandain & Cano 1996; Juenke et al. 2011). Our study demonstrates that propylene <b>glycol</b> may be detected in patients who have ingested ethylene <b>glycol,</b> with iatrogenic drugs such as intravenous lorazepam or activated charcoal being common sources of propylene <b>glycol.</b> These findings illustrate the importance of specific assays for determination of ethylene <b>glycol</b> in human samples.|$|R
