5|$|On 1 November 2009 about 250 {{protesters in}} Brisbane who {{expressed}} anger at Wotton's sentencing.

Benefit concerts were also held in support of him.|$|E
5|$|Some {{opposition}} parties supported the protests' plans, while {{others did not}} explicitly call for demonstration. However, they demanded deep reforms and changes similar to those by the youth. Before the start of protests, the government introduced a number {{of economic and political}} concessions. The protests started with a sit-in <b>in</b> <b>solidarity</b> with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 {{in the vicinity of the}} Egyptian embassy in the capital, Manama ten days before the 'Day of Rage'. On the eve of 14 February, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters south of Manama.|$|E

5|$|Idris' {{government}} was increasingly unpopular {{by the latter}} 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system {{in order to take}} advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the Western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals <b>in</b> <b>solidarity</b> with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent <b>in</b> <b>Solidarity</b> and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E

She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T-shirt on which a political statement could be seen.

The international work council of the company, Triumph International Labor Union, protested and collected 2,500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president, supported <b>in</b> <b>solidarity</b> in Germany, inter alia, by the ver.di youth. In November 2008, the Labor Court in Bangkok found the lay-off to have been lawful.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies {{of foreigners}} at the {{cemetery}} were quickly reported to international news organisations, and video footage of the massacre was widely broadcast internationally causing outrage. In response to the massacre, activists around the world organised <b>in</b> <b>solidarity</b> with the East Timorese, and a new urgency was brought to calls for self-determination. TAPOL, a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia, increased its work around East Timor. In the United States, the East Timor Action Network (now the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network) was founded and soon had chapters in ten cities around the country. Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal, Australia, Japan, Germany, Malaysia, Ireland, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student {{production}} of his opera Kashchey the Deathless was followed {{not with the}} scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, {{which led to a}} police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events, an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence with letters of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory <b>in</b> <b>solidarity</b> with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov; Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.|$|E

5|$|As the 1995–96 season concluded, John McNamara {{sold the}} club to Premier Computers, headed by Alan McGrath. McGrath {{unveiled}} a {{plan to build a}} state-of-the-art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght, and employed Pat Byrne as commercial manager. However, after a couple of weeks and a loss in {{the first game of the}} season, O’Neill was dismissed, while Eviston resigned <b>in</b> <b>solidarity.</b> Byrne was appointed manager of the side playing in Tolka Park once again, and they struggled through the season with the League's joint top scorer, Tony Cousins playing a leading role in avoiding relegation. In May 1997, Alan McGrath resigned as club chairman and was replaced by Brian Kearney, also of Premier Computers, who succeeded in acquiring planning permission for the new stadium in January 1998. However, the permission was delayed by objections until November 1998, by which time Joe Colwell had replaced Kearney as chairman and ended Premier Computers' involvement with the club. On the pitch, Mick Byrne guided Rovers to an Intertoto Cup spot in 1997–98 and an eighth-place finish, the next season. He was replaced by Damien Richardson, who managed the club during their stay at Morton Stadium before his dismissal in April 2002, after a disagreement with Colwell. By that time, a half-built shell of a stadium stood at the Tallaght site; Mulden International Ltd, recruited by Colwell to complete the project, had pulled out of building the stadium. They leased it to a separate company, transferring the responsibility, and focused on four acres that they had retained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{begins in}} 1566, {{and five years}} later the bridge is completed, {{together}} with a caravanserai (or han). The bridge replaces the unreliable ferry transport that was once {{the only means of}} traversing the river and comes to represent an important link between the Bosnia Eyalet {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman Empire. The bridge is built by serfs, who intermittently stage strikes and sabotage the construction site in protest against the poor working conditions. The Ottomans respond harshly, impaling the one caught saboteur. The bridge is wider across the middle portion, known as the gate (or kapija), and this section becomes a popular meeting place. Every important moment in the lives of the local residents comes to revolve around the bridge, with Christian children crossing it to be baptized on the opposite bank, and children of all religions playing around it. As time progresses, legends develop around the history of the bridge. The locals tell of two Christian infants who were buried alive inside the bridge to placate the fairies (vile) that thwart its construction. They come to regard two holes on the side of the bridge as places where the infants' mothers would come to suckle them while they were entombed. About a century later, the Habsburg Monarchy reclaims much of Central Europe and the northern Balkans from the Ottomans, triggering a crisis within the empire. Due to lack of state funds, the caravanserai is abandoned and falls into disuse. The bridge, on the other hand, stands for centuries without maintenance because of how well it was constructed. The residents of Višegrad—Turks, Serbs, Sephardic Jews, and Roma—stand <b>in</b> <b>solidarity</b> with one another during the Drina's regular floods.|$|E
