5|$|Crime in Washington, D.C., <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> areas {{associated}} with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs. A 2010 {{study found that}} 5% of city blocks accounted for over one-quarter of the District's total crime. The more affluent neighborhoods of Northwest Washington are typically safe, but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city. Approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts.|$|E

5|$|Since yttrium is {{chemically}} {{so similar}} to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores (rare-earth minerals) and is extracted by the same refinement processes. A slight distinction is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but the distinction is not perfect. Yttrium <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> the HREE group because of its ion size, though it has a lower atomic mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to manta rays is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low reproductive rate, overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E

Bulgarians are the main ethnic group and comprise 84.8 percent of the population.

The other major towns are Sarh, Moundou, Abéché and Doba, which are considerably smaller but growing rapidly in population and economic activity. Since 2003, 230,000 Sudanese refugees have fled to eastern Chad from war-ridden Darfur.

5|$|About 118tonnes of {{germanium}} {{was produced}} in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite zinc ores where it <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A {{recent study found that}} at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.|$|E

5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed {{mainly because of the}} greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such as that of the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine {{in the body}} is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E

It passes through Dunham Hollow and enters the town of Stephentown as it serves the hamlet of West Stephentown. NY43 continues through forested areas of Stephentown to Stephentown Center, denoted by a cluster of homes near the intersection of NY43 and Newton Road.|$|E

Over 25% of Somerset's population <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> Taunton, Bridgwater and Yeovil. The rest of the county is rural and sparsely populated. Over 9million tourist nights are spent in Somerset each year, which significantly increases the population at peak times.|$|E
5|$|Swedish is {{the sole}} {{official}} national language of Sweden, and one of two in Finland (alongside Finnish).

In 2007 around 5.5% (c. 290,000) of the population of Finland were native speakers of Swedish, though the percentage has been declining steadily since Finland became part of Russia after the Finnish War 1808–1809. The Finland Swedish minority <b>is</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> the coastal areas and archipelagos of southern and western Finland. In some of these areas, Swedish is the predominant language; in 19 municipalities, 16 of which are located in Åland, Swedish {{is the sole}} official language.
