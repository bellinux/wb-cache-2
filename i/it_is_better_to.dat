5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> prevent waste than {{to treat}} or clean up waste {{after it is}} formed.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons as to why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> rely solely on ZFS by using several {{independent}} disks and RAID-Z or mirroring.|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} not enough to eat people starve to death. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.|$|E
25|$|Solution: performance. When manager has to {{take some}} decision, is better not 	to do it {{according}} to {{what he or she}} remembers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> be based on real actions that 	have happened and are recorded.|$|E
25|$|Karma–Sanyasa yoga (Religion by Renouncing Fruits of Works {{contains}} 29 verses): Arjuna asks Krishna if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> forgo {{action or}} to act ("renunciation or discipline of action"). Krishna answers that both {{are ways to}} the same goal, but that acting in Karma yoga is superior.|$|E

6000|$|In the meanwhile, Blake sought Miss Challoner and said, [...] "I don't {{think my}} uncle's looking fit. Mightn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> send for Dr. Onslow?" ...|$|R

25|$|Several exobiologists have {{suggested}} that a Mars sample return is not necessary at this stage, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> focus more on in situ studies on the surface first. Although it is not their main motivation, this approach of course also eliminates back contamination risks.|$|E
25|$|Yet, some {{differentiation}} {{has to be}} {{made between}} these indigestible plant components and other partially digested material, such as protein, that appears in the large bowel. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> classify fiber as a group of compounds with different physiological characteristics, rather than to be constrained by defining it chemically (end quote).|$|E
25|$|According to the British National Formulary, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} {{too slowly}} rather than too quickly from benzodiazepines. The {{rate of dosage}} reduction is best carried out so as to minimize the symptoms' intensity and severity. Anecdotally, a slow rate of reduction may {{reduce the risk of}} developing a severe protracted syndrome.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, aunt," [...] he said, looking {{straight}} at Mrs. Glegg, [...] "if you think it's {{a disgrace to}} the family {{that we should be}} sold up, wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> prevent <b>it</b> altogether? And if you and aunt Pullet," [...] he continued, looking at the latter, [...] "think of leaving any money to me and Maggie, wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> give <b>it</b> now, and pay the debt we're going to be sold up for, and save my mother from parting with her furniture?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a very}} {{comfortable}} {{way of looking at}} it," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "but wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> assume that she did not steal them?" ...|$|R

25|$|Owing to the {{physical}} assumptions made in the original derivation, the term Fowler-Nordheim-type equation has long been used only for equations that describe the ECD at zero temperature. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> allow this name to include the slightly modified equations (discussed below) that are valid for finite temperatures within the CFE emission regime.|$|E
25|$|When {{the land}} needs a {{subsurface}} drainage system, but saline groundwater is present at great depth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> employ a shallow, closely spaced system of pipes or ditches {{instead of a}} deep, widely spaced system. The {{reason is that the}} deeper systems produce a more salty effluent than the shallow systems. Environmental criteria may then prohibit the use of the deeper systems.|$|E
25|$|Horses require {{access to}} clean fresh water at all times, {{and access to}} {{adequate}} forage such as grass or hay. Unless an animal can be fully maintained on pasture with a natural open water source, horses must be fed daily. As horses evolved as continuous grazers, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> feed small amounts of feed throughout the day than to feed a large amount at one time.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Goose liver,' I said, {{climbing}} {{on the top}} of the carriage, for I knew that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> sit out with Mulvaney than to dance many dances.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know it,' said Cecily. 'I fear me {{much that}} her sin has been great; yet, Lucy, <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> pray for her than to talk wildly against her.' ...|$|R
25|$|Smaller {{parrotfish}} {{are relatively}} defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They {{have evolved to}} find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like shoaling rabbitfish. Spinefoot rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last-ditch defence. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> avoid predator detection in the first place, and avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles. So rabbitfish have also evolved skilful colour changing abilities.|$|E
25|$|Vratislav Kulhánek {{announced}} his candidacy on 29 June 2017. Kulhánek is {{the candidate of}} ODA, which will collect signatures on his behalf. ODA leader Pavel Sehnal said that Kulhánek is a right-wing candidate, that was missing in the election. Miloš Zeman stated {{that he does not}} know Kulhánek well but remembers him as a successful manager of Škoda Auto, adding that he does not have a problem with Kulhánek's candidacy because he believes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have more candidates.|$|E
25|$|Del Toro {{wanted to}} include a fairy tale about a dragon for Ofelia to narrate to her unborn brother. The tale {{involved}} the dragon, named Varanium Silex, who guarded a mountain surrounded by thorns, but at its peak is a blue rose that can grant immortality. The dragon and the thorns ward off many men though, who decide <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> avoid pain than to be given immortality. Although the scene was thematically important, it was cut short for budget reasons.|$|E
50|$|In the counsel, he {{was opposed}} to the {{resolution}} of entering Vendée, and thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> head to Saint-Malo where they could receive aide promised by the English. The ancient authority of his family in the Laval county ordered the army to march in that direction.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind me,' replied Job. 'I {{can sleep}} anywhere. But won't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> see Mr. Perker to-night, {{so that we}} may be there, the first thing in the morning?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> take horses {{from here}} and use Indians only over the pass? You know we have about {{thirteen}} miles to travel before the pass is reached." ...|$|R
25|$|The goal of full {{employment}} was of most importance to Petty, having recognised that labour {{was one of}} the major sources of wealth for individuals and 'the greatest Wealth and Strength of the Kingdom'. In this vein, he extended the cloth-wine argument above, arguing that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects, than to have indolent 'supernumeraries' in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating Stonehenge across the plains of Salisbury.|$|E
25|$|Remote {{burning of}} the {{explosive}}. Where possible, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> burn the explosive without detonation. Diethylene triamine (a close relative of ethylenediamine) reacts with TNT to generate heat. The compound that results from this reaction can then be combusted without detonation. It {{has been reported that}} this amine is hypergolic with TNT, Tetryl, Composition B and other TNT based explosives, but it does not react in the same way with RDX or PETN-based explosives. Other nitrogen-containing organic ligands (e.g. pyridine, diethylamine and pyrole) are known to be hypergolic with TNT.|$|E
25|$|Experienced aquarists warn against {{applying}} {{these rules}} too strictly {{because they do}} not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> apply the overall mass and size of a fish per gallon of water, than simply the length. This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste. Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a trial and error approach.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hadn't {{you better}} wait," [...] said he, [...] "till Dr Grantly {{is in town}} with you? Wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> {{postpone}} any serious step till you can consult with him?" ...|$|R
60|$|Finally, as {{the lessons}} were {{less and less}} {{attended}} to, {{and the needs of}} the stall became more urgent, Dr. May and Margaret concurred in a decision, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> yield to the mania, and give up the studies till they could be pursued with a willing mind.|$|R
