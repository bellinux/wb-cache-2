25|$|There {{was a lot}} of {{speculation}} and what seemed to be evidence there were dozens and dozens of deaths. Careful analysis showed these people likely died of something else, and not influenza. That's really <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> <b>and</b> that would fit with what we've seen outside of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Pentecostalism in Australia {{emerged as}} a loose {{movement}} of churches and evangelists around 1909. Not until 1927 with {{the founding of the}} Apostolic Faith Mission of Australasia (AFM) would the Pentecostal Movement take steps at formally organizing. The AFM, whose name was taken from the Apostolic Faith Mission of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, United States, was centred around the leadership of Sarah Jane Lancaster, founder of Good News Hall church in Melbourne and editor of <b>Good</b> <b>News,</b> <b>and</b> South African Evangelist Frederick Van Eyk. The AFM had affiliated congregations in New Zealand as well as in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the content}} of dime novels came from story papers, which were weekly, eight-page newspaper-like publications, varying in size from tabloid to {{full-size}} newspaper format and usually costing five or six cents. They started in the mid-1850s and were immensely popular, some titles being issued for over fifty years on a weekly schedule. They are perhaps best described as the television of their day, containing a variety of serial stories and articles, with something aimed at each member of the family, and often illustrated profusely with woodcuts. Popular story papers included The Saturday Journal, Young Men of America, Golden Weekly, Golden Hours, <b>Good</b> <b>News,</b> <b>and</b> Happy Days.|$|E
25|$|Comden and Green {{headed to}} California and soon found work at MGM. They wrote the screenplays for <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> <b>and</b> The Barkleys of Broadway (which reunited Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers), and then adapted On the Town for Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, {{scrapping}} most of Bernstein's {{music at the}} request of Arthur Freed, who did not care for the Bernstein score. The duo reunited with Gene Kelly for their most successful project, the classic Singin' in the Rain, about Hollywood {{in the final days of}} the silent film era. Comden and Green provided the story and screenplay; the songs were hits from the late 1920s and early 1930s by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.|$|E

60|$|The post of {{this morning}} brought a letter from my sister. We were to expect her return by the next day's train. This was <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> Philip <b>and</b> I might stand in need of clever Helena's help, and we might be sure of getting it now.|$|R
25|$|Cassius' army, {{although}} {{suffering from}} a shortage of supplies {{and the effects of}} a plague, contracted in Seleucia, made it back to Roman territory safely. Iunius Maximus, a young tribunus laticlavius serving in III Gallica under Cassius, took the news of the victory to Rome. Maximus received a generous cash bounty (dona) for bringing the <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> <b>and</b> immediate promotion to the quaestorship. Lucius took the title Parthicus Maximus, and he and Marcus were hailed as imperatores again, earning the title Imp. III. Cassius' army returned to the field in 166, crossing over the Tigris into Media. Lucius took the title Medicus, and the emperors were again hailed as imperatores, becoming Imp. IV in imperial titulature. Marcus too took the Parthicus Maximus now, after another tactful delay.|$|E
25|$|Comín {{appreciated}} Larramendi following {{works of}} the Zaragoza group; he suggested that the Madrid lawyer becomes his replacement. Don Jaime acknowledged Larramendi’s loyalty during the strife for control of El Correo. Moreover, as a young militant deprived of own political basis {{he seemed to have}} posed no threat to royal leadership; his location in Madrid and profession of a lawyer offered additional advantages. Lack of experience was a disadvantage; Melgar dissuaded the choice also due to pro-German Larramendi’s leaning during the war. Don Jaime’s special envoy to Madrid returned with <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> in August 1919 the claimant appointed Larramendi his key representative in Spain and effectively the party leader, though not with the title of Jefe Delegado, but as a Secretario General.|$|E
25|$|After Frederick's setback at Alessandria, {{the failed}} {{agreement}} of Montebello, and {{the refusal of}} his cousin Henry the Lion to help him, Frederick finally received some <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> reinforcements from Germany. The German reinforcements crossed the Lukmanier Pass into the Lake Como region in April 1176. Frederick I Barbarossa, Philip I of Heinsberg, and Archbishop Wichmann of Magdeburg rode secretly from Pavia along the Ticino River to meet the reinforcements and to lead them to a joint operation with his main forces. Frederick received 1,000 knights and 1,000 foot soldiers from 16 different German rulers. At Como, Lombard imperial allies increased the reinforcements {{to a total of}} about 3,000 knights and foot soldiers. However, the Imperial army was largely a cavalry force of German knights.|$|E

25|$|The Methodist Church, {{among other}} Christian denominations, was {{responsible}} for the establishment of hospitals, universities, orphanages, soup kitchens, and schools to follow Jesus's command to spread the <b>Good</b> <b>News</b> <b>and</b> serve all people. In Western nations, governments have increasingly taken up funding and organisation of health services for the poor but the Church still maintains a massive network of health care providers across the world. In the West, these institutions are increasingly run by lay-people after centuries of being run by priests, nuns and brothers, In 2009, Catholic hospitals in the USA received approximately one of every six patients, according to the Catholic Health Association. Catholic Health Australia is the largest non-government provider grouping of health, community and aged care services, representing about 10% of the health sector. In 1968, nuns or priests were the chief executives of 770 of America's 796 Catholic hospitals. By 2011, they presided over 8 of 636 hospitals.|$|E
500|$|One {{holdover}} {{from the}} latter {{stages of the}} Magic Tour was the [...] "Build Me a House" [...] stage rap, now located in [...] "Working on a Dream".

500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "New Boss" [...] {{within a week}} of the episode's original release.

[...] Another clip features Jim expressing his worries to Pam about Charles's apparent distaste for him, as Pam playfully makes fun of Jim. The video ends with Pam asking Jim to leave her workspace because, [...] "I don't want him to keep seeing us together." ...|$|E

The Bell Journal of Economics 12, 380 - 391] {{showed that}} if the strict monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP) does not hold for a conditional distribution then there exists some non-degenerate prior and pair of signals where the higher-signal posterior does not stochastically dominate the lower-signal posterior. We show that for any non-degenerate prior with bounded support there exists a conditional distribution (satisfying several natural properties) and pair of signals such that the lower signal's posterior stochastically dominates that of the higher signal. Thus, for every bounded prior, higher signals may represent strictly "worse" news. Signal extraction Bayes' rule MLRP Stochastic dominance Updating...|$|R

Rufus Sylvester constructed sluice boxes and his group's yield was often ten ounces of gold per day for each man.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{played in}} the World Series two years earlier, the 1986 Padres {{finished}} in fourth place in the National League West with a disappointing record of 74–88. The speculation that Boros would be fired proved accurate, as he was replaced by Larry Bowa on October 24, 1986. Boros said at the time, [...] "I was prepared {{for the fact that}} I wouldn't be coming back. ... It's like the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>and</b> bad news joke. The good news was {{that at the end of}} the season I hadn't been fired. The bad news was I hadn't been rehired." ...|$|E

That's really <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> <b>and</b> that would fit with what we've seen outside of Mexico.as of October 7, it is reported that more new cases of A/H1N1 were recorded in the month of September then in any other month-there were 9,231 new confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza in Mexico in September. It {{is important to remember that}} that number represents only confirmed cases-far more people were in infected with A/H1N1 influenza, became only mildly ill, and recovered without seeing a doctor, and thus never had their cases confirmed or counted. Widespread closures of schools are unlikely, however, as it is known that the virus has a low mortality rate. [...] "We know that the situation is not as serious as officials feared last spring" [...] said health secretary Jose Angel Cordava.|$|E
