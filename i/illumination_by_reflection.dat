According to the imaging principle and medical requirement, a new method is proposed. The image is decomposed into <b>illumination</b> and <b>reflection</b> <b>by</b> wavelet illumination-reflection model. The details of the <b>reflection</b> are strengthened <b>by</b> soft-threshold method. The dynamic range of the <b>illumination</b> is reduced <b>by</b> Gaussian filtering {{in order to enhance}} the image.

We see, by adding more effects to the scene, like soft shadows {{caused by the}} area light source, a caustic caused by the glass ball and indirect <b>illumination</b> caused <b>by</b> diffuse <b>reflection</b> at the walls, we gain more realistic and better looking images. Though the here presented effects {{are not the only}} that can appear. Polarisation, dispersion and fluorescence are examples for other effects that we might have to consider. Global illumination is necessary to achieve realistic images. Although there are plenty methods that focus on solving this problem, most of them are not fast enough for interactive environments. Instant radiosity is a method that approximates the indirect lighting, as part of global <b>illumination,</b> <b>by</b> creating additional light sources. Thereby it is very fast and does not need lot of preprocessing, so it is perfectly fit to be used within real-time requirements. Further techniques based on instant radiosity have extended the method to provide better image quality or faster rendering. So instant radiosity and its derivations can bring us global illumination in real-time.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an experiment in}} the application of holographic interferometry to the visualization of flow in a transonic compressor. The principal objective {{of the study was to}} visualize the shock waves created by the rotor blades and to determine their relative orientation in three dimensions. The technique employed double-pulse, double-exposure holography to record the flow field through a plastic window built into the outer case over the rotor blades. <b>Illumination</b> was <b>by</b> diffuse <b>reflection</b> from the interior surfaces of the compressor. No other optical components in or on the compressor were used. The resulting holograms successfully showed the upstream bow shocks and, at high speed, the outer-most portion of the leading edge passage shock. Techniques were devised for locating these shocks in three dimensions and the results were compared with theoretical predictions. In all cases, the shock angles were somewhat larger than predicted by theory, and a distinct increase in angle near the outer wall was observed, which may be attributed to end wall boundary layer effects...|$|R

Indeed, the iris is located behind the cornea which is a highly reflective mirror; the resulting images could therefore be perturbed <b>by</b> <b>illumination</b> <b>reflections.</b> The iris is also covered by eyelids in both its upper and lower parts and partially by eyelashes. This noise is very hard to detect as it has a random form and location. Blur can also be present in the images in case of non controlled acquisition conditions. In this chapter, first research state of the art in iris recognition is presented. After in order to allowing future benchmarking, a new modular reference system called OSIRIS (Open Source for Iris) based on Daugmans works is described. Our experiments show that the recognition module of OSIRIS outperforms Masek, another open-source software. We have defined a benchmarking protocol on a multicultural - European and Chinese - iris database and compared, Osiris, Masek and two other research systems using this benchmarking framewor...|$|R

30|$|A texture {{feature is}} also a global feature that also {{describes}} the surface properties of a scene corresponding to an image or image region. However, since the texture is only a characteristic of {{the surface of the}} object and does not fully reflect the essential properties of the object, high-level image content cannot be obtained by only using the texture feature. Unlike color features, texture features are not pixel-based features, and they require statistical calculations in regions that contain multiple pixels. In pattern matching, this regional feature has greater advantages and cannot be successfully matched due to local deviations. As a statistical feature, texture features often have rotational invariance and are more resistant to noise. However, texture features also have their disadvantages. One obvious drawback is that when the resolution of the image changes, the calculated texture may have a large deviation. In addition, due to the possibility of being affected <b>by</b> <b>illumination</b> and <b>reflection,</b> the texture reflected from the image is not necessarily the actual texture of the surface of the object, for example, reflections in water. The effects of reflections from smooth metal surfaces, etc., can cause texture changes. Since these are not the characteristics of the object itself, when applying texture information to a search, sometimes these fake textures can be “misleading” to the search.|$|R
