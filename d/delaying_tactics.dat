5|$|The {{question}} in the 1980 referendum, {{in an attempt to}} build a broad coalition, had sought only the authority to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum to ratify the results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics.</b> The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was born}} in Connecticut and was a {{merchant}} operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 (allowing American forces time to prepare New York's defenses), the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which {{he was promoted to}} major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that halted his combat career for several years.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{negotiated}} {{the release of}} six of the eleven men on the patrol, but {{were not able to}} gain the freedom of their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer and the other men before the West Side Boys' demands became increasingly unrealistic. Negotiators concluded that these were <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> rather than an effort to resolve the crisis; by 9 September, the soldiers had been held for over a fortnight. Fearing that the soldiers would be killed or moved to a location from which it would be more difficult to extract them, the British government authorised an assault on the West Side Boys' base, to take place at dawn the following day, 10 September.|$|E

5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks—long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Roman Catholic minority, Phát joined the French-backed Vietnamese National Army which became the ARVN after the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) was established. After having {{been sent to the}} U.S. for further {{training}} in 1958, Phát returned home to head the Civil Guard, a paramilitary force then mostly used to protect the ruling family of President Ngô Đình Diệm, rather than to counteract the communist Việt Cộng insurgency. Later commanding the 2nd Division, he was known for his loyalty to Diệm, who favored fellow Catholics. In 1963, Diệm knew some of the generals were about to launch a coup against him. He appointed Phát to command the 7th Division, located near the capital, Saigon, so he could help in the fighting, but the plotters successfully used <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> so that the paperwork for the transfer of the division leadership could not occur before they proceeded to overthrow and execute Diệm. Despite Phát's pro-Diệm allegiance he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 7th Division.|$|E
50|$|Late in June 1734, Charles Emmanuel {{returned}} to Turin, {{because his wife}} Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg was sick. He asked the French marshals to avoid engaging in offensive actions until he returned, although this was likely another <b>delaying</b> <b>tactic</b> on his part.|$|R
50|$|The game <b>delay</b> <b>tactic</b> backfired {{on them as}} they {{returned}} to find the Flyers even more resolute than before. The Flyers scored quickly after play resumed and never looked back. They outshot the Soviets 49-13 en route to their 4-1 victory.|$|R
40|$|I {{explore the}} idea of {{simplicity}} as a belief-selection criterion in games. A pair of strategies in finite-automata representation (s 1,s 2) is a “Simple Nash Equilibrium ” (SINE) if: (1) sj is a best-reply to si; (2) every automaton for player j, which generates the same path as sj (given si), has at least as many states as sj. I apply SINE to a bilateral concession game and show that it captures an aspect of bargaining behavior: players employ <b>delay</b> <b>tactics</b> {{in order to justify}} their concessions. <b>Delay</b> <b>tactics</b> are mutually reinforcing, and this may prevent players from reaching an interior agreement.

5|$|Following the Empire-wide seizure and {{imprisonment}} of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet {{was strong}} enough to deter an outright attack by the Venetians, who sailed to Chios and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics,</b> until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet. It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with the humiliation of 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off Acre, as Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused to participate in the campaign. However, by the end of Manuel's reign, the strains of constant warfare on all fronts and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian Niketas Choniates attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade, {{with the}} Belgians and Dutch under its command, {{had to contend}} with German <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics.</b> The lead battalions {{advanced}} under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, until stopped by a strong defensive position at Cabourg. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles, unable to outflank the position, were ordered to dig in. The next day, the battalion was relieved by the Belgians and moved to a brigade concentration point, first at Le Plein and then at Troan, which they reached by the morning of 21August. The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance continued from here with the 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment in the lead. The battalion was unopposed until that afternoon, when they had several casualties from German mortar and machine-gun fire. With night approaching the battalion had to dig in, and prepared to continue the advance the next day. At 03:00 on 22August, the battalion started an outflanking attack on Branville, which they occupied by 08:00, and later the same day they liberated Vauville and Deauville, where they secured the high ground {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|After {{leading his}} state to another Sheffield Shield title and {{a win over}} England, Miller {{replaced}} Morris as the vice-captain for the tour of the West Indies that started in early 1955. Australia was looking for its first series win against any team in three years, having lost two consecutive series to England. Australia batted first in the opening Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica. Miller came to the wicket at 2/137 {{and put on a}} 224-run partnership with Harvey. Both ended with centuries and Miller scored his highest Test score of 147, striking 15fours. When Valentine and Ramadhin had conceded 100runs, he respectively shook their hands. Australia finished at 9/515. Johnson had been injured when hit in the foot by a yorker so Miller was left in charge of the team on the field with Australia one bowler short. Miller attempted to unsettle the batsmen by placing many men close to the bat in an attempt to insult their batting capabilities. He took the new ball at 5/239 and the hosts collapsed to be all out for 259. Miller had taken 2/36, and enforced the follow-on, which was questioned as paceman Ron Archer had broken down. With Australia two bowlers short, the West Indies moved to 1/114. When Weekes arrived at the crease, Miller unsettled him with <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics,</b> and he was out for one. He then placed two silly points and two silly mid-ons in an attempt to unsettle Walcott, who fell to Lindwall soon after. Miller then took two wickets and the hosts had lost three wickets in as many overs. The West Indies were bowled out and Australia won by nine wickets. Miller had taken 3/62 in the second innings.|$|E
50|$|Weingarten founded Multiphase Records in St. Louis in 1980. The {{following}} year, {{he released}} its first album, Submergings, {{in collaboration with}} Dale Ormiston and Phil Neon. That same year gave birth to Weingarten's instrumental electronic rock band <b>Delay</b> <b>Tactics.</b> The group, featuring Walter Whitney on synths and guitarists David Udell and Reed Nesbit, took heavy influence from Robert Fripp and served {{as more of a}} recording unit than live act. They were, however, among the first of such indie groups to use digital delays in both studio recordings and live looping performances. With two albums under their belt, the group disbanded in 1986. A third record would be released under the <b>Delay</b> <b>Tactics</b> name in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Sky has {{repeatedly}} used its lawyers to lodge complaints with the soon-to-be-rival YouView service, {{considered by some}} to be a <b>delaying</b> <b>tactic</b> in order to promote its own services, especially considering its failure to complain about other services, such as Google TV.|$|R
50|$|Last resort: Force may be {{used only}} after all {{peaceful}} and viable alternatives have been seriously tried and exhausted or are clearly not practical.

25|$|Haynes, when facing Australia in {{the bitter}} 1990–91 series, clashed {{verbally}} with Ian Healy, Merv Hughes, Craig McDermott and David Boon, who christened him 'Dessie'. He is also noted for using <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> against England during the 1989–90 Test series.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a goalkeeper {{may also}} attempt to delay a penalty by {{cleaning}} his boots, asking the referee {{to see if}} the ball is placed properly and other <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics.</b> This method builds more pressure on the penalty taker, but the goalkeeper may risk punishments, most likely a yellow card.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May 1942, {{following}} an amphibious assault by Royal Marines which were landed from the destroyer HMS Anthony, Antsirane fell and the anchorage captured; the Vichy French forces, however, continued to resist, and having withdrawn to the south, a prolonged land campaign began, although hostilities remained at relative low-intensity level, consisting mainly of <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> {{on the part}} of the French.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>delaying</b> <b>tactic,</b> {{he advises}} the Tweeners how to reorganize their {{air force to}} make a {{successful}} raid, he again seduces his jailer (which this time is Ann Reece), and he again begins to organize a political revolt among his captors, hoping an uprising of peacelovers among the Tweeners will stop the coming attack.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} improve the voter rolls, CENI {{announced}} on 26 January that people could register to vote at a hundred points across the country on 31 January.

5000|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{of the system}} is that it affords a [...] "foot dragging party," [...] another opportunity for stalling and <b>delay</b> <b>tactics</b> to wear out the other side.

25|$|A letter then {{arrived at}} the Federal Government, {{demanding}} the release of eleven detainees, including those from Stammheim. A crisis committee was formed in Bonn, headed by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, which, instead of acceding, resolved to employ <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> to give the police time to discover Schleyer's location. At the same time, a total communication ban was imposed on the prison inmates, who were now allowed visits only from government officials and the prison chaplain.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} concession of March 14, 1925 {{covered all}} of Iraq, but IPC {{was reluctant to}} develop it quickly and production was restricted to fields constituting only one-half of 1 percent of the country's total area. During the Great Depression, the world was awash with oil and greater output from Iraq would simply have driven the price down to even lower levels. <b>Delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> were employed not only in actual drilling and development, but also in conducting negotiations on such matters as pipeline rights-of-way.|$|E
25|$|Yamashita would {{continue}} to use <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> to maintain his army in Kiangan (part of the Ifugao Province), until 2 September 1945, several weeks after the surrender of Japan. At {{the time of his}} surrender, his forces had been reduced to under 50,000 by the lack of supplies and tough campaigning by elements of the combined American and Filipino soldiers including the recognized guerrillas. Yamashita surrendered in the presence of Generals Jonathan Wainwright and Arthur Percival, both of whom had been prisoners of war in Manchuria. Percival had surrendered to Yamashita after the Battle of Singapore.|$|E

25|$|The {{fighting}} {{took place}} mainly around Manggar airstrip as the defending Japanese employed <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> of ambushes and booby traps, however, within three weeks {{the fighting was}} largely over. The battalion's involvement consisted mainly of carrying out fighting patrols and establishing observation posts along the axis of the main advance up the Milford Highway. Nevertheless, it {{was involved in a}} number of significant engagements throughout July as patrols came into contact with pockets of resistance and small Japanese force's attacked the battalion's observation posts before orders to cease aggressive actions came down from higher command in early August. Following that the battalion was involved in reconnaissance patrols as the war came to an end.|$|E
25|$|With {{only limited}} {{forces in the}} region initially, {{in an effort to}} slow the Japanese advance to allow {{reinforcements}} to arrive, the Australian force– designated Maroubra Force– resorted to <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> while reinforcements were sent north from Port Moresby. Kokoda fell in early August, and this was followed by heavy fighting around Isurava later in the month as the veteran 21st Brigade reinforced the Militia troops that had been holding the line to that point. After this, rearguard actions were fought around Eora Creek and Templeton's Crossing, as well as around Efogi, before the Australians fell back towards Menari, where their rearguard clashed with the pursuing Japanese in the Maguli Range, before the withdrawal continued on to Ioribaiwa in mid-September.|$|E
25|$|Striptease {{involves}} a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing with <b>delaying</b> <b>tactics</b> {{such as the}} wearing of additional clothes or putting clothes or {{hands in front of}} just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia. The emphasis is on the act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude. The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the threat}} of Warworld looms high above the Earth. Batman and Superman are blackmailed into {{recruiting}} members of their 'clan' and Krypto shows up. He is shown whining after the mention of Superboy, who is suspected of being dead. Krypto assists Superman and Supergirl in fighting various groups of Warworld challengers, as a <b>delaying</b> <b>tactic</b> to save Earth from destruction. Thanks to the secretive efforts of Steel and Batgirl, no innocents are hurt.|$|R
50|$|However, the Ostrogothic King {{had another}} <b>delaying</b> <b>tactic.</b> Both armies watched as Totila, dressed in shining purple and gold armor, and riding a huge stallion, cantered out towards {{the space between}} the two large armies.
