The default font Times New Roman, for example, as Chief Judge Frank Easterbrook warns, is 2 ̆ 2 utterly inappropriate for long documents [such as] briefs. 2 ̆ 2 Commentators have started urging a more deliberate approach to legal typography. Their suggestions, however, have been content-neutral, intended for all legal texts and focused on goals such as legibility and readability. Typography, however, has much greater potential.

All of these issues can be touched via the society, with the so called “The smart doctor”. How does the society perceive the merits and ethics of medical doctors? They generally say that we need to be open-minded. Get round the medical news in general, i. e. Mr. Sorayuth’s talk show, a nightly televi-sion program. Be modest, respect and honor others.
