40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the economic and <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> lengths for hybrid poplar plantations (Populus x Euramericana Guiner cv. I- 214) in a selected area from Turkey. It was determined the year providing maximum mean annual increment to economic rotation length should be measured. However, it was determined the year providing maximum financial return to <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> length should be measured. According to results, the economic and <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> lengths have been determined as 9 years and 11 years, respectively. The rotation lengths could be determined according to various factors. For example; many previous studies indicate that economic and <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> lengths in hybrid poplars depend on the site characteristics and planting spaces. Therefore, the most appropriate rotation length for hybrid poplar plantations should be determined by local studies...|$|E

40|$|Beekman {{tried to}} define the <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> of teak high forest in a {{clearance}} felling system, allowing for modifying factors. For practical reasons only one site of quality (IV) in one forest district was considered. This district had been used for timber production for 20 years. Through its favourable situation and therefore favourable marketing and ease of transport, and smooth labour relations, the yield of timber had been increased more {{than anywhere else in}} Java. These conditions were taken as an ideal standard. He tried to assess the stand value, the value of the normal wood stock, the forest value and the internal rate of return. For this purpose first the contrasts between the 'soil rent theory' and the 'forest rent theory' were examined. The first theory was held preferable. The calculations demonstrated 50 years as best for the <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> with an interest rate of 3 %, after which also the influences of the fallow period, the cutting period, the ringing period and preceding culture on the financial calculations were studied. The income from teak forestry was compared with those of other tropical cultures. Through these and other considerations Beekman arrived at conclusions on the justification for teak forestry on certain soils...|$|E
40|$|Forests play an {{important}} role in climate change mitigation by absorbing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Additional revenue from carbon credits may change the optimal management of plantation forest. This research aims to analyze the optimal rotation of joint production of timber and carbon sequestration of sengon stand in Java. The method used in this research is the profit maximization of forest stand obtained from wood sales and carbon credits (i. e. Hartman rule as a modification of Faustmann rule). The results of this study showed that (1) the biological rotation of sengon forest in site quality (SQ) III and IV are 6 and 5 years respectively, (2) <b>Financial</b> <b>rotations</b> of sengon forest in SQ III and IV are 8 and 6 years respectively, and (3) Additonal income from carbon sales in afforestation project will not lengthen the optimal rotation of sengon plantation...|$|R
40|$|A 20 -year-old Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] {{stand in}} the Oregon Coast Range was thinned from about 1, 700 to about 350 trees/ac. Subsequent thinnings, under eight {{different}} regimes, occurred at ages 23, 27, 30, and 32. Average net periodic cubic-volume growth was strongly influenced by thinning regime, varying from about 220 ft /ac/yr (heavy thinning age 30) to over 550 ft /ac/yr (controls age 23). The results indicate that young Douglas-fir on productive sites (site index 160 to 170 ft at 100 years) are extremely adaptable and will respond to frequent thinnings of various intensities. Three representative treatments (after thinning at age 32) and the controls were projected and optimized with dynamic programming for two <b>financial</b> analyses. Adjusting <b>rotation</b> or commercial thinning can compensate for lack of early stand management or heavy early thinning...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and structural}} characterization of zwitterionic [(η 6 -C 6 H 5 -BPh 3) M(coe) 2] (M = Rh, Ir) cyclooctene complexes is described. Both complexes exhibit an unusual exo–endo conformation of both cyclooctene ligands in the solid state. However, an equilibrium between the endo–endo and exo–endo rotational isomers {{arising from the}} hindered rotation about the metal–cyclooctene bond is observed in solution. Rotational barriers of around 65 kJ mol− 1 (Rh) and 84 kJ mol− 1 (Ir) have been determined by 2 D EXSY NMR spectroscopy. The rotation process has also been studied by DFT calculations that showed that the dynamic behaviour {{is a consequence of}} the oscillation of the cyclooctene ligands about the metal–olefin bond instead of completing a full <b>rotation.</b> <b>Financial</b> support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (MINECO/FEDER) of Spain (CTQ 2010 - 15221 and CONSOLIDER INGENIO CSD 2009 - 00050), the Diputación General de Aragón (DGA/FSE-E 07) and the ARAID Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} taken to compare {{economic}} performance of different ages of keora (Sonneratia apetala) Plantations in coastal zone in this paper. The main objective was to find out <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> and profitability of keora plantation. The existing market price of round wood per cubic meter and fuel wood per ton {{were found to be}} Tk. 2650 to Tk. 3530 and Tk. 670 to Tk. 940 respectively near plantation area in 2003. The harvesting and processing costs were estimated as 20 % and 10 % of the standing value of the trees. The value of IRR and other economic determinants for timber were varied among Coastal Afforestation Divisions mainly due to different rates of siltation, salinity and other factors involved on the forest floor in coastal zone. However, applying the economic determinants throughout coastal zone, financially remarkable rotation age for timber was found to be within 14 th to 16 th year of plantation and rotation age forfuel wood as 9 th year of plantation. Applying the same economic determinants keora plantation was also found as profitable in coastal zone in Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|This {{economic}} {{analysis of the}} rotation problem {{is based on the}} actual decision which the forest manager must make for every stand, i. e. whether to fell now or in five years or so. This marginal decision becomes important, and need only be carefully con-sidered, when the stand nears financial maturity. The marginal approach is perhaps the most realistic approach to the problem of financial rotations. The financial decision is based upon the recognized criterion of maximum net discounted revenue (N. D. R.) per unit total invested capital. Certain theories of production economics are combined with the practical methods of forest valuation. These principles are used to present the {{economic analysis}} as a graphical choice of the rotation at which the combined yield of pulpwood and sawtimber maximizes N. D. R. Finally, current product prices are introduced and the-optimum rotation is found. These current prices may genuinely be assumed to be constant for any particular five-year period. A subsequent paper will develop the basic principle into a multi-product technique. The principle is presented essentially as a fundamental technique for the projects of forest economics: its application and use are considered here in general terms, and for a specific Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) stand type. An instrument for the rapid determination of <b>financial</b> <b>rotation</b> and N. D. R. has been developed from this principle of rotation determination. A 'ROTATION ' may be denned as 'the planned number of years between the formation or regeneration of a crop and its final felling 1 (B. C. F. T., 1953). Rotations are determined by certain objects of local forestry, for example...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with the plantations of Acacia niloticagrown for sawlog -to produce railway sleeper- production along the Blue Nile, South of Sennar dam, Sudan. The overall objective {{was to determine the}} best management strategy of the plantations that maximizes financial returns. Primary data was collected using standard work study techniques and inventory methods. Secondary data used included previousstudies on yield tables and volume estimations. The study used the criterion of net present value (NPV) for determination of <b>financial</b> <b>rotation,</b> and for evaluating different management strategies. The research applied comparative statistics to assess relative stocking of existing stands. The research revealed that the operations of seed sowing and singling were the most expensive forest operations involving 5. 8 and 7. 8 mandays per feddan, respectively. Log transport was the most expensive sawmilling-related operation involving 36 mandays and 3 machine days per feddan. With the current conversion factor of state sawmills of about 40 %, the technical rotation of stands of site index 22 to produce sawlogs large enough to yield the maximum of a single sleeper was estimated to be within a range of 25 - 36 years. That of stands of site index 25 to yield the maximum of two sleepers falls within the range 25 - 36 years. Stands of site index 28 are technically suitable to produce sawlogs large enough to yield the maximum of three sleepers within age range of 29 - 36 years. These results exclude stands of site index 16 and 19 from producing saw logs for sleeper production. A. nilotica stands under present management show low relative stocking and yield per feddan, low millable percentage of final cut (47 %) and rotation age dropped to 25 - 27 years...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{starts out}} from the {{challenge}} regarding auditor tenure launched in 2010 by the Green Paper of the European Commission "Audit Policy: Lessons from the Crisis". According to this document, the European Commission speaks both {{in favor of the}} mandatory rotation of the audit firm, and in favor of the mandatory rotation of audit partners. Rotation is considered a solution to mitigate threats to independence generated by familiarity, intimidation and self-interest {{in the context of a}} long-term audit-client relationship. At international level, there are several studies on auditor rotation, both empirical (e. g. Lu and Sivaramakrishnan, 2009, Li, 2010, Kaplan and Mauldin, 2008, Jackson et al., 2008) and normative in nature (e. g. Marten et al., 2007, Müller, 2006 and Gelter, 2004). The objective of the present paper is to perform a critical and comparative analysis of the regulations on internal and external rotation in force at international level, in the European Union and in the United States of America. Moreover, arguments both in favor and against mandatory rotation are brought into discussion. With regard to the research design, the paper has a normative approach. The main findings are first of all that by comparison, all regulatory authorities require internal rotation at least in the case of public interest entities, while the external rotation is not in the focus of the regulators. In general, the most strict and detailed requirements are those issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission from the United States of America. Second of all, in favor of mandatory rotation speaks the fact that the auditor becomes less resilient in case of divergence of opinions between him and company management, less stimulated to follow his own interest, and more scrupulous in conducting the audit. However, mandatory rotation may also have negative consequences, thus the debate on the opportunity of this regulatory measure remains open-ended. independence, <b>financial</b> audit, familiarity, <b>rotation...</b>|$|R
