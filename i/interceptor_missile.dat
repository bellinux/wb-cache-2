25|$|The {{improved}} versions will {{be equipped}} with advanced processors and software, as well as upgraded variants of the SM-3 <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile.</b> BMD capable ships can have their BMD capabilities upgraded from earlier versions to later versions.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{successful}} test on 15 May 2016, Pakistan on 20 May 2016 voiced concerns over India’s test-fire of supersonic <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> {{and said it}} would “take all necessary measures to augment the country’s defense capabilities”.|$|E
25|$|Given {{concerns}} about the previous programs using nuclear-tipped interceptors, in the 1980s the US Army began studies about the feasibility of hit-to-kill vehicles, i.e. <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles</b> that would destroy incoming ballistic missiles just by colliding with them head-on.|$|R
25|$|The United States Northern Command, NORAD and the Federal Aviation Administration had, in {{previous}} days, placed restrictions on commercial and civil flight {{operations in the}} areas surrounding Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and Fort Greely, Alaska, homes of U.S. <b>Interceptor</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vandenberg Air Force base {{will serve}} as one of two Pacific bases to defend against {{possible}} North Korean or Iranian missile threats.

25|$|The {{designation}} XRIM-113A, indicating {{an experimental}} ship-launched <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile,</b> was {{allocated to the}} SIRCS project in May 1976, and contracts were awarded to three separate teams of contractors - RCA/Martin-Marietta, McDonnell Douglas/Sperry, and Raytheon/Lockheed/Univac - for initial studies of the SIRCS missile concept, {{in anticipation of a}} competitive evaluation.|$|E
25|$|The system's radar is {{referred}} to as EL/M-2084. It detects the rocket's launch and tracks its trajectory. The BMC calculates the impact point according to the reported data, and uses this information to determine whether the target constitutes a threat to a designated area. Only when that threat is determined, is an <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> fired to destroy the incoming rocket before it reaches the predicted impact area.|$|E
25|$|Minnesota Honeywell Corporation {{conducted}} {{flight tests}} on an inertial guidance sub-system for the later-cancelled X-20 Dyna-Soar {{project at the}} base utilizing an NF-101B Voodoo, completed by August 1963. QB-47E Stratojets and QF-104A Starfighters were operated by the 3205th Drone Director Group through the late 1960s (QB-47s) in support of such programs as the testing of the IM-99 Bomarc <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile,</b> and into the 1970s (QF-104s).|$|E
50|$|One major {{component}} is Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), consisting of ground-based <b>interceptor</b> (GBI) <b>missiles</b> and radar in the United States in Alaska, which would intercept incoming warheads in space. Currently some GBI missiles are located at Vandenberg AFB in California. These GBIs can be augmented by mid-course SM-3 interceptors fired from Navy ships. About ten <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles</b> were operational as of 2006. In 2014, the Missile Defense Agency had 30 operational GBIs, with 14 additional ground-based interceptors requested for 2017 deployment, in the Fiscal Year 2016 budget.|$|R
50|$|The system {{consists}} of ground-based <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles</b> and radar which would intercept incoming warheads in space. Boeing Defense, Space & Security {{is the prime}} contractor of the program, tasked to oversee and integrate systems from other major defense sub-contractors, such as Computer Sciences Corporation and Raytheon.|$|R
50|$|Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) 1972: The United States and Soviet Union could deploy ABM interceptors at two sites, {{each with}} up to 100 {{ground-based}} launchers for ABM <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles.</b> In a 1974 Protocol, the US and Soviet Union agreed to only deploy an ABM system to one site.|$|R
25|$|On 6 March 2011 DRDO {{successfully}} test-fired <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> from Advanced Air Defence (AAD) which {{destroyed a}} 'hostile' target ballistic missile, a modified Prithvi, {{at an altitude}} of 16km over the Bay of Bengal. Advanced Air Defence (AAD) missile positioned at Wheeler Island, about 70km across sea from Chandipur, received signals from tracking radars installed along the coastline and travelled through the sky at a speed of 4.5 Mach to destroy it.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 2010, AAD <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> test {{from the}} Odisha coast on Monday was aborted, as the target missile {{deviated}} from its path and {{plunged into the}} sea. The AAD missile was to intercept the target {{at an altitude of}} 15 to 20nbsp&km over the sea. The target, a Prithvi missile, fired at 10:02 am from a mobile launcher from the Integrated Test Range Complex-3 at Chandipur-on-Sea, 15nbsp&km from here, deviated from its trajectory after travelling about 11nbsp&km and fell into the sea.|$|E
25|$|The A-35 {{anti-ballistic missile}} system was a Soviet {{military}} anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system deployed around Moscow to intercept enemy ballistic missiles targeting {{the city or}} its surrounding areas. The A-35 was the only Soviet ABM system allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In development since the 1960s and in operation from 1971 until the 1990s, it featured the nuclear-tipped A350 exoatmospheric <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile.</b> The A-35 {{was supported by the}} two Dunay radars (NATO: Cat House and Dog House) and the Soviet early warning system. It was followed by the A-135 in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Clinton {{administration}} further {{shifted the}} focus to ground-based <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles</b> and theater scale systems, forming the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and closing the SDIO. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization was renamed {{again by the}} George W. Bush administration as the Missile Defense Agency and focused onto limited National Missile Defense.|$|R
25|$|The Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme is an {{initiative}} {{to develop and}} deploy a multi-layered ballistic missile defence system to protect India from ballistic missile attacks. It is a double-tiered system consisting of two <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles,</b> namely the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) missile for high altitude interception, and the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) Missile for lower altitude interception.|$|R
25|$|On 23 August 2011, Globes {{reported}} that Rafael would invest {{tens of millions}} of shekels in the following months to open a second production line for the Iron Dome's Tamir <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles.</b> Future operational needs, as well as the plan to build two more Iron Dome batteries {{by the end of the}} year, necessitated the increase of missile production.|$|R
25|$|The extreme {{speed and}} {{operating}} altitude of the Valkyrie was considered sufficient protection against Soviet interceptors of the time. However it was anticipated that future aircraft and missile developments {{would reduce the}} B-70's margin of superiority, especially following the SA-2 Guideline SAM being displayed during the 1957 May Day parade. Intelligence reports indicated that SAMs were being deployed in large numbers throughout Russia, and it was believed the SA-2 was capable of being fitted with a nuclear warhead. Therefore, {{it was decided that}} the B-70 would need an <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> to defend itself against the perceived threat.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{before the}} system was {{declared}} operational, Iron Dome was criticized by Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst, former fighter pilot and {{professor of political science}} at Tel Aviv University for costing too much compared to the cost of a Qassam rocket (fired by Palestinian forces), so that launching very large numbers of Qassams could essentially attack Israel's financial means. The estimated cost of each Tamir <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> has been cited from US$20,000–50,000 whereas a crudely manufactured Qassam rocket costs around $800 and the cost of each Hamas Grad rocket is only several thousand dollars each. Rafael responded that the cost issue was exaggerated since Iron Dome intercepts only rockets determined to constitute a threat, and that the lives saved and the strategic impact are worth the cost.|$|E
25|$|Test {{flights of}} XF-99 test {{vehicles}} began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955. The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, {{tests of the}} XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had no guidance system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A, respectively. Originally the USAF had allocated the designation IM-69, but this was changed (possibly at Boeing's request to keep number 99) to IM-99 in October 1955. In October 1957, the first YIM-99A production-representative prototype flew with full guidance, and succeeded to pass the target within destructive range. In late 1957, Boeing received the production contract for the IM-99A Bomarc A <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile,</b> and in September 1959, the first IM-99A squadron became operational.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 2017, the US {{has reached}} a deal to provide Saudi Arabia with THAAD in a deal worth $15 billion. Seven fire units each with a Raytheon AN/TPY-2 radar, two mobile {{tactical}} stations (with two spares {{for a total of}} 16), and six launchers (with two spares for a total of 44), 360 <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Introduced {{in light}} of the {{ballistic}} missile threat from Pakistan, it is a double-tiered system consisting of two <b>interceptor</b> <b>missiles,</b> namely the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) missile for high-altitude interception, and the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) Missile for lower altitude interception. The two-tiered shield should be able to intercept any incoming missile launched 5,000 kilometers away.|$|R

500|$|Bell {{returned}} a further study, delivered on 4 January 1956, that demonstrated {{the need to}} intercept the incoming warheads at [...] altitude, and suggested that this was within the abilities of an upgraded version of the Nike B missile. Given a terminal speed up to 5miles per second (...) , combined with the time it would take an <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> to climb to the RV's altitude, the system required that the RV be initially detected at about [...] range. Due to the RV's relatively small size and limited radar signature, this would demand extremely powerful radars.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 November 2012, India again {{successfully}} testfired its home-made supersonic Advanced Air Defence (AAD) <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> from a defence base off {{the coast}} of the eastern state of Odisha. [...] "The test-firing was part of India's efforts to create a missile defence shield against incoming enemy missiles. The AAD <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile,</b> which was fired from the Wheeler Island off the Odishan coast, successfully destroyed mid-air an incoming ballistic missile launched from the Integrated Test Range in Chandipur, about 70 km from the Wheeler Island." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, reports emerged {{of a new}} exo-atmospheric <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> {{named the}} Prithvi Defence Vehicle (PDV) <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile.</b> The DRDO is {{developing}} a new Prithvi <b>interceptor</b> <b>missile</b> codenamed PDV. It will be a two-stage missile and both the stages will be powered by solid propellants. It will have an innovative system for controlling the vehicle {{at an altitude of}} more than 150km The PDV is intended to replace the existing PAD in the PAD/AAD combination. It will have an IIR seeker for its kill vehicle as well. The PDV will replace the PAD with a far more capable missile and will complete the Phase 1 of the BMD system, allowing it to be operational by 2013. Whereupon Phase 2 development will take over for protection against missiles of the [...] range class. The first test flight of the missile was expected in 2010.
