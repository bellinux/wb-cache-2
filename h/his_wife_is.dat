5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a lawyer friend of Doggett's named Martin Wells tries {{to clear his name}} of the crime after <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> murdered.

5|$|According {{to modern}} genealogies {{the father of}} Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was {{a son of a}} {{previous}} ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{information}} about Anderson initially spread through memoirs of Civil War combatants and works by amateur historians. He was later discussed in biographies of Quantrill, which typically cast {{him as an}} inveterate murderer. Three biographies of Anderson were written after 1975. Asa Earl Carter's novel The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales features Anderson as a main character. In 1976, the book was adapted into a film, The Outlaw Josey Wales, which portrays a man who joins Anderson's gang after <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> killed by Union-backed raiders. James Carlos Blake's novel Wildwood Boys is a fictional biography of Anderson. He also appears as a character in several films about Jesse James.|$|E

5|$|Fleming {{also used}} {{historical}} references {{for some of}} his names and Marc-Ange Draco's name is based upon that of El Draco, the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake, a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character Draco Malfoy. For Tracy's background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of Fleming's, who died in an air-raid and Bond's grief {{for the loss of}} <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> an echo of Fleming's at the loss of Wright. Fleming did make mistakes in the novel, however, such as Bond ordering a half-bottle of Pol Roger Champagne: Fleming's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Foshan is a hub of Southern Chinese martial arts, where various schools {{actively}} recruit disciples {{and compete}} against each other. Although the Wing Chun master Ip Man {{is the most}} skilled martial artist in Foshan, he is unassuming and keeps a low profile. As an independent wealthy man, he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training, meeting with friends, and spending time with his family. However, <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> often resentful {{of the time he}} spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} sculpture, Seneb's size {{required}} {{the creator of}} the reliefs to make some unusual artistic choices. The standard convention of depicting higher status through physical size was maintained by portraying Seneb as being larger than his retainers, although this was clearly the opposite of the situation that actually existed. On the other hand, he is still shown with the physical characteristics of a dwarf. Unusually for such a relief, <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> not pictured alongside him but appears separately. This may have been done to avoid the complications that would have arisen from needing to depict the couple's relative sizes realistically while still portraying Seneb as the larger party, as convention would have dictated. Seneb is also not shown carrying out typical male activities such as hunting, which was presumably impractical for someone of his stature, although one relief shows him pulling on papyrus reeds to guide his boat through the marshes of the Nile Delta.|$|E
5|$|Batman, Robin and Batgirl {{decide to}} go after Freeze together. By {{the time they get}} to the {{observatory}} where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen.

Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E
5|$|Hank Mitchell and {{his wife}} Sarah live in rural Minnesota. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works in a feed mill, while <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> a librarian.

5|$|Howard {{repeatedly}} questions Vaughn, {{believing he}} is {{acting as the}} fall guy for his two friends. Vaughn says nothing, but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison. Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up because he thought {{if he had the}} gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
5|$|After much research, Bella {{concludes that}} Edward is {{seemingly}} human, but has mysterious powers resembling to a vampire. He eventually confirms this, {{but says he}} and the other Cullens only consume animal blood. The pair fall in love, and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the family patriarch, is a doctor working at the hospital in Forks. <b>His</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> Esme, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett, and Rosalie, are their informally adopted children. Edward and Bella's relationship is soon put in jeopardy, when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive in Forks. James, a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts, is instantly intrigued by Edward's protectiveness over a human, which incites him to hunt Bella for sport. Edward and the other Cullens risk their lives to protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice. James lures Bella into a trap by falsely claiming that he is holding her mother hostage. James attacks Bella by biting her wrist, infecting her with vampire venom. After a ferocious battle, Edward subdues James just as the other Cullens arrive.

Upon returning to Forks, Edward accompanies Bella to the high school prom, where he refuses to grant her request that he would transform her into a vampire. As the couple dance, they are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is secretly watching, plotting revenge for her lover's death.|$|E
