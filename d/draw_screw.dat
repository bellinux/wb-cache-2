The press first <b>draws</b> the <b>screw</b> back into the container as the grapes to be loaded in. Then the screw moves forward horizontally acting more like a [...] "battering ram" [...] than an auger by intermittently pushing the cake in [...] "impulses" [...] against {{the far end of the}} press. While producing slightly less phenolic press fraction, the disadvantage of this press is the decrease efficiency that is almost on par with batch presses.|$|R

40|$|Mainly <b>drawing</b> on <b>screw</b> {{theory and}} linear algebra, this paper {{presents}} a general approach for Jacobian analysis of lower mobility manipulators. Given the definitions of twist/wrench spaces and their subspaces of the end-effector, the underlying relationships amongst these subspaces are identified using the virtual work principle. Using the orthogonal and dual properties of these subspaces and variational representation {{to account for the}} permitted and restricted instantaneous motions of the end-effector, a general and systematic procedure for the formulation of a generalized Jacobian is proposed. The merit of the generalized Jacobian allows the first order kinematic and static modeling (velocity, accuracy, force and stiffness) to be integrated into a unified mathematical framework. The generalized Jacobians for three well-known parallel manipulators are derived as examples to illustrate generality and effectiveness of this approach...|$|R
5000|$|I {{worked as}} a {{technical}} illustrator, taking blueprints and converting them to three-dimensional exploded views. I worked {{for a company that}} did the parts catalog for Boeing airliners. These were the books that the mechanics kept in the hangars so that they could order the parts. We <b>drew</b> every <b>screw,</b> washer, bolt and everything else in the planes. I {{got to the point where}} I thought I could go in there and take the plane apart with a screwdriver. ... I kind of enjoyed it. It was different. After that I went to work as a package designer for a manufacturer of paper boxes. I would do dummy artwork for the boxes and after they were approved I did the camera-ready art so that it could be printed. I worked there until one of the partners did some tricks with the books and the place went out of business.|$|R
40|$|Mainly <b>drawing</b> on <b>screw</b> {{theory and}} linear algebra, this paper {{presents}} an approach to determining the bases of three unknown twist and wrench subspaces of lower mobility serial kinematic chains, an essential step for kinematic and dynamic modeling of both serial and parallel manipulators. By taking the reciprocal product of a wrench on a twist as a linear functional, the underlying relationships among their subspaces are reviewed {{by means of the}} dual space and dual basis. Given the basis of a twist subspace of permissions, the causes of nonuniqueness in the bases of the other three subspaces are discussed in some depth. Driven by needs from engineering design, criteria, and a procedure are proposed that enable pragmatic, consistent bases of these subspaces to be determined in a meaningful, visualizable, and effective manner. Three typical examples are given to illustrate the entire process. Then, formulas are presented for the bases of the twist/wrench subspaces of a number of commonly used serial kinematic chains, which can readily be employed for the formulation of the generalized Jacobian of a variety of lower mobility parallel manipulators...|$|R
40|$|<b>Drawing</b> on <b>screw</b> {{theory and}} the virtual joint method, this paper {{presents}} a general and hierarchical approach for semianalytical stiffness modeling of parallel mechanisms. The stiffness model is built by two essential steps: 1) formulating the map between the stiffness matrices of platform and limbs using the duality of wrench and twist of the platform; and 2) formulating the map between stiffness matrices of a limb {{and a number of}} elastic elements in that limb using the duality of the wrench attributed to the limb and the twist of the endlink of that limb. By merging these two threads, the Cartesian stiffness matrix can be explicitly expressed in terms of the compliance matrices of joints and links. The proposed approach bridges the gap between two currently available approaches and is thereby very useful for evaluating stiffness over the entire workspace and investigating the influences of joint/link compliances on those of the platform in a quick and precise manner. A stiffness analysis for a 3 -PRS parallel mechanism is presented as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

According to the New York Times he fell 18 meters from the speeding liner and had to swim desperately in his sea boots to avoid being <b>drawn</b> into her <b>screws.</b> Within a few seconds after the alarm Minnewaska had cut a wide circle to port and was heading back over her course. A boat under the command of Chief Officer James Grant Hutchison was soon lowered and Browning was brought back on board, thirteen minutes after his fall, but without his sea boots.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a flanged neoprene bushing with a nut embedded in the non-flanged end. The bolt is passed {{through one of the}} pieces to be fastened and threaded onto the nut from the flanged end. The non-flanged end is then inserted through the other piece to be fastened. As the bolt is tightened, friction from the neoprene flange against the piece being fastened prevents the nut from turning. The bushing is compressed by the nut, forming a lip behind the piece being fastened, which compresses the fastened piece and seals the bolt hole. It can also be used in a solid workpiece. As the <b>screw</b> <b>draws</b> the embedded nut towards it, the walls of the well exert a force on the hole walls, anchoring it.|$|R

He covered the Times Square beat for Screw during a perilous time when few, if any writers, ventured there. He also worked as a producer on Screws cable television show, Midnight Blue. Several of Friedmans Screw pieces would eventually serve {{as the foundation for}} his 1986 collection, Tales of Times Square, documenting [...] "pre-Disney" [...] Times Square. By the late 70s, Joshs brother, artist Drew Friedman, was <b>drawing</b> covers for <b>Screw,</b> some conceptualized with Josh.

60|$|Colonel Sir Thomas Woolrych, K.C.B. (retired list), was {{a soldier}} of the old school, much {{attached}} to pipe-clay and purchase, and with a low opinion of competitive examinations, the first six books of Euclid, the local military centres, the territorial titles of regiments, the latest regulation pattern in half-dress buttons, and most other confounded new-fangled radical fal-lal and trumpery in general. Sir Thomas believed as firmly in the wisdom of our ancestors as he distrusted the wisdom of our nearest descendants, now just attaining to years of maturity and indiscretion. Especially had he a marked dislike for this nasty modern shopkeeping habit of leaving all your loose money lying idly at your banker's, and paying everybody with a dirty little bit of crumpled paper, instead of pulling out a handful of gold, magnificently, from your trousers pocket, and flinging the sovereigns boldly down before you upon the counter like an officer and a gentleman. Why should you let one of those bloated, overfed, lazy banker-fellows grow rich out of borrowing your money from you for nothing, {{without so much as}} a thank-you, and lending it out again to some other poor devil of a tradesman (probably in difficulties) at seven per cent. on short discount? No, no; that was not the way Sir Thomas Woolrych had been accustomed to live when he was an ensign (sub-lieutenant they positively call it nowadays) at Ahmednuggur, in the North-West Provinces. In those days, my dear sir, a man <b>drew</b> his monthly <b>screw</b> by pay-warrant, took the rupees in solid cash, locked them up carefully in the desk in his bungalow, helped himself liberally to them while they lasted, and gave IOU's for any little trifle of cards or horses he might happen to have let himself in for meanwhile with his brother-officers. IOU's are of course a gentlemanly and recognized form of monetary engagement, but for bankers' cheques Sir Thomas positively felt little less than contempt and loathing.|$|R
