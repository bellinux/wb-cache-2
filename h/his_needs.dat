5|$|In 1933, Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} expand the Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), which he {{considered}} too small for <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> On 21 July 1935, Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall (that {{could also be used}} as a ballroom) to be built onto the old Chancellery. The drawings were unique because of the large cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to a bunker which later became known as the Vorbunker.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1921, Howe was vacationing {{with the}} Roosevelts at Campobello Island when Franklin {{began to run}} a high fever and {{reported}} paralysis in his legs. A doctor was sent for, and Roosevelt was diagnosed with poliomyelitis. Howe remained by Roosevelt's bedside throughout {{the early days of}} his illness, cheering him up, tending to <b>his</b> <b>needs,</b> and even changing his bedpans. By September of that year, Howe had been formally invited to join the Roosevelt household, and began visiting his own family only on weekends.|$|E
5|$|Most {{schools were}} {{residential}} whereby {{both teachers and}} students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, a teacher to instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants to cover all <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> Madrasas were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a job in the government without receiving an education from a madrasa.|$|E

Yet still he was quiet and gentle, in reverence of her conception, and because she was with child by him.|$|R

5|$|She {{dedicated}} The False Laurel, {{published in}} 1896, to Lionel Johnson. The plot features a poetess who {{falls in love}} with and marries an insipid young poet, giving up her own writing to attend to <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> She becomes bored, writes a successful play, and then goes mad. The False Laurel was the least successful of her books, selling fewer than 200 copies. It received a poor review from The Bookman but a good one from The Athenaeneum.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{wary of the}} FROLINAT, Gaddafi {{had come}} to see by 1970 the organization as useful to <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding. On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president François Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians.|$|E
5|$|According to the Samyutta Nikaya, Koṇḍañña {{retired to}} {{the banks of the}} Mandakini Lake in the Chaddanta forest, said to be the abode of the paccekabuddhas. It was said that the 8000 {{elephants}} in the forest took turns to catering for <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> Koṇḍañña only left once, to farewell Gautama Buddha. Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 18 he {{was given}} a {{separate}} establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father, threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace. The Prince of Wales turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) from Parliament and an annual income of £50,000 (equivalent to £ today) from his father. It was far too little for <b>his</b> <b>needs</b> – the stables alone cost £31,000 a year. He then established his residence in Carlton House, where he lived a profligate life. Animosity developed between the prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour {{on the part of the}} heir apparent. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the prince's adherence to Charles James Fox and other radically inclined politicians.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there has}} been some ongoing dispute on the {{experiment}} itself, as the fact that Fechner deliberately discarded results of the study ill-fitting to <b>his</b> <b>needs</b> became known, with many mathematicians including Mario Livio refuting the result of the experiment.|$|E
25|$|Rogers {{was famous}} for his use of language. He {{effectively}} used up-to-date slang and invented new words to fit <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> He also made frequent use of puns and terms which closely linked him to the cowboy tradition, as well as speech patterns using a southern dialect.|$|E

25|$|Many of Lowe's constructions {{are created}} from willow saplings, {{often the only}} {{material}} used in installations. Lowe collects the saplings from Wisconsin farms in the summertime, gathering a large amount, peeling off the bark, and sanding the resulting sticks {{to bring out the}} white in the sapling. Flexibility and strength are essential with willow, allowing Lowe to bend and manipulate the wood to <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
25|$|After his speech, he {{was asked}} by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more {{in the form of a}} book. He wrote Negry v Amerike in 1923. He wrote this in Russian, and it was not {{translated}} into English until 1979. Later in life, he came to the conclusion that the Communist party suppressed the idea of individuality and independent thought. Before coming back to America, he denounced the Communist thoughts{citation needed|Date = October 2017}} and looked for other areas to meet <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alger began {{attending}} Chelsea Grammar School in 1842, but by December 1844 his father's financial troubles had worsened considerably and, {{in search}} of a better salary, he moved the family to Marlborough, Massachusetts, an agricultural town 25 miles west of Boston, where he was installed as pastor of the Second Congregational Society in January 1845 with a salary sufficient to meet <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> Horatio attended Gates Academy, a local preparatory school, and completed his studies at age 15.

By 1965, Dacko had lost the support of most Central Africans and may have been planning to resign from the presidency when he was overthrown.|$|R
25|$|In 1851, {{he moved}} to a poor {{neighborhood}} in Kingston upon Hull to be a medical assistant with Robert Hardey, and began preparing himself {{for a life of}} faith and service, devoting himself to the poor and exercising faith that God would provide for <b>his</b> <b>needs.</b> He practised distributing gospel tracts and open-air preaching among the poor. He was baptized by Andrew John Jukes of the Plymouth Brethren in the Hull Brethren Assembly in 1852, and convinced his sister Amelia to also take adult baptism.|$|E
25|$|Islam, {{which came}} after Hinduism, {{strengthened}} the status structure of this traditional religious pattern. More than 90 {{percent of the}} people of Java are Muslims, on a broad continuum between abangan (more traditional) and santri (more modernist). The Muslim scholar of the writ (Kyai) became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal priesthood, but the Dutch colonial government established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese pesantren (Islamic schools), The Kyai perpetuated the tradition of the resi. Students around him provided <b>his</b> <b>needs,</b> even peasants around the school.|$|E
25|$|At the War Policy Committee (3 October) in Robertson’s absence, Lloyd George urged greater {{effort to}} advance into Syria {{with a view}} to {{knocking}} Turkey out of the war altogether, and the ministers decided to redeploy 2 divisions from France. Robertson angered the Prime Minister (5 October) by arguing against this, claiming that these troops would be needed in France. He also asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza–Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa–Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat (although neither Allenby nor Robertson really thought there was much chance of this happening), but urging Maude not to exaggerate <b>his</b> <b>needs</b> in Mesopotamia.|$|E
