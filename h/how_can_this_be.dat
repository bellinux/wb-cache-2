25|$|<b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> {{rational}} {{for both}} investors? The {{answer lies in}} the fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

60|$|Even {{in his old}} age, Montaigne was a gay, cheerful, untiring traveller, always {{eager to}} be going on, delighted with every place he visited, and yet anxious for {{constant}} change of scene and for new experience. To be amusingly and simply selfish is ever part of the charm of Montaigne. He adds to his reader's pleasure in life by the keenness with which he relished his own existence, and savoured every little incident as a man relishes the bouquet of wine. Without selfishness, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> managed? and without perfect simplicity and the good faith on which he prided himself, how could Montaigne, how could Pepys, have enriched the world as they have done? His essays are among the few works that really and literally make life more opulent with accumulated experience, criticism, reflection, humour. He gives of his rich nature, his lavish exuberance of character, out of that fresh and puissant century to this rather weary one, just as his society in youth might {{have been given to}} the sick old man.|$|E

How petty do such researches seem when compared with this one which strikes at the very roots {{of life and the}} nature of the soul! I had always looked upon spirit as a product of matter. The brain, I thought, secreted the mind, as the liver does the bile. But <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> when I see mind working from a distance and playing upon matter as a musician might upon a violin? The body does not give rise to the soul, then, but is rather the rough instrument by which the spirit manifests itself. The windmill does not give rise to the wind, but only indicates it. It was opposed to my whole habit of thought, and yet it was undeniably possible and worthy of investigation.|$|E

60|$|Excellent! O, by {{all means}} {{preserve}} for {{him the benefit of}} his rightful heir-loom, the regal sceptre; only lay it about his shoulders, till he promises to handle it, as he ought! But what if he breaks his promise and your head? or what if he will not promise? How much honester would it be to say, that extreme cases are 'ipso nomine' not generalizable, --therefore not the subjects of a law, which is the conclusion 'per genus singuli in genere inclusi'. Every extreme case must be judged by and for itself under all the peculiar circumstances. Now as these are not foreknowable, the case itself cannot be predeterminable. Harmodius and Aristogiton did not justify Brutus and Cassius: but neither do Brutus and Cassius criminate Harmodius and Aristogiton. The rule applies till an extreme case occurs; and <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> proved? I answer, the only proof is success and good event; for these afford the best presumption, first, of the extremity, and secondly, of its remediable nature--the two elements of its justification. To every individual it is forbidden. He who attempts it, therefore, must do so on the presumption that the will of the nation is in his will: whether he is mad or in his senses, the event can alone determine.|$|E
60|$|Twelve o'clock! It is {{the natural}} centre, key-stone, and {{very heart of the}} day. At that hour, the sun has arrived {{at the top of his}} hill; and as he seems to hang poised there a while, before coming down on the other side, it is but {{reasonable}} to suppose that he is then stopping to dine; setting an eminent example to all mankind. The rest of the day is called afternoon; the very sound of which fine old Saxon word conveys a feeling of the lee bulwarks and a nap; a summer sea--soft breezes creeping over it; dreamy dolphins gliding in the distance. Afternoon! the word implies, that it is an after-piece, coming after the grand drama of the day; something to be taken leisurely and lazily. But <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be,</b> if you dine at five? For, after all, though Paradise Lost be a noble poem, and we men-of-war's men, no doubt, largely partake in the immortality of the immortals yet, let us candidly confess it, shipmates, that, upon the whole, our dinners are the most momentous attains of these lives we lead beneath the moon. What were a day without a dinner? a dinnerless day! such a day had better be a night.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{these three}} facts of experience, such facts as go {{to make an}} agnostic, are, in this view, turned totally round. I am left saying, [...] "Give me an explanation, first, of the towering {{eccentricity}} of man among the brutes; second, of the vast human tradition of some ancient happiness; third, of the partial perpetuation of such pagan joy in {{the countries of the}} Catholic Church." [...] One explanation, at any rate, covers all three: the theory that twice was the natural order interrupted by some explosion or revelation such as people now call [...] "psychic." [...] Once Heaven came upon the earth with a power or seal called the image of God, whereby man took command of Nature; and once again (when in empire after empire men had been found wanting) Heaven came to save mankind in the awful shape of a man. This would explain why the mass of men always look backwards; and why the only corner where they in any sense look forwards is the little continent where Christ has His Church. I know it will be said that Japan has become progressive. But <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> an answer when even in saying [...] "Japan has become progressive," [...] we really only mean, [...] "Japan has become European"? But I wish here not so much to insist on my own explanation as to insist on my original remark.
