For this application, MEKP is dissolved in dimethyl phthalate, cyclohexane peroxide, or <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> to reduce sensitivity to shock.

50|$|Thin film {{technology}} was also {{employed in the}} 1960s. Ultra Electronics manufactured circuits using a silica glass substrate. A film of tantalum was deposited by sputtering followed by a layer of gold by evaporation. The gold layer was first etched following application of a photo resist to form solder compatible connection pads. Resistive networks were formed, also by a photo resist and etching process. These were trimmed to a high precision by selective adonization of the film. Capacitors and semiconductors were {{in the form of}} LID (Leadless Inverted Devices) soldered to the surface by selectively heating the substrate from the underside. Completed circuits were potted in a <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> resin. Several customized passive networks were made using these techniques as were some amplifiers and other specialized circuits. It is believed that some passive networks were used in the engine control units manufactured by Ultra Electronics for Concorde.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{aimed to}} produce the {{alkaline}} phenolic resin {{by the addition of}} <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> into traditional phenol–formaldehyde resin. Then the modified resin was characterized using dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA). The results indicated that: the increase of the <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> contributed to the rise of the storage modulus (E’) and loss modulus (E”), the decrease of the loss factor. Curing temperature also showed a decline trend and was decreased by 5 ℃ when the amount of modifider was 2. 5 % of the phenol. The improvemnt of Organic ester on curing of alkaline phenolic resin achieved by rapidly promoting resin molecular to generate reactive intermediate quinone methide. The amount of the modifier had little effect on the thermostability of resin, but it reduced the bonding strength of plywood...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Impregnation {{technique}} with suitable chemicals {{can be used}} {{to improve}} the dimensional stability and mechanical properties of wood. The impregnation can be carried out via in-situ polymerization either by using catalyst-heat treatment or irradiation technique. In this study, the rubberwood-polymer composites were prepared by impregnating the rubberwood with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DAP) and the combination of GMA and DAP. The catalyst-heat treatment was employed for the polymerization process to take place. The weight percentage gain of impregnated samples increased as impregnation pressure increased for all monomers used. At the highest chemical loading, rubberwood-polymer composites impregnated with GMA exhibited the best dimensional stability and mechanical performance...|$|E
40|$|The major {{challenges}} of automatic track counting are distinguishing tracks and material defects, identifying small tracks and defects of similar size, and detecting overlapping tracks. Here we address the latter issue using WUSEM, an algorithm which combines the watershed transform, morphological erosions and labeling to separate regions in photomicrographs. WUSEM shows reliable results {{when used in}} photomicrographs presenting almost isotropic objects. We tested this method in two datasets of <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DAP) photomicrographs and compared the results when counting manually and using the classic watershed. The mean automatic/manual efficiency ratio when using WUSEM in the test datasets is 0. 97 +/- 0. 11. Comment: 31 pages, 15 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the role of polymerizable and unpolymerizable pendant group of surfactant in clay dispersion in <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DAP) matrix and evaluate the mechanical properties of resulting nanocomposites. Results of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and high magnification Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) indicate an intercalated morphology for both types of nanocomposites, while low magnification TEM results show better dispersion of clay tactoids in the nanocomposite formulated with organclay containing polymerizable terminal pendant group. The mechanical properties of nanocomposites with organoclay loading of 1, 3, 5 and 7 wt%, respectively, were determined by performing flexural measurements. The testing results show that the nanocomposite formulated with organclay containing polymerizable terminal pendant group has better flexural properties than that formulated with organoclay containing unpolymerizable pendant group...|$|E
40|$|The {{mutagenic}} {{activities of}} several phthalate esters {{have been evaluated}} in an 8 -azaguanine resistance assay in Salmonella typhimurium. Three phthalate esters {{were found to be}} mutagenic: dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate. A number of other phthalate esters were not found to be mutagenic, including di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate, <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> diisobutyl phthalate and diisodecyl phthalate. A metabolite of di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, 2 -ethylhexanol, was also noted to be mutagenic. The mutagenic activity of this agent and others in this series was dose dependent but weak. No dose-response curve exceeded more than 3. 5 times background at maximally testable concentrations. A liquid suspension histidine reversion assay of dimethyl phthalate showed levels of mutagenic activity similar to that observed in the azaguanine resistance assay. The data suggest a need for further investigation of the mutagenic potential of these agents in other assay systems...|$|E

The tensile values compared with the upper limit tensile strength values for asbestos-filled formulations. Adiprene-ferric acetyl acetonate-polyol systems were developed as adhesives and their properties studied. Sources of kilogram quantities of Th/sup 2 //sup 3 //sup 0 / were investigated. The samples were analyzed by a direct CeF/sub 3 / precipitation procedurc or by a tributyl phosphate-cerium procedure. The half- life of Ra/sup 2 //sup 2 //sup 3 / {{was found to be}} 11. 3700 plus or minus 0. 0065 days. Differential thermal analyses were made of lanthanum and praseodymium metals. Three preilminary determinations of the density of molten cerium were made by the vacuum pycnometer method. An average value of 6. 58 was obtained.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{interesting}} biobased chemical building blocks were developed via the condensation of the C 22 acyloin obtained from 10 -undecenoic acid (castor oil and a non-edible oil) with mono- and bifunctional acid chlorides. Two terminally unsaturated acid chlorides (C 3 and C 11), three long chain saturated aliphatic acid chlorides (C 10, C 12 and C 14), {{as well as}} the bifunctional adipoyl chloride were used. The condensation products were obtained as pure oils with potential cross-linking features and are therefore of interest as biobased crosslinkers for the polymer industry. The acyloin was successfully copolymerized in a radical emulsion copolymerization process, replacing <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate.</b> Radical, ionic or coordination homopolymerization of the same acyloin, however, did not work. Neither did the radical homopolymerization of undecenoyl acyloin. The acrylated acyloin, however, was transformed into a transparent glass upon solvent-free radical polymerization initiated by benzoyl peroxide. Thermogravimetric, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Dynamic Mechanical Analyses were performed on the obtained polymer. Epoxidation of the triple unsaturated undecenoyl acyloin and the acyloin itself was evaluated as well...|$|E
40|$|The curing {{kinetics}} of <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> in {{the presence}} of dicumyl peroxide as catalyst were studied by means of the single dynamic temperature scan DSC method. The curing process is accomplished by the liberation of heat and appears as an exotherm on the DSC thermogram. Different data analysis methods were employed to analyse the reaction exotherm and to obtain the kinetic parameters. The rate constants obtained by means of the cut-and-weigh method, as well as those calculated from the residual heats of reaction after different oven curing times, were in excellent agreement with the values obtained by using the Borchardt and Daniels DSC kinetics data analysis software (supplied by Du Pont). It was evident from {{the results of this study}} that all the data analysis methods were suitable for determining the kinetic parameters of thermoset curing reactions which follow first-order kinetics. However, this study has shown conclusively that the analysis speed and simplicity of the Borchardt and Daniels DSC kinetics program make this the preferred method for obtaining quantitative reaction kinetics information for the curing of thermoset resins. © 1993.

40|$|A semiautomatic grinder was {{designed}} and built at Mound Laboratory to grind molded plastic detonator heads to close tolerances. It uses a vertical spindle, dry grinding technique to decrease grinding time of some <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DAP) detonator heads with wire inserts and to eliminate the problem of error in repeatability which is characteristic of the manual grinding process. The semiautomatic grinder is essentially air-operated with electrical control and was primarily designed using standard components for ease of manufacture and maintenance. As development of the semiautomatic grinder progressed, DAP detonator heads with wire inserts ground using the manual surface grinder were evaluated along with {{the same type of}} detonator heads ground using the semiautomatiac grinder. Also, a time study was conducted to determine the cost savings of grinding miniature DAP detonator heads with wire inserts using the semiautomatic grinder. Inspection and analytical results and radiographic sections of ground detonator head surfaces from each grinding technique indicated that the semiautomatic grinding technique provides acceptable ground DAP detonator heads with wire inserts at a cost savings of 83. 5 % and a significant reduction in grinding time...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey and}} re-evaluation of {{previous}} work on polyurethane and polyurethane [...] epoxy copolymer systems was initiated {{to determine which}} phases are more productive than others. The effects of varying excess polyol content were studied. Work was carried out to define the amounts of butamediol that the system Adiprene L- 213 -ferric acetyl acetonate can tolerate and still be thoroughly cured. An experimental <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> formulation was made and tested. A survey is being made of potential sources of kilogram quantities of Th/ sup 2 //sup 3 //sup 0 / in the United States. Analyses of various samples indicated concentrations almost three times as great as previously reported. The half-life of Rain was recalculated to include new data, {{and the results are}} reported {{as a function of the}} resolution time of the gas flow proportional counter. A method is being developed for determining the coincidence correction in porportional alpha counters by following the decay of a short-lived isotope. Additional determinations were made on the density of liquid cerium by the vacuum pycnometer method using tantalum pycnometers of about 0. 5 cm/sup 3 / capacity. The viscosity of molten plutonium metal was investigated from 648 to 950 deg C with a cup viscometer. The construction of the hightemperature colorimeter was continued. Work was continued on the fabrication of plutonium-bearing glass fibers. (M. C. G. ...|$|E
40|$|A new CE {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the simultaneous separation {{of a group of}} parent phthalates. Due to the neutral character of these compounds, the addition of several bile salts as surfactants (sodium cholate (SC), sodium deoxycholate (SDC), sodium taurodeoxycholate (STDC), sodium taurocholate (STC)) to the separation buffer was explored showing the high potential of SDC as pseudostationary phase. However, the resolution of all the phthalates was not achieved when employing only this bile salt as additive, being necessary the addition of neutral cyclodextrins (CD) and organic modifiers to the separation media. The optimized cyclodextrin modified micellar electrokinetic chromatography (CD-MEKC) method consisted of the employ of a background electrolyte (BGE) containing 25 mM -CD- 100 mM SDC in a 100 mM borate buffer (pH 8. 5) with a 10 % (v/v) of acetonitrile, employing a voltage of 30 kV and a temperature of 25 ◦C. This separation medium enabled the total resolution of eight compounds and the partial resolution of two of the analytes, di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) and diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) (Rs ∼ 0. 8), in only 12 min. The analytical characteristics of the developed method were studied showing their suitability for the determination of these compounds in commercial perfumes. In all the analyzed perfumes the most common phthalate was diethyl phthalate (DEP) that appeared in ten of the fifteen analyzed products. Also dimethyl phthalate (DMP), <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DAP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCP), and di-n-pentyl phthalate (DNPP) were found in some of the analyzed samples...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{toxicity}} and {{carcinogenicity studies}} of several phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and compounds containing a 2 -ethylhexyl moiety {{were conducted in}} Fischer 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 (hybrid) mice. The compounds studied were phthalic anhydride, di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, <b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> di(2 ethylhexyl) adipate, tris(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate, and 2 -ethylhexyl sulfate (sodium salt). Estimated maximum tolerable doses and fractionally lower doses of each compound were administered to groups of 50 male and 50 female rats and mice for 2 years, followed by sacrifice, necropsy, and histopathological examination of major organs and tissues. The low toxic potencies {{of most of the}} compounds allowed for relatively high doses to be given during the chronic studies. In general, the toxic manifestations of the PAEs were closely correlated with their ester substituents. Although many of the PAEs possessed some carcinogenic activity, target sites for such effects were dissimilar, suggesting the absence of a common mode of action. In contrast, all of the 2 -ethylhexyl-containing compounds studied possessed some hepatocarcinogenic activity, indicating that this moiety may have a propensity for causing hepatocarcinogenesis in mice, particularly those of the female sex. The 2 -ethylhexyl compound that caused the greatest hepatocarcinogenic response in mice, di(2 ethylhexyl) phthalate, was also hepatocarcinogenic in rats. Similarly, those with a relatively greater effect in female mice were also active in male mice. Thus, sex and species differences in 2 -ethylhexyl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents are probably quantitative rather than qualitative in nature...|$|E
40|$|Bivalves and {{especially}} mussels {{are very good}} indicators of marine and estuarine pollution, and so they {{have been widely used}} in biomonitoring programs all around the world. However, traditional single parameter biomarkers face the problem of high sensitivity to biotic and abiotic factors. In our study, digestive gland peroxisome-enriched fractions of Mytilus edulis (L., 1758) were analyzed by DIGE and MS. We identified several proteomic signatures associated with the exposure to several marine pollutants (<b>diallyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> PBDE- 47, and bisphenol-A). Animals collected from North Atlantic Sea were exposed to the contaminants independently under controlled laboratory conditions. One hundred and eleven spots showed a significant increase or decrease in protein abundance in the two-dimensional electrophoresis maps from the groups exposed to pollutants. We obtained a unique protein expression signature of exposure to each of those chemical compounds. Moreover a set of proteins composed a proteomic signature in common to the three independent exposures. It is remarkable that the principal component analysis of these spots showed a discernible separation between groups, and so did the hierarchical clustering into four classes. The 14 proteins identified by MS participate in �- and �-oxidation pathways, xenobiotic and amino acid metabolism, cell signaling, oxyradical metabolism, peroxisomal assembly, respiration, and the cytoskeleton. Our results suggest that proteomic signatures could become a valuable tool to monitor the presence of pollutants in field experiments where a mixture of pollutants is often present. Further studies on the identified proteins could provide crucial information to understand possible mechanisms of toxicity of single xenobiotics or mixtures of them in marine ecosystems.
