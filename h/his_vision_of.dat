5|$|Cooper and {{his friend}} and {{frequent}} collaborator, noted director John Ford, formed Argosy Productions in 1946 and produced such notable films such as Wagon Master (1950), Ford's Fort Apache (1948), and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. Cooper's films at Argosy reflected his patriotism and <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> America.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{opposed the}} profanity in the script, as the vulgar {{language}} {{did not fit}} <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{remains the}} central figure {{in the history of}} animation. Through {{technological}} innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.|$|E

5000|$|Under his administration, the Philippines enjoyed {{economic}} growth and stability. <b>His</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> 'Philippines 2000' led the country into a newly industrialized {{country in the world}} and the [...] "Tiger Cub Economy in Asia".|$|R
25|$|In 1869, the Paiute Wodziwob {{founded the}} Ghost Dance movement. The dance rituals were an {{occasion}} to announce <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> an earthquake that would swallow the whites. He {{seems to have}} died in 1872.|$|R
5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
5|$|Back on the highway, an {{ambulance}} crew try to resuscitate Black, {{who has been}} outside his car through the night after <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E
5|$|Clear Rivers is {{introduced}} in the 2000 film Final Destination {{as one of the}} seniors from the fictional Mt. Abraham High School boarding Volée Airlines Flight 180 heading to Paris on May 13, 2000. On board, Alex Browning warns the passengers about <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the airliner exploding in mid-air, gaining no support except for Clear. She along with Alex and their classmates Tod Waggner, Terry Chaney, Carter Horton, Billy Hitchcok and teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton are removed from the plane before it explodes in midair minutes after take off, killing the other 286 passengers. Thirty nine days later, while at the memorial for the victims, she presents Alex a white rose as gratitude for saving her life.|$|E
50|$|Jim tells Jean <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> the future, {{going back}} to the 1940s. Jean is doubtful, {{suggesting}} the idea of torus-shaped space stations hadn't yet made it into the science fiction magazines of his youth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} year he repeated this success with <b>his</b> <b>Visions</b> <b>of</b> Salome Waltz (1909) {{also in the}} same low-pitched minor-key style. He was billed by his publishers Ascherberg Hopwood and Crew as the [...] "English Waltz King".|$|R
50|$|Ottavio Michelini (14 August 1906 - 15 October 1979) of Mirandola, Italy was an Italian Roman Catholic priest, {{considered}} to be a mystic. In 1975 he began to publish books pertaining to <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> Jesus and Mary.|$|R
5|$|In Hymns of Divine Love (also called Hymns of Divine Eros) most {{of which}} were {{completed}} during his time in exile, Symeon describes <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> God as uncreated divine light. That experience of divine luminosity is associated by Symeon with the Holy Trinity, with God, and sometimes with Christ. The Hymns are similar in theme to the Discourses, but are written with poetic meter and rhyme. He began writing them {{at the same time as}} the Discourses but only finished editing them during the last thirteen years of his life at the monastery of St. Macrina. There are 58 hymns totaling approximately 11,000 verses.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.|$|E
60|$|With {{sticks and}} knives the man's companions fell upon the beast, while Paulvitch danced around the cursing, snarling pack mumbling and {{screaming}} pleas and threats. He saw <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> wealth rapidly dissipating before {{the weapons of}} the sailors.|$|R
50|$|Since then, Valtaoja {{has written}} another book, Avoin tie (The Open Road, 2004), {{in which he}} {{explains}} <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> the future. The book is written in a style {{similar to that of}} Kotona maailmankaikkeudessa, with the general audience in mind.|$|R
60|$|Gunn {{himself was}} in a dilemma. With Mullet dead, his power was at an end and <b>his</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> wealth dissipated. He {{resolved}} to feather his nest immediately, and interviewed the surgeon. The surgeon was ominously reticent, the nurse cheerfully ghoulish.|$|R
5|$|When {{a chance}} arose {{for him to}} escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald's court. He was then visited by a {{stranger}} who was aware of Rædwald's deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, {{a member of the}} Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. <b>His</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop's presence at Rædwald's court would throw some light on the king's position regarding religion.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Carte {{became the}} {{business}} {{manager of the}} Royalty Theatre, {{under the direction of}} his client, the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro. There he programmed Offenbach's La Périchole. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called Trial by Jury. Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, Cox and Box, had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for Trial by Jury. Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time. Trial by Jury, a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning La Périchole, and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{tensions}} {{within the}} team and from publisher 2K Games continued during the development process. According to LeBreton, Levine was distrustful {{of some of the}} more egotistical newer hires and was often arguing with them to enforce <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> BioShock. 2K Games was concerned with the growing budget for the title, and told Levine to market the title more as a first-person shooter rather than the first-person shooter/role player game hybrid they set out for. Near the targeted release date, Levine ordered the team into round-the-clock development, creating more strife in the team. Paul Hellquist, the game's lead designer, was often omitted from key design meetings, which he later recounted was due to his contrary nature to Levine, questioning several of his choices; he used his frustration to put into the design efforts for the Medical Pavilion level that {{he was in charge of}} at that time. Near the anticipated completion date, 2K decided to give Irrational another three months to polish up the game, extending the current crunch time the studio was already under.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
25|$|On August 16, 1888, Dr. John Stith Pemberton {{suddenly}} died; Asa G. Candler then {{sought to}} move swiftly forward to attain <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> taking {{full control of}} the whole Coca-Cola operation.|$|E
25|$|The former University of Michigan {{honor society}} Michigamua renamed itself the Order of Angell in 2007.

25|$|A case {{in point}} was Ikeda's {{conversion}} through his meeting with Toda. Ikeda was seemingly inspired by the authenticity and clarity of Toda's message, his capacity to employ language and logic to inspire people, and <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> global citizenship.|$|E
25|$|He {{also took}} a narrow view of ijtihad, {{limiting}} the authority {{to use it to}} those with thorough grounding in Islamic sciences, faith in the sharia, and then only to serve the needs of <b>his</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> an Islamic state.|$|E
25|$|Diamond Visual, {{which would}} become the largest AV company for a while, was founded in September 1988 by Toru Muranishi.

50|$|<b>His</b> <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> Arthurian {{romance and}} medieval design also {{inspired}} William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones.
