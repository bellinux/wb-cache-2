The United States Special Operations Command {{does not have}} an <b>intermediate-level</b> professional military <b>education</b> program for its officers. Current service-provided PME programs are not adequately meeting the educational goals for officers as required by USSOCOM. Through the Joint Special Operations University, SOCOM could establish its own PME program for officers of all services who are assigned to USSOCOM. Through the review of formal documents and interviews with senior officers in USSOCOM, an education gap was identified and analyzed.
