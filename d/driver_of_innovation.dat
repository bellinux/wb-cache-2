40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{differences}} in the <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> firm <b>innovation</b> performance across sectors. The literature often makes the assumption that firms in different sectors differ in their propensity to innovate but not in the <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> The authors empirically assess whether this assumption is accurate through a series of econometric estimations and tests. Design/methodology/approach: The data used are derived from the Irish Community Innovation Survey 2004 - 2006. A series of multivariate probit models are estimated and the resulting coefficients are tested for parameter stability across sectors using likelihood ratio tests. Findings: The results indicate that there is a strong degree of heterogeneity in the <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> across sectors. The determinants of process, organisational, new to firm and new to market innovation varies across sectors suggesting that the pooling of sectors in an innovation production function may lead to biased inferences. Research limitations/implications: The implications of the results are that innovation policies targeted at stimulating innovation need to be tailored to particular industries. One size fits all policies would seem inappropriate given the large degree of heterogeneity observed across the <b>drivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> in different sectors. Originality/value: The value of this paper is that it provides an empirical test as to whether it is suitable to group sectoral data when estimating innovation production functions. Most papers simply include sectoral dummies, implying that only the propensity to innovate differs across sectors and that the slope of the coefficient estimates are in fact consistent across sectors...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} {{increased}} emphasis on sustainability in the construction industry, it is uncertain whether the SME sector {{sees it as a}} <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> This lack of concern could occur for several reasons, such as material cost, uncertainty regarding the potential risks associated with sustainable practices, perceived lack of business benefit, and lack of informed client demand. To explore such issues, a sample of smaller domestic builders in South East Queensland were asked, {{as part of a broader}} study of innovation in these firms, to provide their views on environmentally sustainable building practices. While a number of these firms identified sustainability related innovations as important, responses were less clear with respect to environmental sustainability as a <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> This paper uses this research to examine sustainability as a potential driver for innovation in the SME sector of the construction industry, and to suggest approaches to enhance such innovation...|$|E
40|$|The {{creative}} industries {{have long been}} seen as an innovative sector. More recent research posits that creative occupations are also a fundamental, but overlooked, <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> Theory also suggests cities are important for both {{creative industries}} and occupations, with urban environments helping firms innovate. Yet little empirical work has considered the links between creative industries, occupations, cities and innovation at the firm level. This paper addresses this gap using a sample of over 9, 000 UK SMEs. Our results stress that creative industries firms {{are more likely to}} introduce original product innovations, but not those learnt from elsewhere. Creative occupations, however, appear a more robust general <b>driver</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> We find no support for the hypothesis that urban creative industries firms are particularly innovative. However, creative occupations are used in cities to introduce product innovations learnt elsewhere. The results suggest future work needs to seriously consider the importance of occupations in empirical studies of innovation. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{financial}} services sector has been affected by drastic changes, resulting from multiple sources: (de-, re-) regulation; dominant role of information and communication technologies; shift to off balance sheet activities; service bundling; and changes in customer preferences.
