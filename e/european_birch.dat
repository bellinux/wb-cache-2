40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 09 Biomass burning {{is both a}} {{major source}} of {{particulate}} matter and reactive nitrogen oxide radicals, yet the rate and products of the multiphase chemistry between the two has not been well studied. Nitryl chloride (ClNO_ 2), formed by the multiphase reaction of dinitrogen pentoxide (N_ 2 O_ 5) on chloride-containing particles, is known to occur in polluted marine environments where it contributes significantly to the oxidant budget[Finlayson-Pitts, B. et al. Nature 337, 241 - 244 (1989). ]. Since the observation of ClNO_ 2 levels in a moderately polluted region far from the coast, there has been motivation to determine the source of particulate chloride, postulated as the limiting ingredient to ClNO_ 2 formation[Thornton, J. et al. Nature 464, 271 - 274 (2010). ]. Using a smog chamber reactor at Carnegie Mellon University coupled to a biomass combustion chamber with controlled particle and gas injection, we simulated the nocturnal evolution of N_ 2 O_ 5 in biomass burning plumes mixed with ozone. A range of authentic fuel types, including saw grass, cut grass, and white <b>European</b> <b>birch</b> were burned in the combustion chamber and a portion of the smoke plume was then mixed into the 12 m^ 3 chamber, where it was exposed to 70 - 150 ppb of ozone and relative humidity ranging from 0 - 60 % in the dark. Gaseous N_ 2 O_ 5, nitric acid (HNO_ 3), ClNO_ 2, Cl_ 2, and HCl were monitored using a high resolution time of flight iodide adduct chemical ionization mass spectrometer, and particle size distributions and composition were monitored continuously with an SMPS and a Soot-Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer among other instruments. With chemical mechanism modeling I attempt to abstract N_ 2 O_ 5 uptake coefficients as well as molar yields of ClNO_ 2 and report correlated changes in Cl_ 2 and HCl. I analyze dependences on combustion fuel type. These results suggest a potentially important impact of chlorine atom initiated oxidation in biomass burning plumes. The uptake of N_ 2 O_ 5 and yields of ClNO_ 2, Cl_ 2, and HCl determined from this study will allow for more robust parameterizations of these compounds in atmospheric models...|$|E
40|$|Mycorrhizal symbioses {{are formed}} between plant root systems and {{compatible}} fungal hyphae {{that results in}} a complex mixed structure. They are found in all ecosystems and {{with the majority of}} land plants such as forest trees or crops that are of commercial interest. Mutual exchange of nutrients between the two symbionts is central to the successful functioning of the symbioses. In order to understand the processes involved in the development of this symbiosis and to increase our knowledge in this field of study, I have used new molecular methods emerging from functional genomics, a faster way to link functions to genes. Particularly, I have developed and applied the microarray technology to further characterize this complex type of plant microbe interaction. Using this technique, we can decipher the complex molecular programs that lead to the mycorrhizal symbiosis, survey genome-wide patterns of gene expression within and among species as well as employing the information it contains in quantitative genetics studies. I believe that this new tool will be increasingly used by evolutionary biologists and in molecular ecology studies in the future to address questions such as those presented in this thesis. This thesis presents information on the genome and the transcriptome characteristics of our model mycorrhizal fungus Paxillus invoulus. Its nuclear haploid genome was estimated to be 21. 5 Mbp in length and to contain ca 7, 700 genes. An Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) project was initiated to obtain sequence information both on the coding genome of the fungus as well as for one of its plant hosts the <b>European</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pendula). Based on sequencing information of more than 10, 000 ESTs, a unique set of 2, 284 cDNAs either of fungal or plant origin were selected and amplified. These were spotted onto glass slides. These DNA chips or cDNA microarrays were used to survey the expression of the genes represented on the arrays at distinct developmental stages during formation of the symbiotic tissue. Notably, it revealed that the plant responds to the fungus and the formation of the symbiotic tissue by undergoing a typical hypersensitive response also observed in plants when attacked by various pathogens. Furthermore, this response was completely repressed in the more mature mycorrhizal tissue which probably allows the formation of a functional mycorrhizal association to occur. Finally, we use these cDNA microarrays to compare the transcriptome and the genome of isolates presenting phenotypic variations or of different origin. We found that the genome of P. involutus is plastic and contains a high number of divergent genes and / or genes that vary in copy number. Furthermore, transcript profiling in strains presenting different abilities to develop the symbiotic tissue also allowed the characterization of genes related to the symbiosis which show variability due to changes in the promoter elements and levels of transcription factors rather than gene copy number alterations...|$|E

In addition to flaws in stem form, pith discoloration and color change outside the pith reduce quality and value of logs irrespective of their end use. Our objectives were to 1) analyze the external and internal quality of birch trees damaged by moose, 2) measure whether the severity, type, and occurrence of damage dif-fered between silver <b>birch</b> and <b>European</b> white <b>birch</b> trees, and 3) evaluate visual criteria that would enable a forest-owner to assess damage and future value of moose-damaged birch trees prior to the first commercial thinning. We sampled 4 stands with a known history of moose damage; 18 trees per stand were classified by visual evaluation into 3 damage categories. The severity and type of damage lowering the internal quality of logs from sample trees were classified into 5 grades. The proportion of all visible color defects and/or decay was 74 % in silver birch trees and 67 % in white birch trees. Moose damage caused no visible color defect and/or decay in 35 % of silver birch and 33 % of white birch trees. The commercial quality and value of birch trees damaged by moose was reduced by the internal color defects and/or decay, even in certain trees without obvious external moose damage.
