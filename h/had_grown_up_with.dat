5|$|Malaria was endemic in the marshlands {{of eastern}} Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army {{suffered}} greatly from the disease; he estimated during the surrender {{that half of}} his army was unable to fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to the disease. As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.|$|E

5|$|Their {{motives for}} {{escaping}} evolved over time. Those who fled {{in the years}} shortly after the Wall was built had experienced the formerly open border first-hand and often had relatives in the West or had traveled there. By contrast, later escapees <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the closed border, desired greater freedom and were dissatisfied with conditions in East Germany. Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of a request to emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the state authorities and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} First Aliyah in 1881, Jews began immigrating {{to the area}} from Eastern Europe in larger numbers, {{particularly}} from Poland and Russia. These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with,</b> and adapt by using local produce, especially vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant, artichoke and chickpeas. The first Hebrew cookbook, written by Erna Meyer, and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking. The bread, olives, cheese and raw vegetables they adopted {{became the basis for}} the kibbutz breakfast, which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels, and in various forms in most Israeli homes today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{the court was}} central to the {{patronage}} and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. Lavish court display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from into an ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule, Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that she <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. Under James VI, the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated {{the image of a}} philosopher king.|$|E

5|$|Some bootleggers noticed rock {{fans that}} <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{the music in}} the 1960s wanted rare or {{unreleased}} recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become the Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{the court was}} central to the {{patronage}} and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry, which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. Tournaments provided one focus of display and were also pursued enthusiastically by James V, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that she <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity. Under James VI the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated {{the image of a}} philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine. After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue.|$|E

25|$|Research {{with and}} caring for infant rhesus monkeys further {{inspired}} Harlow, and ultimately led {{to some of his}} best-known experiments: the use of surrogate mothers. Although Harlow, his students, contemporaries, and associates soon learned how to care for the physical needs of their infant monkeys, the nursery-reared infants remained very different from their mother-reared peers. Psychologically speaking, these infants were slightly strange: they were reclusive, had definite social deficits, and clung to their cloth diapers. For instance, babies that <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> only a mother and no playmates showed signs of fear or aggressiveness.|$|E
25|$|A fresh {{appreciation}} of the library began to emerge as the Council declared their intention to demolish it. The movement was led by artists and writers mainly of the 1960s generation who <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> it. Jonathan Meades appreciated the ‘guts and attack’ of the library and spoke negatively of the Council’s policies stating “you don’t get a car and never get it serviced”. Brutalist architecture was becoming more appreciated in the 21st Century with the listing of Preston bus station, Trellick Tower and the rejuvenation of Park Hill in Sheffield. Books celebrating brutalism were published and television shows featuring brutalist buildings began to feature with greater regularity. Central library {{was chosen as the}} location of MI5 HQ in BBC series The Game.|$|E
25|$|Although {{widely known}} for its {{analogue}} technology, SSL {{was one of the}} digital audio pioneers and put together an impressive team of digital engineers under the leadership of Peter Eastty. The team defected en masse to become Oxford Digital (subsequently Sony Oxford) and SSL had to start over. Recognising the importance of digital interface standardisation {{to the future of the}} industry, SSL partnered with Sony and Studer to develop the now widespread MADI (Multichannel Audio Digital Interface) protocol. The new team, led by Phil Hill, developed an eight channel editor, ScreenSound, followed by workstations, Scenaria and OmniMix; all targeted at the post-production market. This technology formed the basis of SSL 'A Series' consoles starting with Axiom and followed by Aysis, Avant, Aysis Air and Axiom MT. These consoles offered knob per function type control surfaces that were familiar to a generation of engineers who <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> SSL's analogue consoles.|$|E

25|$|The {{first phase}} of postmodernity {{overlaps}} the end of modernity and is regarded by many as {{being part of the}} modern period (see lumpers/splitters, periodization). Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the baby boom generation, which <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the Algerian War and the Vietnam War, to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to divorce, increased use of marijuana and psychedelics, the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including rock music and the ubiquity of stereo, television and radio helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of Marshall McLuhan, a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a media culture and argued that participation in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.|$|E

While those films {{were described as}} [...] "goofy" [...] and primitive {{by members of the}} cast and crew, Raimi eventually produced the short film It's Murder!, which featured mostly comedic moments.
