25|$|The Bee, {{registered}} G-AEWC, first flew on 3 April 1937 at Heston Aerodrome, piloted by Hubert Broad.

This was the Bee's only flight; before there was time to improve the cooling and handling, financial problems forced Carden-Baynes into Receivership in June 1937, and all development stopped. In November 1937, it was reported that production was on hold, until British engines became available. The Bee, its plans, and Carden-Baynes' design <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> aircraft were bought by the newly formed Scottish Aircraft Construction Co., but no more was heard of any of them apart from an uncertain report that the Bee was scrapped at Heston in 1939.|$|E

[...] A spectator at a ballet comments: [...] "it {{was easy to see}} that she was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men." [...] Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to [...] "waste" [...] more of some resource by trading it off <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> tail.

On Metacritic, {{the film has}} a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Ken Eisner (Variety) gave the film a positive review. The reviewer referred to the film as a [...] "truly shocking horror film" [...] that was [...] "made even more disturbing by its haunting beauty". Geoffrey Macnab, writing in Sight and Sound, referred to the film as a [...] "slow-burning but ultimately devastating horror pic" [...] and wrote that [...] "it's a virtuoso piece of film-making with much more subtlety and depth than Miike's other films". The Hollywood Reporter Frank Scheck described the film as [...] "one of the most audacious, iconoclastic horror films in recent years". Mark Schilling (The Japan Times) praised Shiina and Ishibashi's acting, but noted that [...] "among the film's few irritants is a smarmy, snarly bad guy turn by Renji Ishibashi as Asami's wheelchair-bound ballet instructor.
