5|$|While DNA {{contains}} <b>deoxyribose,</b> RNA contains ribose (in <b>deoxyribose</b> {{there is}} no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA {{because it is more}} prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or <b>deoxyribose</b> sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called <b>deoxyribose</b> and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
25|$|Radical {{damage to}} DNA can also occur through the {{interaction}} of DNA with certain natural products known as radiomimetic compounds, molecular compounds which affect DNA in similar ways to radiation exposure. Radiomimetic compounds induce double-strand breaks in DNA via highly specific, concerted free-radical attacks on the <b>deoxyribose</b> moieties in both strands of DNA.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{of these}} {{mechanisms}} explains ribavirin's effect on many DNA viruses, {{which is more}} of a mystery, especially given the complete inactivity of ribavirin's 2' <b>deoxyribose</b> analogue, which suggests that the drug functions only as an RNA nucleoside mimic, and never a DNA nucleoside mimic. Ribavirin 5'-monophosphate inhibits cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thereby depleting intracellular pools of GTP.|$|E
25|$|Monosaccharides can {{be linked}} {{together}} into what are called polysaccharides (or oligosaccharides) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, <b>deoxyribose,</b> a component of DNA, is {{a modified version of}} ribose; chitin is composed of repeating units of N-acetyl glucosamine, a nitrogen-containing form of glucose.|$|E
25|$|Ribose is an {{aldopentose}} (a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms) that, in its open chain form, has an aldehyde {{functional group}} at one end. In the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides, the carbon atoms are numbered from C1' (in the aldehyde group) to C5'. The <b>deoxyribose</b> derivative found in DNA differs from ribose {{by having a}} hydrogen atom {{in place of the}} hydroxyl group at C2'. This hydroxyl group performs a function in RNA splicing.|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates perform {{numerous}} {{roles in}} living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for {{the storage of}} energy (e.g. starch and glycogen) and as structural components (e.g. cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods). The 5-carbon monosaccharide ribose {{is an important component}} of coenzymes (e.g. ATP, FAD and NAD) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA. The related <b>deoxyribose</b> is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of DNA, the 1,4-didehydrobenzene diradical abstracts hydrogens from the <b>deoxyribose</b> sugar backbone, predominantly at the C-1’, C-4’ and C-5’ positions. Hydrogen abstraction causes radical formation at the reacted carbon. The carbon radical reacts with molecular oxygen, {{which leads to a}} strand break in the DNA through a variety of mechanisms. 1,4-Didehydrobenzene is able to position itself {{in such a way that}} it can abstract proximal hydrogens from both strands of DNA. This produces a double-strand break in the DNA, which can lead to cellular apoptosis if not repaired.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advances}} in molecular biology {{stemming from the}} discovery of the DNA double helix eventually led to ways to sequence genes. James Watson directed the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health. The ability to sequence and manipulate DNA is now central to the biotechnology industry and modern medicine. The austere beauty of the structure and the practical implications of the DNA double helix combined to make Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids; A Structure for <b>Deoxyribose</b> Nucleic Acid {{one of the most prominent}} biology articles of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|The enzymes transketolase, {{pyruvate}} dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are {{all important}} in carbohydrate metabolism. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase {{is a key}} player in the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars <b>deoxyribose</b> and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a major form of energy for the cell. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, while the reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and for myelin synthesis.|$|E
25|$|DNA usually {{exists as}} a {{double-stranded}} structure, with both strands coiled {{together to form}} the characteristic double-helix. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides. Nucleotides in DNA contain a <b>deoxyribose</b> sugar, a phosphate, and a nucleobase. The four types of nucleotide correspond to the four nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine and guanine are purine bases, while cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. These nucleotides form phosphodiester bonds, creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the nuclei bases pointing inward (i.e., toward the opposing strand). Nucleotides (bases) are matched between strands through hydrogen bonds to form base pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (stronger: three hydrogen bonds).|$|E
25|$|B12 is {{the most}} {{chemically}} complex of all the vitamins. The structure of B12 {{is based on a}} corrin ring, which is similar to the porphyrin ring found in heme, chlorophyll, and cytochrome. The central metal ion is cobalt. Four of the six coordination sites are provided by the corrin ring, and a fifth by a dimethylbenzimidazole group. The sixth coordination site, the center of reactivity, is variable, being a cyano group (–CN), a hydroxyl group (–OH), a methyl group (–CH3) or a 5′-deoxyadenosyl group (here the C5′ atom of the <b>deoxyribose</b> forms the covalent bond with cobalt), respectively, to yield the four B12 forms mentioned below. Historically, the covalent C-Co bond {{is one of the first}} examples of carbon-metal bonds to be discovered in biology. The hydrogenases and, by necessity, enzymes associated with cobalt utilization, involve metal-carbon bonds.|$|E
25|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid is a {{molecule}} that carries {{most of the}} genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins and complex carbohydrates, {{they are one of}} the three major types of macromolecule that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase—either cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), or thymine (T)—as well as a sugar called <b>deoxyribose</b> and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. According to base pairing rules (A with T, and C with G), hydrogen bonds bind the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037, and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 TtC (trillion tons of carbon).|$|E
500|$|Biopolymers of sugars {{are common}} in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar {{that is used by}} the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose (...) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose (...) [...] Monosaccharides may be further {{converted}} into structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and pectin for cell wall construction or into energy reserves in the form of storage polysaccharides such as starch or inulin. Starch, consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form of chemical energy stored by cells, and can be converted to other types of energy. Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by plants as a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest cellulose only to a very limited extent, though ruminants can do so with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their gut. DNA and RNA are built up of the monosaccharides <b>deoxyribose</b> and [...] ribose, respectively. <b>Deoxyribose</b> has the formula [...] and ribose the formula [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{expression}} of genes encoded in DNA begins by transcribing the gene into RNA, a {{second type of}} nucleic acid that {{is very similar to}} DNA, but whose monomers contain the sugar ribose rather than <b>deoxyribose.</b> RNA also contains the base uracil in place of thymine. RNA molecules are less stable than DNA and are typically single-stranded. Genes that encode proteins are composed of a series of three-nucleotide sequences called codons, which serve as the [...] "words" [...] in the genetic [...] "language". The genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids. The genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms.|$|E
500|$|Scientifically, sugar loosely {{refers to}} a number of carbohydrates, such as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or oligosaccharides. Monosaccharides are also called [...] "simple sugars," [...] the most {{important}} being glucose. Most monosaccharides have a formula that conforms to [...] with n between 3 and 7 (<b>deoxyribose</b> being an exception). Glucose has the molecular formula [...] The names of typical sugars end with -ose, as in [...] "glucose" [...] and [...] "fructose". Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of carbohydrates soluble in water. The acyclic mono- and disaccharides contain either aldehyde groups or ketone groups. These carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds with the resultant loss of a molecule of water (...) per bond.|$|E
2500|$|Hydroxyl {{radicals}} can {{attack the}} <b>deoxyribose</b> DNA backbone and bases, potentially causing {{a plethora of}} lesions that can be cytotoxic or mutagenic. Cells have developed complex and efficient repair mechanisms to fix the lesions. In the case of free radical attack on DNA, base-excision repair is the repair mechanism used. [...] Hydroxyl radical reactions with the <b>deoxyribose</b> sugar backbone are initiated by hydrogen abstraction from a <b>deoxyribose</b> carbon, and the predominant consequence is eventual strand breakage and base release. [...] The hydroxyl radical reacts with the various hydrogen atoms of the <b>deoxyribose</b> in the order 5′ H > 4′ H > 3′ H ≈ 2′ H ≈ 1′ H. This order of reactivity parallels the exposure to solvent of the <b>deoxyribose</b> hydrogens.|$|E
2500|$|The ribose β-D-ribofuranose forms {{part of the}} {{backbone}} of RNA. It is related to <b>deoxyribose,</b> which is found in DNA. [...] Phosphorylated derivatives of ribose such as ATP and NADH play central roles in metabolism. [...] cAMP and cGMP, formed from ATP and GTP, serve as secondary messengers in some signalling pathways.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of carbohydrate is a monosaccharide, which {{among other}} properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in {{a ratio of}} 1:2:1 (generalized formula CnH2nOn, where n is at least 3). Glucose [...] (C6H12O6) {{is one of the}} most important carbohydrates; others include fructose (C6H12O6), the sugar commonly associated with the sweet taste of fruits, and <b>deoxyribose</b> (C5H10O4).|$|E
2500|$|... "Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for <b>Deoxyribose</b> Nucleic Acid" [...] was {{the first}} article {{published}} to describe {{the discovery of the}} double helix structure of DNA, using X-ray diffraction and the mathematics of a helix transform. It was published by Francis Crick and James D. Watson in the scientific journal Nature on pages 737–738 of its 171st volume (dated 25 April 1953).|$|E
2500|$|Working in the 19th century, biochemists {{initially}} isolated DNA and RNA (mixed together) from cell nuclei. They {{were relatively}} quick {{to appreciate the}} polymeric nature of their [...] "nucleic acid" [...] isolates, but realized only later that nucleotides were of two types—one containing ribose and the other <b>deoxyribose.</b> It was this subsequent discovery {{that led to the}} identification and naming of DNA as a substance distinct from RNA.|$|E
2500|$|Formation of DNA (during cell division) {{requires}} nucleotides, {{molecules that}} are the building blocks for DNA. The purine bases (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidine bases (thymine and cytosine) are bound to <b>deoxyribose</b> and phosphate and incorporated as necessary. Normally, the nucleotides are synthetized de novo from amino acids and other precursors. A small part, however, is 'recycled' from degraded DNA of broken-down cells. This is termed the [...] "salvage pathway".|$|E
2500|$|A {{carbohydrate}} is {{a biological}} molecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water); in other words, with the empirical formula [...] (where m could {{be different from}} n). This formula holds true for monosaccharides. Some exceptions exist; for example, <b>deoxyribose,</b> a sugar component of DNA, has the empirical formula C5H10O4. Carbohydrates are technically hydrates of carbon; structurally it is more accurate to view them as polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones.|$|E
2500|$|DNA damage occurs very {{frequently}} and is generated {{from exposure to}} a variety of both exogenous and endogenous genotoxic sources. [...] One of these include ionizing radiation, such as γ radiation and X-rays, which ionize the <b>deoxyribose</b> groups in the DNA backbone and can induce DSBs. [...] Reactive oxygen species, ROS, such as superoxide (O2–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (HO•), and singlet oxygen (1O2), can also produce DSBs as a result of ionizing radiation as well as cellular metabolic processes that are naturally occurring. [...] DSBs can also be caused by the action of DNA polymerase while attempting to replicate DNA over a nick that was introduced as a result of DNA damage.|$|E
2500|$|One {{strand of}} the DNA, the {{template}} strand (or noncoding strand), {{is used as}} a template for RNA synthesis. [...] As transcription proceeds, RNA polymerase traverses the template strand and uses base pairing complementarity with the DNA template to create an RNA copy. [...] Although RNA polymerase traverses the template strand from 3' → 5', the coding (non-template) strand and newly formed RNA can also be used as reference points, so transcription can be described as occurring 5' → 3'. [...] This produces an RNA molecule from 5' → 3', an exact copy of the coding strand (except that thymines are replaced with uracils, and the nucleotides are composed of a ribose (5-carbon) sugar where DNA has <b>deoxyribose</b> (one fewer oxygen atom) in its sugar-phosphate backbone).|$|E
2500|$|DNA strands have a directionality, and the {{different}} ends of a single strand are called the [...] "3' (three-prime) end" [...] and the [...] "5' (five-prime) end". By convention, if the base sequence of a single strand of DNA is given, the left end of the sequence is the 5' end, while the right end of the sequence is the 3' end. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel with one being 5' to 3', and the opposite strand 3' to 5'. These terms refer to the carbon atom in <b>deoxyribose</b> to which the next phosphate in the chain attaches. Directionality has consequences in DNA synthesis, because DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only one direction by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand.|$|E
2500|$|The work of Kiwako Sakabe and Reiji Okazaki {{provided}} {{experimental evidence}} supporting {{the hypothesis that}} DNA replication is a discontinuous process. Previously, it was commonly accepted that replication was continuous in both the 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions. [...] 3' and 5' are specifically numbered carbons on the <b>deoxyribose</b> ring in nucleic acids, and refer to the orientation or directionality of a strand. [...] In 1967, the Okazakis and their colleagues suggested {{that there is no}} found mechanism that showed continuous replication in the 3' to 5' direction, only 5' to 3' using DNA polymerase, a replication enzyme. [...] The team hypothesized that if discontinuous replication was used, short strands of DNA, synthesized at the replicating point, could be attached in the 5' to 3' direction to the older strand.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the {{handwritten}} correspondence from Franklin to Watson, located in the archives at CSHL, reveals that the two scientists later had exchanges of constructive scientific correspondence. In fact, Franklin consulted with Watson on her tobacco mosaic virus RNA research. Franklin's letters begin on friendly terms with [...] "Dear Jim", and conclude with equally benevolent and respectful sentiments such as [...] "Best Wishes, Yours, Rosalind". Each of the scientists published their own unique contributions {{to the discovery of}} the structure of DNA in separate articles, and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of Nature. These classic molecular biology papers are identified as: Watson J.D. and Crick F.H.C.

2500|$|Aminoallyl {{nucleotide}} is a nucleotide with {{a modified}} base containing an allylamine. They {{are used in}} post-labeling of nucleic acids by fluorescence detection in microarray. They are reactive with N-Hydroxysuccinimide ester group which helps attach a fluorescent dye to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-aminoallyl)-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring of uracil or cytosine. The primary amine group in the aminoallyl moiety is aliphatic and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings (aromatic) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl nucleosides are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated {{with or without the}} lowercase [...] "d" [...] indicating <b>deoxyribose</b> if included or ribose if not. Finally the nitrogenous base and number of phosphates are indicated (i.e. aa-UTP = aminoallyl uridine triphosphate).|$|E
2500|$|An old {{standing}} dynamic {{problem is}} how DNA [...] "self-replication" [...] {{takes place in}} living cells that should involve transient uncoiling of supercoiled DNA fibers. Although DNA consists of relatively rigid, very large elongated biopolymer molecules called fibers or chains (that are made of repeating nucleotide units of four basic types, attached to <b>deoxyribose</b> and phosphate groups), its molecular structure in vivo undergoes dynamic configuration changes that involve dynamically attached water molecules and ions. Supercoiling, packing with histones in chromosome structures, and other such supramolecular aspects also involve [...] in vivo DNA topology which is even more complex than DNA molecular geometry, thus turning molecular modeling of DNA into an especially challenging problem for both molecular biologists and biotechnologists. Like other large molecules and biopolymers, DNA often exists in multiple stable geometries (that is, it exhibits conformational isomerism) and configurational, quantum states which are {{close to each other}} in energy on the potential energy surface of the DNA molecule.|$|E
2500|$|Monosaccharides [...] are {{the major}} source of fuel for metabolism, being used both as an energy source (glucose being the most {{important}} in nature) and in biosynthesis. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often polysaccharides. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is glycogen, especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, starch is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, cellulose, is a structural component of the cell wall of plants and many forms of algae. Ribose is a component of RNA. <b>Deoxyribose</b> is a component of DNA. Lyxose is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart. Ribulose and xylulose occur in the pentose phosphate pathway. Galactose, a component of milk sugar lactose, is found in galactolipids in plant cell membranes and in glycoproteins in many tissues. Mannose occurs in human metabolism, especially in the glycosylation of certain proteins. Fructose, or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during digestion, and found in semen. Trehalose, a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight.|$|E
2500|$|All five of {{the bases}} found in DNA and RNA are {{aromatic}} [...] adenine and guanine (purine core structures), and cytosine, thyamine, and uracil (pyrimidine core structures). [...] Biologically active substances including caffeine and uric acid (responsible for gout) also possess purine structures. [...] DNA and RNA have [...] polymeric structures with repeating nucleotide units, each possessing a phosphate group, a ribose or <b>deoxyribose</b> sugar, and a nucleobase. [...] Nucleobases are Watson-Crick base paired through hydrogen bonding, and these pairs are stacked {{through the center of}} the double helix through π-π interactions of their aromatic systems. [...] The possibility for extended planar aromatic systems such as acridine (dibenzopyridine) to insert between base pairs was recognised by Lerman in a process now known as intercalation. [...] Intercalating agents have applications in biochemical research as stains (ethidium bromide) and in medicine as chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin). [...] Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzopyrenes and dibenzanthracene are some of the 43 known carcinogens in tobacco smoke (the Environment Protection Agency classes tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen). Benzopyrene has been shown to form preferentially in lung cancer hotspots and is known to be transformed into a metabolite, (+)-Benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, which forms mutagenic adduct with DNA. [...] The epoxide and group on the metabolite alkylate the N2 of guanine bases while the pyrene system intercalates between base pairs, disrupting the structure. [...] Intercalation interferes with DNA replication which can inhibit tumour growth but can also cause changes in the base pair sequence which explains its potential for carcinogeneity.|$|E
