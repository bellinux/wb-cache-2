The model {{suggests that there}} are five <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> quality dimensions that should be considered when assessing the quality <b>of</b> <b>information</b> provided by e-government for citizens. These five <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> quality dimensions are: Availability, Objectivity, Utility, Integrity, and Confidentiality. Nineteen Thai ministry websites were surveyed based on the proposed e-government information quality model. It was found that the availability and confidentiality <b>of</b> <b>information</b> seem to get lower attention from Thai ministries, this might make citizens feel less confident in e-government...|$|R

However, in order to provide access to the necessary information for organizations investments in technology are not enough: they must invest in the information infrastructure.

In the case of Major Events, such as the Football World Cup or the Olympic Games, the thematic <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> every <b>information</b> may be overwhelming. The theme switching caused by information associated with a different thematic group may be modelled as an interruption in multitasking set-ups. Thus, automate the thematic <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> may facilitate the decision making process by reducing the theme switching for a decision maker when he reads a set of messages. It was used clustering techniques with multi-criteria to group the messages in themes. These criteria were implemented as configurable operators. To achieve a better comprehension of those parameters, we introduced the concepts of Thematic strength (TS) and Thematic Density (TD). The evaluation of the strategy was made over a set of operational messages available in the Pacificador system during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. ...|$|R
