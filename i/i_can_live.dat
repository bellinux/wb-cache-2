500|$|Despite the {{problems}} during production, the album remained Wright's favourite: [...] "It's an album I {{can listen to}} for pleasure, and there aren't many Floyd albums that I can." [...] Gilmour shares this view: [...] "I for {{one would have to}} say that it is my favourite album, the Wish You Were Here album. [...] The end result of all that, whatever it was, definitely has left me an album <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> with very very happily. [...] I like it very much." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was {{getting in the way of}} his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a couple of years before that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E

During videotaped testimony submitted to the grand jury in December 2004, Joan testified about her family, but did not identify her son as an attacker. Nine months later, she wrote a letter for publication in the Albany Times Union about Christopher: [...] "I implore the Bethlehem Police and the District Attorney's Office to leave my son alone, and to search for Peter's real killer or killers, so that he can rest in peace and my sons and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> in safety." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share in the Burden {{threatened}} {{to boycott the}} fashion chain Fox if they hired Refaeli. The two sides reached a compromise in which Refaeli agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers whenever she is in Israel, and actively encourage enlistment in the army. Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army." [...] She also said: [...] "Israel or Uganda, what difference does it make? It makes no difference to me. Why is it good to die for our country? What, isn't it better to live in New York?

Lucas credited him with inspiring cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to achieving completion of the filming. Guinness was quoted as saying that the royalties he obtained from working on the films gave him [...] "no complaints; let me leave it by saying <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> {{for the rest of my}} life in the reasonably modest way I am now used to, that I have no debts and I can afford to refuse work that doesn't appeal to me."

I was looking at them through my tears. Coming from our part of the world, you don't see that." [...] The younger Qupty observed that [...] "people were amazed all the time" [...] that he – a Palestinian – and a Jew could coexist, and Shapira Bar-Or said: [...] "It shows how simple the situation is.
