5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>future.</b> As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E

40|$|As an {{architect}} with the London County Council (LCC), a newspaper columnist, friend {{of artists and}} an incipient collector, Colin St John Wilson is a fascinating figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interacting circles of 1950 s London. It was Wilson’s sketch-plan that ordered the ‘market-stalls’ of the This is Tomorrow exhibition and – <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opinion of Theo Crosby – the display he created with architect Peter Carter, engineer Frank Newby and sculptor Robert Adams most closely achieved the exhibition’s original aim of an anonymous synthesis of <b>the</b> arts. <b>In</b> this article, <b>the</b> author interprets Wilson’s life, work and theory as both critique and commentary in an examination of three pertinent issues within the Independent Group: the possibilities of artistic collaboration <b>in</b> architecture; <b>the</b> creative tension <b>in</b> architecture between science/technology and art/humanism; {{and the potential for}} a deeper psychologising of space – linked to psychoanalytical debates of the time. Interrogating these concerns is of importance, the author proposes, as they were so central to the discourses and form-making of architecture both at <b>the</b> time and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>futures</b> of <b>the</b> 1960 s, the 1970 s and afterwards...|$|R

The company stated that it needed NOK500,000 annually in support from the state and Norway Post for the service. In 1933, the brothers Viggo Widerøe and Arild Widerøe—who would found Widerøe in 1934—also applied for routes in the same areas, but using sea planes on the route from Oslo via Kristiansand and Stavanger to Haugesund. Also Norske Luftruter applied, but a three-year concession was granted to Widerøe.
