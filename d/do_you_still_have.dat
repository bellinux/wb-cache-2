In case you don’t know, I’ve {{been in the}} army since May 7, when I left for Fort Devens. After being there for 18 days, I was shipped down here, where I’m in the infantry. Yes, it {{is a far cry}} from Bryant and I {{certainly}} miss Bryant. I was in the Senior Accountancy and Finance class when I was inducted. How are things going at Bryant? I suppose that they haven’t changed much, if any. I heard that the senior classes are being completed June 30. What other news is there? Are the draftees going very fast now? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> assemblies about once a month? I am now in my basic training of 13 weeks. This is my fifth week. There are a scattered few down here from Providence and others from Massachusetts, but the great majority of the trainees (privates) here are from Pennsylvania. I hope to hear from the letter-writing committee soon. So long, James J. Connery, Jr. [Transcription ends...|$|E

T. this afternoon. My arm is getting numb now, so it doesn’t hurt anymore. Well I got some news about the {{graduation}} today. The Cadet Corps Commdr. Is trying to have it held on the flight line outside. That would be swell. They’re also trying have some planes in it too. There’s a regulation that says that no cadets can take part in a flying show or exhibition, but maybe we can swing it and get underclass to fly over in formation. I hope so. The dance {{is going to be the}} 10 th Saturday night, honey. So you’ll be here for it. What dress are you going to being down? I’ll bet you haven’t got half enough room in that luggage. I’ve got two pairs of pink pants (en. Officer’s pinks) and a couple of poplin shirts in my B- 4 bag and it’s already filled up. I got my blouse today, and a pair of tailored green slax. That blouse fits like a glove, it was tailor-made. Gosh I can hardly wait to wear it. We’re all like a bunch of kids on the night before Christmas. Oh I got Charlotte a date with D. A. Clark, my roommate. He’s a sharp looking article. About 6 feet and 180 pounds. Think she’ll like him? There’s no other news darling, except that I love you, 24 times more than I did last night because I love you more ever hour that we’re apart my darling. Only 18 more days after today baby. It seems like I haven’t seen you in centuries, not weeks. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> those beautiful blue eyes, that wonderful smile, that cute way you throw your head when you’re happy?

40|$|A {{year before}} the 1997 handover, I read with {{amusement}} an article in an entertainment magazine describing the political attitudes {{of the people of}} Hong Kong [...] not so much concerning the humdrum row between China and Great Britain over the pace of democratization, or the turnout in every year 2 ̆ 7 s June Fourth night vigil, but the rather extraordinary Hong Kong reaction to the issues of political correctness that have recently had a high degree of sensitivity in the West. According to the writer, people in Hong Kong drink too much, stay out too late, are mean to helpless animals, use racial slurs in polite conversation, and worst of all, have no sense of shame. The columnist 2 ̆ 7 s amazed evaluation of Hong Kong is captured in the headline: 2 ̆ 2 Not PC... and Proud. 2 ̆ 2 Yes, social attitudes in Hong Kong have always been characterized by their impertinent conceit, saucy flippancy, and irresponsible frivolity [...] the very political incorrectness the author tries to portray. However, things are going to change. With the hustle and bustle of the handover becoming an event of the past, I, like many people traveling from Hong Kong, have often been asked the same questions: What is Hong Kong like now? Is there any change? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> freedom of speech? Is there any state control in the universities or censorship in the mass media? The answer I always give to these well-intended questions is, There is nothing noticeable on the surface [...] except that the TV and radio news (wo) men no longer call Jiang Zemin the Chinese president but, directly and with an odd effect, President Jiang. Small but significant, this apparently Hong Kong/Chinese style of political correctness in newspeak can be discerned in any updated reportage of post- 1997 Hong Kong. If it does not exactly answer the usual questions coming from ingenuous presumptions about political control, or satisfy curiosity about the Chinese Communist Party 2 ̆ 7 s (CCP) alleged rabbit in the hat, it can at least provide clues about local politics operating on a more mundane, discursive, and everyday level. Blessed is the fact that, unlike their colleagues in the mainland 2 ̆ 7 s CCTV, our journalists still do not have to substitute China, whenever the word appears, with my country (woguo). It is also true that the more cozy ways of addressing our national leaders are presumably not the result of Beijing 2 ̆ 7 s dictates. Yet they are just as politically correct as titling every woman Ms. One is less likely to understand a distant place through communicative dialogue or interaction with local people than through media images, which are usually derived from a fixed set of stereotypes, or gatekeeper concepts. In the case of Hong Kong, it is quite certain that the city, {{were it not for the}} 1997 handover, would not command the same level of interest from international journalists or cultural critics. For some, who really are worried about the threat of communist sinicization of this international city, attention from international media is taken somewhat as a lifeline. Their politics, then, is almost solely concentrated on how to generate portrayals of the city that will continue to gain sympathy from the international community for the course of politically correct freedom and democracy in Hong Kong. Internationally renowned and well-intentioned cultural critics, who also see the importance of struggles on the discursive level, mean well, too, in their efforts to claim for Hong Kong a voice in the Western academies, an arena in which they work. To uphold the ideal of political progressiveness of cultural criticism, they have spared no effort in drawing international attention to Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s future, advocating once again the importance of freedom and democracy for the local residents...|$|E

You threw yourself into the first adventure that came your way, rescued a lovely damsel in distress, and her gratitude and that of her father attracted the king's notice, and gained that ring on your finger. In the next place, after escaping from the ruffians who attacked the coach--principally, as it seems, by cutting down their leader, and so occupying the attention of his followers--you instantly took the resolution to attempt to rescue him and his daughter, and succeeded in doing so. Another man might have stopped at Moulins, congratulating himself that he had escaped from the trap, and lamenting that he could do nothing towards again rescuing this damsel from her abductors.
