This {{study also examined whether}} demographic variables influenced <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 decisions to use multimedia in training (these were 11 independent variables, including age, education level, ethnic background, hotel experience, hotel managerial experience, <b>hotel</b> training <b>manager</b> experience, geographic location, size, hotel type, room occupancy, and ownership). This study also investigated whether Ajzen and Fishbeins 2 ̆ 7 (1980) Theory of Reasoned Action applied to <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 decisions to implement multimedia in hotel training. ^ The sample was 229 <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> from <b>hotels</b> located in three regions: Asian cities, the Pacific Islands, and the Micronesian Islands. Data were collected using a 47 items, cross sectional, descriptive survey modified from Huang (1993) and Van Hoof (1995).

40|$|Hotel {{companies}} have developed and implemented green activities mainly in three areas: energy management, water conservation, and waste management. A variety of influential drivers of green initiatives have been addressed, including cost savings, corporate social responsibility, and market demand. With growing consumer demand for green initiatives, {{it is important}} to examine whether hotel companies position green messages to those consumers. Researchers attempted to answer the four main questions including: 1) Do hotel companies actively communicate green messages to consumers? 2) Do <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> believe that green activities are effective in their hotels? 3) Do <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> believe that consumers are aware of their green activities? And 4) Do <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> believe that green activities influence consumers 2 ̆ 7 purchase behavior? To answer those questions, a framework of hotel 2 ̆ 7 s projected green image was proposed based on Beerli and Martin 2 ̆ 7 s conceptual model of destination image formation. In the present study, website content analysis of ten hotel companies illustrated that limited green messages are presented. Additionally, questionnaires were distributed to <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> to understand their perceptions of green messages, green activities as well as projected green image.

Poirot introduces himself to Schwartz as Monsieur Poirier, a silk merchant from Lyon. The next morning, when delivering coffee to his room, Gustave tells Poirot that in fact he is M.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to identify the perceptions and stereotypical views of <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> to older employees in the British hotel industry, {{with a focus on}} the north of England, and to determine the equal opportunities policies and practices of hotels in relation to older workers and the types of jobs deemed suitable or not suitable for older employees. Design/methodology/approach – The method used in this exploratory study was a survey incorporating a postal questionnaire. The questionnaire was sent to 144 <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> in <b>hotels</b> with a minimum of 20 bedrooms in the north of England. In all, 36 completed questionnaires were returned. Data were analysed using Predictive Analytics Software (PASW). Findings – The results of the survey clearly point to <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> having overwhelmingly positive views of older workers (confirming the findings of Magd's, 2003 survey), although some managers did age-stereotype certain jobs as being not suitable or suitable for older hotel workers. Research limitations/implications – The principal limitations concern the use of a questionnaire to measure the attitudes of <b>hotel</b> <b>managers,</b> the use of a non-probability sampling technique and the relatively small sample size. Practical implications – Given the UK's ageing population and labour shortages in the hotel industry, it is important that <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> address negative stereotypical views of older workers and the jobs deemed suitable for these workers.

40|$|Purpose – This {{study has}} a twofold purpose: to {{identify}} the competitive strategies and advantages of hotels located {{in the province of}} Alicante (Spain); and to inform <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> about how some key strategic variables (size, type of hotel management, category and competitive advantage) impact on hotel performance. Design/methodology approach – A study of the population was carried out using a questionnaire addressed to <b>hotel</b> <b>managers.</b> A principal components factor analysis was performed to identify business strategies. In addition, hotels were grouped together according to the key strategic variables and the degree of development of the different business strategies implemented. Findings – A comparative study of the performance levels achieved by each strategic group was carried out for the purpose of checking whether any of them produced significantly higher performance levels. In the light of the results, if hotels are to achieve higher performance levels, they should preferably be medium or large sized, belong to a chain, increase their category and base their competitive strategy on improvement and dimension. Practical implications – Strategic groups simplify the complex strategic reality in which <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> develop their professional activity. Thanks to the creation of these groups, managers acquire an aggregate knowledge of the business strategies and advantages of the hotels operating around their establishments and can equally be aware of the performance levels reached in each group analysed. This information also allows <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> {{to identify the}} strategic variables which must be developed to avoid being left behind inside their group in competitive terms or to join a different group which they may eventually consider more interesting in terms of strategy or performance.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to explore}} the human {{resource}} (HR) challenges faced by <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> in Langkawi due {{to the implementation of}} the minimum wage order (MWO). Design/methodology/approach This study collected qualitative data from 18 managers and two owners from 19 hotels of various sizes and levels of service, including budget and boutique resorts on Langkawi Island, Malaysia. A semi-structured interview was used to ask the question “What are the challenges faced by <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> due to the implementation of an MWO?” Findings: The challenges faced by the managers are: low employee productivity levels, many employees with a salary below the minimum wage rate, difficulty paying staff because of low revenue and conflicting laws and guidelines relating to the issues related to the service charge. Research limitations/implications: This study provides an initial qualitative exploration of an important current legal development bearing on <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> in Malaysia. It provides some initial findings from Langkawi, but the findings may not represent the attitudes of <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> in other parts of Malaysia. Practical implications: This study contributes to HR management literature by providing an insight into challenges faced by <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> in a developing country. To the managers, the MWO guideline is a serious challenge, as some of their employees are not productive enough to be paid at the minimum wage rate. To address the increasing labour cost, some have turned to the employment of foreign workers, whereas others have increased their casual employee numbers. These insights may serve to guide policy-makers and <b>hotel</b> <b>managers</b> in other developing countries that are planning to introduce an MWO. Social implications: For the MWO to be effective, it is crucial for the government to develop effective guidelines for its implementation and for hotel employees amongst the Langkawi community to increase their level of productivity. Originality/value: The Malaysian MWO policy was introduced in 2012. The policy affects employees’ remuneration and provides a challenge in implementation for the Malaysian hotel industry, especially in Langkawi. Although many studies on MWO implementation have focused on unemployment, this study provides the managers’ perspective on the challenges faced due to the implementation of this policy and identifies reasons why the unemployment rate for local workers may increase after the implementation of an MWO...|$|R
