The lifting {{platform}} connecting <b>hinge</b> <b>shaft</b> {{finite element analysis}} by ANSYS software, and the fork arm {{is connected to the}} hinge bearing contact surface using spring element, the spring element contact stress situation to determine the hinge bearing and internal and external fork arm, solves the contact with the fork arm of the <b>hinge</b> <b>shaft</b> stress relationship problems, finite element analysis. The model is more accurate. The analysis of ideas can be widely applied to the similar finite element contact analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Various {{uncertain}} factors {{affect the}} movement of the welding robot, thus welding gun tend to deviate from the theory of welding position which reduces the welding accuracy, of which the revolute pair clearance have an greater effect on {{the movement of}} the welding robot. In order to study the influence of revolute pair clearance to the end pose accuracy of welding robot, the mathematical model of revolute pair clearance was established, and the software SolidWorks was used for establishing the welding robot model, making simulations of the mechanical arm with joint clearance and no joint clearance. At last, the movement characteristic of the <b>hinge</b> <b>shaft</b> is attained. The simulation results showed that the shaft velocity and displacement of mechanical arm with joint clearance has a certain degree of fluctuation, which affecting the end pose accuracy of welding robot, and reducing the movement stability and the welding accuracy of welding robot...|$|E
50|$|For four-wheeled {{vehicles}} with independently <b>hinged</b> <b>shafts,</b> the tugs (Tilbury tugs) are leather straps buckled tightly around the shafts so they {{move with the}} animal.|$|R
50|$|A pin is {{a device}} used for {{fastening}} objects or material together. Pins often have two components: a long body and sharp tip made of steel, or occasionally copper or brass, {{and a larger}} head often made of plastic. The sharpened body penetrates the material, while the larger head provides a driving surface. It is formed by drawing out a thin wire, sharpening the tip, and adding a head. Nails are related, but are typically larger. In machines and engineering, pins are commonly used as pivots, <b>hinges,</b> <b>shafts,</b> jigs, and fixtures to locate or hold parts.|$|R
50|$|The saddle {{is held in}} {{position}} by a girth strapped firmly around the heartgirth area of the horse. When traces are used, a back band runs through the saddle, joining at the sides to a loose strap under the belly, the 'belly band'; both attach to loops around the shafts or to a pole. The back band may be fixed {{or it may be}} free to slide through the saddle from side to side; it is normally fixed for a four-wheeled vehicle with independently <b>hinged</b> <b>shafts,</b> but sliding for a vehicle with rigid shafts (such as a two-wheeled cart). This allows the horse to twist in the shafts on a side-slope.|$|R
25|$|Icing {{may prevent}} a warship from {{conducting}} {{any type of}} offensive operations, including restraining the doors of a vertical launch systems, binding gears, <b>shafts,</b> <b>hinges</b> and pedestals. Other effects include sluggish performance of lubricants, increased failure rate of seals, plugs and O-rings, frozen magazine sprinkler systems, excessively long warm-up times for electronics or weapon system electronics, and freeze up of compressed-air-operated components.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} move the vehicle, the {{rotating}} force generated in the motor by increasing the required amount depending on the front or rear-wheel drive must be transmitted to the wheels. Vehicle movement {{in all of these}} systems enables the transmission Powertrain is called. In motor vehicle driveline clutch mechanism with the mechanical movement as energy, gear boxes, <b>hinge</b> mechanisms, <b>shafts,</b> differential, axle systems with wheels are expressed transmitting system. Powertrain for working under severe conditions some damage and malfunction may occur. Power of the most important parts in the driveline is one of the differential gear. In this study; BMC 935 trucks belonging to the spider and the spider shaft of the differential gear box damage were investigated. According to information received from the service, which is 138, 000 miles spider, and the spider shaft broken, the damage has occurred. Differential gear unit and the shaft breaks the chemical composition spider, optical microscope, hardness and applying the failure analysis, the obtained results were evaluated in accordance with literature data...|$|R
40|$|Neglected or late {{presenting}} femoral neck stress fractures {{are often}} associated with varus deformity, with potential risks of nonunion and osteonecrosis. We proposed a surgical technique whereby a wedge osteotomy was performed at the basal part of the neck, on the tensile surface, keeping the inferomedial femoral neck as a <b>hinge.</b> The femoral <b>shaft</b> was abducted to close the osteotomy site and it was fixed with three cannulated cancellous screws. Three military recruits who presented with neglected femoral neck stress fracture with varus deformity were operated on with the proposed modified femoral neck valgus osteotomy. All the fractures united without any complications and the patients resumed their professional activity...|$|R
5000|$|Fixed back-band. In a four-wheeled vehicle, {{the shafts}} or pole {{must be allowed}} to hinge up and down, to allow the horse and vehicle to pass over {{hillocks}} and dips. Often the <b>shafts</b> are independently <b>hinged,</b> and on a side-slope these will each hinge to follow the horse, and a sliding back band is not needed. However, if a sliding back band was used with independent shafts it might allow one shaft to ride up higher than the other, and so for such shafts the back-band is normally fixed to the harness saddle. On other four-wheeled vehicles, the two <b>shafts</b> <b>hinge</b> together, and a sliding back band is needed as for two-wheeled vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|The A-4's four blade rotor {{was mounted}} {{at the top}} of a three legged pylon. [...] The two rear legs were based on the upper {{fuselage}} longerons and the forward on the upper central fuselage. They positioned the rotor hub directly over the wing centre line and [...] behind the centre of gravity. [...] The [...] rotor had blades with an aspect ratio of less than 14. [...] They were of mixed construction, with steel main spars, two wooden subsidiary spars and covered in a mixture of ply and fabric. Their section was the airfoil used by the Cierva C.19. The blades were wire braced from above from an extension of the rotor axis, which leaned forwards with respect to the aircraft's axis by 2°. [...] These wires were steel but contained rubber dampers. <b>Hinges</b> (double Cardan <b>shafts)</b> provided both upwards and in-plane movement, the latter damped by springs; normally such deflections were about ±7°.|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} {{of a typical}} shear connection with headed shear studs in a composite beam is analysed for the normal case in accordance with EN 1994 - 1 - 1. The reducing effect of a trapezoidal metal decking to the ultimate loadbearing capacity is considered with empirically derived reduction factors and equations that were developed between the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. The RFCS research project ”DISCCO“ investigated the shear stud resistance with novel types of steel decking. In many cases, the shear resistance predicted by EN 1994 - 1 - 1 was not reached in tests. In the respective experiments with composite beams and deep decking, a concrete cone failure mode was identified and not a pure shear failure of the stud. This failure mode acted {{in combination with the}} loadbearing capacity of the shear stud, which formed one or two plastic <b>hinges</b> in the <b>shaft</b> depending on the actual geometry. Based on these observations, new equations have been developed to predict the shear connection's resistance with more accuracy. The yield hinge mechanism of the shear stud, which was developed by Lungershausen, was extended by the aforementioned loadbearing component ”concrete cone“. The formulae consider the geometry of the stud and the steel decking and the material strength of the stud and the concrete. The statistical evaluation of the equations developed demonstrates good agreement with test results...|$|R
