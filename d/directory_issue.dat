40|$|Distributed, {{computer}} based communication is becoming established within many working environments. Furthermore, {{the near future}} is likely to see {{an increase in the}} scale, complexity and usage of telecommunications services and distributed applications. As a result, there is a critical need for a global Directory service to store and manage communication information and therefore support the emerging world-wide telecommunications environment. This thesis describes research into the design of distributed Directory services. It addresses a number of <b>Directory</b> <b>issues</b> ranging from the abstract structure of information to the concrete implementation of a prototype system. In particular, it examines a number of management related issues concerning the management of communication information and the management of the Directory service itself. The following work develops models describing different aspects of Directory services. These include data access control and data integrity control models concerning the abstract structure and management of information as well as knowledge management, distributed operation and replication models concerning the realisation of the Directory as a distributed system. In order to clarify the relationships between these models, a layered directory architecture is proposed. This architecture provides a framework for the discussion of <b>directory</b> <b>issues</b> and defines the overall structure of this thesis. This thesis also describes the implementation of a prototype Directory service, supported by software tools typical of those currently available within many environments. It should be noted that, although this thesis emphasises the design of abstract directory models, development of the prototype consumed a large amount of time and effort and prototyping activities accounted for a substantial portion of this research. Finally, this thesis reaches a number of conclusions which are applied to the emerging ISO/CCITT X. 500 standard for Directory services, resulting in possible input for the 1988 - 92 study period...|$|R

40|$|TEPSIS PAPERThe {{charities}} {{that developed}} in the major cities of the industrialized world throughout {{the nineteenth century and}} beyond are no longer considered as anecdotal by historiography. Charitable practices consolidated or redistributed the relationships between political forces, redefined the internal hierarchies of the privileged classes, were intended to stabilize social order and control urban working classes, were matrices for the reformist public policies that came to prevail later, and created a space where middle-class women could have access to public action. However, aside from biographies of certain leading figures or descriptions of institutions, there exists no sociography of charitable worlds. We have worked on a project aiming to produce a sociography of charities for several major cities around 1900, and have used as source material charity <b>directories</b> <b>issued</b> by " charity organizers " who intended to render charitable practices more " scientific " in their respective cities...|$|R

[...] In August 1901 the UIL reached nearly 100,000 members, when its <b>Directory</b> <b>issued</b> a resolution calling for active agitation throughout Ireland. O'Brien now {{at the height of his}} prestige, dominated the UIL machine and in a vigorous speech on 15 September called for “a great national strike against ranching and grabbing” as its winter program. What he wanted was boycotting and the filling of Irish jails.
