5000|$|In 1948 Postgate {{obtained}} a Research Fellowship at the Chemical Research Laboratory (CRL) in Teddington, West London, {{to investigate the}} biochemistry of the sulphate-reducing bacteria. A small microbiology group, led by K R Butlin, was researching their role in iron corrosion and other civil and <b>industrial</b> <b>nuisances.</b> The group also investigated and advised on diverse problems in economic microbiology which {{had been brought to}} the laboratory. The bacteria were known to be strict anaerobes which live by converting mineral sulphates to hydrogen sulphide. They are difficult to culture and to separate from other soil bacteria in the laboratory, but Butlin's group had isolated a few pure strains. Postgate managed to culture large populations of the organism and his experience of competition informed his first paper, in which he showed that selenates are powerful competitive inhibitors of sulphate reduction. [...] He went on to obtain biochemical evidence on how they consume sulphates and carbon sources, but his most influential finding was cytochrome C3., a discovery that has been described as [...] "seminal". Cytochromes are iron-containing proteins found in the cells of all air-breathing creatures from bacteria and plants to humans; they were known {{to be part of the}} aerobic respiratory apparatus and were widely understood to be absent from anaerobes. The appearance of a cytochrome, one which had an unusually large amount of iron, in a strict anaerobe conflicted with current theory. However soon it became accepted and the concept emerged of [...] "anaerobic respiration", based on reducing nitrate, carbonate or similar oxygen-containing minerals. Postgate's research formed the basis of worldwide research on these bacteria and their cytochromes, as well as the discovery of many new genera; sulphate reducers are now known to constitute a diverse biosphere of their own.|$|E
50|$|Several {{proposals}} {{have been made}} in recent years to strip mine remaining coal deposits near the surface in the Point Aconi area. However, this proposal has met with strong community opposition, citing fears of contamination and changes to groundwater supplies, as well as <b>industrial</b> <b>nuisance</b> through deteriorated air quality and noise which would lead to lower property values.|$|R
50|$|Case {{law in the}} UK and the US clearly held {{though the}} {{construction}} and operation of a gas-works was not {{the creation of a}} public nuisance in se, due to the reputation of gas-works as highly undesirable neighbors, and the noxious pollution known to issue from such, especially {{in the early days of}} manufactured gas, gas-works were on extremely short notice from the courts that (detectable) contamination outside of their grounds - especially in residential districts - would be severely frowned upon. Indeed, many actions for the abatement of nuisances brought before the courts did result in unfavorable verdicts for gas manufacturers - in one study on early environmental law, actions for nuisance involving gas-works resulted in findings for the plaintiffs 80% of the time, compared with an overall plaintiff victory rate of 28.5% in <b>industrial</b> <b>nuisance</b> cases.|$|R
50|$|Herbert Philips {{retained}} {{this commitment}} for clean air provision {{for the masses}} with his establishment of the permanent society, ‘The Committee for Securing Open Spaces for Recreation’ {{of which he was}} the Chairman and Treasurer. Likewise he founded the ‘Noxious Vapours Abatement Association’ to promote the control of chemical and <b>industrial</b> smoke <b>nuisances</b> in Manchester and Salford which proved so harmful to vegetation within these open spaces. He gave a member's address to the Manchester Statistical Society in 1896 entitled 'Open Spaces for Recreation in Manchester'.|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} land-use conflicts extract from the rulings of French Administrative Courts from 1981 to 2005. It focuses on Paris?s suburb, where the urbanisation process and the diversity of land-use require a deeper comprehension of the problem. Our {{results show that the}} land-use conflict?s evolution is correlated with the urbanisation process. They also detect a coupling phenomenon between conflict?s type and territory?s parameters : urbanism disputes often arise in wealthy municipalities, whereas oppositions to public infrastructure have particularly risen in strongly urbanising towns. Classified <b>industrial</b> facility?s <b>nuisances</b> have been found in unfortunate municipalities. land-use conflict, periurbanisation, litigation, Paris region...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of an {{individual}} alone cannot exhaustively explain all the causes of poor health, and neighborhood of residence have been suggested {{to be one of}} the factors that contribute to health. However, knowledge about aspects of the neighborhood that are most important to health is limited. The main objective of this study was to explore associations between certain features of neighborhood environment and self-rated health and depressive symptoms in Maastricht (The Netherlands). A large amount of routinely collected neighborhood data were aggregated by means of factor analysis to 18 characteristics of neighborhood social and physical environment. Associations between these characteristics and self-rated health and presence of depressive symptoms were further explored in multilevel logistic regression models adjusted for individual demographic and socio-economic factors. The study sample consisted of 9, 879 residents (mean age 55 years, 48 % male). Residents of unsafe communities were less likely to report good health (OR 0. 88 95 % CI 0. 80 - 0. 97) and depressive symptoms (OR 0. 81 95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 97), and less cohesive environment was related to worse self-rated health (OR 0. 81 95 % CI 0. 72 - 0. 92). Residents of neighborhoods with more car traffic nuisance and more disturbance from railway noise reported worse mental health (OR 0. 79 95 % CI 0. 68 - 0. 92 and 0. 85 95 % CI 0. 73 - 0. 99, respectively). We did not observe any association between health and quality of parking and shopping facilities, facilities for public or private transport, neighborhood aesthetics, green space, <b>industrial</b> <b>nuisance,</b> sewerage, neighbor nuisance or satisfaction with police performance. Our findings can be used to support development of integrated health policies targeting broader determinants of health. Improving safety, social cohesion and decreasing traffic nuisance in disadvantaged neighborhoods might be a promising way to improve the health of residents and reduce health inequalitie...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, a {{major problem}} {{throughout}} the world is air pollution caused mainly by the fast growth in industry. This growth leads to negative impacts on human health and ecosystems directly or indirectly by chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The gas emissions from industrial plants are a current problem especially on ecosystems close to these sources. These emissions from large industrial complexes have been an increasing concern around the world. Due to {{the rapid growth of}} urban areas and the increase in the standard of living, environmental problems in urban areas become particularly critical. Selecting the location of industrial areas has been the traditional way for a community to lower the impact of <b>industrial</b> <b>nuisance</b> such as noise, smoke, odor, dust, dirt, and noxious gases. This growth concern accentuates the need for additional studies of air dispersions and modeling. The main objective of this thesis is to assess the potential impacts associated with the emissions of toxic air contaminants from new industrial plants in order to select the best location based on human health risk assessment. Air dispersion models have been widely used to study the patterns of dispersion and air emissions behavior as well as to simulate the dispersion and transport of pollutants. In this work, AERMOD model, which is recommended by the U. S. EPA, has been used to estimate the gas emissions of all significant sources in an industrial complex (taken as a case study), as well as the pollutant concentrations and distributions in the industrial complex area. In addition, in order to quantitatively assess potential changes in health impacts due to the gas emissions, IRAP View model, which is based on the Human Health Risk Assessment Protocol (HHRAP) for hazardous waste combustion facilities published by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has been used to estimate the transport and fate of mercury from all proposed industrial plants in the area of concern. A case study that deals with locating a new industry in an existing complex was considered. Both environmental and health risks are considered {{in order to determine the}} best location for a new proposed plant. It is shown that considering both environmental impact as well as health risks leads to different best locations as compared to environmental impact alone...|$|R
40|$|Complaints {{associated}} with nuisance activity by Louisiana black bears (Ursus americanus luteolus) in south Louisiana have steadily increased since 2000, demanding intervention {{by state and}} federal agencies. As a federally threatened species, Louisiana black bears that are a nuisance require nonlethal management, referred to as aversive conditioning. We used rubber buckshot and dogs to test the effectiveness of management techniques used {{by the state of}} Louisiana to deter nuisance bear activity. We captured 11 bears in residential and <b>industrial</b> areas where <b>nuisance</b> bear activity was reported. We fitted bears with radiotransmitting collars and released them within 2 km of the capture site. We conditioned 5 bears using only rubber buckshot and 6 bears with rubber buckshot and dogs. Bears were monitored using telemetry to estimate movements and space use. All bears remained within 2 km of capture sites 2 weeks following release. Ten bears (91 %) returned to nuisance behavior within 5 months, regardless of treatment. Mean distance from capture sites did not differ between treatments. Our results suggest that aversive conditioning techniques used in Louisiana to deter bears from nuisance activity have limited short-term effectiveness, independent of practices addressing food source...|$|R
