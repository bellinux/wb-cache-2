A secondary {{objective of this}} study was to determine the durability of <b>exterior</b> <b>plywood</b> made with keruing (12 Dipterocarpus spp.). To reach these objectives I made plywood using three phenolic adhesives in a split-split plot design, varying assembly time (5, 20, 45 minutes) and species (16 Southeast Asian hardwoods) through four replications. Samples from these panels were subjected to vacuum/ pressure soak (PS 1 - 74); standard boil cycle (PS 1 - 74) for 2, 5, 10, and 25 cycles; automatic boil cycle (ASTM D 3434 - 75) for 20, 40, 100, and 200 cycles; weatherometer (ASTM G 23 - 69) for 2400 hours; and wet/dry cycling for 2400 hours. For these hardwoods, both the standard and automatic boil cycle aging methods were good discriminators of bond durability. The standard boil method required 10 or more cycles to assure that unsatisfactory bonds would be detected. The automatic boil method required 40 or more cycles. The vacuum/pressure, weatherometer and wet/dry cycle methods were poor discriminators of bond durability.

40|$|Soy flour is an {{inexpensive}} {{raw material for}} adhesives and is readily available {{in most parts of}} the world. However, converting soy flour into a wood adhesive that can compete in both cost and performance with existing petroleum-based adhesives is not easy given the variables of flour quality, denaturation conditions, and curing methods. Formulating adhesives that alter these variables is more readily accomplished than is testing the performance of these formulations using standard evaluation methods. To overcome this problem, we developed a rapid and reproducible small-scale bond strength testing procedure that allows us to screen new adhesives more efficiently. This procedure, employing the automated bond evaluation system (ABES) instrument, has led to improved soy adhesive formulations for plywood and other wood-bonding applications. Additionally, this procedure has been compared with standard product performance tests for decorative and <b>exterior</b> <b>plywood</b> using the common commercially available adhesives poly(vinyl acetate), urea-formaldehyde, melamine-urea-formaldehyde, and phenol-formaldehyde...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{aimed at}} finding some {{fast-setting}} glues for <b>exterior</b> <b>plywood</b> and particleboard based on diisocyanates {{in combination with}} compounds from renewable resources like tannins, proteins, and starches revelaed the following: The mechanical properties of particleboard bonded with unmodified tannin extracts from spruce (Picea abies) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) were inferior. The fortification of the tannin extracts with diisocyanate increased the bonding strength and reduced the thickness swelling. With one exception, particleboards bonded with nonemulsifiable diisocyanate modfied with glutin or maize starch (extender content up to 20 %) had exteriorgrade quality (German standard V 100 for flat-pressed boards). Veneer plywood, which is conditionally weatherproof (German standard AW), can be produced by applying diisocyanate together with tannins or starches. The veneer wood species, the glue mixtures, the pressing conditions, and the fillers have to be adjusted to the diisocyanat e type and the extender.

40|$|A {{prefabricated}} building was designed in 1965 by the Committee for Antarctic Buildings and built in 1966 at Syowa Station. This building is of box-frame structure, {{which can be}} easily assembled in short time for multi-purpose establishment in the Antarctic area, such as sleeping quarters, mess hut, laboratory, etc. Therefore, even expedition members without any experiences in such construction are able to put it together. With the said building, thickness of the panel and its weight are exceptionally much more {{than those of the}} standard type, since the building is expected to accommodate deep frozen food as a cold storage. Of course, there is no changes in basic design. The outline of this building for cold storage is as follows : [table] Each panel contains insulation material of 100 mm thick which is sandwiched by water-proof <b>plywood.</b> <b>Exterior</b> surface of the panel is covered with stainless steel sheet and in-terior is lined with vinyl resin coated steel sheet. This {{prefabricated building}} has the following features : 1. For the jointed part of each corner of the structure, the unique prefabricated Lshaped corner-wall is employed. Since it is manufactured under a standard size, other components of the establishment, such as roof, floor, and side-wall can also be standardized. Besides, such tightly fastened prefabricated corner completely eliminates the fundamental weakpoint that has been unavoidable so far withstanding shock and tortion. 2. As for the jointing method of two panels, a long sized bolt of 13 φ is tightly screwed across the both adjacent frames, thus the surface of the both frames being tightly put together each other. In this method, only the bolting at two points in a panel substitutes for the traditional connecting method that is less endurable against shock and tortion. 3. Each jointed surface of the panel is finished with foamed chloroprene rubber, so that the gaps at the jointed surface can be completely eliminated. This foamed rubber lining has another merit that the elasticity of the rubber makes the errors characteristic to the assembly of the customary prefabricated structure practically ignorable...|$|R
40|$|Soy-based {{adhesives}} {{have attracted}} much attention recently because they are environmentally safe, low cost, and readily available. To improve the gluability and water resistance of soy-based adhesives, we prepared an enzyme-treated soy-based adhesive modified with an epoxy resin. We investigated the wet shear strength of plywood bonded with the modified adhesive using the boiling-water test. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis were used to characterize the reaction between epoxy groups and –NH 2 groups in the modified soy-based adhesives. FTIR analysis confirmed the cross-linking structure in the cured adhesives. Viscosity and the solid content of soy-based adhesives gradually increased with the increasing amount of epoxy resin, but {{had little effect on}} its operability. Wet shear strength of plywood samples increased as the amount of epoxy resin was increased, whereas the inverse trend was observed regarding the water absorption of cured adhesives. Compared to an unmodified adhesive, the addition of 30 % of epoxy resin increased the wet shear strength of plywood samples by 58. 3 % (0. 95 MPa), meeting the requirement of the Chinese National Standard for <b>exterior</b> <b>plywood.</b> Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis showed the improved thermostability of the cured adhesives after curing at 160 °C. These results suggest that epoxy resin could effectively improve the performance of enzyme-treated soy-based adhesives, which might provide a new option for the preparation of soy-based adhesives with high gluability and water resistance...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Using Southeast Asian {{hardwood}} veneers for <b>exterior</b> <b>plywood</b> siding {{has caused}} problems because some species produced quality plywood while other species produced plywood which delaminated soon after {{being put in}} service in exterior exposure. This study attempted to improve the durability of glue bonds of some Southeast Asian hardwood veneers by treating the veneer surfaces prior to gluing with a phenolic adhesive that {{has the advantage of}} shorter press time in plywood production. The species selected were known to produce plywood panels having a range of bond durabilities for untreated veneer glued with this adhesive. Kapur (Dryobalanops aromatica) was chosen because it has consistently glued poorly. A low density Meranti (Shorea curtisii) having good gluability and a high density Balau (Shorea ochropholia) having poor gluability were selected. Also six Keruing species (Dipterocarpus spp.) having variable bond durabilities were included. The two treatments were planing the veneer surface arid extracting the veneer surface with a one percent caustic solution. A statistical analysis was performed on wood failure data from plywood shear tests using a split plot experimental design. The design factors were three treatments (planing, extraction, control), ten species including the Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] control, two phenolic adhesives (A and B), two assembly times (20 and 45 minutes), two test methods (vacuum-pressure and automatic boil) and four replications. A second phase of the study focused on anatomical observation of the veneer surfaces and plywood gluelines of treated and untreated veneer. Stereo light microscopy, incident fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used. Plywood made of untreated veneer using adhesive A produced the variable bond quality previously observed for these species, many being below the commercial standard. Planing the veneer surface prior to gluing was an effective treatment. All of the hardwood species producing unacceptable plywood bonds when made with untreated veneer produced plywood panels with acceptable bonds when made of planed veneer. Planing altered the veneer surface anatomically. The surface appeared smooth with cellular debris deposited in the vessel lumens. Planing appeared to produce veneer surfaces with larger amounts of intra-wall failures rather than cross-wall failures common for unplaned veneer surfaces. The plywood gluelines were of uniform thickness and appeared to cause an even adhesive distribution. Extracting the veneer surface with a caustic solution prior to gluing was not an effective treatment. The variable bond quality of the species was not eliminated. Extraction produced a darker colored veneer surface and it appeared that new extractives might have migrated to the surface following the extraction sequence...|$|E
