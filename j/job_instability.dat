50|$|For the French {{sociologist}} Louis Chauvel, due to {{demographic and}} economic history, {{the younger generation}} is in a specifically difficult situation.

Other problems include repetitive poorly paid internships, <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> and lower incomes, while the qualifications and skills required for vacancies are ever-increasing, requiring several more years of education and financial investment than for previous generations, while postponing savings and contributions to the retirement insurance system. Moreover, rental costs for housing and relatively lower incomes reduce the quality of housing conditions. These tensions are fuelling anti-government feeling and the strike itself.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{decompose}} {{the variance}} of logarithmic monthly earnings of prime age males into its permanent and transitory components, using a five-wave rotating panel from the Venezuelan "Encuesta de Hogares por Muestreo" from 1995 to 1997. As far as we know, {{this is the first}} time a variance components model is estimated for a developing country. We test several specifications and find that an error component model with individual random effects and first order serially correlated errors fits the data well. In the simplest model, around 22 % of earnings variance is explained by {{the variance of}} permanent component, 77 % by purely stochastic variation and the remaining 1 % by serial correlation. These results contrast with studies from industrial countries where the permanent component is predominant. The permanent component is usually interpreted as the results of productivity characteristics of individuals whereas the transitory component is due to stochastic perturbations such as <b>job</b> and/or price <b>instability,</b> among others. Our findings may be due to the timing of the panel when occurred precisely during macroeconomic turmoil resulting from a severe financial crisis.

Besides temporary work agencies, this unstable work is used more often by the industries in the services sector and less often by those in the manufacturing sector. Within firms, the share of unstable work in new contracts has been decreasing since 1996, having apparently been replaced by temporary work. Firms use this type of human resources management because of its flexibility. Moreover, the use of unstable work does not have the same meaning within service and manufacturing industries. In manufacturing industries, recently hired workers seem to occupy the same kinds of jobs, whether they will stay or not within the firm thereafter. In services industries, workers who occupy an unstable job (that will last less than one year) are more productive to the firms: their contribution to the production is higher than for recently hired stable workers.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{perception}} of <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> {{is an important}} measure of subjective wellbeing of individuals, because most people derive their income from selling their labour services. The study explores the determination of {{perception of}} <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> in Europe. The study {{is based on a}} large-scale survey from the year 1998. There are evidently large differences in the amount of perceived <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> from country to country. The lowest level of perceived <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> is in Denmark (9 %). In contrast, the highest level of perceived <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> is in Spain (63 %). Perceived <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> increases with age and an earlier unem-ployment episode. An increase in educational level, on the other hand, leads to a decline in the perception of <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> In addition, a temporary contract as such does not yield an additional increase to the perception of <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> The perception of <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> is more common within manufacturing industries and there is some evidence for the view that it increases according {{to the size of the}} firm. 1...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The main form of {{flexible}} employment in Spain is temporary contracts. In 1984, when a legal change {{was introduced to}} allow their use (in particular, the so-called temporary contract for employment promotion, TCEP) for any type of job, including the performance of permanent tasks, the ‘causality principle’ was broken (this legal principle states that the firm can only hire workers using open-ended contracts for permanent tasks and should use fixed-term contracts for temporary needs). This break was considered as transitory and exclusively justified by the poor economic outcomes of the Spanish labour market at that historical moment. However, it remained until 1994. Although the causality principle was formally restated, firms had learnt to use temporary contracts as an easy and swift way to adapt to business cycle changes and preferred to keep on using other forms of temporary contracts (as the per-task or the eventual contracts) when the TCEP was abolished, circumventing legal regulation modifications. The model of ‘flexibility at the margin’ hinged on a dual economic structure between jobs prone to stability and <b>jobs</b> prone to <b>instability.</b> The introduction and wide use of temporary contracts probably helped reinforce such structure, creating incentives for the segmentation of jobs, especially in large firms. Therefore, employers intensified the adaptation of their whole production process {{to the existence of}} a group of workers in low-paid, high-rotation jobs, hired through temporary contracts, while using open-ended contracts for high-paid, low-rotation jobs...|$|R

We have observations on the duration of a spell of unemployment for each of the individuals in the sample. In practice we {{are more likely to have}} censored duration data.

There are enormous variations in the duration of spells of unemployment from one individual to the next (from a few weeks to five years or more) and it is important to model the causes for these differences. In particular it is important to know how the re-employment probability changes over the period of the spell and what is the impact of the level of unemployment benefits on these probabilities.

40|$|The {{individual}} differences literature {{has suggested that}} age, generation and career stage are related {{to a range of}} individual and organisational outcomes. In an employment context that is becoming increasingly characterised by <b>instability,</b> <b>job</b> insecurity, and responsibility for one’s career, individual perceptions of employability and job insecurity are important concepts to explore. However, age, career stage and generation differences in perceptions of employability and job insecurity have received modest attention. The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore the relationships between age, generational identity and career stage and the impact that these factors had on perceptions of employability and job insecurity. Aside from the main focus of the present research, this study also aimed to develop a measure of generational identity, as previous research relied on generational measures derived from age that limited the inferences that could be drawn from such research. However, this measure needed more development in order to be used in the main study. Five hundred and nine participants from a range of organisations participated in the main study, completing an online questionnaire containing measures of career stage, perceptions of employability and perceptions of job insecurity. As expected, measures of age generation and career stage were interrelated, providing support for the empirical literature and highlighting the importance of longitudinal research designs in age research. In line with the literature, low perceptions of employability were related to increased perceptions of job insecurity. In particular, Baby Boomers were found to have higher perceptions of job insecurity, as a result of lower perceptions of employability. Generations X and Y were found to have higher perceptions of job insecurity through higher levels of overall career concern. This paper provides support for the relationship between perceptions of employability and job insecurity in the changing employment context. It offers a platform for further empirical research regarding generation differences at work, and further exploration of the concepts of career stage and concern with ones career. Practical implications and directions for further research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Russia experienced a series of economic shocks, resulting in large decreases in output but limited change in employment. Using information contained in a nationally representative longitudinal survey of Russian citizens, this research analyzes the labor market behavior of individuals from 1992 to 1996 during the transition to a market economy. Under Markovian assumptions, the pattern of transitions between labor market states is identified. Results indicate that the state sector has declined, but that the emerging private sector has played a limited role in alleviating growing unemployment. The probability of losing a job increased 75 percent from 1992 to 1996 while the re-employment probability declined by 24 percent, leading to an increase in long-term unemployment. Multinomial logit estimates demonstrate that workers with a personal ownership stake in their firm, the prevalence of which has more than tripled since 1992, are significantly less likely to lose their job or change to a new one. Men are more likely to make a transition to non-state employment, while women are more apt not only to move into the state sector, but also to remain in a state sector <b>job.</b> The relative <b>instability</b> of the private sector and self-employment, which are predominated by men and younger persons, is evident from higher flows into unemployment from these sectors. In contrast to the state sector, hiring in the private sector is primarily from the pool of employed individuals. The growing wage arrears crisis has not influenced labor market transitions, but the incidence of forced leaves is strongly and positively associated with dropping out of the labor force and changing jobs. Education has become a factor in exiting unemployment to a job. While there was no distinction by level of education in 1992 - 93, by 1995 - 96 individuals with higher, special secondary, or ordinary secondary education are more likely to find employment than those with primary education or less. University or graduate degrees carry the greatest weight, increasing the re-employment probability by 27. 5 percentage points. Higher and secondary education provided protection against job loss initially, but by 1996 only higher education provides a distinct advantage in maintaining employment. This result is suggestive of a divergence between education and skills acquired in the Soviet era and those demanded by the jobs of an emerging market economy.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis brief note {{presents}} {{some thoughts}} about the possible effects of the failure to renew the Andean Trade Preferences and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA); and its possible expiration this coming December 31. United States President, George W. Bush, asked his country's Congress to extend {{the validity of the}} trade preferences granted to the Andean countries under the ATPDEA. That news was welcomed and applauded by the Andean countries, which hailed this measure and promptly thanked the U. S. leader for his gesture. Even so, it is evident that there are Congressmen in the United States who do not back the bill to extend the ATPDEA. Considering this situation and the possible risk of the failure of President Bush's initiative and of the efforts made by the Andean Governments and the Secretariat of the Andean Community, 1 ECLAC, conscious of the pressing need for that extension, has prepared the following technical note to contribute {{to an understanding of the}} problem, pointing up the risks the countries would face if they were to lose the present conditions for their access to the Unites States market. Our intention is to voice a warning to the political bodies and business organizations of the United States, informing investors, businessmen, sector authorities, representatives of non governmental organizations, and multilateral international institutions about the grave risk the neighboring countries of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru run in the light of the uncertain trade situation of their businessmen, investors, exporters and, above all, labor force, whose destabilized jobs are now in serious jeopardy. The lines below explain the true importance of the ATPDEA regime for the four Andean countries and for the United States, in the areas of trade, welfare, employment, migration pressures, drug control efforts, energy security, regional political stability and contribution to the economic development to which the less favored countries of the region so aspire. The autonomy of the United States Congress in its political decision-making is not open to doubt. Even so, we deem it a legitimate concern to point up some elements that should not be overlooked in the debate, particularly because the possible consequences affect the very lives,security and stability of the citizens and countries of the hemisphere, placing at risk not only a large percentage of the inhabitants of the countries affected, but also, indirectly, those of the United States and the rest of the international community. The cost of failing to renew the ATPDEA [...] measured in loss of <b>jobs,</b> political <b>instability,</b> recession, loss of welfare, etc. [...] appears to be very high, if one considers that the imports covered by that Act represent barely 0. 64 % of total United States imports. All the advances effectively made in reducing the number of hectares sown with drug crops from over 200 thousand to barely 160 thousand, in the contribution toward diversifying Andean exports and in the positive contribution to the growth and creation of jobs in both the beneficiary countries and the United States are threatened by the possible failure to extend the ATPDEA. If this happens, a vicious circle would be put into play that would, inter alia, a); reverse the accomplishments in drug eradication; b); increase migration pressures on the United States; c); complicate the political panorama as a result of pro-cyclical economic pressures; d); make the United States look in the eyes of the world as though it were turning its back on its commitments to help improve living conditions in the developing countries; and, indirectly, it would reduce the welfare of local consumers already benefited by the ATPDEA, also complicating the labor situation in the sectors that generate direct and indirect jobs in the United States...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Functionally {{flexible}} {{systems for}} organizing work may reduce <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> and insecurity by reducing employers ’ reliance on job cuts or contingent work {{to respond to}} changes in their environments. Related arguments hypothesize that contingent work allows firms to adjust labor while “buffering ” their core of permanent workers from <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> We find evidence that internally flexible work systems are associated with reduced involuntary and voluntary turnover in manufacturing, but that contingent work and involuntary turnover of the permanent workforce are positively related regardless of sector, {{in contrast to the}} prediction of the “core-periphery ” hypothesis.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} informal job search methods on the labour market outcomes of displaced workers. Informal job search methods could alleviate short-term labour market difficulties of displaced workers by providing information on job opportunities, allowing them to signal their productivity and may mitigate wage losses through better post-displacement job matching. However if displacement results from reductions in demand for specific sectors/skills, the use of informal job search methods may {{increase the risk of}} <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> While informal job search methods are associated with lower wage losses, they lead to increased <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> and increased risk of subsequent job displacement...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} impact of IT diffusion on the stability of employment relationships. We document the evolution of the different components of <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> over a panel of 350 local labor markets in France, from the mid 1970 s to the early 2000 s. Although workers in more educated local labor markets adopt IT faster, they do not experience any increase in <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> More specifically, we find no evidence that the faster diffusion of IT is associated with any change in job-to-job transitions, and we find that it is associated with relatively less frequent transitions through unemployment. Overall, the evidence goes against the view that the diffusion of IT has spurred <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> Combining the local labor market variations with firm data, we argue that these findings can be explained by French firms' strong reliance on training and internal promotion strategies {{in order to meet the}} new skills requirement associated with IT diffusion.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} IT diffusion on the stability of employment. We document the evolution of different components of <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> over a panel of 348 cities in France, from the mid- 1970 s to the early 2000 s. The evidence goes against {{the view that the}} diffusion of IT has spurred <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> Yet, analysing long-term differences in the occupational structure, we find that IT diffusion has increased the share of high-skill occupations at the expense of low-skill occupations. This is consistent with French firms' reliance on their internal labour market to meet the new skill requirements associated with IT diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Data and {{measurement}} problems have complicated {{the debate over}} trends in <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> in the United States. We compare two cohorts of young white men from the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS), construct a rigorous measure of job change, and confirm earlier findings of {{a significant increase in}} <b>job</b> <b>instability.</b> We then benchmark the NLS against other main data sets in the field and conduct a thorough attrition analysis. Extending the analysis to wages, we find that the wage returns to job changing have both declined and become more unequal for young adults, mirroring trends in their long-term wage growth.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impact of product market {{competition}} on <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> as proxied {{by the use of}} fixed-term labor contracts. Using both worker data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey and firm data from the Spanish Business Strategies Survey, I show that <b>job</b> <b>instability</b> rises with competition. In particular, a one standard deviation increase in competition in an economic sector decreases the probability that a fixed-term worker gets an open-ended contract within that sector in a given year by more than 30 %. The effect is identified by means of exogenous shifts in competition brought about by changes in legislation. fixed-term employment, product market competition, labor contract...|$|E
