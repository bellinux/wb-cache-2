40|$|Objective: Sirenomelia or Mermaid {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} complete or incomplete fusion of lower extremities with an incidence of 1. 5 to 4. 2 in 100000 live births. It occurs in gastrulation period (beginning of third gestational week) because of insufficient mesoderm formation in caudal region. Various theories have been postulated to explain the etiology of sirenomelia such as pressure theory which denotes that some intra-uterine force, probably amniotic, acts on the tail of embryo. The {{aim of this study}} was to present a rare congenital malformation. In addition we reviewed the pertinent literature in this regard. Case Presentation: We report a case of sirenomelia with multiple interesting anomalies including bilateral renal agenesis, absent external genitalia, gall bladder agenesis, colorectal agenesis from mid ascending colon, ileosacral dysgenesis, meningocele, caudal tapering of abdominal aorta and single umbilical artery. History, detailed autopsy findings and review of literature are presented in this report. Conclusion: Sirenomelia is a rare congenital malformation leading to stillbirth or early death after birth due to multiple anomalies, so promp <b>intra-uterine</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and therapeutic abortion is of utmost importance...|$|E
40|$|The noninvasive {{nature of}} the {{detection}} of fetal DNA in the maternal circulation represents the greatest advantage over the conventional methods of prenatal diagnosis. The applications of this methodology involve the detection of the fetal sex, and <b>diagnosis,</b> <b>intra-uterine</b> treatment, and evaluation of the prognosis of many diseases. Fetal cells detected in the maternal circulation have {{also been shown to}} be implicated in autoimmune diseases and to represent a potential source of stem cells. On the other hand, with the introduction of a technology that detects the fetal sex as early as at 6 - 8 weeks of gestation, there is the possibility of early abortion based on sex selection for social purposes. This implies an ethical discussion about the question. The introduction of new noninvasive techniques of prenatal diagnosis and the knowledge of the Nursing Team regarding new methodologies can be of great benefit to the mother and her children, and can help the Genetic Counseling of the families...|$|R
