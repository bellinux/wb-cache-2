5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also have been accused of recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E
5|$|During his tenure, {{the workers}} in the Royal dockyards <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in pay due {{to an increase in}} living costs. St Vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken {{an active role in the}} strike. He eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.|$|E

50|$|After 24 {{hours the}} Premier <b>demanded</b> <b>a</b> {{return to work}} and promised no victimisation, {{although}} there was no promise of meeting the strikers' demands. After 48 hours the Premier again <b>demanded</b> <b>a</b> return to work with no guarantees regarding victimisation.|$|R
5|$|Some Iranian {{newspapers}} avoided {{mentioning the}} character, presumably to avoid offending Iran's clerical rulers. On March 2009, Javad Shamaqdari, cultural adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> apology from {{a delegation of}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences actors and producers visiting Iran for what he characterized as negative and unfair portrayals of the Islamic republic in The Wrestler and other Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|The Russo-Japanese War {{had caused}} rising dissent {{throughout}} the Russian Empire, including its Polish provinces. On 26 January 1905 about 6,000 workers in Łódź {{took part in}} a large strike. Next day, a general strike was declared, and the day after that, 70,000 workers were on strike. They <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> 8-hour work day and support for the sick. Some worker demonstrations were joined by the students, who <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> end to the policy of Russification. Another large strike occurred during the Labor Day on 1 May. It affected close to half of the city's industry. On 3 May, the anniversary of the Polish May Constitution, another demonstration with patriotic undertones took place. On 30 May, Łódź's industrialists asked the Russian governor-general for help.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{increasing}} anti-British sentiment {{spread throughout}} the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain. The riots focused on the Jewish community. In 1948, following rising hostilities and looting, most members of Bahrain's Jewish community abandoned their properties and evacuated to Bombay, later settling in Israel (Pardes Hanna-Karkur) and the United Kingdom. , 37 Jews remained in the country. In the 1950s, the National Union Committee, formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried {{out a number of}} protests and general strikes. In 1965 a month-long uprising broke out after hundreds of workers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company were laid off.|$|E

5|$|After an April 21, 1995, {{court hearing}} on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they {{continued}} their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> attorney. Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|During the Quasi-War, the United States {{paid tribute}} to the Barbary States {{to ensure that they}} would not seize or harass American {{merchant}} ships. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to Algiers, <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> immediate payment of $250,000. Thomas Jefferson responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States.|$|E
5|$|During the United States' {{preoccupation with}} France during the Quasi-War, {{troubles}} with the Barbary States were suppressed by {{the payment of}} tribute to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized.

5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|In May 1895 the Royal Navy {{occupied}} the Nicaraguan port of Corinto, {{after a number}} of British subjects, including the Vice-consul, had been seized during disturbances, shortly after the former protectorate of the Mosquito Coast had been incorporated into Nicaragua. The British <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> indemnity of £15,000. US Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham thought the demands harsh, but also that they should be met. US public opinion, however, was outraged at this British military activity in the United States' sphere of influence.|$|E
5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} war, many Israelis <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> {{impartial}} inquiry to investigate {{what became known}} as the machdal (the blunder), with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army, particularly their lack of preparedness for the attack and its ramifications. Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another's performance.|$|E
5|$|Sridhar remade {{the film}} in Hindi as Dil Ek Mandir (1963) and in Telugu as Manase Mandiram (1966). It was also remade in Malayalam as Hridayam Oru Kshethram and in Kannada as Kumkuma Rakshe (1977). California-based Indian filmmaker Jag Mundhra was keen on remaking Dil Ek Mandir in English and Hindi, effecting some {{marginal}} changes in the film treatment. Mundhra met Sridhar {{to ask for the}} rights to the film's script only to learn that Sridhar had assigned it to a film financier for a paltry sum, for eternity. The financier <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> exorbitant fee for giving up the rights. The fee amounted to 75% of Mundhra's budget.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Airborne Division was an {{airborne}} {{infantry division}} of the British Army during the Second World War. The division was formed in late 1941 during World War II, after the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> airborne force, and was initially under command of Major-General Frederick A. M. Browning. The division {{was one of two}} airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the war, with the other being the 6th Airborne Division, created in May 1943, using former units of the 1st Airborne Division.|$|E

5|$|The Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, {{summoned the}} Christian rulers of Syria and the Holy Land to Cyprus. Bohemond joined him while Frederick was marching from Limassol to Nicosia in August 1228. Frederick <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> oath of fealty for Antioch and Tripoli from Bohemond, but Bohemond feigned a nervous {{breakdown}} and returned to Nephin. Bohemond again met Frederick in Acre in 1229, but Bohemond's realms {{were not included in}} the peace treaty between Frederick and Al-Kamil, sultan of Egypt, on 18 February 1229.|$|E
5|$|When World War I broke out, the United States {{maintained}} {{a policy of}} isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned that the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion <b>demanded</b> <b>an</b> immediate attack.|$|E
