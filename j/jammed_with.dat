The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|The church {{formally}} {{announced the}} change on June 9, 1978. The story led many national news broadcasts {{and was on}} the front page of most American newspapers, and in most largely Latter-day Saint communities in Utah and Idaho, telephone networks were completely <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> excited callers. The announcement was formally approved by the church at the October 1978 general conference and is included in LDS Church's edition of the Doctrine and Covenants as Official Declaration 2.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what would {{eventually}} be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.|$|E

25|$|When Vincent's column neared Rottenburg, {{he found}} the road <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> the III Armeekorps trains. A charge by the Rosenberg Chevauxlegers halted the French cuirassiers long enough for his {{infantry}} to gain solid positions {{on the east side}} of the Große Laber. Hiller arrived at Rottenburg in the late afternoon and ordered a counterattack at 7:00 PM. Vincent swung his left brigade forward and quickly overran a Bavarian unit, capturing 300 troops. Soon after, the Deutschmeister Infantry Regiment # 4 got into a vicious firefight with Bavarian and French infantry. In the twilight, the Austrians were forced back by superior numbers with 600 casualties, but they had finally stopped their enemies.|$|E

At the performance at the first weekend of Coachella, AC/DC guitarist Angus Young joined the band on stage (Rose was set to join AC/DC as a touring vocalist).

25|$|News {{immediately}} began to spread {{about the death of}} the beloved Congressman and crowds {{immediately began}} to gather in front of the hospital, the Londons' home, and the building of The Jewish Daily Forward newspaper. The next day, London's body was taken to the Forward building, where it lay in state while 25,000 men, women, and children filed past the casket, paying their respects. A funeral followed on Wednesday, June 10, one of the greatest mass displays of mourning in New York City's history, witnessed by an estimated 500,000 people. The streets were <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> a procession of 50,000 people, as hundreds of thousands crowded windows and hung from fire escapes or stood along the procession route in a crowd jammed six people deep.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} {{that in the early}} hours of 22 December the Ceaușescus made their second mistake. Instead of fleeing the city under cover of night, they decided to wait until morning to leave. Ceaușescu must have thought that his desperate {{attempts}} to crush the protests had succeeded, because he apparently called another meeting for the next morning. However, before 07:00, his wife Elena received the news that large columns of workers from many industrial platforms (large communist-era factories or groups of factories concentrated into industrial zones) were heading towards city centre of Bucharest to join the protests. The police barricades that were meant to block access to Piața Universității (University Square) and Palace Square proved useless. By 09:30 University Square was <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> protesters. Security forces (army, police and others) re-entered the area, only to join with the protesters.|$|E

25|$|The film follows Lăzărescu's {{journey through}} the night, as he is carried from one {{hospital}} to the next. At the first three hospitals, the doctors, after much delay, reluctantly agree to examine Lăzărescu. Then, although finding that he is gravely ill and needs emergency surgery, each team refuses to admit him and sends him to another hospital. Meanwhile, Lăzărescu's condition deteriorates rapidly, his speech is reduced to babbling, and he slowly loses consciousness. The hospitals are <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> injured passengers from a bus accident, but some doctors appear to reject him out of fatigue or {{because they do not}} feel like taking care of a smelly old drunkard. During the night, his only advocate is Mioara, the paramedic who stubbornly stays by him and tries to get him hospitalized and treated, while passively accepting verbal abuse from the doctors who look down on her.|$|E
25|$|There were unarmed Polish UN {{observers}} in the church: Major Jerzy Mączka and Major Ryszard Chudy, who were supervising {{the implementation of the}} Arusha accords signed on August 4, 1993 on behalf of the UNAMIR. When the attack on the church began, Major Jerzy Mączka was in a garden near the church and tried to contact the UNAMIR headquarters in Kigali in order to direct some Belgian or Bangladeshi operational units to the church. Initially, all Motorola system channels were <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> other calls for help. Eventually he managed to pass the report about the ongoing murders to UNAMIR duty officer, captain Godson Zowonogo. However the captain's response was negative – he argued that he had been informed about many similar events in the capital and that direct intervention of UNAMIR soldiers in all of these places was impossible. Major Mączka also tried to contact a duty officer of the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front who was stationed in Kigali.|$|E
25|$|During the Process era, a loose-knit art/philosophy {{collective}} {{also known}} as The Process was formed, with early contributions from Ogre and Genesis P-Orridge, among others. P-Orridge and Chris Carter, among others, <b>jammed</b> <b>with</b> Skinny Puppy during this period, a recording of which was eventually released as Puppy Gristle in a limited edition in 2002. The creation of the Download project, which Key and Goettel formed with Mark Spybey and Phil Western, also occurred at this time. Download explored everything from electronic improvisation with spoken vocals to techno, and toured in 1996. Earlier, in 1993, Goettel and Western had issued a breakbeat hardcore single (under the name aDuck) on their own Subconscious Records, and after Goettel's death in 1995, Subconscious evolved into a recording studio and record label imprint that Key used to release {{a number of his}} own and Skinny Puppy's recordings. Key also continued to work with The Tear Garden, produced industrial/trance music with Western in the side project platEAU, and released his first solo album in 1998.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the influence of several parameters on quality of Clementine (Citrus clementine) jam. Thermal treated and nontreated Clementine purée, two types of sugar (sucrose and fructose) and three different amounts of added pectin were used for the jam producing. Accordingly, twelve jams were prepared and sorted in four groups, two of nontreated purées and two of treated purées, and each one with sucrose and fructose within. The quality of jams was evaluated through gel strength measurement, sensory evaluation and level of polyphenols. The results of gel strength measurement showed that the treated purée jams were less firm than nontreated ones, the <b>jams</b> <b>with</b> sucrose were firmer than the ones with fructose and the gel strength of <b>jams</b> increased <b>with</b> amount of added pectin increase. Jams of nontreated purée contained higher level of polyphenols in comparison <b>with</b> <b>jams</b> of treated purée. Regarding to sensory evaluation, the nontreated purée jams were higher rated in comparison to treated ones. Furthermore, <b>jams</b> <b>with</b> fructose were better evaluated than <b>jams</b> <b>with</b> sucrose. Based on obtained results, it is revealing that nontreated purée <b>jam</b> <b>with</b> fructose and 0. 7 % added pectin was the best sensory evaluated sample...|$|R
