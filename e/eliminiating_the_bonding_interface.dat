30|$|Thermal self-compressing bonding (TSCB) {{is a new}} {{solid-state}} bonding method {{pioneered by}} the authors. With electron beam as the non-melted heat source, previous experimental study performed on titanium alloys has proved the feasibility of TSCB. However, the thermal stress–strain process during bonding, which is of very important significance in revealing the mechanism of TSCB, was not analysed. In this paper, finite element analysis method is adopted to numerically study the thermal elasto-plastic stress–strain cycle of thermal self-compressing bonding. It is found that due to the localized heating, a non-uniform temperature distribution is formed during <b>bonding,</b> with <b>the</b> highest temperature existed on <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>interface.</b> <b>The</b> expansion of high temperature materials adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> are restrained by surrounding cool materials and rigid restraints, and thus an internal elasto-plastic stress–strain field is developed by itself which makes <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> subjected to thermal compressive action. This thermal self-compressing action combined with the high temperature on <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> promotes <b>the</b> atom diffusion across <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> to produce solid-state joints. Due to the relatively large plastic deformation, rigid restraint TSCB obtains sound joints in relatively short time compared to diffusion bonding.|$|R

This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} electrical measurements and sample modifications that enabled the electrical properties of hybrid-orientation direct silicon <b>bonded</b> wafer <b>interfaces</b> to be determined. It is shown that the carrier transport across this near-surface (110) Si/(100) Si boundary is dictated by the defects present at <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>interface.</b> These interface states are believed to pin the Fermi-level, producing a conduction barrier with a thermal activation energy Ea = 0. 56 eV. The defect band has been identified by deep-level transient spectroscopy and associated with the defect states typically observed in plastically deformed silicon.

40|$|It {{is known}} that it is {{difficult}} to bond dissimilar metals such as aluminum and copper or aluminum and iron using diffusion bonding, because an intermetallic compound is easily produced at <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>interface</b> and <b>bonding</b> strength becomes low.

In this study, we investigated <b>the</b> effect of <b>bonding</b> temperature and reduction of aluminum plate thickness on bonding strength of Al/Cu clad materials when aluminum-clad copper (Al/Cu clad) materials were produced at 3 Pa in vacuum degree by the vacuum roll bondings.

The study was separated into two main parts: bond strength measurement and investigation of <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>interface.</b> Twenty-two human premolars were used for <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> strength measurement. Each tooth was cut vertically, separating the tooth into mesio-distal halves. One half of the tooth was used to bond to a surface perpendicular to the dentinal tubules and other half to bond to a surface parallel to the tubules. For each half, six locations of dentine were bonded. Each material was used in accordance to the manufacturer's directions. Cylindrical hourglass-shaped specimens of 1. 2 mm diameter at <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> <b>interface</b> were manufactured. <b>The</b> <b>bonds</b> were stressed in tension at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Mean bond strengths were compared using LSD, one-way ANOVA, and Student's t-test. The fractured surfaces were examined under a scanning electron microscope, {{and the frequency of}} fracture modes was compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. For the investigation of <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> <b>interface,</b> four teeth were prepared by the same procedure used for <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> test specimens. <b>The</b> <b>bonded</b> <b>interfaces</b> were observed after an acid-base treatment or fracturing across <b>the</b> <b>bonded</b> <b>interface,</b> prior to investigation with a field-emission scanning electron microscope. For Single <b>Bond,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> strengths for mid-root dentine were significantly lower than for other locations (p 0. 05).

The results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> for Single Bond may be affected by its ability to penetrate demineralised dentine in different locations of a tooth.
