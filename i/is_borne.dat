5|$|The even-toed {{ungulates}} are ungulates whose weight <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> about equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 artiodactyl species worldwide, including many that are of great economic importance.|$|E
5|$|The benediction being concluded, the {{sovereign}} {{rises from the}} Coronation Chair and <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> into a throne. Once the monarch is seated on the throne, the formula Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth…– a translation of the Latin formula Sta et retine…, historically used for the enthronement of other Christian sovereigns – is recited.|$|E

5000|$|Veiga's account {{seems to}} have been {{received}} by Samuel Purchas, who has a close paraphrase in his Purchas His Pilgrims (1613/1626), [...] "that the Earth had nine corners, whereby it <b>was</b> <b>borne</b> up by the Heaven. Others dissented, and said, that the Earth <b>was</b> <b>borne</b> up by seven Elephants; the Elephants feet stood on Tortoises, and they <b>were</b> <b>borne</b> by they know not what." ...|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|Physically {{abused as}} a child, Judd {{wants to keep}} Shiloh {{because he does not}} {{comprehend}} why people are so interested in rescuing the abused dog. No one cared to rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> because of the love his family nurtured in him.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> {{primarily on}} one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5000|$|Flowers {{are very}} small, greenish and <b>are</b> <b>borne</b> in summer. The {{male and female}} flowers <b>are</b> <b>borne</b> on {{separate}} trees and the female trees bear small fruits 3-4 mm in diameter, which turn red when ripe.|$|R
50|$|Flowers: Cherrybark oak is monoecious; staminate and pistillate catkins <b>are</b> <b>borne</b> {{separately}} on {{the same}} tree. Catkins <b>are</b> <b>borne</b> on stalks from leaf axils of the current growth. Flowers appear from February to May, depending on latitude.|$|R

5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E
5|$|When fit, Lindwall {{opened the}} bowling with Miller in the Tests, and the pair {{operated}} in short and fiery bursts {{with the new}} ball. English cricket administrators had agreed {{to make a new}} ball available every 55 overs in the Tests; at the time, the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored, something which usually took longer than 55 overs. The new regulation played directly {{into the hands of the}} Australians, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs. As a result, Lindwall bowled 224 overs, while Australia's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled 306. Lindwall led the Test bowling averages, with 27 wickets at 19.62, making him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Johnston, who averaged 23.33. The duo’s haul of 27 Test wickets equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler during a tour of England. The Australian pair were substantially ahead the next most successful bowler, England's Alec Bedser, who took 18 wickets at 38.22. Lindwall's role as the leading strike bowler <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> out in his economy and strike rate in both the Tests and all first-class matches. He was the least economical of the three pacemen, but took his wickets more frequently than any other frontline bowler.|$|E

25|$|Frederick William Lillywhite (13 June 1792 – 21 August 1854) was an English cricketer {{during the}} game's roundarm era. One {{of the main}} protagonists in the {{legalisation}} of roundarm, {{he was one of}} the most successful bowlers of his era. His status <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> out by his nickname: The Nonpareil.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission {{provided}} {{a report on}} the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding.|$|E
25|$|The strong genetic {{component}} <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> out in studies on monozygotic twins, with a concordance of 38-55%, {{with an even}} higher concordance of circulating thyroid antibodies not in relation to clinical presentation (up to 80% in monozygotic twins). Neither result was seen to a similar degree in dizygotic twins, offering strong favour for high genetic aetiology.|$|E

25|$|Brilliance can {{be divided}} into the {{definitions}} external brilliance and internal brilliance. The former is the light reflected {{from the surface of the}} stone—its luster. Diamond's adamantine ("diamond-like") luster is second only to metallic (i.e., that of metals); while it is directly related to RI, the quality of a finished gem's polish will determine how well a diamond's luster <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> out.|$|E
25|$|The Institute for Exploration Black Sea expeditions {{relied on}} remote sensing with side-scan sonar in shallow and deep water to {{identify}} potential archaeological sites examined by ROVs. The {{hypothesis that the}} anoxic waters of the Black Sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> out by the discovery of Sinop D, the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{in journalism}} {{in the rest}} of the First World right-wing Swedish {{commentators}} have criticized the news as being biased in favor of the left-wing parties. This <b>is</b> <b>borne</b> out by the fact that according to the SOM Institute at the University of Gothenburg, a disproportionate number of journalists support the socialist parties as opposed to the conservative, liberal or centrist ones compared to the Swedish public.|$|E

25|$|There is less robust {{evidence}} of good outcomes {{for patients with}} borderline personality disorder, with some studies showing only small to moderate effect sizes. The authors comment that these poor outcomes might reflect a need for additional support for some patients, {{in addition to the}} group therapy.
