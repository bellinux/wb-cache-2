The plagiopatagium (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is {{attached}} to the <b>fifth</b> <b>toe.</b> The tail extends only about 1mm beyond the back margin of the uropatagium (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The calcar, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen). The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5mm long. The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes M.alcathoe from M.brandtii as well as M.ikonnikovi.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the <b>fifth</b> <b>toe</b> extends nearly to the base of the second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but there may not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E

[...] Reviewing the genus Nectomys in 1944, Philip Hershkovitz listed N.hammondi among species of Nectomys incertae sedis (of uncertain position), and considered its placement in Nectomys as dubious. Characters he listed as conflicting with a Nectomys identity of the species included the short hindfoot with a long <b>fifth</b> <b>toe,</b> the weakly developed posterolateral palatal pits (perforations of the palate near the third molars), and {{the orientation of the}} zygomatic plate.|$|E

Like the arms, a fringe of scalloped skin also extended from the heel {{to the base of the}} foot on each leg, continuing as a low ridge to the base of the disc of the <b>fifth</b> <b>toe.</b> The toes, like the fingers, possessed flattened discs at the tips, though they were slightly smaller in diameter. The tubercles on the tipmost joints of the fifth toes were larger than all of the other subarticular tubercles on the toes. Interspersed between them were numerous small and conical tubercles. The toes were also fully webbed.|$|E
500|$|Eremoryzomys polius is a large, long-tailed {{rice rat}} that in color resembles some North American woodrats (Neotoma). The fur is grayish above and lighter below, where the hairs are gray at the bases but white at the tips. The {{external}} ears (pinnae) are short and the tail is dark above and light below. The hindfeet have well-developed ungual tufts (patches of hair) along the plantar margins and between {{all of the}} digits, a character shared only with Sooretamys angouya among oryzomyines. The squamae, small structures resembling scales that cover the soles of the hindfeet in many oryzomyines, are well developed.

60|$|With {{animals and}} plants reared by man there is no severe or {{recurrent}} struggle for existence, and the principle of economy will not come into action, so that the reduction of an organ will not thus be aided. So far, indeed, is this from being the case, that in some few instances organs, which are naturally rudimentary in the parent-species, become partially redeveloped in the domesticated descendants. Thus cows, like most other ruminants, properly have four active and two rudimentary mamma; but in our domesticated animals, the latter occasionally become considerably developed and yield milk. The atrophied mammae, which, in male domesticated animals, including man, have in some rare cases grown to full size and secreted milk, perhaps offer an analogous case. The hind feet of dogs naturally include rudiments of a <b>fifth</b> <b>toe,</b> and in certain large breeds these toes, though still rudimentary, become considerably developed and are furnished with claws. In the common Hen, the spurs and comb are rudimentary, but in certain breeds these become, independently of age or disease of the ovaria, well developed. The stallion has canine teeth, but the mare has only traces of the alveoli, which, as I am informed by the eminent veterinarian Mr. G.T. Brown, frequently contain minute irregular nodules of bone. These nodules, however, sometimes become developed into imperfect teeth, protruding through the gums and coated with enamel; and occasionally they grow to a fourth or even {{a third of the}} length of the canines in the stallion. With plants I do not know whether the redevelopment of rudimentary organs occurs more frequently under culture than under nature. Perhaps the pear-tree may be a case in point, for when wild it bears thorns, which consist of branches in a rudimentary condition and serve as a protection, but, when the tree is cultivated, they are reconverted into branches.|$|E
50|$|The {{intermediate}} dorsal cutaneous nerve (external dorsal cutaneous branch), the smaller, passes {{along the}} lateral {{part of the}} dorsum of the foot, and divides into dorsal digital branches, which supply the contiguous sides of the third and fourth, and of the fourth and <b>fifth</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|R

6000|$|With {{respect to}} minor {{differences}} little need be said. Isidore Geoffroy has shown (1/63. 'Hist. Nat. General' tome 3 page 448.) that in size some dogs are {{six times as}} long (the tail being excluded) as others; and that the height relatively {{to the length of}} the body varies from between one to two, and one to nearly four. In the Scotch deer-hound there is a striking and remarkable difference {{in the size of the}} male and female. (1/64. W. Scrope 'Art of Deer-Stalking' page 354.) Every one knows how the ears vary in size in different breeds, and with their great development their muscles become atrophied. Certain breeds of dogs are described as having a deep furrow between the nostrils and lips. The caudal vertebrae, according to F. Cuvier, on whose authority the two last statements rest, vary in number; and the tail in English cattle and some shepherd dogs is almost absent. The mammae vary from seven to ten in number; Daubenton, having examined twenty- one dogs, found eight with five mammae on each side; eight with four on each side; and the others with an unequal number on the two sides. (1/65. Quoted by Col. Ham. Smith in 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 79.) Dogs have properly five toes in front and four behind, but a <b>fifth</b> <b>toe</b> is often added; and F. Cuvier states that, when a <b>fifth</b> <b>toe</b> is present, a fourth cuneiform bone is developed; and, in this case, sometimes the great cuneiform bone is raised, and gives on its inner side a large articular surface to the astragalus; so that even the relative connection of the bones, the most constant of all characters, varies. These modifications, however, in the feet of dogs are not important, because they ought to be ranked, as De Blainville has shown (1/66. De Blainville 'Osteographie, Canidae' page 134. F. Cuvier 'Annales du Museum' tome 18 page 342. In regard to mastiffs, see Col. H. Smith 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 218. For the Thibet mastiff, see Mr. Hodgson in 'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 1 1832 page 342.) as monstrosities. Nevertheless they are interesting from being correlated with the size of the body, for they occur much more frequently with mastiffs and other large breeds than with small dogs. Closely allied varieties, however, sometimes differ in this respect; thus Mr. Hodgson states that the black-and-tan Lassa variety of the Thibet mastiff has the fifth digit, whilst the Mustang sub-variety is not thus characterised. The extent to which the skin is developed between the toes varies much; but we shall return to this point. The degree to which the various breeds differ in the perfection of their senses, dispositions, and inherited habits is notorious to every one. The breeds present some constitutional differences: the pulse, says Youatt (1/67. 'The Dog' 1845 page 186. With respect to diseases Youatt asserts (page 167) that the Italian greyhound is [...] "strongly subject" [...] to polypi in the matrix or vagina. The spaniel and pug (page 182) are most liable to bronchocele. The liability to distemper (page 232) is extremely different in different breeds. On the distemper, see also Col. Hutchinson on 'Dog Breaking' 1850 page 279.) [...] "varies materially according to the breed, as well as to the size of the animal." [...] Different breeds of dogs are subject in different degrees to various diseases. They certainly become adapted to different climates under which they have long existed. It is notorious that most of our best European breeds deteriorate in India. (1/68. See 'Youatt on the Dog' page 15; 'The Veterinary' London volume 11 page 235.) The Rev R. Everest (1/69. 'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 3 page 19.) believes that no one has succeeded in keeping the Newfoundland dog long alive in India; so it is, according to Lichtenstein (1/70. 'Travels' volume 2 page 15.), even at the Cape of Good Hope. The Thibet mastiff degenerates on the plains of India, and can live only on the mountains. (1/71. Hodgson in 'Journal of As. Soc. of Bengal' volume 1 page 342.) Lloyd (1/72. 'Field Sports of the North of Europe' volume 2 page 165.) asserts that our bloodhounds and bulldogs have been tried, and cannot withstand the cold of the northern European forests.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Additional digits {{have been}} {{observed}} in negroes {{as well as in}} other races of man, and in several of the lower animals, and have been inherited. Six toes have been described on the hind feet of the newt (Salamandra cristata), and are said to have occurred with the frog. It deserves notice, that the six-toed newt, though adult, preserved some of its larval characters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus, which is properly absorbed during the act of metamorphosis, was retained. It is also remarkable {{that in the case of}} man various structures in an embryonic or arrested state of development, such as a cleft-palate, bifid uterus, etc., are often accompanied by polydactylism. (12/31. Meckel and Isid G. St. Hilaire insist on this fact. See also M. A. Roujou 'Sur quelques Analogies du Type Humain' page 61 published, I believe, in the 'Journal of the Anthropolog. Soc. of Paris' January 1872.) Six toes on the hinder feet are known to have been inherited for three generations of cats. In several breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is double, and is generally transmitted truly, as is well shown when Dorkings are crossed with common four-toed breeds (12/32. 'The Poultry Chronicle' 1854 page 559.) With animals which have properly less than five digits, the number is sometimes increased to five, especially on the front legs, though rarely carried beyond that number; but this is due to the development of a digit already existing in a more or less rudimentary state. Thus, the dog has properly four toes behind, but in the larger breeds a <b>fifth</b> <b>toe</b> is commonly, though not perfectly, developed. Horses, which properly have one toe alone fully developed with rudiments of the others, have been described with each foot bearing two or three small separate hoofs: analogous facts have been noticed with cows, sheep, goats, and pigs. (12/33. The statements in this paragraph are taken from Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' tome 1 pages 688-693. Mr. Goodman gives, 'Phil. Soc. of Cambridge' November 25, 1872 the case of a cow with three well developed toes on each hind limb, besides the ordinary rudiments; and her calf by an ordinary bull had extra digits. This calf also bore two calves having extra digits.) ...|$|E

We performed a cadaver study to determine whether the flexor digitorum brevis tendon is long enough to be transferred to the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of the toe from its lateral or medial aspect. Transposition of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon was attempted in 180 toes of cadaver feet: 45 second toes, 45 third toes, 45 fourth <b>toes,</b> and 45 <b>fifth</b> <b>toes.</b> The flexor digitorum brevis tendon was long enough to be successfully transposed in 100 % of the second, third, and fourth toes and in 42 (93. 3 %) of the <b>fifth</b> <b>toes.</b> In the three remaining <b>fifth</b> <b>toes</b> (6. 7 %), the flexor digitorum brevis tendon was absent, a known anatomical variation. In conclusion, transfer of the flexor digitorum brevis tendon to the dorsum of the proximal phalanx can be performed for correction of claw or hammer toe deformities, especially in the second, third, and fourth toes.
