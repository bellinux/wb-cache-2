Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came {{and asked for a}} sandalwood Tilaka (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave a hint to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.|$|E

While at the zoo, Bobo never <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Lowmans, instantly recognizing any of them when they came to visit. In 1956, the zoo introduced a female gorilla named Fifi to Bobo's cage in the hopes that they would mate. Although Fifi remained with Bobo until his death, they never mated, which perplexed zookeepers and the media who followed them.|$|E

25|$|On Monday 28 December, {{the first}} day of the runoff campaign, the {{incumbent}} president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3million kuna for the campaign saying he knows how much a campaign costs. He pleaded for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns so he knows how nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name of every single person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there could be one debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the fact that the president himself was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> help he provided him during his two campaigns.|$|E

They reviewed some of their previous projects and eventually chose Evolve, which seemed to be the most [...] "straightforward" [...] concept.

Cobain <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song for a while, but {{began working on}} it again {{when he and his}} wife, Courtney Love, moved to a house in the Hollywood Hills. In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, [...] " [...] off!" [...] and closed the closet door. [...] "He was trying to be so sneaky", said Love. [...] "I could hear that one from downstairs." [...] The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross noted that Love's songwriting {{sensibility}} informed Cobain's on the song. The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song [...] "Heart-Shaped Coffin".|$|E
500|$|The Bill of Rights {{originally}} only {{restricted the}} federal government, {{and went through}} a long initial phase of [...] "judicial dormancy"; {{in the words of}} historian Gordon S. Wood, [...] "After ratification, most Americans promptly <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> first ten amendments to the Constitution." [...] Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act were passed. As federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as narcotics, more questions about the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing [...] "the privacy, dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government, without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function." [...] In Mapp v. Ohio (1961), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

500|$|The Bill of Rights {{had little}} {{judicial}} impact {{for the first}} 150 years of its existence; {{in the words of}} Gordon S. Wood, [...] "After ratification, most Americans promptly <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> first ten amendments to the Constitution." [...] The Court made no important decisions protecting free speech rights, for example, until 1931. Historian Richard Labunski attributes the Bill's long legal dormancy to three factors: first, it took time for a [...] "culture of tolerance" [...] to develop that would support the Bill's provisions with judicial and popular will; second, the Supreme Court spent much of the 19th century focused on issues relating to intergovernmental balances of power; and third, the Bill initially only applied to the federal government, a restriction affirmed by Barron v. Baltimore (1833). In the twentieth century, however, most of the Bill's provisions were applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment—a process known as incorporation—beginning with the freedom of speech clause, in Gitlow v. New York (1925). In Talton v. Mayes (1896), the Court ruled that Constitutional protections, including the provisions of the Bill of Rights, do not apply to the actions of American Indian tribal governments. Through the incorporation process the United States Supreme Court succeeded in extending to the States almost all of the protections in the Bill of Rights, as well as other, unenumerated rights. The Bill of Rights thus imposes legal limits on the powers of governments and acts as an anti-majoritarian/minoritarian safeguard by providing deeply entrenched legal protection for various civil liberties and fundamental rights. The Supreme Court for example concluded in the West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943) case that the founders intended the Bill of Rights to put some rights out of reach from majorities, ensuring that some liberties would endure beyond political majorities. As the Court noted the idea of the Bill of Rights “was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.” This is why “fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.” ...|$|E

[...] After three days, the maid failed to return to work, prompting O'Brien's mother to discharge her, requesting that the awards be returned.

2500|$|Many {{critics argue}} {{that even if the}} IOC presses {{countries}} to allow women’s participation in sports, especially at the Olympic level, that {{this does not mean that}} the women athletes are treated equally. Much controversy surrounded the participation of two women athletes from Saudi Arabia in the 2012 Olympic Games. [...] These two athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics but were not allowed to train inside their country and were chastised by many in their Islamic communities for their “disgraceful” actions. In a country where women can not drive a vehicle or leave the house without a male escort, the thought of women competing in sport was very controversial. More controversy surrounding these women athletes followed when they were required to participate in hijabs (traditional Muslim head covering). Critics said that the IOC was requiring the countries to send women athletes but then <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> countries’ cultures after the fact.|$|E

2500|$|When Jacob {{returned}} to Marburg from Paris in 1806, their friend Brentano sought the brothers' help in adding to {{his collection of}} folk tales, at which time the brothers began to gather tales in an organized fashion. By 1810, they had produced a manuscript collection of several dozen tales, written after inviting storytellers to their home and transcribing what they heard. These tales were heavily modified in transcription, and many had roots in previously written sources. At Brentano's request, they printed and sent him copies of the 53 tales that they collected for inclusion in his third volume of [...] Brentano either ignored or <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tales, leaving the copies in a church in Alsace where they were found in 1920 and {{became known as the}} Ölenberg manuscript.

2500|$|On another front, Robertson {{had agreed}} to perform with his cover band in a battle of the bands at Nathan Phillips Square for the Second Harvest food bank. The band broke up and he <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gig. When he {{received}} a phone call a week before the show, asking him to confirm the gig, he improvised that the name of the band had changed to [...] "Barenaked Ladies", recalling the name from the Dylan concert. He then called Page and asked if he wanted to do the gig; Page reportedly could not believe Robertson had given that name. They arranged three rehearsals and missed them all. The two played the show on October 1, 1988, but instead of competing, they played while the other bands set up, playing every song they could think of that they both knew. The show went well and they were invited to open a show for another well-known local band, The Razorbacks, at the Horseshoe Tavern the coming weekend. They set up three more rehearsals, and again missed them all; they proceeded to improvise their set once again. This would set a precedent for an element of Barenaked Ladies concerts which still almost always contain some improvised raps or songs, as well as general improvised banter.|$|E
2500|$|Leadbeater {{played for}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club as a middle-order batsman from 1966 to 1979, {{although}} {{he preferred to}} open the innings. His promise went largely unfulfilled; his average of 25.34 in 147 first-class matches (the norm for a county cricketer of the period was around 30.00), scoring just one century. The highlight of his playing career was a man-of-the-match winning 76 in the 1969 Gillette Cup Final, a match {{in which he was}} not expected to play. Leadbeater broke a finger in the County Championship game the day before, and would have been omitted had Geoffrey Boycott not suffered a worse injury. Leadbeater said: [...] "I almost <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact that I had a broken finger. Then when it came to lunchtime, I was changing my clothing because of perspiration, and ate my lunch in a jockstrap and left batting glove! I couldn’t get the glove off because my finger had swollen. I can't get m' breath!" [...] Leadbeater posted a top score of 90 in 106 one day games. Leadbeater was touted by Colin Cowdrey (amongst others) as a future Test match cricketer. However, batting lower down the order and a shin injury in 1970 meant that Leadbeater failed to score enough runs to impress the selectors.|$|E
