5|$|Anne Dallas Dudley (née Annie Willis Dallas; November 13, 1876 – September 13, 1955) was a {{prominent}} activist in the women's suffrage movement in the United States. After founding the Nashville <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> League and serving as its president, she moved {{up through the ranks}} of the movement, serving as President of the Tennessee <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> Association and then as Third Vice President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, where she helped lead efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution ratified, giving women the right to vote nationwide. She is especially noted for her successful efforts to get the Nineteenth Amendment ratified in her home state of Tennessee, the final state necessary to bring the amendment into force.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving as}} {{president}} of the local league for four years, Dudley was elected to head the Tennessee <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> Association in 1915. During this time she helped to introduce and lobby for a suffrage amendment to the state constitution. Although the amendment was defeated, a later measure to give women the right to vote in presidential and municipal elections was eventually passed by the state legislature in 1919.|$|E

50|$|In several Western democracies, such as Sweden and pre-unitary Germany, {{weighted}} voting preceded <b>equal</b> and universal <b>suffrage,</b> {{as well as}} women's suffrage, to different extents. In Sweden, universal and <b>equal</b> male <b>suffrage</b> to the lower house (Andra kammaren) was introduced by Arvid Lindman's first cabinet, while voting for city and county councils, which indirectly decided {{the composition of the}} upper house (Första kammaren), was graded along a 40-degree scale. Certain corporations also had votes of their own, thus multiplying the political strength of its owners. Weighted voting was abolished in Nils Eden's reforms of 1918-19, when female suffrage was also introduced.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century, {{prohibition}} and women's suffrage had become the major reform issues in the state. Although supporters and their opponents closely linked the two movements, temperance received a broader hearing than the efforts toward <b>equal</b> <b>suffrage.</b> While many Protestant churches in Indiana supported temperance, few provided a forum for discussions on women's voting rights.|$|E
5|$|Bryant, who {{retained}} {{her maiden}} name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics and the women's suffrage movement by her friend Sara Bard Field, she joined the Oregon branch of the College <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> League in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual Flag Day parade. Led by Abigail Scott Duniway, women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.|$|E
5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman {{suffrage}} {{drew on the}} educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E

5|$|Smith favored women's suffrage, {{and was an}} Episcopalian by religion. She was {{a member}} of the Chicago Woman's Club, Chickaming Country Club, North Side Branch <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> League, and the Audubon Society. In 1897, she moved into the {{settlement}} house and lived there until 1924. At that time, she lived in the home of Mary Rozet Smith, where she remained until around 1934. Smith returned to Hull House as a resident until she retired in 1936, and was succeeded by her sister, Gertrude. For health reasons, at that time, Smith moved to Midland, Michigan, where she resided with a niece until her death on June 30, 1942 in Midland. She was buried in Annapolis, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive for}} women's {{suffrage}} was reinvigorated in the 1870s, and {{was sponsored by}} the leaders of the prohibition movement, especially the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The Indiana branch of the American Woman Suffrage Association was re-established in 1869. In 1878 May Wright Sewall founded the Indianapolis <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> Society, which fought for world peace before the nation plunged into World War I. Several Indiana women also became temperance leaders and took {{an active role in the}} movement. The Indiana chapter of the WCTU was formed in 1874 with Zerelda G. Wallace as its first president. Like many other suffrage leaders, Wallace was radicalized for woman's suffrage through her temperance reform work. During her 1875 speech before the Indiana General Assembly in support of prohibition, legislators demonstrated an open contempt for women involved in politics and speaking in public. Afterward, Wallace credited the experience with her embrace of suffrage.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, {{relief work}} helped keep the women's {{societies}} in Wales active, though membership numbers began to fall. After the People's act of 1918, {{many of the}} regional branches began to wither. The Llangollen WSS resolved to disband in December 1918, handing their marching banner to the National Council, believing their work was done. While others, such as the Newport branch, revised their aims to form a Women's Citizen Association taking an active interest in welfare and social issues. Other branches continued the political vision of <b>equal</b> <b>suffrage,</b> notably Bangor, while the Cardiff WSS busied itself by attempting to secure the election of women to local government posts. The fact that the terms of enfranchisement were not equal to men ensured that the surviving suffragist societies still had a focus, and the first point of order was the bill to admit women as MPs. This was passed in October 1918 and seventeen women stood at the 1918 General Election. There was one female candidacy in Wales, Millicent Mackenzie, a former professor of education from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, who unsuccessfully contested the newly formed University of Wales seat. It took until 1929 for Wales to return its first female MP, Megan Lloyd George, the youngest daughter of the former Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Bermuda on 22 May 1968. The {{elections were}} the first held under <b>equal</b> universal <b>suffrage,</b> as the additional vote for property owners used in the 1963 elections was scrapped, and the voting age lowered from 25 to 21. The result was {{a victory for the}} United Bermuda Party, which won 30 of the 40 seats in the House of Assembly. On 10 June Henry Tucker became the territory's first Premier.|$|R

50|$|The {{feeling of}} unity between the Swedish-speaking rural {{population}} and the (remains of the) Swedish-speaking elite is the lasting legacy of the Svecoman movement, and this became the core idea of the Swedish People's Party, which was founded after the introduction of <b>equal</b> and common <b>suffrage</b> in 1906.|$|R
5|$|The 1866 North German Constitution became (with some {{semantic}} adjustments) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire. With this constitution, the new Germany acquired some democratic features: {{notably the}} Imperial Diet, which—in {{contrast to the}} parliament of Prussia—gave citizens representation {{on the basis of}} elections by direct and <b>equal</b> <b>suffrage</b> of all males who had reached the age of 25. Furthermore, elections were generally free of chicanery, engendering pride in the national parliament. However, legislation required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the states, in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto. Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies, with executive power vested in the Prussian King as Kaiser, who appointed the federal chancellor. The chancellor was accountable solely to, and served entirely at the discretion of, the Emperor. Officially, the chancellor functioned as a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. With the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty's hegemonic home-kingdom, Prussia. The Imperial Diet had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills, but it could not initiate legislation. (The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor.) The other states retained their own governments, but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control. The militaries of the larger states (such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony) retained some autonomy, but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, the National College <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> League {{was formed}} as an {{affiliate}} of the NAWSA. It had its origins in the College <b>Equal</b> <b>Suffrage</b> League, which was formed in Boston in 1900 {{at a time when}} there were relatively few college students in the NAWSA. It was established by Maud Wood Park, who later helped create similar groups in 30 states. Park later became a prominent leader of the NAWSA.|$|E

25|$|Langston {{worked for}} 30 years for <b>equal</b> rights, <b>suffrage</b> and {{education}} in Ohio and Kansas. In 1858, Langston was tried {{with a white}} colleague for the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue, a cause célèbre that was a catalyst for increasing support for abolition. That year Langston helped found the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society and, with his younger brother John as president, led it as executive secretary. After the American Civil War, he was appointed as general superintendent of refugees and freedmen for the Freedmen's Bureau in Kansas. In 1872 he was appointed as principal of the Quindaro Freedman's School (later Western University), the first black college west of the Mississippi River.|$|R
