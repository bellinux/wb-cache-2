5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, <b>further</b> <b>diagnostic</b> testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} to Biologist in June 2001, British teacher and Chartered Biologist Paul Spiring speculated that Merrick might have {{suffered}} {{from a combination of}} the two syndromes. This hypothesis was reported by Robert Matthews, a correspondent for The Sunday Telegraph. The possibility that Merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled The Curse of The Elephant Man that was produced for the Discovery Health Channel by Natural History New Zealand. During 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a BBC appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took DNA samples from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition. During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned <b>further</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tests using DNA that was extracted from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide <b>further</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{a person}} is {{diagnosed}} with cerebral palsy, <b>further</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tests are optional. Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is warranted when {{the cause of a}} person's cerebral palsy has not been established. An MRI is preferred over CT due to diagnostic yield and safety. When abnormal, the neuroimaging study can suggest the timing of the initial damage. The CT or MRI is also capable of revealing treatable conditions, such as hydrocephalus, porencephaly, arteriovenous malformation, subdural hematomas and hygromas, and a vermian tumour (which a few studies suggest are present 5–22% of the time). Furthermore, an abnormal neuroimaging study indicates a high likelihood of associated conditions, such as epilepsy and intellectual disability.

40|$|While the ferret is not {{considered}} to be a particularly exotic pet and in general its clinical medicine is very similar to feline clinical medicine, the interpretation of the ferret chemistry profile deserves special attention as there can be several pitfalls if ferret profiles are interpreted by comparing with cat or dog normal values. This article focuses on {{some of the most important}} clinical pathology parameters and their interpretation. As in other species, an exact diagnosis of a clinical problem should never be based on blood work alone, but should include an evaluation of other diagnostic tools such as biopsies. One abnormal parameter is rarely pathognomic for a problem, and often two or three clinical pathology parameters need to be assessed in order to better locate the potential origin of the clinical problem, especially if it is subclinical. If several different parameters are significantly altered, a preliminary diagnosis can be with a high degree of certainty and then pursued with <b>further</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> <b>Further</b> <b>diagnostics</b> approaches, eg, biopsies, should be recommended. The lecture presents clinical cases, which highlight the need to harvest biopsies early on in the diagnostic process in order to come to a definitive diagnosis and to establish an accurate treatment plan early on.
