We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E

500|$|On 2 February, Benfica {{played host to}} Boavista. They {{had several}} {{opportunities}} to beat William, but Boavista prevented them all. The match ended in a goalless draw, leaving Benfica one point away from the Estádio da Luz. Santos accepted the draw, saying, [...] "I {{do not like to}} speak about luck or misfortune. The ball <b>just</b> <b>would</b> not go in. That is it." [...] Eight days later, Benfica travelled to Estádio do Varzim to play the sixth round of the Portuguese Cup against Segunda Liga-side Varzim. The hosts opened the score with an own goal from Nélson in the 13th minute, but Benfica equalizer with a goal from Simão at the half-hour mark. In the second half, Varzim pressed again and António Mendonça scored a match-winning 77th-minute goal. Benfica's elimination at the hands of Varzim was the third time in Santos' career he was knocked-out of the Portuguese Cup by a team from lower divisions, the other clubs being Porto and Sporting.|$|E

Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would have been great to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe.

Benfica never beat Estrela's goalkeeper, Pedro Alves, drawing 0–0 and losing crucial points. Chalana said, [...] "We started the first half somewhat nervous. Not playing our best. However, the second half was different, we did everything to win, created opportunities but the ball <b>just</b> <b>would</b> not go in." [...] The draw left Benfica dependent on others to reach second place; even if they won, Sporting had to lose and Guimarães had to lose or draw. On 11 May, the club hosted Vitória de Setúbal. The match, attracting over 54,000 fans for Rui Costa's last game, was a 3–0 Benfica win. Sporting and Guimarães also won and Benfica finished fourth, missing a Champions League berth. It was their fifth finish outside the top three after fourth-place finishes in 1939–40, 1940–41 and 2001–02 and a sixth-place finish in 2000–01. Chalana said, [...] "Benfica is very big. We failed to reach our objectives, but nearly sold out the stadium today." [...] The club's season ended with an African tour in which they defeated a team with players from Sal and São Vicente on 17 May and the Angolan national team two days later.|$|E

Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't help feeling that nothing short of a stake through the heart is going to keep Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your spirit guide."

500|$|To {{compete with}} Nintendo, Sega was {{more open to}} new types of games than its rival, but still tightly {{controlled}} the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing. Technicians from American third-party video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989, following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system. The clean room reverse engineering was led by Steve Hayes and Jim Nitchals, lasting several months before EA secretly began game development. EA founder Trip Hawkins confronted Nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), noting that EA {{had the ability to}} run its own licensing program if Sega refused to meet its demands. Sega relented, and the next day EA's upcoming Genesis games were showcased at CES. EA signed what Hawkins described as [...] "a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement" [...] with Sega in June 1990: [...] "Among other things, we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted. We could approve our own titles... the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable. We also had more direct control over manufacturing." [...] After the deal was in place, EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon learned that [...] "we hadn't figured out all the workarounds" [...] and [...] "Sega still had the ability to lock us out," [...] noting [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>would</b> have been a public relations fiasco." [...] EA released its first two Genesis games, Populous and , within the month. The first Genesis version of EA's John Madden Football arrived before the end of 1990, and became what Gordon called a [...] "killer app" [...] for the system. Taking advantage of the licensing agreement, Gordon and EA's vice president of marketing services Nancy Fong created a visual identifier for EA's Genesis cartridges: A yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} the PTC mandate that passed Congress, Metra took steps to meet the deadline. Metra {{concluded}} that the December 31, 2015 mandate to have PTC running was an unreasonable requirement. This aligns with the stance taken by much of the railroad industry. This {{is due to a}} variety factors including but not limited to: delays from the government and the fundamental complexity of building a program from the ground up. Moreover, Metra estimates the cost of implementing the system on their [...] of track in the Chicago region to be over $200 million. The fear is this unfunded mandate will divert scarce capital funds from other essential needs. This includes building and maintaining existing tracks, stations, signals, and other equipment that ensures a safe operating environment for all of Metra’s passengers. However, Metra recognizes the need for PTC but <b>just</b> <b>would</b> like a more reasonable timeline to implement such a program. This recognition is partially based on Metra’s previous accident history. Two noteworthy events were a pair of accidents on the Rock Island District within a span of a couple of years. The first event was a derailment that occurred on October 12, 2003 when a train flew through a 10mph crossing at 68mph. A second very similar occurrence happened on September 17, 2005 but was more serious. This derailment killed 2 passengers and injured 117. Both of these incidents could have been prevented if PTC were in place. In both circumstances PTC would have overridden the engineer and slowed the train down to the appropriate speed to prevent an accident from occurring.|$|E
