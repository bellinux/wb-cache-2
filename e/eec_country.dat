It was 50% higher than the West German {{standard of}} living, and {{twice as high as}} the Italian {{standard of living}}. By the earlier Seventies, however, the UK standard of living was lower than all EEC countries apart from Italy (which, according to one calculation, was roughly equal to Britain). In 1951, the average weekly earnings of men over the age of 21 stood at £8 6s 0d, and nearly doubled a decade later to £15 7s 0d. By 1966, average weekly earnings stood at £20 6s 0d. Between 1964 and 1968, the percentage of households with a television set rose from 80.5% to 85.5%, a washing machine from 54% to 63%, a refrigerator from 35% to 55%, a car from 38% to 49%, a telephone from 21.5% to 28%, and central heating from 13% to 23%.|$|E

Forty-two of 431 abortions (9, 74 %) were diagnosed as septic abortions during 1998 at the I and II Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Rome La Sapienza, and are retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-four women (81 %) came from an <b>EEC</b> <b>country,</b> whereas 8 (19 %) from a developing country. Their mean age was 31, 4 years (range: 18 - 43 years). Eighteen patients (43 %) were nulliparous; 24 (57 %) multiparous; 14 (33 %) had previous abortions, none had previous septic abortions. Among risk factors, premature rupture of membranes was found in 5 cases (12 %); whereas amniocentesis, HIV positivity, diabetes, positive urine culture and illegal pregnancy termination procedures were found in 5 further cases. No risk factors were found in 76 % of patients. It is observed that, due to medical-scientific advances, previously unknown risk factors have emerged {{during the last three}} decades in Western Countries, such as invasive procedures of prenatal diagnosis, IUD contraception and AIDS immunodepression. However, other previously frequent risk factors, such as sepsis from illegal abortion, may emerge again in Countries where abortion is legal (such as Italy), due to massive immigration of clandestine women from developing Countries...|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. The {{invitation}} {{to speak on}} {{whether there is a}} latin model underlying the way human resources are managed in Spanish firms evoked in me a positive, albeit complex, reaction. Por one thing, the word "model" suggested a specific way of approaching and visualizing a complex situation before tackling it. The project of building up the European Community seems to qualify as a situation complex enough to call for different models and styles of going about it. Leaving aside other aspects of the problem, not all the <b>EEC</b> <b>countries</b> enjoy the same level of economic wellbeing. In addition there are considerable differences in the rate of industrialization achieved by <b>EEC</b> <b>countries.</b> England in the U. K. and the whole of central Europe are the EEC industrial belt that is far ahead of the Mediterranean member states. The imminent application of the "Acta Unica" has further aggravated the situation.

40|$|This thesis treats {{extremely}} present aspects {{regarding the}} evolutions {{of the emerging}} economies within the new member states of the European Union insisting on {{the analysis of the}} convergence process from a real perspective. Beside the achievement of a monetary union, one of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is represented by the reducing of the disparities regarding the level of development among the member states. One of the ways of appreciating the reduction of the disparities between the economies involve a reduction of the gap as far as the GDP level/inhabitant is concerned or in other words, a real convergence. A series of statistic data are analysed in order to point out {{the extent to which the}} central ad East-European states have managed to reduce the gap in report to the developed member states of the EMU, using indicators for the appreciation of the real convergence: the GDP per inhabitant, the monthly average salary, the poverty rate, the contribution of the main sectors of the economy in the formation of the GDP and the unemployment rate. From the analysis of the statistic data one can observe that the highest degree of real convergence is held by Slovenia, which distanced a lot from the other EEC states, followed by the Czech Republic. Regarding from the point of view of the evolution of the <b>EEC</b> <b>countries</b> during the entire analysed period, based on the dynamics of the indicators and of the speed of catching up the gaps we can also notice the performance of the Baltic countries.
