25|$|On 4 December 1290, {{the funeral}} cortège of Eleanor of Castile, {{accompanied}} {{by her husband}} King Edward <b>I,</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> Grantham on its way from Lincoln to Westminster Abbey.

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “I’m a trader,” Jaques remarked. “I want a {{fair profit}} {{on the money}} I lay out; but <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> that. All the money I take is for value supplied.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you suppose, then, {{that is why}} <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Rooi Krantz, just {{to breed}} horses? Has not your father {{told you about the}} great {{treasure}} hidden away up there among the Makalanga?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> your house, though," [...] I said, half {{ashamed of}} myself for venturing to make conditions, [...] "there's one promise {{you must make}} me--that I sha'n't see Dr. Ivor unless you let me know and get my consent beforehand." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> {{a certain}} {{expression}} which I fancied I saw in Mrs. Gray's face.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> this, confounded that I had run so far; he was observing {{me with a}} unfathomable face.|$|E
60|$|We {{walked on}} in silence, {{and then came}} {{to a place where}} several streets met. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the curb.|$|E
60|$|P. S. <b>I</b> shall <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Brandiger's Hotel, where I shall await you.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> for <b>at</b> {{this point}} no {{plausible}} {{reason for the}} girl's disappearance suggested itself.|$|R
60|$|Cristel and <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> him, <b>at</b> {{the same}} moment. We instinctively lifted our hands to our ears.|$|R
60|$|ASHER. No. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> {{the house}} to speak to Augusta, and then--(he speaks a trifle apologetically)--well, I went for a little walk.|$|E
6000|$|About {{this time}} {{having to go}} to Ireland, on my way back <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> Hawarden, and the {{following}} note gives a glimpse of Mr. Gladstone at this evil moment (Dec. 17):— ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Two weeks ago, in Boston," [...] said Gaites. [...] "Miss Axewright and <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the S. B. & H. C. freight-depot to {{see that}} your piano started off all right." ...|$|E
60|$|Had <b>I</b> only <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> {{the proper}} time, I {{could have made}} {{anything}} out of it.|$|R

60|$|The last night! Reserve slipped unheeded to the floor. Hendry wandered ben and but the house, and Jamie sat at {{the window}} holding his mother's hand. You must walk softly now if you would cross that humble threshold. <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the door. Then, as now, I was a lonely man, and when the last night came the attic was the place for me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>at</b> a loss how to {{describe}} my employment in terms which should tell her nothing, and which should {{at the same time}} successfully set her distrust of me at rest.|$|E
60|$|ABOUT noon <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the captain's {{door with}} some cooling drinks and medicines. He was lying {{very much as}} we had left him, only a little higher, and he seemed both weak and excited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he is a rale gintleman, sir, {{and mighty}} obliged I feel to him, for I {{have had enough}} of English prisons, though indeed, it was {{only three or four}} days that <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> Harwich." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{look upon}} {{her as an}} {{abandoned}} creature, and I tell you frankly <b>I</b> shall <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> nothing to save my son from her clutches.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave out}} another ringing peal, ran off {{into her own}} room, {{and slammed the door}} behind her, leaving me profoundly astounded. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> {{laughing}} <b>at</b> once.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, with {{a cry of}} horror, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> short. <b>At</b> my very feet, in {{the little}} circle of {{concentrated}} light thrown by the lantern, lay a white crushed, cylindrical mass.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{got to sit}} down," [...] he said. [...] "Now, {{after the}} way you fixed me up when <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> your ranch, you don't figure I'd let you go before you had some supper with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the Cross Roads Post Office. Lucky I did, or you'd hev had kempany on {{your hands}} afore you knowed it--this very night! I found this letter from Dr. Duchesne," [...] and he {{produced}} a letter from his pocket.|$|E
60|$|But {{the trouble}} was the blank incongruity of this {{serenity}} and the swift death flying yonder, not two miles away. There was a noise of business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the group of people.|$|E
60|$|There <b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{not feeling}} <b>at</b> all {{sure of the}} ground I was {{treading}} on.|$|R
60|$|The priest, {{observing that}} <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> to look <b>at</b> the grave, {{shook his head}} and sighed.|$|R

6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the day <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> Vernon, and the {{afternoon}} was well advanced when I came in sight of a little way-side house with a broad unfenced green in front of it, and a swinging sign which told the traveller that this was the [...] "Holly Sprig Inn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I too was {{dining out}} and <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> home on purpose to see you. But I didn't mean to-night, for {{you have done}} very well. I was quite {{intending}} to send for you--the other day. But something {{put it out of}} my head. Besides, I knew she wouldn't like it.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was between}} nine and ten o'clock when, strolling in a melancholy manner through the town, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Omer's door.

5000|$|Herbert E. Krugman wrote [...] "Why Three Exposures may be enough" [...] {{while he}} was {{employed}} at General Electric. His theory has been adopted and widely use in the advertising arena. The following statement s his theory: [...] "Let me try to explain the special qualities of one, two and three exposures. <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> three because as you shall see {{there is no such}} thing as a fourth exposure psychologically; rather fours, fives, etc., are repeats of the third exposure effect.|$|R
