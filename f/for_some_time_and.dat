5|$|Both the Grammar School and High School co-existed as {{voluntary}} aided schools until 1970 {{when they}} merged to become co-educational, with the Grammar School {{moving into the}} North Brink High School site under headmaster Dr. D.S. Anderson. Relations between the schools had always been close; the amalgamation had been planned <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> {{a number of new}} laboratories and classrooms had already been under construction on the North Brink site before the two schools merged. The school magazine Riverline was first published in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise soon {{arrives at}} Tarquin's planet. He welcomes Archer and Hoshi and soon agrees {{to work on}} reading the weapon fragment, but only if Sato agrees to remain with him.

5|$|The Germans rapidly {{realised}} that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers {{had grown}} to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedić government had no confidence in them. They were completely disbanded by March 1943. Pećanac himself was interned by the Nedić regime <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> was killed by agents of Mihailović in May or June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|When Gothenburg left Port Darwin on Tuesday, 16 February 1875, Captain Robert George Augustus Pearce {{was under}} orders to make best {{possible}} speed.

5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering the embassy compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia. Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the embassy {{with their families and}} about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal. Local banks had been closed <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the age of}} 14, Morrissey {{was one of two}} youth theatre {{members who}} sat {{on the board of the}} Everyman Theatre. Ian Hart, with whom he had been friends since the age of five, was one of his contemporaries, as were Mark and Stephen McGann and Cathy Tyson. Morrissey became friends with the McGann brothers, who {{introduced}} him to their brother Paul when Paul was on a break from studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). When Morrissey was 15 years old, his father developed a terminal blood disorder. He was ill <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> eventually died of a haemorrhage at the age of 54 in the family home. After leaving school at the age of 16, Morrissey joined a Wolverhampton theatre company, where he worked on sets and costumes.|$|E

5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1966, Nell {{was driving}} the family car with Harry as a passenger; {{they were going to}} the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had {{suffered}} heart trouble <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the shock of the accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Sharia (or Islamic law), {{the primary}} source of law in modern Saudi Arabia, was {{developed}} gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between the seventh and tenth centuries. From the time of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century, the developing Sharia was accepted as the basis of law in the towns of the Muslim world, including the Arabian peninsula, and upheld by local rulers, eclipsing urf (or pre-Islamic local customary law). In the rural areas, urf continued to be predominant <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and,</b> for instance, was the main source of law among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{circulation}} {{rose from}} 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by Analog {{among the other}} science-fiction magazines, and If won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including Galaxy and If, to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro {{when he heard the}} news, and decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management. He had been considering a return to a writing career <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> the change in ownership precipitated his decision to leave.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of the Keeper of the London Museum, Harmon Oates, Wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy. He had been considering a return to London <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> eagerly agreed, taking on the post, which was based at Lancaster House in the St James's area, in July 1926. In Wales, many felt that Wheeler had simply taken the directorship of the National Museum to advance his own career prospects, {{and that he had}} abandoned them when a better offer came along. Wheeler himself disagreed, believing that he had left Fox at the Museum as his obvious successor, and that the reforms he had implemented would therefore continue. The position initially provided Wheeler with an annual salary of £600, which resulted in a decline in living standards for his family, who moved into a flat near to Victoria Station.|$|E
5|$|Abdül Kadir {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople in October 1892. By 1895, the steel frames for her hull had been erected, but work {{proceeded}} very slowly and frequently stopped, primarily due to the chronically tight Ottoman budget. In 1897, for instance, work had been halted <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the contemporary journal Navy and Army Illustrated predicted that the ship would not be finished. Similar large-scale building projects during this period also fell apart {{due to lack of}} funds; a major construction program launched {{in the aftermath of the}} Ottoman Navy's poor performance in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 stalled after funds could not be appropriated for the new ships. By 1906, when work on Abdül Kadir stopped for the last time, the hull had been only partially plated. By this time, the blocks that supported the hull during construction had shifted, which destroyed the keel. As a result, the unfinished ship was broken up on the slipway in 1909.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 {{season the}} New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) {{suspended}} Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over a claim for expenses he had submitted to the Auckland Rugby Football Union for travel to play in the match against the British Isles. Eventually the matter was resolved when, under protest, Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's 1905–06 tour of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the New Zealand Natives, had preceded them in 1888–89.|$|E
5|$|During March and April, U.S. {{military}} intelligence began to detect {{elements of the}} PAVN 2nd Division moving towards Khâm Đức, but their opponent's true intentions were largely unknown. In response to {{what could be a}} major attack, General William Westmoreland decided to build up the defenses of the Khâm Đức Special Forces, by sending in U.S. Army engineers to upgrade the local airstrip for sustained use by large transport aircraft, as well as airlifting weapons and ammunition for the U.S.-led Detachment A-105. Australian-led 11th Mobile Strike Force (MSF) Company was ordered to take up positions in Ngok Tavak (Ngok Ta Vak), an outpost serving Khâm Đức, to boost allied intelligence-gathering capabilities in the area. However, unbeknownst to the United States and other allied forces, the Viet Cong (VC) 1st Regiment had been watching the build-up around Khâm Đức <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> were preparing to initiate the assault by taking out Ngok Tavak.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E
