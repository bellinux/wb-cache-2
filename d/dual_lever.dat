40|$|To date, 13 {{older adults}} (mean age= 79, SD = 9. 7) {{have participated in}} the study and have had no (n= 5), a mild (n= 4) or a {{moderate}} (n= 4) cognitive impairment. All participants are from the same long term care facility in Toronto, Canada. Data for three of the measures is presented by group in Figure 2. Examples of unsolicited comments made by participants during the trials include: “[I] had this kind as a child ”- Participant with a moderate impairment, regarding crosshead “[I] like something I have control over ”- Participant with a moderate impairment, regarding automatic “You can use your whole hand or just one finger. Nice looking. ”- Participant with no impairment, <b>dual</b> <b>lever</b> “Easy. If it's hard than I ask you for help. It's okay, We don't have it in my country. Only people with money, not easy or difficult, for older people it is harder”- Participant with a mild impairment, regarding single lever “Anyone in a hurry that would be good, don't have to use a lot of muscle power. I have weakness in my joints. Not good. Sometimes it takes a moment to come on and you might break the wand. ”- Participant with a moderate impairment, regarding plastic wand Objective The objective of this research is to determine what role familiarity plays in the usability of product operation by cognitively impaired older adults.

40|$|Twenty {{subjects}} with lower limb disabilities {{participated in a}} simulator study. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate how an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system together with two different hand controls for accelerator and brake influenced workload, comfort and driving behaviour and to further develop a method to evaluate vehicle adaptations for drivers with disabilities. The installed ACC system could maintain a constant speed selected and set by the driver and it also adapted speed in order to keep a safe distance to a leading vehicle. Furthermore, it included a stop-and-go function. Two common types of hand controls for accelerator and brake were used. The hand controls were different both with respect to function, single or dual levers, and position, on the steering column or between the front seats. The subjects were all experienced drivers of adapted cars equipped with hand controls. All subjects drove 100 km at two occasions, with and without the ACC system available but with the same hand control. Subjective workload was found to be significantly lower and performance better for the ACC condition. The difference in speed variation between manual and ACC supported driving increased with the distance driven which seems to support the previous finding. The subjects thought they could control both speed and distance to leading vehicles better while the ACC was available. ACC driving did not influence reaction time, speed level, lateral position or variation in lateral position. Headway during car following situations was shorter for the ACC condition compared to manual driving. The ACC was well received, trusted and wanted. It was concluded that the ACC system substantially decreased workload, increased comfort and did not influence safety negatively. The only difference found between the two types of hand controls was that drivers using the <b>dual</b> <b>lever</b> system had less variation in lateral position. The applied evaluation method proved to be useful but needs to be further developed...|$|E

5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments {{to cope with}} the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and <b>dual</b> brake <b>levers.</b> More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|R
50|$|Selec-Trac {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the full-size Jeeps (SJ) in 1983 using the New Process NP228 and NP229 transfer cases. These {{are very similar to}} the Quadra-Trac NP219 transfer case described in the next section below. The differences are 1) they added a 2WD mode for fuel savings and 2) the 2WD-to-4WD modes were controlled via a vacuum switch on the dashboard. The Hi-N-Lo range selection was still performed using a shift lever on the console. The NP228 differs from the NP229 by not having the viscous coupling in 4WD Hi mode, reverting to a simpler open center differential. Both transfer cases still lock the center differential in 4WD Lo mode. The NP228/229 transfer cases were available in the full-size Jeeps from 1983 to 1991. The NP228 was also available in the XJ Cherokee and Wagoneers and the MJ Comanche pickups from 1984 until replaced by the NP242 in 1987. Several companies have offered a <b>dual</b> shift <b>lever</b> conversion which replaces the vacuum switch and solenoid with a more reliable second console lever for 2WD-4WD mode selection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new beating machine {{based on a}} <b>dual</b> cam and <b>lever</b> {{mechanism}} to operate flapping and torsion motions of a dragonfly wing. The beating machine was designed according to the time dependent variation in flapping angle and in torsion angle of a free flight dragonfly. Our experiment {{results show that the}} variations in flapping angle and in torsion angle of a wing on beating machine agree well with those of a real free flight dragonfly wing, confirming that our beating machine is available for studying the beating performance. We then use the beating machine to study the aerodynamic force and inertia affecting on the wing by comparing the flapping angle and torsion angle under the normal and vacuum conditions...|$|R
40|$|The adapted {{recumbent}} {{project was}} to redesign a disabled veteran’s recumbent bicycle. The main areas of concern were the crank pedal, chain tension, braking and steering system, and ergonomics. Since the customer is an avid biker, this bike will be used often, so the design {{is based on the}} ease of repair and replacement. The crank system was redesigned to a lightweight, adjustable part with chain clearance and high strength. The chain tension was improved by replacing the existing single idler wheel/chain tube system with a dual idler wheel system. The dual idler has a titanium sprocket in one of the wheels and a smooth low friction surface for the other wheel. A rear mechanical disc brake was added with a locking brake lever. The locking brake was added {{to make it easier for}} the user to get in and out of the seat. A weld was made on the rear seat stay in order to place a bracket for the rear brake calipers. The front hydraulic brakes were replaced with two mechanical disc brakes with mechanical lines routed to a single <b>dual</b> pull <b>lever.</b> Additional custom seat padding was made specifically for this recumbent tricycle. Using closed cell foam in a nylon cover with sewn on straps, the new seat simply attaches to the existing seat for increased comfort. Total cost for the entire project was $ 1489. 86. A cost breakdown for each specific system is provided in the report. Testing for all implemented systems was conducted and verified using the design specifications as stated in the report. All systems have passed specified design criteria...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{pilot study}} used a CONFORmat® Pressure mat {{to measure the}} {{position}} and movement of the centre of force measured at the buttock/seat interface of users whilst seated in three different one arm drive wheelchairs during propulsion. The manual wheelchairs included were: a <b>dual</b> handrim, a <b>lever</b> drive and a Neater Uni-wheelchair. Methods: 15 hemiplegic user’s propelled each wheelchair around an indoor course during which the centre of force was continuously recorded. Position and movements of the centre of force in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were recorded. The time taken to complete the circuit was also recorded. Standard deviations and 95 % confidence intervals for each participant in each wheelchair were calculated to determine statistically significant differences. Results: Movement of the centre of force was greatest in the dual handrim wheelchair, both antero-posteriorly [F(2, 39) = 21. 696, p< 0. 001] and mediolaterally [F(2, 39) = 44. 273, p< 0. 001]. Position of the centre of force was also anteriorly displaced in the dual handrim wheelchair, [F(2, 39) = 15. 57, p< 0. 001]. There {{were no significant differences}} in the position of the centre of force in the medio-lateral direction. [F(2, 39) = 2. 488, p= 0. 096] Conclusions: The dual handrim wheelchair produced the greatest movement of centre of force and the lever wheelchair produced the least. This may be indicative of the symmetry and stability of seated posture in hemiplegic one arm drive wheelchair users...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to compare the {{vertical}} reaction forces (N) generated in three different Action 3 manual one-arm drive wheelchairs: <b>dual</b> handrim, a <b>lever</b> drive and a Neater Uni-wheelchair (NUW). A CONFORmat® Pressure measurement mat, placed {{on top of the}} users' prescribed cushion, measured vertical force at the buttock/seat interface on both hemiplegic and non-hemiplegic sides in each wheelchair. Methods: Fifteen hemiplegic users were randomly assigned each wheelchair to drive around an indoor obstacle course. During propulsion of a multiple sensor, continuous measurement of force was recorded. Time taken to complete the circuit was recorded. Mean force and confidence intervals for each buttock were calculated per user per wheelchair. Results: The dual handrim produced the highest vertical force during propulsion under the right buttock ([Formula: see text] = 484. 43; SD = 55. 4; p < 0. 001) and the lever drive produced the least force ([Formula: see text] = 368. 05; SD = 53. 55; p < 0. 01). The NUW completed the course quickest (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: The dual-handrim wheelchair requires the greatest vertical force during propulsion. Since increases in this seat vertical reaction force {{may be related to the}} propulsive force. Further investigation is indicated as this may be a significant factor for clinicians when prescribing one-arm drive wheelchairs.

50|$|The FN40GL {{is deemed}} a third {{generation}} grenade launcher, meaning it is multifunctional: {{it can be}} used mounted to the rifle or as a standalone system; it is manufactured using a number of materials like aluminum, composites, and polymers; the breech opens to the side for use of longer 40 mm rounds including less-lethal; and it is mounted on the bottom accessory rail instead of requiring specialized mounting hardware. The FN40GL is attached to SCAR rifles on the bottom rail with a trigger adapter and <b>dual</b> locking clamp <b>levers</b> on the launcher, limiting the ability to integrate with other rifles. Barrel length is 9.6 in, and is unique in that it is the only system where the barrel can swivel to the left or right for loading, while other breech loading launchers pivot specifically to one side. This enhances its ambidextrousness, making it easy for a left-handed operator to load under fire. The standalone stock assembly has the FN40GL mounted to the bottom rail as with the rifle, but still has 3 o’clock, 6 o’clock, and 9 o’clock rail positions for other accessories. This is mainly during non-lethal uses for other mounted additions like LED lights and laser dazzlers. The trigger is placed lower than normal for operation with the user's middle finger, while keeping their trigger finger free to use the rifle. The double-action trigger is long and heavy to prevent easily and unintentionally firing a round under stress.|$|R
