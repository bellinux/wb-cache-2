50|$|Crescents are {{a type of}} {{artifact}} {{or group}} of artifacts that are somewhat morphologically diverse, but typically consist of a chipped-stone tool that is bilaterally symmetrical, bifacially pressure flaked, may have winged edges, and typically have <b>edge-grinding.</b> Crescents are typically found as part of surface assemblages as opposed to well-dated subsurface contexts, and lack good chronology which would indicate if the degree of morphological variability represents changes over time, or if the differences represent regional expressions. Crescent morphology has been subdivided into three groups including lunate, winged, and eccentric crescents. Lunate crescents typically have a curved/convex proximal lateral edge with a generally straight to convex distal lateral edge. Winged crescents are characterized by convex proximal lateral edge and a concave distal lateral edge. Some eccentric crescents {{have been described as}} being shaped like animals such as bears, while others consist of serrated or barbed edges. The most common materials crescents are made of include chert, chalcedony, and jasper - all strong and durable lithic materials that are not as brittle as obsidian; however, although its rare, some crescents are made of obsidian.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{grinding}} {{of stone}} to make sharp cutting edges did not evolve {{with the emergence}} of biologically modern humans in Africa, but late in the Pleistocene at the completion or nearcompletion of the Out-of-Africa 2 migration. Here we discuss the earliest securely-dated fragment of ground-edge axe from Australia, dated at 35, 500 cal. bp, an age slightly older or comparable to the earliest ages for <b>edge-grinding</b> from the Pacific Ocean's western seaboard. In this region ground-edge axes did not evolve {{with the emergence of}} agriculture, nor for the clearance of forests, but, rather, as socially mediated technology, part of the development of symbolic storage that is the hallmark of the evolution of cognitively modern humans at the geographical end, during, or following, Out-of-Africa 2...|$|E
