To ensure they do not show on screen, they would spray the wires in the same colour as the set background. If the wires were shown, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> overseas for editing which was not popular at that time. However, no wires were used in the scene where actor Chin Siu-ho performed a back-flip up the door.|$|E
500|$|Controversy ensued {{when the}} Soviets wanted {{to back out}} of the refereeing agreement. The Soviets wanted to include the German pair of referees, {{originally}} scheduled for the game. Eagleson threatened to pull Team Canada from playing the eighth game. In a compromise, Kompalla refereed along with Bata instead of Baader. The ill will spilled over into the presentation of a totem pole as a gift from Team Canada. The pre-game presentation was cancelled by the Soviets, but restored on the insistence of Team Canada. According to Coach Sinden, Eagleson stated that they [...] "were going to take this totem pole and bring it to centre ice and they'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> or skate around it the whole game." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One of Us Must Know" [...] is a {{straightforward}} {{account of a}} burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: [...] "I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You {{just happened to be}} there, that's all." [...] "One of Us Must Know" [...] was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern. [...] "You could take the show seriously {{just as long as}} you didn’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> seriously, as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics," [...] wrote Aaron Bady of The New Republic, who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing. [...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Revere {{was back}} hitting mainly {{at the top of}} the order after manager Charlie Manuel decided to adjust the lineup in hopes of {{sparking}} some offense. He managed two hits in a game against the Miami Marlins on June 3, stole two bases, and stopped an extra-base hit from Adeiny Hechavarria. [...] "I just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> one game at a time and not put any pressure on myself. I'm finding my stroke", Revere later said of the game. On July 13, Revere suffered a fractured foot after a foul ball hit him while at-bat. He had surgery for the fracture on July 16. Although the initial timetable for Revere's return was six to eight weeks, the Phillies official website later published an article stating that there was no timetable for his return and they were unsure whether or not he will return for a remainder of the 2013 season. He ended up missing the rest of the 2013 season, and finished with a [...]305 batting average, 0 home runs, 17 runs batted in and 22 stolen bases.|$|E
