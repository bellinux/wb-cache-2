50|$|Run on assays {{have been}} largely supplanted with Global Run on assays that use next {{generation}} DNA sequencing as a readout platform. These assays are known as GRO-Seq and provide an incredibly detailed view of genes engaged in transcription with quantitative levels of <b>expression.</b> <b>Array</b> based methods for analyzing Global run on (GRO) assays are being replaced with Next Generation Sequencing which eliminates the design of probes against gene sequences. Sequencing will catalog all transcripts produced {{even if they are}} not reported in databases. GRO-seq involves the labeling of newly synthesized transcripts with bromouridine (BrU). Cells or nuclei are incubated with BrUTP in the presence of Sarkosyl which prevents the attachment of RNA polymerase to the DNA. Therefore only RNA polymerase that are already on the DNA before the addition of Sarkosyl will produce new transcripts that will be labeled with BrU. The labeled transcripts are captured with anti-BrU antibody labeled beads, converted to cDNAs and then sequenced by Next Generation DNA sequencing. The sequencing reads are then aligned to the genome and number of reads per transcript provide an accurate estimate of the number of transcripts synthesized.|$|E

To gain insight into molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of cancer, this cDNA <b>expression</b> <b>array</b> technique could be a useful tool, however, no established methods for interpreting the results are yet available. We used the Atlas cancer cDNA <b>expression</b> <b>array</b> (Clontech, USA) for analysing total RNA isolated from four human endometrial carcinoma samples (two cell-lines and two tissue samples), one benign endometrial tissue sample and a human breast cancer cell-line, in order to develop a method for analysing the array data. The obtained gene-expression profiles were highly reproducible. XY-scatterplots and regression analysis of the logarithmic transformed data provided a practical method to analyse the data without the need of preceding normalization. Three genes (Decorin, TIMP 3 and Cyclin D 1) were identified to be differentially expressed between the benign endometrial tissue sample and the endometrial carcinoma samples (tissue and cell-lines). These three genes may potentially be involved in cancer progression. A higher degree of similarity in gene-expression profile was found between the endometrial samples (tissue and cell-lines) than between the endometrial samples and the breast cancer cell-line, which is indicative for an endometrial tissue-specific gene-expression profile. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

Many macrophage genes {{were found to be}} modulated after 5 h of in vitro infection with L. pneumophila. In particular, {{it was found that the}} monocyte chemotactic protein 3 (MCP- 3) gene expression was significantly induced by infection with virulent L. pneumophila but not with avirulent L. pneumophila. In contrast, other chemokine genes, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1 a, were induced by both virulent and avirulent L. pneumophila. Reverse transcription (RT) -PCR assay of total RNA isolated from macrophages infected with the bacteria for 5 or 24 h confirmed the differential induction of the chemokine genes by virulent versus avirulent L. pneumophila. Thus, the cDNA <b>expression</b> <b>array</b> technique readily revealed differential induction by L. pneumophila infection of select chemokine genes of macrophages from more than 1, 100 genes.
