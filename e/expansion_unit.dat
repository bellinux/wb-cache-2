25|$|Expandable to 320KB with Commodore 1764 256KB RAM <b>Expansion</b> <b>Unit</b> (REU); {{although}} only 64KB directly accessible; REU mostly intended for GEOS. REUs of 128KB and 512KB, originally {{designed for the}} C128, were also available, but required the user to buy a stronger power supply from some third party supplier; with the 1764 this was included. Creative Micro Designs also produced a 2MB REU for the C64 and C128, called the 1750XL. The technology actually supported up to 16MB, but 2MB was the biggest one officially made. Expansions of up to 16MB were also possible via the CMD SuperCPU.|$|E

5000|$|The PPG Wave can be {{connected}} to multiple peripheral PPG components simultaneously, such as a [...] "smart" [...] keyboard controller (PRK), 8-voice <b>expansion</b> <b>units</b> (EVU), and a wave computer called Waveterm for sampling, editing, sequencing and creating user defined wavetables.

50|$|The 5161 was an {{expansion}} chassis that used an identical case and power supply as the XT but had {{instead of a}} system board a backplane with 8 card slots (and no microprocessor). The 5161 came with a 10 MB hard drive and had room for another one. The 5161 {{was connected to the}} 5160 using an Extender Card in the system unit and a Receiver Card in the <b>Expansion</b> <b>Unit,</b> connected by a custom cable. The <b>Expansion</b> <b>Unit</b> could also contain extra memory, but the Extender card inserted wait states for memory in the <b>Expansion</b> <b>Unit,</b> so it was preferable to install memory onto the XT system board or on memory cards in slots plugged into the XT system board directly. The 5161 could be connected to either an XT or to the earlier 5150 (the original IBM PC). This expansion feature was not available for later machines like the IBM PC AT and in fact the 5161 is completely incompatible with anything but an 8088-based PC.|$|E
5000|$|The TI-99/4's {{original}} expansion {{concept was}} that peripherals would be connected serially to the console and each other, in a [...] "daisy-chain" [...] fashion. The [...] "sidecar" [...] <b>expansion</b> <b>units</b> can be connected {{together in a}} continuing chain, but can rapidly occupy an entire desktop and cause crashes and lockups due to {{the large numbers of}} connectors on the system bus.|$|R
50|$|Neyveli Thermal Power Station {{is a set}} {{of power}} plant {{situated}} near lignite mines of Neyveli. It consists of two distinct units (Neyveli Thermal Power Station I and Neyveli Thermal Power Station II) capable of producing 1020 MW and 1,970 MW respectively including their <b>expansion</b> <b>units.</b> It is operated by NLC. The total installed capacity of this station is 2990 MW as of December 2014.|$|R
50|$|Because window air {{conditioner}} units have condensers and <b>expansion</b> <b>units,</b> {{some of them}} can be used as makeshift dehumidifiers by sending their heat exhaust back into the same room as the cooled air, instead of the outside environment. If the condensate from the cooling coils is drained away from the room as it drips off the cooling coils, the result will be room air that is drier but slightly warmer.|$|R
50|$|The Super 1750 Clone was a 512 kB RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> {{designed}} as a tiny, but compatible, third-party replacement for Commodore's then out-of-production CBM 1750 REU. Manufactured by Chip Level Designs, the Super 1750 Clone was sold by Software Support International.|$|E
50|$|The Model I used a Zilog Z80 {{processor}} clocked at 1.77 MHz (the later {{models were}} shipped with a Z80A processor). The basic model originally shipped with 4 kB of RAM, and later 16 kB, {{in the main}} computer. The <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> allowed for RAM expansion {{for a total of}} 48K. Its other strong features were its full stroke QWERTY keyboard, small size, well written Microsoft floating-point BASIC and inclusion of a monitor and tape deck for approximately half the cost of the Apple II. Eventually, 5.25 inch floppy drives were made available by Tandy and several third party manufacturers. The <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> allowed up to four floppy drives to be connected, provided a slot for the RS-232 option and a parallel port for printers.|$|E
50|$|RAM pack, RAMpack, RAM {{expansion}} cartridge, RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>unit</b> (REU), memory expansion pak {{and memory}} module {{are some of}} the most common names given to various self-contained units or cartridges that expand a computer, games console or other device's own internal RAM in a user-friendly manner.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{the chip}} {{was used in}} the Yamaha SFG-01 and SFG-05 FM Sound Synthesizer <b>units.</b> These are <b>expansion</b> <b>units</b> for MSX {{computers}} and were already built into some Yamaha MSX machines like the CX5M. Later SFG-05 modules contain the YM2164 (OPP), an almost identical chip that differs only in a few undocumented registers and is otherwise identical. The SFGs were followed by the Yamaha FB-01, a standalone version powered exclusively by the YM2164.|$|R
50|$|On April 2007 the {{deployment}} was concentrated along the 210 magnetic meridian, which means {{north and south}} of Japan. However, during the current stage of <b>expansion,</b> <b>units</b> are also being deployed along the geomagnetic equator, in places such as Malaysia,Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Brazil, Antarctica, and from October 2012 Ecuador. Data from each unit is sent in real time to a data center located at SERC (Space Environment Research Center of Kyushu University).|$|R
50|$|With hindsight, {{the machine}} lacked the RAM (a typical program {{would need to}} fit in only around 20 kB once display memory is subtracted) and {{processing}} power {{to take on the}} prevailing Spectrum and Commodore 64. Despite this, several features that would later be associated with BBC Master and Archimedes were first features of Electron <b>expansion</b> <b>units,</b> including ROM cartridge slots and the Advanced Disc Filing System, a hierarchical improvement to the BBC's original Disc Filing System.|$|R
