5|$|In 1877 Lieutenant Kitchener, of the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> survey team, {{reported}} uncovering an Arabic inscription {{buried in}} {{the wall of the}} village mosque recording its building and dedication. He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea. He noted that they would probably have to repeat the payment.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{her mother}} and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened {{department}} of Egyptology at University College London (UCL) in Bloomsbury, Central London. Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards, one of the co-founders of the Egypt <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> (EEF), the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, and based in the Edwards Library of UCL's South Cloisters. Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, {{as part of a}} class composed largely of other women and older men. There, she took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively.|$|E

25|$|The next {{important}} excavation works {{took place}} from 1903 to 1907 {{under the direction}} of Henri Édouard Naville, who worked there on behalf of the Egypt <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund.</b> He was the first to undertake a systematic exploration of the temple.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his musical work, Grove had a deep and scholarly knowledge of the Bible. He contributed to the English literature on the subject, including a concordance in 1854 and about a thousand pages of Sir William Smith's 1863 Bible Dictionary. He was a co-founder of the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund.</b>|$|E
25|$|The arch was {{identified}} in 1864 by 19th-century explorer and surveyor Charles William Wilson, {{for whom it}} is now named. Wilson had joined the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1864, continuing {{to participate in the}} city surveying project that was established to improve the city's water system. The Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> (PEF) later commissioned him to survey Western Palestine, as well.|$|E

25|$|An early {{school of}} modern Palestinian {{archaeology}} {{was led by}} William F. Albright, whose work focused on biblical narratives. Albright himself held that Frederick Jones Bliss (1857–1939) {{was the father of}} Palestinian archaeology, although Bliss is not well known in the field. Jeffrey A. Blakely attributes this to Bliss' successor at the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund,</b> R.A.S. Macalister (1870–1950), who underplayed his predecessor's achievements.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, Howard Carter and {{his father}} Samuel visited Didlington Hall to study the {{artefacts}} at the estate's museum. The two were known for their illustrations and drawings and were acquaintances of the family. Lady Margaret, who was impressed by young Howard's talent, assisted in arranging an apprenticeship for him from the Egypt <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund,</b> as a tracer of drawings and inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, aged 24, Kitchener was {{assigned}} by the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> to a mapping-survey of the Holy Land, replacing Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake, who had died of malaria. By then {{an officer in the}} Royal Engineers, Kitchener joined fellow officer Claude R. Conder; between 1874 and 1877 they surveyed Palestine, returning to England only briefly in 1875 after an attack by locals at Safed, in Galilee.|$|E

25|$|The British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem began {{operating}} in 1921, after R. A. Stewart Macalister and Duncan Mackenzie of the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> {{appealed to the}} British government {{for the establishment of}} a local antiquities authority. Macalister and Mackenzie expressed concern over the dangers posed to archaeological sites on account of the battles being fought throughout the land. Mackenzie was also wary of fellahin raiding archaeological sites and stealing artifacts.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, a {{team from}} the Royal Engineers, led by Lieutenant Charles Warren and financed by the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> (P.E.F.), {{discovered}} a series of underground tunnels near the Temple Mount. Warren secretly excavated some tunnels near the Temple Mount walls {{and was the first}} one to document their lower courses. Warren also conducted some small scale excavations inside the Temple Mount, by removing rubble that blocked passages leading from the Double Gate chamber.|$|E
25|$|The {{past and}} present {{directors}} of the museum have been enabled {{from time to time}} to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; D. G. Hogarth made tentative researches on behalf of the Egypt <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.|$|E

25|$|Reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{worked from}} April to provide aerial photographs to update and correct existing maps, {{the best of}} which had been produced in 1881 by Lieutenant Herbert Kitchener, R.E., and Lieutenant Claude Conder for the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund.</b> The Royal Flying Corps surveyed hundreds of square miles, taking comprehensive aerial photographs of the Gaza to Beersheba line, which were used by Royal Engineers from Army Headquarters' survey companies to produce constantly revised maps showing changes to the Ottoman defences. Changes were also immediately reported to the area commander.|$|E
25|$|The William Burges {{collection}} of armoury was bequeathed {{to the museum}} in 1881. In 1882, the Museum {{was involved in the}} establishment of the independent Egypt <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, A.W. Franks, was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 finger rings, 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 netsuke, 850 inro, over 30,000 bookplates and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the Oxus Treasure.|$|E
25|$|By 1866 the {{collection}} consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations {{started to come}} to the museum {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century as a result of the work of the Egypt <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> under the efforts of E.A. Wallis Budge. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from Amarna, Bubastis and Deir el-Bahari. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including Flinders Petrie's Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the Oxford University Expedition to Kawa and Faras in Sudan.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> {{founded in}} 1865 {{completing}} its survey of excavatable sites in Palestine in 1880 began excavating in 1890 {{at the site}} of ancient Lachish near Jerusalem, {{the first of a series}} planned under the licensing system of the Ottoman Empire. Under their auspices in 1908 Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger began excavation at Jericho previously excavated for the first time by Sir Charles Warren in 1868. They discovered a Neolithic and Bronze Age city there. Subsequent excavations in the region by them and others turned up other walled cities that appear to have preceded the Bronze Age urbanization.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Evans {{began to}} {{negotiate}} {{for the land}} purchase of the Knossos site. He established the Cretan <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund,</b> with only his own money at first, and by 1896 the fund had purchased one-fourth of Kephala Hill, on which the ruins were located, with first option to buy the rest. However, he could not obtain a firman excavation permit from the Ottoman government. He returned to Britain. In January 1897, the Christian population of Crete staged its final insurrection against the Ottoman Empire. The last Ottoman troops were ferried off the island by the British fleet on December 5, 1898. In that year also, Evans and his friends returned to finish paying for the site. By this time, the Fund had other contributors as well. In 1899, the Constitution of a new Cretan Republic went into effect. Once Arthur had received permission to excavate from the local authorities, excavation on the hill began on 23 March 1900.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to al-Kabri {{which is located}} east of the site, during the Ottoman Period, two additional Arab villages were founded on the actual site – en-Nahr and et-Tell – in the southern and western portions of the tel, respectively. All three villages were close to the major springs, but during most of their existence, they were sparsely populated – in the low hundreds. Al-Kabri appears as Kabli and En-Nahr appears as el-Qahweh in the first topographic map of the region made in 1799 by Napoleon's cartographer, Pierre Jacotin. This same map does not show Et-Tell, and only shows a mill in that location. Et-Tell does appear in the later Palestine <b>Exploration</b> <b>Fund</b> map of 1880, and is talked about by Victor Guérin in his travelogue of the area, published that same year, which described all three villages. Karmon hypothesised that the new village of et-Tell might have been founded by villagers from el-Qahweh as a home for mill workers. The three villages existed up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War when they were depopulated.|$|E
