5|$|Martin Peerson (or Pearson, Pierson) (born between 1571 and 1573; died December 1650 or January 1651 {{and buried}} 16 January 1651) was an English composer, organist and virginalist. Despite Roman Catholic leanings {{at a time}} when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal</b> not to {{subscribe}} to Church of England beliefs and practices, he was highly esteemed for his musical abilities and held posts at St Paul's Cathedral and, it is believed, Westminster Abbey. His output included both sacred and secular music in forms such as consort music, keyboard pieces, madrigals and motets.|$|E

5|$|The Treasury {{announced}} {{the new design}} on December 19, 1921. Photographs of Baker and de Francisci examining the final plaster model appeared in newspapers, along with written descriptions of the designs, since the Treasury at that time took the position that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal</b> for photographs of a United States coin to be printed in a newspaper. Secretary Mellon gave formal approval to the design on December 20. As {{it would take the}} Mint several days to produce working dies, the first strike of the new coins was scheduled for December 29.|$|E
5|$|The German Church of Scientology has {{repeatedly}} challenged {{the legality of}} this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff {{and members of the}} Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal</b> for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was {{reported}} at Lilongwe's Kamuzu Central Hospital in 1985. President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal</b> for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E

5|$|In 1624, a {{fatality}} occurred {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman, Edward Tye, {{who was trying to}} hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality. The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first Laws of Cricket were encoded in 1744, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal</b> to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, {{along with}} the SA and several other {{paramilitary}} units, took part in what would {{become known as the}} Beer Hall Putsch. The plan was to take control of Munich and then seize total power in Berlin. The coup d'état failed and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 police officers. In the aftermath of the putsch both Hitler and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were officially disbanded. Berchtold then left Germany and fled to Tirol, Austria. Berchtold was tried in absentia before the special People's Court in Munich in 1924 {{for his role in the}} Beer Hall Putsch and sentenced to a prison term. During his time in Austria, Berchtold continued to be involved with Nazi Party activities, even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Preparations for the ZNG {{began on}} 12 April 1991. Its {{formation}} {{as a police}} force with military capability was considered necessary by Croatian authorities after March clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes {{and the possibility of}} further confrontation with the JNA. Since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal</b> to establish a separate military in a constituent republic of Yugoslavia, the ZNG was planned as part of the police force under the Ministry of the Interior. Parliament amended the Internal Affairs Act on 18 April, and the ZNG was formally established five days later. It was tasked with the protection of the constitutional order, the maintenance of public order, anti-terrorist operations, the protection of Croatia's borders, territory, coast and territorial waters, valuable structures and high-profile individuals. Although the ZNG was formally subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior, its founding legislation stipulated that it would be commanded by the Ministry of Defence.|$|E

5|$|Spain forbade its American colonies {{to trade}} with other nations or foreign colonies, and imposed itself as the only buyer and vendor for their {{international}} trade. This situation damaged the viceroyalty, as Spain's economy was not powerful enough to produce the huge supply of goods that the numerous colonies would need. This caused economic shortages and recession. The Spanish trade routes favored the ports of Mexico and Lima, {{to the detriment of}} Buenos Aires. As a result, Buenos Aires smuggled those products that could not be obtained legitimately. Most local authorities allowed this smuggling as a lesser evil, even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal,</b> and it occasionally equalled in volume the legal commerce with Spain. Two antagonistic factions emerged: the landowners wanted free trade so they could sell their products abroad, while the merchants, who benefited from the high prices of smuggled imports, opposed free trade because prices would come down.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal.</b> In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>illegal</b> to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E
