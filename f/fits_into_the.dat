5|$|Set in 1920, {{the film}} follows the {{experiences}} of Tom Birkin (Colin Firth), who has been employed under a bequest to carry out restoration work on a Medieval mural discovered in a church in the small rural community of Oxgodby, Yorkshire. The escape to the idyllic countryside is cathartic for Birkin, haunted by his experiences in World War I. Birkin soon <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> slow-paced life of the remote village, and {{over the course of}} a summer uncovering a painting begins to lose his trauma-induced stammer and tics.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> health system. Preventive {{care is a}} crucial part of healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

5|$|Some {{instruments}} {{fall into}} more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range {{as part of their}} name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone horn, alto flute, bass guitar, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabass clarinet. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.|$|E

25|$|The {{key idea}} of {{tabulation}} hashing is {{to view a}} key as a vector of t r-bit numbers, use a lookup table filled with random values to compute a hash value {{for each of the}} r-bit numbers representing a given key, and combine these values with the bitwise binary exclusive or operation. The choice of r should be made {{in such a way that}} this table is not too large; e.g., so that it <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> computer's cache memory.|$|E

On a CDMA network, however, the phone connects to the network using an ESN. All prior models have used regular mini-SIM cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> micro-SIM tray.|$|E
25|$|The Colt Bisley was {{introduced}} in 1894 as a target pistol. The name Bisley came from the famous firing range in Bisley, England. The Colt Bisley can be distinguished by the longer grip, the wider hammer spur, and the wider trigger. The distinguishing feature of the Bisley Target Model is the topstrap, which is flat and fitted with a sliding rear sight, adjustable for windage only. The front sight is a removable blade, which <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> slotted base attached to the barrel. The revolvers were supplied with different blades for elevation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the normal}} {{anatomy of the}} hip joint, the root (the thigh bone) is {{connected}} to the pelvis at the hip joint. The almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> acetabulum (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the acetabulum are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to support body weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, discussed in this article, trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|If the incisions to {{the breast}} are satisfactory, the patient’s {{homeostasis}} is feasible at that juncture of the mastopexy operation. The surgeon then evaluates the tissue-thickness of the medial pedicle flap, and its physical capability for rotating in a superomedial direction (above {{and to the}} center) with no resultant torsion tension to the tissue of the inferior portion of the pedicle; afterwards, the surgeon reduces the tissue thickness of the skin pedicle. Once positioned superiorly, the pedicle tissue thickness is reviewed to ascertain that it <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new position, without undue pressure or constriction; thus are assured the tissue viability of the medial pedicle and of the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} {{area and}} aisle are paved with coloured, plain encaustic tiles whose layout pattern {{was designed by}} Mallinson and Barber; the floor under the pews retains its original floor boards. The organ was made by F.W. Jardine for Kirtland and Jardine in 1870, and was fully restored in 1990. It <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> organ arch, which was designed for its dimensions. The original 1870 carved oak pulpit on its carved stone plinth stands in its original position {{in front of the}} north side of the chancel arch. Many of the original pews designed by Mallinson and Barber still exist in situ, but the ones at the back of the nave were removed along with the marble font in the 1980s when the church room was constructed there.|$|E

25|$|Kileak: The DNA Imperative is a first-person shooter, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} an International Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) polar operative Matt Coda in an armored SJ 107 assault suit. The player can advance and retreat, move {{from side to side}} and rotate the camera in any direction. The game is set in a South Pole observation base, which is composed of floors connected by elevators. On each floor, the player must find an elevator in order to proceed to the level below. The requirements are varied between floors, with many levels requiring the use of key cards to open locked doors, while some doors are opened by puzzle solving. On reaching the elevator to the next floor, the player can save their progress to a memory card that <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> accompanying PlayStation.|$|E
25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson {{counter that}} their theory distinguishes between {{political}} and economic institutions {{and that it is}} not political institutions that contribute to growth directly but economic institutions shaped by the political institutions. In the case of China, even though the political institutions on a higher level are far from inclusive, the incentive to reform Chinese economy does come from political institutions; in 1978 from Deng Xiaoping's Opening up policy {{at the end of the}} internal political feud during the Cultural Revolution. This exactly <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> theory that the change in political institutions has shaped economic institutions and thus has influenced economic performance. This economic growth is further expected to shape the political institutions in China in the future. One can only say that China is an outlier to the theory when in the future China becomes as wealthy as U.S. or Germany but still remains an authoritarian regime.|$|E
25|$|The South Court {{is a large}} court {{between the}} South Tomb and the pyramid. Within the court are curved stones thought to be {{territorial}} markers associated with the Heb-sed festival, an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers. These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt, while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue {{to benefit from the}} ritual in the afterlife. At {{the southern end of the}} court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne. This <b>fits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship. At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.|$|E
