Pentiti Tommaso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno later said Leggio personally shot Scaglione dead because he either did {{not want him to}} help deliver an acquittal for one of the Corleonesi boss's rivals or {{he did not want to}} leave someone who <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of his secrets alive. Leggio would later be tried twice for killing Scaglione but was acquitted for insufficient evidence.|$|E

It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down.

500|$|McCartney's {{first serious}} girlfriend in Liverpool was {{seventeen}} year old Dorothy [...] "Dot" [...] Rhone (a bank clerk or a cashier at a chemist's, according to varying accounts), {{whom he had}} met at The Casbah Club in 1959. McCartney picked out the clothes he liked Rhone to wear and told her which make up to use, also paying {{for her to have}} her blonde hair done in the style of Brigitte Bardot, whom both he and John Lennon idolised. He disliked Rhone seeing her friends, and stopped her from smoking, even though he did so himself. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with The Beatles he wrote regular letters to Rhone, and she accompanied Lennon's girlfriend, Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when the group played there again in 1962. According to Rhone, McCartney bought her a gold ring in Hamburg, a leather skirt, took her sightseeing, and was very attentive and caring. For the time Rhone was there, the couple lived in a bungalow by the Hamburg docks that belonged to Rosa, a former cleaner at the Indra club. McCartney admitted that he had other girlfriends in Hamburg when Rhone was in Liverpool, admitting that they were usually strippers, who <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more about sex than Liverpool girls.|$|E

2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success.
