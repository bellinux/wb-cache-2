40|$|Study Design: A prospective, criterion-based {{validity}} study. Objectives: To {{assess the}} diagnostic {{properties of the}} carpal compression test (CCT) when performed with the Durkan carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) gauge, and to determine the measurement validity of the gauge. Background: The CCT {{has been reported to}} be highly sensitive (. 87 -. 89) and specific (. 93 - 1. 0) in the diagnosis of CTS when it is done with thumb pressure. The accuracy of measurements with the Durkan CTS gauge, however, has not been established and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the CCT when the gauge is used has not been independently confirmed. Methods and Measures: The study sample included 33 women and 19 men, aged 18 to 85 years (45. 7 ± 13. 5 years). The accuracy of the gauge was determined with a force dynamometer and holding frame. Standard nerve conduction studies (NCS) and the CCT were performed on the symptomatic extremity of all subjects. A compatible history and the NCS results were used to confirm CTS. Results: The Durkan gauge registered pressures of 11. 94 psi and 15. 25 psi at the 12 and 15 psi <b>gauge</b> <b>marks,</b> respectively. Test sensitivity and specificity were. 36 (95 % Cl =. 17 -. 54) and. 57 (95 % Cl =. 39 -. 74), respectively. Conclusions: Pressure measurements obtained with the Durkan CTS gauge were accurate. The CCT when performed with the Durkan gauge, however, was neither sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of CTS...|$|E

25|$|Hamar Station {{developed}} into a major center for transshipment of goods between narrow and standard gauge rolling stock. By 1912 there was 91,725 tonnes of cargo which was transshipped, all of it for hand. The cost and time restraints on this caused proposals for the Røros Line to receive gauge conversion, mentioned {{for the first time}} in parliamentary discussions in 1890. The 1898 decision to build the Bergen Line in standard <b>gauge</b> <b>marked</b> the end of narrow gauge as an acceptable standard. The Solør Line opened in 1910, connecting to the Røros Line at Elverum, resulting in both Hamar, Elverum and Trondheim having split two-gauge stations and major transshipment operations.|$|R

On canals where the fee was based on cargo weight it also put the boat in a convenient place to read the <b>gauging</b> <b>mark</b> height from the water line. On busy canals which were built with a towpath on either side such as the Birmingham Canal Navigations BCN New Main Line the toll house may have been built on an island between two constricted channels so that one toll point could collect from boats travelling in each direction. The BCN retains several of these islands, for example at Winson Green Junction.|$|R
60|$|Besides this, it had {{a curious}} device for {{altering}} the gearing automatically while one rode, so as to enable one to adapt it to the varying slope in mounting hills. This part of the mechanism he explained to me elaborately. There was a gauge in front which allowed one to sight the steepness of the slope by mere inspection; and according as the <b>gauge</b> <b>marked</b> one, two, three, or four, as its gradient on the scale, the rider pressed {{a button on the}} handle-bar with his left hand once, twice, thrice, or four times, so that the gearing adapted itself without an effort to the rise in the surface. Besides, there were devices for rigidity and compensation. Altogether, it was a most apt and ingenious piece of mechanism. I did not wonder he was proud of it.|$|R

5000|$|Tachometers or {{revolution}} counters on cars, aircraft, and other vehicles show {{the rate of}} rotation of the engine's crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds. This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication, overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example spring retracted valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines. This is more applicable to manual transmissions than to automatics. On analogue tachometers, speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by {{an area of the}} <b>gauge</b> <b>marked</b> in red, giving rise to the expression of [...] "redlining" [...] an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. The red zone is superfluous on most modern cars, since their engines typically have a revolution limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the tachometers in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.|$|R

5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature <b>gauge,</b> <b>marked</b> to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|R

40|$|According to {{classic and}} {{contemporary}} social theory, {{the community is}} crucial to how individuals respond to the onset of health problems. Cultural response to symptoms provides the foundation for lay diagnosis; offers a <b>gauge</b> for <b>marking</b> individual and societal health literacy; and reflects the cultural embeddedness of modern medical knowledge. Using data collected between 2004 and 2007 from the Stigma in Global Context - Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) on the recognition of schizophrenia from vignettes describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria, we examine the nature and correlates of lay diagnosis. Focusing on Western societies in the SGC-MHS, we ask three questions regarding problem recognition in Bulgaria (NÂ =Â  255), Cyprus (NÂ =Â  253), Germany (NÂ =Â  382), Hungary (NÂ =Â  352), Iceland (NÂ =Â  291), Spain (NÂ =Â  327), Great Britain (NÂ =Â  289), and the United States (NÂ =Â  449) : (1) What is the cross-national variation in recognition of schizophrenia as a mental illness? (2) Is lay diagnosis associated with individuals' socio-demographic characteristics and/or their evaluation of underlying causes? (3) Are lay diagnoses likely to shape the nature {{and direction of the}} illness career? We find lay diagnosis of "mental illness" to be high across these Western nations with some, though modest, difference across countries. Variation for the more specific diagnosis of "schizophrenia" is greater, though fairly consistent in country ordering. Lay diagnoses are shaped most consistently by attributions, inconsistently by socio-demographics, and generally associated with respondents' treatment recommendations and expected outcomes. In light of assumptions about public beliefs and knowledge that often underlie research, community efforts, clinical programs, and health policy, these findings suggest that a greater understanding of the complexities of lay diagnosis is warranted.

40|$|Throughout history, {{the still}} {{surface of the}} sea {{has been used as}} a {{reference}} for heights and elevations. A given landmark's "height above sea Ievel" is the distance measured in a plumb line from the Iandmark itself to the surface of the sea, which continues beneath the surface of the continents.

40|$|A {{discussion}} {{regarding the}} alignment and measuring procedure of propeller shafts has arose {{due to the}} competing situation in the industry, and higher standards from the customers. An estimation of the deflection of shafts in different alignment situations has been made with help of FEM-analysis and beam theory. This has been analyzed and compared with the experience from Rolls-Royce AB suppliers of shafts. An evaluation of measuring protocols has been made and the result indicates {{that there is a}} correlation between the deflection of the shaft and the run out. Results from a measuring test performed by Balino, Spain, verifies this conclusion. But the main issue is considered to be the type of supports that prevent the shaft from moving in the horizontal plane. The solution to this issue is to use supports along the shaft that only prevents the deflection in the median plane.   A recommendation to the Rolls-Royce AB is to perform changes in their measuring protocols to make them easier to use and to include more information. The sequence of the measuring points in the protocol should be re-arranged and re-named. Information of what type of support that has been used by the supplier and where they been placed should be added to the protocols to increase the traceability when questions arise. To make the measuring protocol unequivocal, the position of the measuring <b>gauge</b> should be <b>marked</b> in the protocol and the point of reference marked on the shaft.   External expertise will participate in a workshop to educate and discuss with Rolls-Royce AB personnel how to change required references in the drawing of the shaft arrangements...|$|R
