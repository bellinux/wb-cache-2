40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determining}} the low-temperature oxidation-rate con-stants of metals has been developed. The method is based on measuring the change in <b>d-c</b> <b>resistance</b> of a discontinuous metal film when it is exposed to oxygen. Values of the logarithmic oxidation-rate constant (10 - 9 cm) for zirconium (1. 8 - 10. 3), t itanium (0. 2 - 4. 0), niobium (0. 8 - 3. 2), and nickel (0. 2 - 2. 0) have been determined under the following conditions: 77 ~ 176 and 10 -s to 10 -s Torr oxygen. A new method has been developed to measure the tarnishing rate of a metal at or below room temper-ature. The method {{is based on the}} change in d-c re-sistance of a discontinuous metal film when it is ex-posed to a reactive gas such as oxygen. Using this method, oxidation rates for titanium (1, 2), nickel (2), and zirconium (3) have been found which are smalle...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A multivariable model {{describing}} the system response (weld tensile strength of 6061 -T 6 aluminum) of a percussive stud welding {{system as a}} function of five natural (external) system variables was developed. The five natural system variables were 1) static weight of the drop-shaft (W), 2) initial stud base height (H₀), 3) capacitance (C), 4) equivalent <b>d-c</b> circuit <b>resistance</b> (R), and 5) initial capacitor voltage (V₀). In order to develop the multivariable model, a Single Factor experiment was used to bring the system response to the neighborhood of a maximum. The maximum observed tensile strength was 2231 ± 18 pounds. This value was seven percent higher than the nominal tensile strength rating for the 6061 -T 6 aluminum stud material and seven percent less than the "cross-grain" tensile strength of the 6061 -T 6 work-plate material, To describe the effects of the independent variables (W, H₀, C, R, and V₀) and their interactions upon the dependent variable (tensile strength), a complete Factorial experiment was performed. An Analysis of Variance showed that (in order of importance) V₀, V₀², RV₀, W, R, CRV₀, H, WV₀, H₀CRV₀, WH₀ CV₀ and WC contributed significantly to the observed variability of the system response. In order to describe the response surface by a working multivariable model, a weighted Multiple Regression Analysis of the Factorial data was performed, The result of the Regression Analysis was a quadratic model relating the weld tensile strength of 6061 -T 6 aluminum (y[subscript t][superscript (pred) ]) to the five standardized natural variables of the welding system. The quadratic model was y[subscript t][superscript (pred) ] = - 1483. 1 + (446. 7 x₁ - 57. 6 x²₁) + (501. 3 x₂ - 71. 2 x₂²) + (200. 2 x₃ - 7. 2 x²₃) - (508. 5 x₄ + 2. 9 x²₄) + (2096 x₅ - 456. 5 x²₅) + (- 5. 5 x₁x₂ + 5. 6 x₁x₃ + 9. 7 x₁x₄ - 64. 3 x₁x₅ - 7. 6 x₂x₃ - 38, 1 x₂x₄ - 20. 9 x₂x₅ - 3. 6 x₃x₄ - 60. 1 x₃x₅ + 242. 2 x₄x₅) Examinations of metallurgical photomicrographs of weld specimens suggested that the multivariable model would have to be restricted to specific regions of the response surface since voids, intergranular cracking, and transgranular cracking was observed in the weld zones, Comparisons of observed and predicted tensile strengths, using the quadratic model, suggested that future multivariable models might very well have to include the higher order interactions to achieve a better fit to the observed response surface...|$|R
40|$|Fig. 8 Evaporation of subcooled water {{calculated}} from a-c less <b>d-c</b> <b>resistance</b> thermometer temperatures flux. The linear {{velocity of the}} steam passing over {{the outside of the}} tube was varied 10 -fold at a high rate of heat transfer. The results still showed the relation given in Fig. 5, despite the much increased tendency of condensate to be swept off the tube wall. Conclusions The resistance thermometer method has been developed to evaluate mean wall temperature of a circular metal tube. This temperature can be measured over any short interval to ± 4 F for one observation of a stainless-steel tube. The method given has been extended to include a means of measuring heat flux passing through the tube wall. Single de-terminations are accurate to about ± 20, 000 Btu/hr ft 2. The method is based on the variation of alternating current density with radius in a circular conductor. Independent measurements may be made for any number of intervals along a tube. The two methods may be combined to evaluate wall surface temperature in any interval. When combined with bulk liquid or bulk steam temperatures, local film heat-transfer coefficients can be calculated entirely from observed quantities...|$|E
