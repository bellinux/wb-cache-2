Previous studies in Darwin have associated the environmental presence of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, with anthropogenic land usage and proximity to animals. In our study, we estimated the occurrence of B. pseudomallei and Burkholderia spp. relatives in faecal matter of wildlife, livestock and domestic animals in the Darwin region. A total of 357 faecal samples were collected and bacteria isolated through culture and direct DNA extraction after enrichment in selective media. Identification of B. pseudomallei, B. ubonensis, and other Burkholderia spp. was carried out using TTS 1, Bu 550, and recA BUR 3 -BUR 4 quantitative PCR assays, respectively. B. pseudomallei was detected in seven faecal samples from wallabies and a chicken. B. cepacia complex spp. and Pandoraea spp. were cultured from wallaby faecal samples, and B. cenocepacia and B. cepacia were also isolated from livestock animals. Various bacteria isolated in this study represent opportunistic human pathogens, raising the possibility that faecal shedding contributes to the expanding geographical distribution of not <b>just</b> <b>B.</b> pseudomallei but other Burkholderiaceae that can cause human disease. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2016...|$|E
40|$|Inflammasomes are multimeric protein {{complexes}} that {{respond to}} infection by recruitment and {{activation of the}} Caspase- 1 (CASP 1) protease. Activated CASP 1 initiates immune defense by processing inflammatory cytokines and by causing a rapid and lytic cell death called pyroptosis. Inflammasome formation is orchestrated {{by members of the}} nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) or AIM 2 -like receptor (ALR) protein families. Certain NLRs and ALRs have been shown to function as direct receptors for specific microbial ligands, such as flagellin or DNA, but the molecular mechanism responsible for activation of most NLRs is still poorly understood. Here we determine the mechanism of activation of the NLRP 1 B inflammasome in mice. NLRP 1 B, and its ortholog in rats, is activated by the lethal factor (LF) protease that is a key virulence factor secreted by Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. LF was recently shown to cleave mouse and rat NLRP 1 directly. However, it is unclear if cleavage is sufficient for NLRP 1 activation. Indeed, other LF-induced cellular events have been suggested {{to play a role in}} NLRP 1 B activation. Surprisingly, we show that direct cleavage of NLRP 1 B is sufficient to induce inflammasome activation in the absence of LF. Our results therefore rule out the need for other LF-dependent cellular effects in activation of NLRP 1 B. We therefore propose that NLRP 1 functions primarily as a sensor of protease activity and thus could conceivably detect a broader spectrum of pathogens than <b>just</b> <b>B.</b> anthracis. By adding proteolytic cleavage to the previously established ligand-receptor mechanism of NLR activation, our results illustrate th...|$|E
40|$|Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) is a 72 kDa non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. It {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in B cell development and signaling downstream of many immune receptors. However, its expression is not limited to <b>just</b> <b>B</b> cells, as it has been shown to play a functional role in signaling in many other hematopoietic cell types such as thymocytes, mast cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. Its expression and roles have expanded since its original discovery; and it has now been associated with epithelial tissues as well as tumor progression and prognosis. A particular interest has focused on Syk and its suggested tumor suppressor role in various epithelial-based carcinomas. Loss of Syk expression both at the mRNA and protein level in breast cancer has been associated with loss of cell-cell adherence and increased mobility and invasiveness. Similar effects have been observed with overexpression of protein arginine methyltransferase five (PRMT 5) and seven (PRMT 7) in breast cancer, indicating a new potential mechanism by which Syk may regulate the ability of cancer to metastasize. Western blot analysis has demonstrated Syk 2 ̆ 7 s ability to alter the di-symmetric methylation of proteins catalyzed by PRMT 5. PRMT 5 and Syk were found to reside in a complex with one another. Further analysis by immunoprecipitation indicated that the formation of this Syk-PRMT 5 complex was dependent on nucleolin expression. A downstream substrate of PRMT 5, SUPT 5 H, also displayed the ability to form a complex with Syk. SUPT 5 H is a component of a large complex that regulates mature B cell class switching. A component of this complex, LEO 1, was also shown to interact with Syk through immunoprecipitation. These results suggest Syk interacts with the methyltransferase PRMT 5 and some of its substrates. Furthermore, this study indicates that Syk is interacting with components of a complex that regulates class switch recombination. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION Brassica tournefortii: Phenology, Interactions and Management of an Invasive Mustardby Robin Gene Marushia Doctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in Plant Biology University of California, Riverside, June 2009 Dr. Jodie S. Holt, Chairperson Brassica tournefortii (Gouan), or Sahara mustard, is a nonnative, {{invasive}} annual forb currently invading {{the deserts}} of North America. Despite its increasing distribution and dominance in desert plant communities, {{little is known about}} the biology or impacts of B. tournefortii, and few options exist for management. This dissertation sought to answer three basic questions. First, this dissertation questioned "Why is B. tournefortii able to invade desert ecosystems, whereas closely-related invasive mustards are not?" Four biotypes of invasive Brassicaceae, including desert and more mesic populations of B. tournefortii, Brassica nigra, and Hirschfeldia incana were grown with climate and watering treatments over three years. Results show that all biotypes are capable of equal fitness under desert and drought conditions. Although no differences were found between mesic and desert populations of B. tournefortii, the species had a more rapid phenology than its congeners, suggesting that B. tournefortii succeeds because it can reproduce quickly. Second, this dissertation asks, "What are the interactions of B. tournefortii with native annual forbs?" Because native annuals fill a similar ecological niche, I hypothesized that B. tournefortii would have negative impacts on natives with increasing density and cover. Success of the plant community and individual native species was correlated to B. tournefortii dominance. Results show that B. tournefortii has mostly negative interactions with natives with high precipitation, but positive relationships with low precipitation, suggesting that interactions of B. tournefortii with natives change from negative to positive based on resource availability. Finally, this dissertation asks, "Can B. tournefortii be selectively managed in desert ecosystems?" This research compared hand-weeding, a common control technique, to an emergence-stage application and rosette-stage application of glyphosate, vs. no treatment. Emergence-stage application was hypothesized to selectively control B. tournefortii and other invasives by taking advantage of their non-specific germination requirements and rapid emergence. This hypothesis was supported by results showing that native cover can be maintained by applying herbicide at emergence while reducing exotic cover. Hand-weeding selectively removed B. tournefortii, but promoted annual cover and richness only underneath shrubs at a site with few other invasives present. Late herbicide produced high mortality in all species. Results suggest that herbicide can be used as a selective technique to remove most desert invasives, not <b>just</b> <b>B.</b> tournefortii. In conclusion, B. tournefortii is a unique case study for biological invasions in extreme ecosystems, and presents challenges for ecologists and land managers alike...|$|E
