25|$|Since {{the atomic}} radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only {{slightly}} less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being circular. When raster graphics became affordable, {{one of the common}} approaches was to replicate CPK models in silico. It is relatively straightforward to calculate the circles of intersection, but more complex to represent a model with <b>hidden</b> <b>surface</b> removal. A useful side product is that a conventional value for the molecular volume can be calculated.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{advance in}} 3D {{computer}} graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers - <b>hidden</b> <b>surface</b> determination. In order {{to draw a}} representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are [...] "behind" [...] the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be [...] "hidden" [...] when the computer creates (or renders) the image. The 3D Core Graphics System (or Core) was the first graphical standard to be developed. A group of 25 experts of the ACM Special Interest Group SIGGRAPH developed this [...] "conceptual framework". The specifications were published in 1977, {{and it became a}} foundation for many future developments in the field.|$|E

5000|$|In rendering, z-culling {{is early}} pixel {{elimination}} based on depth, {{a method that}} provides an increase in performance when rendering of <b>hidden</b> <b>surfaces</b> is costly.

50|$|In 3D {{computer}} graphics, shown surface determination (also {{known as}} <b>hidden</b> <b>surface</b> removal (HSR), occlusion culling (OC) or visible surface determination (VSD)) {{is the process}} used to determine which surfaces and parts of surfaces are not visible from a certain viewpoint. A <b>hidden</b> <b>surface</b> determination algorithm is {{a solution to the}} visibility problem, {{which was one of the}} first major problems in the field of 3D computer graphics. The process of <b>hidden</b> <b>surface</b> determination is sometimes called hiding, and such an algorithm is sometimes called a hider. The analogue for line rendering is hidden line removal. <b>Hidden</b> <b>surface</b> determination is necessary to render an image correctly, so that one may not view features hidden behind the model itself, allowing only the naturally viewable portion of the graphic to be visible.|$|E
5000|$|Ray tracing {{attempts}} {{to model the}} path of light rays to a viewpoint by tracing rays from the viewpoint into the scene. Although not a <b>hidden</b> <b>surface</b> removal algorithm as such, it implicitly solves the <b>hidden</b> <b>surface</b> removal problem by finding the nearest surface along each view-ray. Effectively this is equivalent to sorting all the geometry on a per pixel basis.|$|E

In principle, the system should not be sensitive to skin color and potential reflections of light. For example, scars on the skin at the location of the lumpectomy change local imaging features. Temporary markers on the breast necessary for radiotherapy treatment may also impact surface imaging. Finally, there may be complicated 3 D surfaces with lines of discontinuity due to possible <b>hidden</b> <b>surfaces</b> below the breast.|$|R

40|$|An {{automatic}} 3 D model reconstruction {{technique is}} presented to acquire complete 3 D models of real objects. The technique is based on novel approaches to pose estimation and integration. Two different poses of an object are used because a single pose often <b>hides</b> some <b>surfaces</b> from a range sensor. The presence of <b>hidden</b> <b>surfaces</b> makes the 3 D model reconstructed from any single pose a partial model. Two such partial 3 D models are reconstructed for two different poses of the object using a multi-view 3 D modeling technique. The two partial 3 D models are then registered. Coarse registration is facilitated by a novel pose estimation technique between two models. The pose is estimated by matching a stable tangent plane (STP) of each pose model with the base tangent plane (BTP) which is invariant for a vision system. The partial models are then integrated to a complete 3 D model based on voxel classification defined in multi-view integration. Texture mapping is done to obtain a photo-realistic reconstruction of the object. 1...|$|R
