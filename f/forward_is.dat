5|$|A <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> {{a player}} {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side or the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E
5|$|Looking <b>Forward</b> <b>is</b> a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from James Oliver Curwood's short story of the same name, the film follows a young chemist named Jack Goodwin. He discovers a chemical compound that puts a person {{into a state of}} sleep for a determined period of time and decides to test it upon himself. The first test is a success and Jack makes arrangements for his sleep of a hundred years, in a state similar to suspended animation. When he awakes in 2010 into a world ruled by women, he woos the female mayor. Jack joins a society to campaign for men's rights. The society ends up before the female mayor who jails all of them, save for Jack who she proposes to. Jack accepts on the condition that men are given back their rights and she accepts. The cast and production credits of the film are not known, but Theodore Marston was not the director. The film was released on December 20, 1910. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later {{came forward with}} claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, {{it is hard to}} believe that a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E
25|$|A {{closely related}} {{contract}} is a forward contract. A <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> like a futures {{in that it}} specifies the exchange of goods for a specified price at a specified future date. However, a <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> not traded on an exchange and thus {{does not have the}} interim partial payments due to marking to market. Nor is the contract standardized, as on the exchange.|$|E

25|$|Distinctive {{features}} {{common to}} both rugby codes include the oval ball and {{throwing the ball}} <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> not allowed, so that players can gain ground only by running with the ball or by kicking it. As the sport of rugby league moved further away from its union counterpart, rule changes were implemented {{with the aim of}} making a faster-paced and more try-oriented game.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the left}} corner forward who wears the number 15 jersey is to watch the full forward's breaks and to score as many points and goals as possible. The full forward line {{operates}} around the opposition's 21-metre line. The left corner <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> generally marked by the right corner back, and usually prefers to kick with the right foot.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo's face is {{best known}} from a drawing in red chalk {{that appears to be}} a self-portrait. However, there is some {{controversy}} over the identity of the subject, because the man represented appears to be of a greater age than the 67 years lived by Leonardo. A solution which has been put <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> that Leonardo deliberately aged himself in the drawing, as a modern forensic artist might do, in order to provide a model for Raphael's painting of him as Plato in The School of Athens.|$|E

50|$|In {{object-oriented}} programming, forwarding {{means that}} using {{a member of}} an object (either a property or a method) results in actually using the corresponding member of a different object: the use <b>is</b> <b>forwarded</b> to another object. <b>Forwarding</b> <b>is</b> used in a number of design patterns, where some members <b>are</b> <b>forwarded</b> to another object, while others are handled by the directly used object. The <b>forwarding</b> object <b>is</b> frequently called a wrapper object, and explicit <b>forwarding</b> members <b>are</b> called wrapper functions.|$|R
25|$|A Fast <b>Forward</b> <b>is</b> a task that, once completed, {{allows the}} team that completes it to bypass all {{remaining}} tasks in the leg and proceed directly to the Pit Stop. The Fast Forward clue is given with another task clue (usually a Roadblock or Detour) and is a separate task from the others. Only one team may complete a Fast Forward in any given leg, and a team may only complete one Fast Forward in the entire Race. The exception to this rule is in seasons wherein the Fast <b>Forward</b> <b>is</b> offered {{in conjunction with the}} Intersection, in which case a team may win the Fast Forward both as an individual team and as a team working with another as part of the Intersection instructions. Teams that win the Fast Forward are not guaranteed a first-place finish for that leg and still face elimination if they arrive at the Pit Stop last. Multiple teams may undertake Fast Forward tasks, but only the first team to complete the task gets credit. If a team fails to get the Fast Forward (either by quitting the task or being beaten to it), they must return and complete the leg as normal. This creates a risk in going for the Fast Forward and potentially losing time with the other teams for that leg.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the centre}} half forward who wears the number 11 jersey, is to build up attacks and feed {{the ball to the}} full forward line. The centre half <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for taking shots on goal and points when opportunities present themselves. The centre forward will cover a lot of ground and utilising speedy half forwards to run at defences is a common tactic. The centre forward also helps win breaking ball in the midfield, helping to win the possession to bring the ball forward. The centre forward operates from the midfield to the opposition's 45-metre line.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen {{announced}} that the party composition of cabinet would remain as before, but that parties not in cabinet that support his premiership will have influence over policy. This statement apparently was aimed at the New Alliance. Rasmussen's capacity to accommodate both the New Alliance and the Danish People's Party going <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> not assured – the New Alliance was established, in part, to limit the Danish Peoples's Party's influence. With the DPP in coalition, Rasmussen is able to govern: a New Alliance-supported opposition would be short of a majority by one vote. Edmund Joensen's pledge to abstain on matters related to internal affairs of Denmark and would alter this, giving the New Alliance {{the balance of power}} and risking conflict with the DPP, but Joensen has also pledged that if doing so would risk giving the opposition a majority, he would not abstain, but instead vote with the government.|$|E

25|$|A centre forward (main striker) has the key task {{of scoring}} goals {{and for this}} reason acts as {{the focal point of the}} {{majority}} of attacking play by a team. As such, how well a striker is performing tends to be measured purely on goals scored despite the fact that they may be contributing in other ways to a team's success. A traditional centre forward was required to be tall in height and strong physically in order to be able to win the ball in the area from crosses and attempt to score with either their feet or head, or to knock the ball down for a teammate to score. Whilst these assets are still an advantage, in the modern game speed and movement are also required as there is more interplay when attacking. In a 4–4–2 or 4–4–1–1 formation the centre <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> often paired with a second striker who may play around him or in a slightly withdrawn role respectively, though it is not unknown to play two recognised centre forwards.|$|E
25|$|In short, total {{least squares}} {{does not have}} the {{property}} of units-invariancei.e. it is not scale invariant. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way <b>forward</b> <b>is</b> to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line; (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables. This line has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as standardised major axis (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006), the reduced major axis, the geometric mean functional relationship (Draper and Smith, 1998), least products regression, diagonal regression, line of organic correlation, and the least areas line. Tofallis (2002) has extended this approach to deal with multiple variables.|$|E

50|$|Only <b>{{forwards}}</b> <b>are</b> {{allowed to}} shoot the ball. Forwards must stay in their teams' frontcourt (the side of the court they shoot from) and guards must stay in their team's backcourt. For example, Team A's <b>forwards</b> would <b>be</b> {{on the left side}} of the court with Team B's guards on defense. Team B's <b>forwards</b> <b>are</b> on the right side of the court with Team A's guards. Thus, forwards play only offense and guards play only defense.|$|R
