40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the impacts of aquatic {{invasive}} species preventative measures on recreation displacement of bass fishermen from Central Coast lakes. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to participants at a local bass fishing tournament. Thirty-six respondents completed the questionnaire. The results indicated that boat <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> do not necessarily cause bass fishermen to displace. This study found that fishermen are likely to avoid recreating at a Central Coast lake in fishing practice conditions rather than in tournament conditions, and are likely to avoid tournaments at their least favorite lake if boat <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> take too long. It is recommended that Central Coast lake counties assess why the boat inspection process is not consistent in duration among these lakes, and land management agencies should consider implementing uniform <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> at all three lake counties...|$|R

40|$|Road Safety Inspections (RSI) are {{recognized}} as an effective tool for identifying safety deficiencies of road infrastructures. They represent a low cost process {{for the evaluation of}} the network safety performance. Its applicability in rural local roads, where accident data generally do not give enough information for the safety analysis, make the procedure very attractive. However, due to the subjective nature of the process RSI may give rise to disagreements which limit their effectiveness. The paper describes the RSI procedures defined by the IASP research program. The IASP project is funded by European Commission (DG TREN) and Province of Catania (Italy) with the scientific support and collaboration of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of University of Catania. The project is aimed at defining a methodological approach for the safety analysis and the restoration of rural highways specially suited for local rural roads. Various countries adopted RSI procedures but, in the main, they are not operational in nature. As part of the project, safety inspections of 100 km of two lane rural roads have been carried out. The IASP safety <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> reflect the scope of the project and give some quantitative safety evaluation, to the best extent compatible with a methodology mainly based on subjective evaluations. The research was aimed at defining a RSI operative procedure able to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the methodology. For this purpose, the research was focused on the review framework, on the reviewers and client roles and, with special emphasis, on the methodologies used for identifying and ranking the safety problems. Phases of the <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> have been defined: preliminary <b>inspection,</b> <b>general</b> <b>inspection,</b> detailed inspection and night time inspection. For each phase, objectives of the inspection, needed equipments, inspection methodology and roles of each team member have been defined and synthetically described in the paper. <b>General</b> <b>inspection</b> checklists, relative to the main safety features which may be present with continuity along two lane rural roads, and detailed inspection modules, differentiated for segments and intersections, have been defined. Moreover, criteria for identifying and ranking safety issues have been briefly reported. Last, the review report contents and format have been described. The procedure has proved to be effective to identify most safety issues. As far as alignment geometric defects and design consistency evaluation is concerned, RSI are not as valuable such as the quantitative methods, that may usefully integrate the inspection results. As a research outcome, a RSI operative manual has been edited. It allows to transfer to other road agencies the acquired knowledge and to obtain a greater objectivity in the inspection process...|$|R

50|$|The {{foundations}} for the inspection services were {{laid in the}} late nineteenth century when a growing demand became apparent for safeguards regarding the quality of propagating material and seed. This need resulted in several inspection initiatives. In 1919 the Central Committee for the Inspection of Plants was established, followed by the Inspection Institute for Seeds and Planting Materials. Both organisations competed in their seed inspection activities. The establishment in 1932 of the Netherlands <b>General</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service for Agricultural Seeds and Seed Potatoes (NAK) signalled the end of the confusion. From then on, the inspection of agricultural crops was centralised. The first merger was between the then Netherlands <b>General</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service for Arboricultural Crops (NAKB) (1941) and the Netherlands <b>General</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service for Floricultural Crops (NAKS) (1947). This resulted in the creation of the NAKB. In 2000 the new NAKB and NAKG (the Netherlands <b>General</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service for Vegetable and Flower Seeds, 1941) merged to form the current Naktuinbouw.|$|R
40|$|A crucial {{stage of}} the {{remanufacturing}} process is the <b>inspection</b> <b>procedure.</b> Surveys {{carried out in the}} automotive remanufacturing sector show that the industry is concerned about its need for such a large amount of specialist skills. Despite this, there has been little research into what is actually involved in the inspection process and what different strategies are used in different companies carrying out remanufacturing operations. This thesis presents case based research that was carried out on the <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> of sixteen companies. These included companies from all industries ranging from those in the automotive and defence industries, to those in consumer electronics and IT. The cases range from small companies remanufacturing a few units per month to those with established remanufacturing production lines. This project has created two key contributions to theory. The first is a theory for remanufacturing strategy. A framework for remanufacturing strategy has been produced showing how different strategies are used to remanufacture items with different characteristics. The second is a generic inspection process which breaks down each <b>inspection</b> <b>procedure</b> within remanufacturing to its main objectives and methods. These, practical and applicable, contributions are of vital interest to researchers who can use them to enhance their knowledge of <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> within remanufacturing and will act as a road map for future research into this new and exciting area.
