5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de <b>France</b> his squadron broke up. Four ships were {{sent back to}} <b>France</b> in 1797 and 1798 as Île de <b>France</b> could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île de <b>France</b> and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to the Directory then ruling <b>France.</b> With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de <b>France</b> Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering Forte to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798. Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the early}} success with Scotland, Henry hesitated to invade <b>France,</b> {{annoying}} Charles. Henry finally went to <b>France</b> in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged Montreuil. The other, under Suffolk, laid siege to Boulogne. Henry later took personal command, and Boulogne fell on 18 September 1544. However, Henry had refused Charles' request to march against Paris. Charles' own campaign fizzled, {{and he made}} peace with <b>France</b> that same day. Henry was left alone against <b>France,</b> unable to make peace. Francis attempted to invade England {{in the summer of}} 1545, but reached only the Isle of Wight before being repulsed. Out of money, <b>France</b> and England signed the Treaty of Camp on 7 June 1546. Henry secured Boulogne for eight years.

5|$|<b>France</b> competes {{annually}} in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. <b>France</b> first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations. <b>France</b> were expelled from the tournament due to rumours of professionalism in the then-amateur sport in 1932, but rejoined in 1947.
