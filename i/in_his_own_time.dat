5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> Whitman {{attracted}} {{an influential}} coterie of disciples and admirers. Some, like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman {{both as a}} prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire – the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism.|$|E
5|$|EdwardIII was a temperamental man but {{capable of}} unusual clemency. He {{was in many}} ways a {{conventional}} king whose main interest was warfare. Admired <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> Bede was as {{well known}} for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, {{as well as other}} {{theological}} works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost. It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and why he was made a saint.|$|E

50|$|De Clementia faced {{negative}} critique from Seneca's contemporaries. Gellius {{states that}} his works {{are not particularly}} worth reading due to being pedestrian. Quintilian found his work admirable, but wasted with cheap effect and failing to demonstrate the possession of solid knowledge — in no way comparable to Cicero. Despite this, Seneca has seen extraordinary popularity <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>times</b> and <b>in</b> the Renaissance.|$|R
50|$|His chief {{work was}} a poem in three books, {{dedicated}} to his mistress Leontion. Of this poem {{a fragment of}} about one hundred lines has been preserved by Athenaeus. Plaintive in tone, it enumerates instances, mythological and historical, of the irresistible power of love. Hermesianax, whose style is characterized by alternate force and tenderness, was exceedingly popular <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>times,</b> and was highly esteemed even in the Augustan period.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that we do not}} have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked.

5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr. In June, {{he decided to take}} private flying lessons at Hendon Aerodrome, which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).|$|E
40|$|When we {{read about}} Euler, or about any other {{historical}} figure, {{we must remember that}} he lived <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>times.</b> The 18 th century was very different from the 21 st in ways that we hardly ever think about. There are the obvious differences; now we have Internet, iPods, airplanes and automobiles. I am fond of reminding my students that we also have indoor plumbing, grocery stores and paper money. So, when we read Euler, we must try to understand how the problems he works on and the techniques he uses are embedded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>times,</b> and not <b>in</b> ours. He was speaking to and writing for an 18 th century audience and we are lucky that the things he was saying are still useful and interesting today. So, when we find Euler seeming to use 17 th century techniques to solve a 19 th century problem, we might raise an eyebrow. Euler’s paper Geometrica et sphaerica quaedam, [E 749] which translates uninformatively as “Certain geometric and spheric things, ” is such a paper. Its main result is a theorem in triangle geometry, a subject that was extremely popular an...|$|R

Karl Marx read both Systems and Morgan's subsequent book Ancient Society (1877) which built on and extended the arguments of the previous one. Morgan's thought became foundational in Marx's development of his theory about the relation between evolution, social organization, and historical materialism. Posthumously, Marx' notes on Ancient Society were edited by Friedrich Engels and published as The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.|$|R

5|$|Stańczyk, {{the male}} figure {{depicted}} in the painting, was the court jester when Poland was {{at the height of}} its political, economic and cultural power during the era of the Renaissance in Poland, during the reign of King SigismundI the Old (reigned 1506–1548). He was a popular figure; besides his fame as a jester he has been described as an eloquent, witty, and intelligent man, using satire to comment on the nation's past, present, and future. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Stańczyk has always been considered as much more than a mere entertainer. Stańczyk's fame and legend were strong <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> and enjoyed a resurgence in the 19th century, and he remains well-known to this day.|$|E
5|$|William was famously {{biased against}} the Knights Templar, whom he {{believed}} to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they {{were not required to}} pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> William accused them of hindering the Siege of Ascalon in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the invasion of Egypt in 1168; and of murdering Assassin ambassadors in 1173.|$|E
5|$|Cole {{arrives in}} Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then {{hospital}}ized {{in a mental}} hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed {{by a panel of}} doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears moments later, and wakes up back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> Cole is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield of World War I where he is shot in the leg, and then he is suddenly transported to 1996.|$|E

A smile so wild and meaning, however, gleamed {{on his face}} at this declaration, that the {{permanent}} officer of the secret tribunal, he who served as its organ of communication, bowed nearly to the paper he held, {{as it might be}} to look deeper into his documents. Let not the reader turn back to this page in surprise, when he shall have reached the explanation of the tale, for mysticisms quite as palpable, if not of so ruthless a character, have been publicly acted by political bodies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
5|$|Short story {{fiction and}} tales were also popular during the Tang, {{one of the}} more famous ones being Yingying's Biography by Yuan Zhen (779–831), which was widely {{circulated}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> and by the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) became the basis for plays in Chinese opera. Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of melancholy. Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as Romeo and Juliet, but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness of self from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional device of romantic tension.|$|E
5|$|During the Song dynasty, {{previous}} works on architecture {{were brought to}} more sophisticated levels of description, as in Yili Shigong, written by Li Ruogui in 1193 AD. One of the most definitive works, however, was the earlier Mu Jing ("Timberwork Manual"), ascribed to Yu Hao and written sometime between 965 and 995. Yu Hao {{was responsible for the}} construction of a wooden pagoda tower in Kaifeng, which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick Iron Pagoda soon after. In his time, books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft's status, so Mu Jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography. Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it as a work of architectural genius, saying that no one <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> could reproduce such a work. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda against the wind, and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the crossbeams, the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.|$|E

Indeed, particular aspects of his teachings had a profound influence on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Hanbali reform movement practiced in Saudi Arabia known as Wahhabism, and on other later Wahabi scholars. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah's controversial fatwa allowing jihad against other Muslims is referenced to by Al-Qaeda and other jihadi groups.|$|R
