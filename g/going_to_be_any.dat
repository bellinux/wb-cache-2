500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E

The following summer, the band toured as support to Mötley Crüe's Crüe Fest 2 tour and released a non-album single, [...] "Whiskey Hangover". After the tour, Godsmack started production for their new album. The album, titled The Oracle was released on , 2010. Arriving to popular reception, The Oracle is Godsmack's third straight full-length studio album to debut at No.1 with 117,000 sold {{in the first week}} of release. Erna had this to say about the early sound album, [...] "It's gonna be really heavy. I mean, it's very aggressive. I'm not really sure; it's very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the Crüe Fest this Summer. But as far as the whole record goes, I think it's going to be a lot more in your face. I don't think there's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> 'Voodoo's or 'Serenity's on this one. We decided to go balls out!".|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> good. But {{when you saw the}} rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E

Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention, which nominated John F. Kennedy.

2500|$|Veteran animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston were {{assigned}} as directing animators {{over the three}} good fairies: Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Walt Disney urged for the fairies to be more homogeneous, which Thomas and Johnston objected to, with Thomas stating they [...] "thought 'that's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> fun'. So we started figuring {{the other way and}} worked on how we could develop them into special personalities." [...] John Lounsbery would animate the [...] "Skumps" [...] sequence between Kings Hubert and Stefan. Chuck Jones, known for his work as an animation director with Warner Bros. Cartoons, was employed on the film for four months during its early conceptual stages when Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed when it was anticipated that 3-D film would replace animation as a box office draw. Following the failure of 3-D, and the reversal of Warner's decision, Jones returned to the other studio. His work on Sleeping Beauty, which he spent four months on, remained uncredited. Ironically, during his early years at Warner Bros., Jones was a heavy user of Disney-style animation.|$|E

The Daily Telegraphs Benji Wilson also praised the series and argued that it [...] "had all of the staggering self-regard and dim-witted hilarity we have come to expect from the contestants on the grown-up Apprentice". The online version of Heat magazine, heatworld.com, praised the series and said that it was [...] "amazing...might just be the best show we’ve seen all year", while The Guardians Johnny Dee claimed that the programme was of better quality than its adult counterpart and proved that reality television [...] "doesn't have to be nasty to be entertaining".|$|E
