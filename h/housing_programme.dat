40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop and test a {{theoretical}} and conceptual framework for an alternative approach to evaluation of public <b>housing</b> <b>programmes</b> in Nigeria. It seeks to address limitations of existing approaches where one theory or discipline has the upper hand in evaluating public <b>housing</b> <b>programmes.</b> This paper proposes a broad-based framework for assessing relationships between input, output and outcomes of public <b>housing</b> <b>programmes</b> through a realistic approach to evaluation based on objective-oriented theory, theory-driven evaluation paradigm and conceptual issues. This approach allows for the use of logical framework to explain the complex connections between underlying programme theory and outcomes. The distinct features of this alternative evaluation approach include: an open-ended evaluation approach; housing providers and residents participation; broad-based and a multi-faceted data gathering approaches and analysis in distinguishing the outcome of different housing delivery strategies in public <b>housing</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

25|$|In the 1950s, post-war {{demand for}} housing led the State Government to create a public <b>housing</b> <b>programme,</b> {{providing}} cheap accommodation to cope with returning servicemen, and the boom in migrant labour. Suburbs such as Bellerive, Lindisfarne, Montagu Bay, Mornington, Rosny and Warrane all expanded dramatically throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and housing from the period still often bears the distinctive design patterns of former government housing. For {{many parts of the}} city electricity supply only arrived in the 1950s, and sealed roads, mains water, and sewage only began to be provided in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Following {{decades of}} immense and {{sustained}} immigration, {{the shortage of}} housing in the territory was intolerable. Many lived in squatter settlements or boats, and were susceptible to typhoons, fires and landslides. To {{improve the quality of}} public housing and relieve overcrowded conditions, the government announced the Ten-year <b>Housing</b> <b>Programme</b> (十年建屋計劃) in 1972, with the goal of providing quality housing for 1.8million people in 10 years. The Hong Kong Housing Authority was thus formed to spearhead the programme. The government also introduced the Home Ownership Scheme (居者有其屋計劃) in 1976, building houses and selling them at below-market prices to help people own property.|$|E
25|$|The {{redundancy}} notices {{were issued}} on 27 September, {{together with a}} letter from the council's leader and deputy leader (John Hamilton and Derek Hatton) explaining that there was no intention to make any employee redundant but that the notices were a legal requirement. With time running out, the council had to hire taxis to distribute the notices. At the Labour Party conference the following week, David Blunkett agreed with Hatton that the GLC's Director-General Maurice Stonefrost could offer advice to Liverpool. Stonefrost suggested increasing rates by 15%, and cutting the <b>housing</b> <b>programme.</b> The council's budget problems for the 1985–86 financial year were only solved when the council removed £23m from its capital budget to fund revenue spending, and borrowed £30m from Swiss banks to replenish the capital fund. The council also transferred £3m in loans which it had given to other Labour councils and found £3m of budget savings. The council's Finance Committee approved this plan on 26 November 1985.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, the Shek Kip Mei fire left 53,000 homeless. This {{prompted}} major change: Sir Alexander Grantham, the 22nd Governor of Hong Kong, drew up {{an emergency}} <b>housing</b> <b>programme</b> that introduced the 'multi-storey building' {{as a common}} building form. His structures were capable of housing 2,500 people in a fire/flood-proof structure. The idea was to house as many and {{as fast as possible}} to deal with the homeless shelter crisis. Every floor in the building incommunal room, washroom, and toilet facility. Each person was granted 24 square metres of space. [...] The high rise buildings would become the norm, as skyscrapers have a small footprint compared to their overall volume.|$|E

An environment in which occupants {{of a piece of}} land, especially the poor, build their affordable houses fulfilling their current needs and progressively expand and/or improve the house to meet their changing needs. The Million <b>Houses</b> <b>Programme</b> in Sri Lanka ‘aided’ self-help incorporated participation in decisionmaking, support for planning, design, construction, and financing. The project further expanded to enhance skills of settlement residents for taking-up community contracts for construction of community assets. Currently when relocation of slum dwellers in built-housing is becoming the preferred option, this article very briefly revisited the lessons learnt and the lessons that could still be learned from the experience of the Million <b>Houses</b> <b>Programme</b> and of the ‘People’s Process’. It argues that an ‘enabling environment’ for increasing access to housing involves multi-pronged support through facilitators. The experience of the Million <b>Houses</b> <b>Programme</b> offer insights, even now, into effective strategies for aided self-help housing...|$|R

2500|$|The Second Housing Allowance Law of December 1970 {{simplified}} {{the administration}} of housing allowances and extended entitlements, increased the income limit to 9,600 DM per year plus 2,400 DM for each family member, raised the general deduction on income to determine reckonable income from 15% to 20%, allowance rates listed in tables replacing complicated calculation procedure based on [...] "bearable rent burdens." [...] The Housing Construction Modification Law (1971) increased the income-limit for access to low rent apartments under the social <b>housing</b> <b>programme</b> from 9,000 DM to 12,000 DM per annum plus 3,000 DM (instead of 2,400) for each family member. The law also introduced special subsidies to reduce the debt burden for builders not surpassing the regular income-limit by more than 40%. Under a 1973 law, the limits were increased to 1,000 DM plus 9,000 DM and 4,200 DM for additional family members. The Rent Improvement Law (1971) strengthened the position of tenants. Under this legislation, notice was to be ruled illegal [...] "where appropriate substitute accommodation not available; landlords obliged to specify reasons for notice," [...] whilst the Eviction Protection Law (1971) established tenant protection against rent rises and notice. The notice was only lawful if in the [...] "justified interest of the landlord." [...] Under this law, higher rents were not recognised as [...] "justified interest." [...] The Second Eviction Protection Law (1972) made the tenant protection introduced under the Eviction Protection Law of 1971 permanent. Under this new law, the notice was only lawful where the landlord proved justified personal interest in the apartment. In addition, rent increases were only lawful if not above normal comparable rents in the same area.|$|E
