Martin had remained optimistic that a negotiated settlement could be reached whereby the US would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out of South Vietnam and, {{in an effort to}} avert defeatism and panic he instructed Major James Kean, Commanding Officer of the Marine Security Guard Battalion and Ground Support Force Commander United States Embassy Compound, that he could begin to remove the tamarind tree and other trees and shrubbery which prevented the use of the Embassy parking lot as a helicopter landing zone.|$|E
25|$|Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a {{textiles}} magnate, patented {{the modern}} form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, {{the line was}} drawn off {{the leading edge of}} the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E

500|$|More {{controversy}} {{occurred after}} Sebastian {{took aim at}} contestant Mitchell Callaway's attitude to the competition following his performance of [...] "Run to Paradise" [...] on the third live performance show. Sebastian told Callaway: [...] "You've {{got to have the}} right attitude to this competition, you've got to be focused and to be honest, not be rude to people and have the work ethic. For you to not learn your lyrics and for you to at times be rude to crew, you really <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> that in and rein that in because you won't last long in this competition or this industry if you do that."

500|$|Oh said of Yang's {{expressions}} of emotions during season eight: [...] "You see her express her emotions {{with only two}} people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart and then you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though {{they go to the}} darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} romantic theme in her storyline Ruby {{has been shown}} as an {{aspiring}} singer. Breeds is classically trained in real life and said she doesn't mind singing on camera. Discussing this she stated: [...] "When you're playing a character you can hide behind them. I know it's still my voice, [...] I was more confident singing from Ruby's point of view. Even {{though there was a}} storyline where she was terrified about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at all. I had to try really hard to make myself feel nervous." [...] She revealed she had to play down her voice and make it [...] "a bit cleaner" [...] and a [...] "bit more inexperienced". This was due to the fact {{it was meant to be}} that she had never sung before – [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> her back a bit." [...] She added the storyline was realistic because there are no set guidelines for discovering vocal talent.|$|E

500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{felt the}} album's lyrics have an [...] "emotional and {{pictorial}} directness, rare for Yorke". The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The album title was inspired by [...] "these huge elephants {{that we have in the}} room at the moment, in the west, and people are desperately trying to erase them from public consciousness." ...|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things.

[...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack.
