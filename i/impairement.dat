40|$|The {{study of}} the {{cerebral}} mechanisms underlying empathy lies currently {{at the heart of}} neuroscience research. This process which can be defined as "the ability to put oneself into other's shoes in order to feel his emotions and feelings", constitutes a basic skill in any interpersonal relationship, particularly in the caregiver-patient relationship. In addition, the study of empathy <b>impairements</b> offers new ways to approach diverse mental disorders such as autism or psychopathy. However, it is essential to identify how the brain processes empathy in healthy subjects before studying its <b>impairements.</b> The purpose of this paper will then be to synthesize what the neuroscience research already identified thanks to the numerous works in neurophysiology, neuroimaging and lesion studies. We will also mention some limitations of this field of research and end the paper with its future perspectives. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{polarization}} multiplexing based coherent optical transmission, two main kinds of <b>impairements</b> {{have to be}} counter-acted: 1) the inter-symbol interference generated by the chromatic dispersion and the polarization mode dispersion and 2) the frequency offset. Usually adaptive approaches are carried out to mitigate them. Since the channel is very slowly time-varying, we propose to combat these <b>impairements</b> by using block-wise methods. Therefore, we introduce two new algorithms: {{the first one is}} a block-wise version of blind time equalizer (such as CMA), and the second one estimates the frequency offset in block-wise way. These algorithms are suitable for PSK and QAM constellations. By simulation investigations, we show that they outperform the standard approach in terms of convergence speed only at a moderate expense of computational load. We also experimentally evaluate their performance using 8 -PSK real data traces and off-line processing which takes into account other physical impairments such as phase noise and non-linear effects...|$|R

A system being developed by Rutgers and Stanford Universities provides therapy at the patient’s home, with remote monitoring and periodic re-as-sessment. This telerehabilitation system uses virtual reality and haptic interfaces, and a pair of networked PCs.

40|$|During {{the last}} 2 - 3 years, {{there has been}} a lot of {{activities}} aiming to deploy broadband wireless access systems. The US LMDS auctions in February-March 1998 of 1. 3 GHz of spectrum between 27. 5 GHz and 31. 3 GHz triggered e orts to develop system solutions and standards that have as objective to render LMDS systems competitive to other broadband, and primarily wireline, technologies. The modem design must be matched to the channel characteristics of LMDS systems, which are very di erent from those of coax and even lower frequency wireless communications systems. In addition, the cost factor is a key issue to face the competition from other technologies. A modem design meeting these two constraints is described in this paper, together with an analysis of the main <b>impairements</b> characterizing the LMDS channel.
