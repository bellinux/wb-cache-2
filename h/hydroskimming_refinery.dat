5000|$|Hydroskimming {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} types of refinery used in the petroleum industry. [...] A <b>hydroskimming</b> <b>refinery</b> is defined as a refinery equipped with atmospheric distillation, naphtha reforming and necessary treating processes. A <b>hydroskimming</b> <b>refinery</b> is therefore more complex than a topping refinery (which just separates the crude into its constituent petroleum products by distillation, known as atmospheric distillation, and produces naphtha but no gasoline) and it produces gasoline. However a <b>hydroskimming</b> <b>refinery</b> produces a surplus of fuel with a relatively unattractive price and demand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{refinery}} has {{a capacity}} of [...] [...] It is a simple <b>hydroskimming</b> <b>refinery,</b> but its products meet market specifications due {{to the use of}} high quality crude oil. It produces fuel oil, gas oil, naphtha and kerosene. The complex also produces petrochemicals, utilizing naphtha as a feed stock for an ethylene plant with {{a capacity of}} 1.2 million tons per year (tpy). Its main products are ethylene (330,000 tpy), propylene (170,000 tpy), Mix C4 (130,000 tpy) and P Gasoline (335,000 tpy).|$|E
5000|$|Ra's Lanuf is a topping and {{reforming}} oil refinery. It became operational in 1984 {{and produces}} an estimated [...] It {{is a simple}} <b>hydroskimming</b> <b>refinery,</b> but its products meet market specifications due to high quality crude oil. Rasco produces fuel oil, gas oil, LPG, naphtha and kerosene. The refinery also produces petrochemicals, utilizing naphtha as a feed stock to an ethylene plant with a capacilty of 1.2 million tpy (tons per year). Its main products are ethylene (330,000 tpy), propylene (170,000 tpy), Mix C4 (130,000 tpy) and P Gasoline (335,000 tpy).|$|E
50|$|Catalytic cracking, coking {{and other}} such {{conversion}} units {{are referred to as}} secondary processing units. The Nelson Complexity Index, captures the proportion of the secondary conversion unit capacities relative to the primary distillation or topping capacity. The Nelson Complexity Index typically varies from about 2 for <b>hydroskimming</b> <b>refineries,</b> to about 5 for the Cracking refineries and over 9 for the Coking refineries.|$|R
2500|$|NOC {{owns and}} {{operates}} several refining facilities, in addition to many {{oil and natural gas}} processing companies. Close to [...] of crude is refined by NOCs subsidiaries. Approximately 60% of refined products are exported, primarily to Europe. These are simple <b>hydroskimming</b> <b>refineries,</b> but their products meet market specifications due to high quality crude. As of early June 2007, NOC was evaluating investment proposals for upgrading its Ra's Lanuf refinery. Total cost of the upgrade is estimated at $2 billion. NOC is also expected to re-tender an engineering, procurement and construction contract for upgrading the Zawia refinery. NOC's refineries include: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in 1963 and first lube refinery {{was constructed in}} June 1966. <b>Hydroskimming</b> fuel <b>refinery</b> was commissioned in April 1977 and its capacity was increased in 1985. BTX (petrochemical) plant was constructed in April 1979 {{which was the first}} petrochemical unit of the country. Second lube refinery was constructed in February 1992. Since then various up gradations and revamps of the refinery have been made. In 2005, the company was privatized and Attock group acquired 51% share holding of National Refinery.|$|R
