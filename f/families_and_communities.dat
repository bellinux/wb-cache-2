5|$|There is {{an ethical}} {{component}} {{that must be}} considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted {{to assist with the}} processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing peace of mind to <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities.</b> These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> or committed suicide.|$|E

Especially, in helping children to learn and to put up school events, this volunteer needs to cooperate with them and teachers.

These issues represent critical areas of work where clarification, agreement, and further development are needed, as well as promising new directions that are emerging. After reviewing and examining more than 160 publications, four key issues emerged: that the concept of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> connections with schools needs to be clarified, that outcomes of <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> connections with schools need to be measured in a consistent way, that the research base for <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> connections with schools needs to be advanced, and that critical areas for research in this field still exist.

25|$|A {{minority}} of historians dispute that {{substantial numbers of}} mixed-blood Aboriginal children were forcibly taken from their families.
