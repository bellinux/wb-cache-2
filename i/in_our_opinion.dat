5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|One {{interpretation}} {{follows the}} insights of the renowned Augustinian scholar, Fr. Fulbert Cayré (1884–1971), who holds to an Augustinian definition of the charism: the Assumption was born of Augustinian inspiration as evidenced, among other things, by its name, its rule, the institute it founded (Les Etudes augustiniennes), the number of references to St. Augustine in the founder’s writings (he once wrote that the City of God should be for the Assumption “a kind of second revelation”), and the many Assumptionist authors in the Augustinian tradition (Cayré, Edgar Bourque, Marcel Neusch, Goulven Madec, Ernest Fortin, George Folliet, Rémi Munsch, etc.). This interpretation, strongly founded on the facts, bears witness to the debt Assumption owes to Augustine. Still, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>opinion,</b> Augustine remains second to d’Alzon himself.|$|E

500|$|In {{negotiations}} {{on the future of}} Rhodesia Douglas-Home was less successful. He was instrumental in persuading the rebel leader, Ian Smith, to accept proposals for a transition to African majority rule. Douglas-Home set up an independent commission chaired by a senior British judge, Lord Pearce, to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion in Rhodesia. After extensive fieldwork throughout Rhodesia, the commission reported, [...] "We are satisfied on our evidence that the proposals are acceptable to the great majority of Europeans. We are equally satisfied... that the majority of Africans rejected the proposals. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>opinion</b> the people of Rhodesia as a whole do not regard the proposals as acceptable as a basis for independence." [...] To Douglas-Home's disappointment there was no resolution, and Rhodesia remained a rebel regime long after he left office.|$|E
500|$|During {{the play}} on Monday, a short ball from Larwood {{fractured}} Bert Oldfield's skull, although Bodyline tactics {{were not being}} used at the time. The Australian Board of Control contacted the MCC managers Warner and Palairet asking them to arrange for the team to cease the use of Bodyline, but they replied the captain was solely {{in charge of the}} playing side of the tour. On the Wednesday of the game, the Australian Board sent a cable to the MCC which stated [...] "Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace {{the best interests of the}} game, making protection of the body by the batsman the main consideration.

[...] After England's victory in the match, Jardine went to the Australian dressing room but had the door closed in his face. Speaking to his team, Jardine offered to end the use of the tactics if the players opposed them, but they unanimously voted to continue. The report in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack stated it was probably the most unpleasant match ever played.|$|E
500|$|The Great Hall is {{the central}} part of Bramall Hall. As with typical great halls in the Middle Ages, this would have been the room where the {{business}} of the house, estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household. It was originally an open-roofed, single-storey building, with a fireplace situated {{in the middle of the}} floor. It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt, and the Withdrawing Room was created above it. A long gallery was also added as a third storey. The history of the gallery is uncertain; it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819, because it was believed to be unsafe. A similar gallery was built at Little Moreton Hall, and it is still intact, causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight. The Great Hall has a bay window with leaded windows, common throughout the building. William Harrison Ainsworth wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall, in his 1834 novel Rookwood. He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall, and be entertained and sometimes refreshed. He described Bramall as [...] " [...] best specimen of its class... its class, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>opinion,</b> is the best... to be met with in Cheshire". No evidence exists for any such right of way. According to another tale, food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside.|$|E

The first, that in the year 1759 the Italian {{painters}} were, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> author's <b>opinion,</b> sunk <b>in</b> the very bathos of insipidity. The second, that the Venetian painters, i.e. Titian, Tintoret, and Veronese, are, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> author's <b>opinion,</b> to be classed with the Dutch; that is to say, are painters in a style [...] "in which the slowest intellect is always sure to succeed best." [...] Thirdly, that painting naturally is not a difficult thing, nor one on which a painter should pride himself. And, finally, that connoisseurs, seeing a cat or a fiddle successfully painted, ought not therefore immediately to compare the painter to Raphael or Michael Angelo.|$|R
