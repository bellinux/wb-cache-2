In 1992 Mathews joined Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and led the <b>economic</b> <b>team</b> for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created in May 1933 a scheme for deficit financing. Capital projects were {{paid for with}} the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money to do so. While the national debt soared, Hitler and his <b>economic</b> <b>team</b> expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} fallout from Iraq and the pension reforms led to poor {{results for the}} LDP in the July 2004 upper house elections. While the coalition retained its majority, and the LDP remained the largest party, the opposition DPJ narrowly won {{the largest number of}} the contested seats. This was considered a setback, and reflective of the Prime Minister's decline in popularity, but Koizumi refused to resign. Two months after the election, Koizumi conducted the first reshuffle of his second cabinet in an attempt to improve his popularity, he changed several key ministers, but kept his key <b>economic</b> <b>team</b> in place.|$|E
25|$|The narrow {{majority}} for the Conservative government {{proved to}} be unmanageable, particularly after the United Kingdom's forced exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday (16 September 1992) just five months into the new parliament. From this stage onwards, Labour – now led by John Smith – was ascendant in the opinion polls. Major allowed his <b>economic</b> <b>team</b> to stay in place unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before forcing the resignation of his Chancellor, Norman Lamont, who he replaced with Kenneth Clarke. This delay was indicative {{of one of his}} weaknesses, an indecisiveness towards personnel issues that was to undermine his authority through the rest of his premiership.|$|E

50|$|Political {{tensions}} with neighboring countries like Peru over mining {{and other resources}} to support the growing population, and struggles between the growing urban mestizo population and indigenous peoples over land and resources have underlined the political struggles in recent years.

Firstly, the <b>economic</b> <b>teams</b> formed by the military government tended to be made of the same figures, mainly coming from the conservative-liberal sections of society, leading some to say that the Armed Forces behaved as a political party of the upper classes.

40|$|What are {{the causes}} of {{economic}} globalization and {{of the sources of}} globalization in national policy? We address these questions with a focus on policies of capital market liberalization and theories of cultural and policy isomorphism in Latin America, an early liberalizer among emerging markets and developing countries. We conceptualize international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) as a key carrier of “mimetic isomorphism, ” the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a vehicle for “coercive isomorphism ” and the ascent of neoliberal economists to economic policy-making positions as an indicator of the rise of neoliberal “normative” isomorphism. Our analysis of data on 17 Latin American countries in the 1980 s and 1990 s reveals that IMF coercive isomorphism, professional isomorphism in the form of neoliberal <b>economic</b> policy <b>teams,</b> and INGO-based mimetic isomorphism largely drove financial neoliberalization. However, although IMF and neoliberal <b>economic</b> <b>teams</b> promoted capital market liberalization, ties to INGOs inhibited it. There is some evidence that additional political forces, leftist chiefs of government and domestic banking interests, complemented the anti-neoliberal pressures emanating from the domestic banking sector and the new transnational civi...|$|R

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>teams,</b> {{including}} the business partnership, are created to exploit gains from cooperation, but teams also {{fall prey to}} shirking and other opportunistic behaviors, which lead to their dissolution. If team production is partly financed with debt, the untimely dissolution of partnerships exposes creditors to default risks that they will price into debt contracts. This paper explores these two features of the nineteenth-century business partnership and finds: (1) partnerships were short-lived teams (two years or less, on average) and larger partnerships were shorter-lived yet; and (2) compared to proprietorship, partnerships paid higher interest rates on short-term debt, after controlling for loan size, maturity, and other observable features. Although there were potential gains from team production, potential opportunism raised the costs of partnerships. ...|$|R
