50|$|In 1907, Walter A. Sheaffer {{patented}} the Lever filler, using a <b>hinged</b> <b>lever</b> {{set into}} the pen barrel which pressed down onto a bar which in turn compressed the rubber sac inside, creating a vacuum to force ink into the pen. Introduced in 1912, this innovation was rapidly imitated by the other major pen makers. Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap {{on the end of}} the barrel; when pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturers produce modern {{functional}} nutcrackers usually somewhat resembling pliers, {{but with}} the pivot point at the end beyond the nut, {{rather than in the}} middle. These are also used for cracking the shells of crab and lobster to make the meat inside available for eating. <b>Hinged</b> <b>lever</b> nutcrackers, often called a [...] "pair of nutcrackers", may date back to Ancient Greece. By the 14th century in Europe, nutcrackers were documented in England, including in the Canterbury Tales, and in France. The lever design may derive from blacksmiths' pincers. Materials included metals such as silver, cast-iron and bronze, and wood including boxwood, especially those from France and Italy. More rarely, porcelain was used. Many of the wooden carved nutcrackers were in the form of people and animals.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, Hex is {{activated}} by [...] "initializing the GBL," [...] which Stibbons reluctantly admits means [...] "pulling the Great Big Lever" [...] (similar to the Internet slang [...] "BRS", or [...] "big red switch"). This releases millions of ants into {{a much more}} complex network of glass tubes that makes {{up the bulk of}} Hex, hence the sticker on Hex that reads [...] "Anthill inside": a pun on Intel's ad slogan [...] "Intel Inside". Hex [...] "thinks" [...] by controlling which tubes the ants can crawl through, thus allowing it to perform increasingly complex computations if enough ants are provided (that is, if there are enough bugs in the system). This is a reference to Douglas Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in which there exists a sentient ant colony, with the ants acting as neurons. Hex can now be given input through a huge wooden keyboard, in analogue writing by means of a complicated mechanical eye designed by Hex itself, or vocally through an old hearing trumpet, and gives output by means of a series of wooden blocks and later a quill on a <b>hinged</b> <b>lever</b> (echoing the real-world evolution of computer output from paper tape to video monitor).|$|E
50|$|Very light {{crossbows}} can {{be drawn}} by hand, but heavier types need the help of mechanical devices. The simplest version of mechanical cocking device is a hook attached to a belt, drawing the bow by straightening the legs. Other devices are <b>hinged</b> <b>levers,</b> which either pulled or pushed the string into place, cranked rack-and-pinion devices called cranequins and multiple cord-and-pulley cranked devices called windlasses.|$|R
5000|$|Pereira was {{interested}} in exploring {{the role of the}} artist in society, believing artists to be on a par with industrialists. She created [...] "machine paintings" [...] that incorporated images of technological components, including ship's ventilators, generators, and funnels, as well as <b>hinges,</b> <b>levers,</b> and gears. [...] Boat Composite from 1932, {{in the collection of the}} Whitney Museum of American Art is an example of her [...] "machine paintings".|$|R
50|$|Only {{one type}} of 4-12-2 was built: the Union Pacific Railroad's 9000-series {{locomotives}}, 88 of which were built by ALCO between 1926 and 1930. These locomotives were used {{to increase the speed}} of freight trains in flat country, and were fairly successful, but were maintenance nightmares, largely because of their use of an inside third cylinder driving the cranked second driving axle between the frames. There was no inside valve gear to worry about, however. ALCO had obtained permission to use the conjugated valve gear invented by Sir Nigel Gresley. This system used two <b>hinged</b> <b>levers</b> connected to the outer cylinder's valves to operate the inner cylinder's valve. The 9000 class locomotives were the largest to use Gresley gear.|$|R
50|$|In 1839, a <b>hinged</b> loading <b>lever</b> and capping window became {{standard}} for new revolvers and was retrofitted {{to the older}} designs. So modified, the revolvers could be loaded without disassembly. When the Paterson revolvers with loading levers finally reached Texas in 1842, Texas Ranger Captain John Coffee Hays was very pleased that his ranging companies could now reload from horseback.|$|R
50|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of 37 barrels of 11 mm inside a cylindrical protective casing. Loading was performed with a loading plate containing 37 cartridges. It was inserted against the breech in one stroke and locked {{in with a}} <b>hinged</b> loading <b>lever</b> attached {{to the rear of}} the gun. The ammunition had a brass head and thin rolled brass foil body and was fired by needle pins. With the rotation of a crank, all shots were fired simultaneously, although later improvements used a cam which permitted the progressive firing of the 37 shots. Around 150 - 250 shots per minute could be fired depending on the skills of the operators. The whole weapon was very heavy, weighing 2000 lb.|$|R
5000|$|The {{action of}} these small {{instruments}} {{is known as the}} [...] "English single" [...] and is unusually simple (for instance, it is far simpler than the original piano action as invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori.) It consists of a small [...] "sticker" [...] simply pushing up on a hammer, while a rod passing through the hitch pin plank lifted up a damper <b>lever</b> <b>hinged</b> from a rail attached to the spine. The action is illustrated below.|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} by Rab [4], the altered biomechanical femoro-acetabular contact area {{can lead to}} impaction-type or inclusion-type impingement. The latter {{is due to a}} prominence (bump) on the head–neck junction in mild SCFE [5] or to the remodelling process in higher grade SCFE resulting in a cam deformity. Impaction-type impingement is due to an abutment of the proximal metaphysis on the acetabular rim, which cannot enter the acetabulum as occurs in higher grade SCFE. Due to the <b>hinge</b> and <b>lever</b> effect on the acetabulum rim, increasing stress on the posterior acetabular cartilage is applied as well as direct antero-superior labral injuries [4]. Early degenerative changes with cartilaginous and labral injuries have been reported not only in moderate and severe but also in mild SCFE [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].|$|R
25|$|A huge bust of Kong's head, neck, {{and upper}} chest {{was made of}} wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E. B. Gibson, and Fred Reefe. Inside the structure, metal <b>levers,</b> <b>hinges,</b> and an air {{compressor}} were operated by three men to control the mouth and facial expressions. Its fangs were 10 inches in length and its eyeballs 12 inches in diameter. The bust was moved from set to set on a flatcar. Its scale matched none of the models and, if fully realized, Kong would have stood thirty to forty feet tall.|$|R
50|$|A dial test {{indicator}}, {{also known}} as a lever arm test indicator or finger indicator, has a smaller measuring range than a standard dial indicator. A test indicator measures the deflection of the arm, the probe does not retract but swings in an arc around its <b>hinge</b> point. The <b>lever</b> may be interchanged for length or ball diameter, and permits measurements to be taken in narrow grooves and small bores where the body of a probe type may not reach. The model shown is bidirectional, some types may have to be switched via a side lever to be able to measure in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|Spades {{are flat}} metal plates, usually {{attached}} to the aileron lower surface, ahead of the aileron <b>hinge,</b> by a <b>lever</b> arm. They reduce the force needed by the pilot to deflect the aileron and are often seen on aerobatic aircraft. As the aileron is deflected upward, the spade produces a downward aerodynamic force, which tends to rotate the whole assembly so as to further deflect the aileron upward. The size of the spade (and its lever arm) determines how much force the pilot needs to apply to deflect the aileron. A spade works {{in the same manner}} as a horn but is more efficient due to the longer moment arm.|$|R
50|$|The {{means of}} lifting the bar varies. Some {{machines}} have a roller {{at the top}} of the bar that sits on a lever. When the lever is raised the bar can go up and the roller moves along the lever, allowing the bar to stay vertical. On some machines the bar is attached to a <b>hinge</b> on the <b>lever,</b> which causes swaying in the bar and the plates as the lever goes up and down. On other machines the bar is attached to a cable or belt, which runs through pulleys or over a wheel. The other end of the cable will either be a handle or strap that the user holds or wraps around some body part, or will be attached to a lever, adding further simple machines to the mechanical chain.|$|R
50|$|The Knights Armament Company LMG {{is listed}} as the lightest and most simple, rugged 5.56x45mm NATO machine gun. The Stoner LMG is an open bolt, belt-fed, gas operated, air-cooled, and fully automatic, firing {{at a rate of}} 550 rounds per minute. The belt feed has an unusual exposed <b>lever</b> <b>hinged</b> {{at the side of the}} receiver. The top cover above the feed tray is very short which allows quicker {{reloading}} and allowing the use of sights etc. Although it lacks a bipod, a grip pod is intended to be installed on the modular handguard. The KAC LMG lacks a bolt buffer as there is no impact on the bolt making the weapon controllable in full auto. The KAC LMG is extremely accurate due to the secure mounting of the “quick change” hammer forged chrome lined barrel.|$|R
40|$|Individual- and Local Blade Control (IBC/LBC) for {{helicopter}} rotors {{promises to}} be a method to increase flight performance and to reduce vibration and noise. Quite a few concepts to realize IBC Systems have been proposed so far. Some of them have already been tested in wind tunnels or on real helicopters. A drawback of all systems that include discrete mechanical components like <b>hinges,</b> <b>levers</b> or gears is their vulnerability in a helicopter environment with high centrifugal loads and high vibration levels. That’s why the idea of using smart materials that are directly embedded in the rotor blade structure is very attractive for this application. Operating as solid state actuators they can generate a twist deformation of the rotor blade without any friction and wear. A promising approach is the use of anisotropic piezoelectric strain actuators embedded in the rotor blade skin. This concept has been intensively investigated in the US. Wind tunnel tests have been performed with 1 / 6 th scaled CH- 47 rotor with a radius of 1. 397 m and a chord of 108 mm in a heavy gas me-dium. Investigations on up-scaling have been carried out using a full scale blade segment of a CH- 47 blade. Main features of these blades are a D-spar configuration and several plies of Active Fiber Composites (AFC). Motivated by these promising results and the potential benefits, the goal of this work was the development and test of an active twist blade incorporating improved actuation tech-nology and alternative structural concepts to bring this technology a further step forward. At this phase the test are limited to a verification of the actuation system and the structural concepts under centrifugal loads. The intention is to develop the necessary prerequisites for a successful wind tunnel campaign with an active twist model rotor. Because of the large amount of available experi-mental data, the BO 105 model rotor was chosen as reference rotor, having a radius of 2 m and a chord of 121 mm. The baseline design of all blades was a C-spar configuration with an anisotropic blade skin incorporating a single layer of state of the art Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuators. The design of the blades was optimized using a finite element code as well as rotor dynamic simu-lations to predict the benefits with respect to vibrations, noise and performance. Several blades with different skin lay-ups, actuator configurations and spar geometry were designed build and tested. The blades were intensively investigated within some bench- and centrifugal tests. To mea-sure the blade deformation the blades were equipped with several sets of strain gauges. An optical measurement system was installed to allow a direct measurement of the active twist angle. The centrifugal test comprised a measurement of the active twist performance at the nominal rotation speed of 1043 RPM at different excitation frequencies from 2 /rev up to 6 /rev. Finally the blades were compared with respect to their twist performance...|$|R
40|$|Individual Blade Control (IBC) for {{helicopter}} main rotors {{promises to}} be a method to increase flight performance and to reduce vibration and noise. Several structural concepts for the implementation of such a secondary control have been presented in the past. Many of those include discrete me-chanical components like <b>hinges,</b> <b>levers</b> or gears, which are subject to wear. In contrast to that, active twist blades use smart materials, which are directly embedded into the blade structure and – on top – do not show any discrete edges. Several different technologies have been proposed to twist rotor blades. Within the common DLR-ONERA partnership, a project called “Active Twist Bla-de” (ATB) was established in 2004, which investigated different concepts for active twist blades, using the BO 105 blade with a cord length of 121 mm and a C-spar as reference. The concept followed by DLR uses a technology consisting of skin integrated piezoelectric patches oriented at +/- 45 deg in upper and lower skin, respectively. Specially shaped Macro Fiber Composi-te actuators (MFCs) generate a directed strain in the skin. This is a prerequisite for the shear torsi-on coupling, which causes the blade to twist. In addition to that the twist generation was enhanced by the use of non isotropy in the skin and a variation of the actuator orientation. Several different demonstrators have been designed and built, featuring different degrees of isotropy in the skin and different designs and angles of the actuator. The concept followed by ONERA uses a twistable section closed by actuation (TWISCA), where the actuator is introducing warping into the section. This is done by cutting the section along the radius of the blade and bridging this gap with a shear actuator, which is causing {{the two sides of the}} slot to move parallel to one another. Different locations of the slot in the profile were proposed. At first a slotted trailing edge was investigated, where later developments move the slot into the spar region. Specially designed shear actuators – based on MFCs as well – were laid out to intro-duce the warping movement into the structure. For both concepts several 1 : 2. 5 mach scaled demonstrator rotor blades were built which measure 2 m radius, each. Besides intensive lab tests for determining stiffness distribution and active twist for all blades a testing campaign in the DLRs whirl tower facility was carried out, which is especially equipped for testing rotor blades with active elements. The blades were tested in hover conditions, only. Blade tip twist was measured optically for all blades. The active twist angles for quasi static excitation exceeded the minimal demand of ± 1. 5 deg for all blades. On top of that the blades dy-namic behaviour (fan plot) and active twist under centrifugal loads and quasi static and dynamic excitations were measured. The specific working capability of the designs was derived and com-pared, considering not only the twist at the blade tip, but also the torsional rigidity and the actuator volume. A final discussion of reliability and maintenance issues will close this paper. ...|$|R
50|$|Current Fascinations are {{all-composite}} aircraft, with a {{low wing}} of trapezoidal planform. The ailerons have external balance trim tabs and sealed nosegaps. Inboard, there are electrically operated Fowler flaps. The fuselage becomes slender towards the tail, where the trapezoidal tailplane is set at mid-height, the elevators having a small cutout for rudder movement. The fin is swept but the rudder has vertical edges; it extends {{to the bottom of}} the fuselage. The cockpit seats two in side-by-side configuration under a one-piece bubble canopy, <b>lever</b> <b>hinged</b> from the rear; behind the seat backs there is luggage space. Until 2008, all Fascinations had a retractable tricycle undercarriage. The main wheels, mounted from the fuselage on cantilever spring legs, retract electrically outward into the wing and the nosewheel retracts rearwards. The fixed wheel option has wheel fairings. The main wheels have brakes and the nosewheel power steering. A Stratos Magnum 501 ballistic recovery parachute is fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Sadlowski {{is able to}} {{generate}} such massive lengths far beyond those {{of some of the}} more powerfully built professional golfers because of his unique flexibility and leanness of build, remarking, [...] "Because I'm lean, I can get in positions other long drivers can't."

5000|$|In 1811 Wornum {{patented}} a small bichord upright standing {{about three}} feet three inches tall (99 cm) styled the [...] "unique". Its strings were stretched diagonally from the top {{to the right side}} of the case and communicated with a small sounding board, and the case itself was divided in half with separate parts containing the action and keyboard, and strings and frame. Wornum's escapement worked directly upon a padded notch on the hammer butt and in this way could omit the intermediate lever used in many square pianos and Southwell's cabinet uprights, and the hammer was returned to its resting position by a spring fixed to the hammer rail instead of by its own weight or that of the sticker. Like Southwell, Wornum used overdampers that pressed against the strings above the hammers and were mounted on <b>levers</b> <b>hinged</b> from a separate rail, but the wires that raised them were to be acted upon by the backward oriented base of the escapement instead of by the sticker or the hammer. Wornum also claimed a buff stop, operated by the left pedal which muted one of the strings of each note. Two articles published in 1851 indicate that the firm built several hundred of these pianos.|$|R
5000|$|In 1826 Wornum {{patented}} {{improvements to}} what he called in the specification the professional piano, claiming a pizzicato pedal positioned between the two ordinary pedals and operating linkages arranged to press the dampers against the strings, a pinned single action where the damper lever was raised by a button {{at the end of}} a wire attached to an extension on the sticker and two double actions with additional levers mounted to a second rail for operating the dampers as well as checks for the hammer. The first of these was arranged like the action from his 1811 patent with the backward facing escapement on the key operating the check lever wire; in the second the check lever wire was operated by the sticker. The sticker was pinned to the underside of another <b>lever,</b> <b>hinged</b> to the hammer rail and carrying the escapement. The escapement worked on the principle of the English grand action with the regulating button fixed to the hammer rail, but with its spring mounted on the sticker instead of the lower part of the escapement. A fixed hammer return spring was not shown, and apparently in its place a spring was mounted on the hopper and worked against the hammer butt to prevent the hammer [...] "from dancing after the hand is off the key".|$|R
50|$|The Natter had no landing gear, which saved weight, {{expense and}} {{construction}} time. Consequently, {{one of the}} most unusual features of the machine was the escape of the pilot and recovery of the machine. The proposed sequence of these events was as follows: After the attack, the Natter might dive to a lower altitude and flatten out into level flight. The pilot would then proceed with a well-practised escape sequence. He would open the cockpit canopy latch; the canopy flicking backwards on its hinge in the airstream; he would undo his seat belt and remove his feet from the rudder pedal stirrups. By squeezing a lever mounted on the control column, he would release a lock {{at the base of the}} column, which would allow him to tilt the column forwards where it could engage in and undo a safety latch for the nose release mechanism. He would then lean a little further forward and pull a <b>lever</b> <b>hinged</b> near the floor at the front of the cockpit. This action frees the nose section, which self-jettisoned as a result of the reduced aerodynamic pressure at the front of the fuselage. As the nose section separates, it was intended to briefly pull on two cables that release a small ribbon parachute stored on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The parachute subsequently opens and decelerates the Natter. The pilot would be ejected from the cockpit by his own inertia and as soon as he was clear of the fuselage, he would open his personal parachute and descend to the ground.|$|R
