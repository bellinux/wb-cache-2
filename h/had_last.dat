5|$|In 1834, {{silver dollar}} {{production}} was temporarily restarted to supply a diplomatic mission to Asia {{with a special}} set of proof coins. Officials mistakenly believed that dollars <b>had</b> <b>last</b> been minted with the date 1804, prompting them to use that date rather than the date in which the coins were actually struck. A limited number of 1804 dollars were struck by the Mint in later years, and they remain rare and valuable.|$|E

5|$|The 2002 Gator Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 1, 2002 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, exactly one {{year since the}} Hokies <b>had</b> <b>last</b> played in the game.

In the second quarter, however, Florida State began to find gaps in the Hokie defense and scored 10points. At halftime, Florida State held a 103 lead.|$|E

The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals worked closely with the civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E

5|$|After {{success in}} karting as a child, Schumacher won titles in Formula König and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship. In 1991, his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team {{resulted}} in Schumacher being signed by Benetton {{for the rest}} of that season. He finished third in 1992 and fourth in 1993, before becoming the first German World Drivers' Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill. In 1995 he repeated the success, this time with a greater margin. In 1996, Schumacher moved to Ferrari, who <b>had</b> <b>last</b> won the Driver's Championship in 1979, and helped them transform into the most successful team in Formula One history, as he came close to winning the 1997 and 1998 titles, before breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix, ending another title run.|$|E

Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt <b>had</b> <b>last</b> visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had {{in that city}} had {{in large part to}} do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|Buxton (1995) {{tells the}} story of two men who left Mingulay together. One was visiting Barra, and the other {{intended}} to emigrate to New York. They said their farewells in Castlebay but it did not work out for the latter and he returned from the United States three months later. To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they <b>had</b> <b>last</b> met because of adverse sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.|$|E
5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having hung up on Danny right before he disappeared. Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because it was near the place he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> seen Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E
5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as a boy and <b>had</b> <b>last</b> been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
50|$|The Labour Act of 2004 {{allows for}} a few {{different}} ways in which employees can be terminated. The first method is in the event of the death of an employee. The second is that either party may terminate the employment contract as long as the other party is given notice. The amount of notice given goes as follows: one days notice for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> less than three months, one week of notice for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> more than three months but less than two years, two weeks for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> more than two years but less than five years, and one month for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> for more than five years.

40|$|SummaryWe {{examined}} {{activity in}} the frontal cortex as monkeys performed a duration-discrimination task. Two stimuli, one red and the other blue, appeared sequentially on a video screen—in either order. Later, both stimuli reappeared, and to receive a reward the monkeys had to choose the stimulus that <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer during its initial presentation. Some neurons encoded stimulus duration, but {{a larger number of}} cells represented their relative duration, which was encoded in three ways: whether the first or second stimulus <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer; whether the red or blue stimulus <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer; or, less commonly, as {{the difference between the two}} durations. As the monkeys' choice approached, the signal encoding which stimulus (red or blue) <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer increased as the order-based signal dissipated. By representing stimulus durations and relative durations—both bound to stimulus features and event order—the frontal cortex could contribute to both temporal perception and episodic memory...|$|R
5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container <b>had</b> <b>last</b> {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing. Moments after this procedure commenced, the staff member was advised of {{a telephone call from}} his wife and he went to answer the telephone. With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over and rolled some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E
5|$|In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut {{for a large}} invited audience; it was {{remarked that}} his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his {{personal}} bearing was admirable {{for a man of}} eighty-six. He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the Cimetière de Montparnasse. Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he <b>had</b> <b>last</b> seen in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Mariano {{was told}} that this refined cloth was {{restricted}} for use only by the bishop of the city. Mariano {{went to see the}} prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they touched him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel <b>had</b> <b>last</b> appeared.|$|E

5|$|Monk is briefly {{separated}} from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador <b>had</b> <b>last</b> been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, {{despite the lack of}} supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical coats, and that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{traveled}} to Richmond, {{where he received}} permission to raise an independent company of mounted infantry to provide defense along the border. Parsons set about enrolling volunteers, and within {{a short period of}} time, he enlisted approximately 30 men. Following its organization, the company became known as the Huckleberry Rangers of the Confederate States Army's 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The following personnel were elected to serve in leadership positions within the company: Parsons as its captain in command; John Blue, first lieutenant; and his son Isaac Parsons, Jr., second lieutenant. Parsons and his company utilized flintlock muskets, which they had retrieved from the loft of the courthouse, and additional sabres and flintlock horse pistols which <b>had</b> <b>last</b> been used during the American Revolutionary War. Parsons provided Lt. Blue with a Minié ball rifle reportedly seized from John Brown at Harpers Ferry.|$|E
