40|$|Abstract. In edge orientations, {{the goal}} is usually to orient (direct) the edges of an undirected network (modeled by a graph) such that all outdegrees are bounded. When the network is fully dynamic, i. e., admits edge insertions and deletions, we wish to {{maintain}} such an orientation while <b>keeping</b> a <b>tab</b> <b>on</b> the update time. Low out-degree orientations {{turned out to be}} a surprisingly useful tool for managing networks. Brodal and Fagerberg (1999) initiated the study of the edge orientation problem in terms of the graph’s arboricity, which is very natural in this context. Their solution achieves a constant out-degree and a logarithmic amortized update time for all graphs with constant arboricity, which include all planar and excluded-minor graphs. It remained an open question – first proposed by Brodal and Fagerberg, later by Erickson and others – to obtain similar bounds with worst-case update time. We address this 15 year old question by providing a simple algorithm with worst-case bounds that nearly match the previous amortized bounds. Our algorithm is based on a new approach of maintaining a combinatorial invariant, and achieves a logarithmic out-degree with logarithmic worst-case update times. This result has applications to various dynamic network problems such as maintaining a maximal matching, where we obtain logarithmic worst-case update time compared to a similar amortized update time of Neiman and Solomon (2013). ...|$|R

40|$|State legislatures enacted sex {{offender}} registration and notification (SORN) laws with the explicit and exclusive aim of reducing {{sex offender}} recidivism. The general {{idea that we}} ought to “regulate” released offenders — of any type — to reduce the likelihood of their returning to crime is an attractive one, at least in theory. Criminal recidivism generates significant social harm. Nevertheless, despite their now-widespread use, SORN laws became the norm without any systematic study of their consequences. Admittedly, the logic underlying these laws seems at first difficult to gainsay: if a known sex offender poses even a small risk to a potential new victim, how can it hurt if the police are <b>keeping</b> better <b>tabs</b> <b>on</b> that offender or if the offender’s neighbors are made aware that he is a threat so they can take measures to reduce their own risk of victimization? But this question and its implied answer presume that SORN laws have no influence whatever on whether released sex offenders opt to pursue new victims in the first place. If the enforcement of notification laws imposes significant financial, social, and psychological costs on released sex offenders, as an avalanche of evidence suggests it does, then notification may in fact be criminogenic. The result may well be many more attempted attacks by convicted sex offenders and therefore higher recidivism rates on the whole, even if every individual attack attempted becomes somewhat less likely to succeed...|$|R

The FBI opened a file on Hampton in 1967.
