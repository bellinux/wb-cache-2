40|$|Several {{issues related}} to <b>the</b> {{interface}} structure <b>in</b> molecular-beam epitaxially grown InAs/AlSb and InAs/GaSb heterostructures are investigated by Raman scattering, photoluminescence and X-ray measurements. The measurements reveal differing degrees of layer intermixing at the interfaces (IFs), greatest for AlAs-like <b>IFs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> InAs/AlSb material system, less pronounced for GaAs-like <b>IFs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> InAs/GaSb material system, and smallest for InSb like <b>IFs</b> <b>in</b> both systems. This intermixing is both thermodynamically favoured and, in addition, driven by a lowering of the strain-induced component of the surface energy...|$|R

5|$|Bent progressed through Ipswich Town's youth system, having {{joined the}} club at age 14 in 1998, after {{considering}} a possible career in athletics. He signed a professional contract with Ipswich on 2 July 2001. He made his first-team debut on 1 November 2001 in a 3–1 victory against Helsingborgs <b>IF</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UEFA Cup, and scored his first senior goal in a 4–1 League Cup defeat to Newcastle United on 27 November 2001.|$|E
5|$|His footballing {{career began}} as a youth player with home club Elverum IL, before joining Strømmen <b>IF</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s. He moved to Kongsvinger IL in 1989, {{establishing}} himself as a first-team regular in the Norwegian Premier League. After three seasons with Kongsvinger, he transferred to Rosenborg in 1992, where he in his inaugural season won the Norwegian Premier League and Norwegian Cup, in the final of, which he scored the deciding goal against Lillestrøm SK.|$|E
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. <b>If</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|Håkan Jeppsson, CEO of Inwido, a Swedish {{company that}} sells windows and doors, was elected as the club's new {{chairman}} in February 2010. Jeppsson {{had previously been}} a member of the board and vice-chairman during the last years of Madsen's time in charge. Jeppsson's first year as chairman proved to be markedly different from those directly preceding it, as the club won its 19th league title in November 2010. The championship was much celebrated by the club's fans because it coincided with the club's centenary, and also because Malmö FF clinched the title two points ahead of their local rivals Helsingborgs <b>IF</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final standings. The second Swedish championship of Jeppssons chairmanship was won in the 2013 season where the title was secured in the penultimate round of the league. The club also won Svenska Supercupen for the first time in 2013 with a 3–2 win against rivals IFK Göteborg. In the following season Malmö FF won yet another league title and entered the group stage of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the club's history.|$|E
5|$|<b>If,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> famous {{garden and}} {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue {{of the two}} lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E

5|$|Josefson {{started to}} play junior hockey in 2005 for Djurgården's under-18 team. During the 2006–07 season, he helped Djurgården's under-16 team to win the Swedish championship. The 2007–08 season began with the {{national}} junior hockey tournament TV-pucken. Josefson's team Stockholm/Vit reached the final which ended with a 2–1 defeat to Småland. He made his Elitserien debut on 28 February 2008, against Timrå IK. This {{proved to be the}} only appearance Josefson would make in the Elitserien during the 2007–08 season. Josefson played for the J20-team during most of the season scoring 14 goals and 31 points. His team reached the playoffs, but were defeated by Brynäs <b>IF</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals. After the loss, he joined the under-18 team during the playoffs where he helped the team defeat Färjestads BK to capture the Swedish championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the AESC was {{the most}} prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a supporter of free enterprise like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of his objectives. He had little time for those who objected to plans that were {{for the betterment of}} South Australia, despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology. The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as a critical point in Playford's premiership; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford's leadership of his party, but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave himi enduring control over his party {{for the rest of his}} career, although it angered some of the staunch LCL conservatives in the upper house for some time; a significant number of them refused to talk to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter.|$|E
5|$|There {{remained}} {{the prospect of}} American assistance. In secret talks in Washington, D.C., in June 1939, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William D. Leahy {{raised the possibility of}} an American fleet being sent to Singapore. In April 1940, the American naval attaché in London, Captain Alan Kirk, approached the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Phillips, to ask <b>if,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of the United States Fleet being sent to the Far East, the docking facilities at Singapore could be made available, as those at Subic Bay were inadequate. He received full assurances that they would be. Hopes for American assistance were dashed at the staff conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. The U.S. Navy was primarily focused on the Atlantic. The American chiefs envisaged relieving British warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean so a British fleet could be sent to the Far East.|$|E
