40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} sixty years, {{cylindrical}} steel cannons (long mortar and short mortar) {{have been used in}} France to assess the safety of explosives with regard to firedamp. These testing methods are considered expensive mainly because a large number of shots are needed äs a result of the low level of reproducibility. Also, using them with certain explosives, such äs slurries and emulsions, is somewhat problematical. Taking into aecount the Polish expertise, CERCHAR (now INERIS) developed m the sixties a testing method in which the Charge, placed in a steel <b>groove</b> <b>mortar,</b> is isolated from the methane-air mixture by an asbestos-cement plate. This method seems more attractive than those traditionally used, {{especially when it comes to}} distinguishing rock explosives from the more powerfui pennitted explosives...|$|E
5000|$|Concrete masonry units may be {{formulated}} {{with special}} aggregates to produce specific colors or textures for finish use. Special textures may {{be produced by}} splitting a ribbed or solid two-block unit; such factory-produced units are called [...] "split-rib" [...] or [...] "split-face" [...] blocks. Blocks may be scored by grooves {{the width of a}} mortar joint to simulate different block modules. For example, an 8 by(x) 16 in block may be scored in the middle to simulate 8 by(x) 8 in masonry, with the <b>grooves</b> filled with <b>mortar</b> and struck to match the true joints.|$|R
5000|$|A 4-inch mortar was {{the only}} {{official}} type to enter service {{before the end of}} 1914 (12 units). It fired an 8½ pound steel bomb with studs to engage rifling <b>grooves</b> in the <b>mortar</b> barrel, similar to the German minenwerfer. The barrel was improvised by boring out a 6-inch shell. Its range of 900 yards and its accuracy was considered acceptable, but the shell case was expensive and was slow to load. About 40 guns and several thousand rounds were issued by June 1915, with 168 of the total 300 manufactured eventually serving in France. It was soon replaced by the 3-inch Stokes mortar in its [...] "light mortar" [...] class.|$|R

Foram preparadas argamassas com cimento Portland, areia e água, que foram moldadas, curadas a 25 ºC por 7 dias e secadas a 50 ºC por 48 h. Foram estudadas duas proporções (dosagens ou traços) de areia:cimento de 3 : 1 e 2 : 1. Foram testados dois tipos de entalhe: um com perfil quadrado da ponta e outro em "V" com ângulo de 60 º. Os entalhes de formato quadrado foram obtidos de duas formas: produzidos mecanicamente a partir de disco diamantado e outro na própria moldagem das amostras. Para produzir as amostras entalhadas e ranhuradas já na moldagem, foi desenvolvido um molde de PVC munido de lâminas de aço internas. A partir dos testes preliminares foram estabelecidas as condições de propagação estável da trinca. A trinca percorre um plano imaginário definido pelas ranhuras laterais da amostra. Os resultados mostraram que o entalhe que proporciona melhores condições de estabilidade de propagação de trinca é o de forma em "V", obtido durante o processo de moldagem das amostras. This paper {{discusses}} how {{the shape}} and preparation of the notch affect crack propagation in ceramic materials with heterogeneous microstructures and, as a result, the maximum load and fracture energy when these materials are subjected to loads using the wedge splitting test. Mortars were prepared with Portland cement, sand and water, which were mixed, molded, and cured at 25 ºC for seven days. After curing, the samples were dried at 55 ºC for 48 h. Two mortar compositions were prepared with proportions of sand:cement of 3 : 1 and 2 : 1. Two types of notches were tested: one with a square-tipped profile and the other V-shaped with a 60 º angle. The square shaped notches were prepared in two ways: one mechanically with a diamond disc tool and the other using blades as cores during the molding of the mortars. A PVC mold equipped with internal steel blades was created to produce samples notched and <b>grooved</b> in the <b>mortar</b> molding process. Stable conditions of crack propagation were established based on preliminary tests. The crack was found to propagate along an imaginary plane defined by the lateral grooves in the sample. The {{results indicated that the}} notch providing the best conditions of crack propagation stability is the V-shaped notch produced in the molding of the sample...|$|R
