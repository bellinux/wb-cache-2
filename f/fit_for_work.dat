25|$|In 1816, Robert Owen, {{a philosopher}} and pedagogue, opened the first British and {{probably}} globally the first infants school in New Lanark, Scotland. In conjunction with his venture for cooperative mills Owen wanted {{the children to}} be given a good moral education so that they would be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> His system was successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.|$|E
25|$|Someone {{wanting to}} claim ESA {{will need a}} medical certificate, i.e. a sick-note, signed by their GP {{to say that they}} are not fully <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The new {{claimant}} must then contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), usually by phone, who will log their claim and usually post them a questionnaire to complete (except in rare circumstances where a full assessment isn't required, such as when a doctor has officially certified the claimant as being likely to die within six months). The completed form must then be sent in the envelope provided to the Health Assessment Advisory Service - the trading name of the assessment provider, Maximus.|$|E
25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives {{the same amount of money}} as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work.|$|E

500|$|Göth was {{assigned}} to the SS-Totenkopfverbände ("Skull and crossbones" [...] unit; concentration camp service). His first assignment, starting on 11 February 1943, was to oversee the construction of the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp, which he was to command. The camp took one month to construct using forced labour. On 13 March 1943, the Jewish ghetto of Kraków was liquidated and those still <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> were sent to the new camp at Płaszów. Several thousand not deemed <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> were sent to extermination camps and murdered. Hundreds more were murdered on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto.|$|E
500|$|In fall 1941 the Nazis began {{transporting}} Jews {{out of the}} ghetto. Most {{of these}} were sent to Belzec extermination camp and killed. On 13 March 1943 the ghetto was liquidated and those still <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> {{were sent to the}} new concentration camp at Płaszów. Several thousand not deemed <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> were sent to extermination camps and killed. Hundreds more were killed on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto. Schindler, aware of the planned action because of his Wehrmacht contacts, had his workers stay at the factory overnight to prevent them coming to any harm. Schindler witnessed the liquidation of the ghetto and was appalled. From that point forward, says Schindlerjude Sol Urbach, Schindler [...] "changed his mind about the Nazis. He decided to get out and to save as many Jews as he could." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Black {{addressed}} the <b>Fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>Work</b> Europe organisation, {{of which she}} is a co-president (the organisation focuses on the consequences of musculoskeletal disorders when they affect people of working age). In her address, {{she said that the}} government had appointed her to her national director role because [...] "...we had far too many people leaving the workforce with relatively mild musculoskeletal conditions, stress, anxiety, depression...and many of those people received no immediate help to keep them in the workplace...they were leaving the workplace to go into the benefits system". She also said: [...] "If I had to summarise what we have been trying to do in the United Kingdom, it would be to say: get rid of the old system of the paper sick-note, put it in red because it's dangerous, it's not good advocacy for your patient".|$|E
2500|$|Richard was {{bolstered by}} winning the Eisteddfod Prize and wanted to repeat his success. He chose to sing Sir Arthur Sullivan's [...] "Orpheus with his Lute" [...] (1866), which biographer Alpert thought [...] "a {{difficult}} composition". He requested {{the help of his}} schoolmaster, Philip Burton, but his voice cracked during their practice sessions. This incident marked the beginning of his association with Philip. Philip later recalled, [...] "His voice was tough to begin with but with constant practice it became memorably beautiful." [...] Richard made his first foray into theatre with a minor role in his school's production of the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw's The Apple Cart. He decided to leave school by the end of 1941 and work as a miner as Elfed was not <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> due to illness. He worked for the local wartime Co-operative committee, handing out supplies in exchange for coupons. He also simultaneously considered other professions for his future, including boxing, religion and singing. It was also during this period that Richard took up smoking and drinking despite being underage.|$|E
