5|$|Black Rock, Antelope Island, White Rock, Egg Island, Fremont Island, and the Promontory {{mountain}} range are each <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> the Oquirrh Mountain Range, which dips beneath the lake at its southeastern shore. Stansbury, Carrington, and Hat Islands are <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> the Stansbury {{mountain range}}, and Strongs Knob {{is an extension}} of the Lakeside Mountains which run along the lake's western shore. The lake is deepest in the area between these island chains, measured by Howard Stansbury in 1850 at about 35 feet (10.7 meters) deep, and an average depth of 13 feet (four meters). When the water levels are low, Antelope Island becomes connected to the shore as a peninsula, as do Goose Islands, Browns Island, {{and some of the other}} islands. Stansbury Island and Strongs Knob remain peninsulas unless the water level rises well-above the average.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball {{involves}} guiding {{a transparent}} ball containing {{one of four}} monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms.

There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> the main single-player game.|$|E

The extension of service from Providence further into Rhode Island opened to T. F. Green Airport In December 2010 and to Wickford Junction in April 2012. The Fairmount Line is undergoing a major rehabilitation that includes the construction of four new stations in Boston; the first three of these opened in November 2012 and July 2013. Planning work on the South Coast Rail project to restore service to Fall River and New Bedford is continuing with bridge work already started, and proposed <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> commuter rail service to Nashua, New Hampshire via the Lowell Line and Plaistow, New Hampshire via the Haverhill Line are in the planning stages.|$|E

For example, an α-β, γ-δ unsaturated ketone can undergo a similar cationic conrotatory cyclization that is typically referred to as an iso-Nazarov cyclization reaction. Other such extensions have been given similar names, including homo-Nazarov cyclizations and vinylogous Nazarov cyclizations.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital. To keep the powers granted by the act alive, the CCE submitted a series of further bills to Parliament for <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> time. Extensions were granted by the Charing Cross Euston and Hampstead Railway Acts, 1897, 1898, 1900, and 1902.|$|E
5|$|Michaelis–Menten {{kinetics}} {{relies on}} the law of mass action, which is derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement.

5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; {{modifications}} include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches.

5|$|Some {{species of}} pterosaurs {{featured}} elaborate crests.
