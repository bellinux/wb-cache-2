25|$|In 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is {{providing}} healthcare services for approximately one million {{gay and lesbian}} veterans. With {{the repeal of the}} Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care. However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans do not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA. The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well-being.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 Pew Center {{survey on}} Religion and Public Life {{indicates}} that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members {{have stated that}} they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to defend their worthiness due to political differences. In recent decades, the Republican Party has consistently won {{a majority of the}} LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, Utah, a state with a majority LDS population, {{is also one of the}} most heavily Republican states in the country. However, Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2014, became an LDS Church convert as a college student. James E. Faust (1920–2007), an apostle and member of the First Presidency, also identified himself as a Democrat prior to his full-time church service as a general authority (1972–2007).|$|E
25|$|Self-efficacy is a person's {{belief that}} he or she can {{accomplish}} a particular activity. It is a related concept introduced by Albert Bandura, and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale. It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and self-esteem, using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of their own health, they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific treatment regimen that is essential to maintaining their own health. Self-efficacy {{plays an important role in}} one's health because when people <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.|$|E

25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{been the victim of}} unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they often feel that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E

Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] an [...] "effective and affecting gender-bender". Allmusic writer Andy Kellman felt that though the ballad sounds like [...] "the watery backdrop for a singing competition finale", {{it is the most}} outstanding song on I Am...

40|$|Money is an {{important}} factor that influences the development of romantic relationships. The current paper examines how the feeling of having relatively more or less money influences human mating strategies in long-term and short-term mating contexts under the framework of evolutionary psychology. We recruited mainland Chinese college students involved in steady, heterosexual romantic relationships to participate in two experiments. In each study, we experimentally triggered participants’ feelings of having relatively more or less money and then examined their thoughts and behaviors related to mating. Results of Study 1 showed that men who were primed to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> relatively more money were less satisfied with their partners’ physical attractiveness than those primed to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> less money, suggesting that the subjective feeling of having more or less money may affect men’s preferences regarding the physical appearance of a mate in a long-term relationship. Interestingly, this difference was not significant for women. Results of Study 2 indicated that both men and women who were primed to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> relatively more money exhibited a greater behavioral approach tendency toward an attractive member of the opposite sex than those primed to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> less money. This finding suggests <b>that</b> people who <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> relatively more money may have more interest in an attractive alternative than those who feel <b>they</b> <b>have</b> relatively less money. The differences in mating strategies between and within the genders brought about by money support the evolutionary hypothesis that individuals adopt conditional mating strategies in response to environmental conditions. These findings have both conceptual and practical implications for the psychology of evolution and romantic relationships...|$|R

2500|$|One {{antecedent}} to {{perceptions of}} organizational justice {{is the extent}} to which employees feel that they are involved in decision-making or other organizational procedures. [...] Higher levels of justice are perceived when employees <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> input in processes than when employees do not perceive that they have the opportunity to participate (Greenberg & Folger, 1983; Bies & Shapiro, 1988). [...] The opportunity or ability to participate in decision making improves an individual's perceptions of procedural justice, even when the decision is unfavorable to the individual (Bies & Shapiro, 1988). [...] In addition, other studies have shown that employee input is related to both procedural and interpersonal justice perceptions (Kernan & Hanges, 2002).|$|E
2500|$|While {{the church}} takes an apolitical {{approach}} to candidates, it encourages {{its members to}} {{play an active role}} as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections. It actively works to counter anti-Mormonism that may come up during political campaigns.

Some liberal members say they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to defend their worthiness due to political differences.
