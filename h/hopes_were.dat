5|$|Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro {{following}} the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy {{and his administration}} experimented with various ways of covertly facilitating {{the overthrow of the}} Cuban government.

40|$|Hope {{plays an}} {{important}} role in all individuals’ lives both today and in the future. While <b>hope</b> and hopelessness <b>are</b> important concepts and the subjects of much theorizing in psychology, theology, philosophy, political science, nursing, as well as in literature and the arts, it is absent from economics. This silence on <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> notable since <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally at the centre of choice, especially intertemporal choice, which is at the centre of economic analysis. To place hope at the centre of intertemporal choice, it is important to clearly define what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> and what it <b>is</b> not. What <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not <b>is</b> constant. <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> not optimism; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not unfounded dreams divorced from reality; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not irrational. I distil what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> from its characterization in a number of different disciplines. A comparison of characterizations identifies a number of commonalities and common definitions. Using the derived set of definitions, I incorporate hope into economic analysis, consider what implications hope has for the modelling of choice and for economic behaviour, and discuss whether <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> implicitly imbedded in or has been abandoned, to our eternal cost, by economics.

Wake Forest won the 2006 ACC Championship Game by a 96 score.|$|E
5|$|During {{the annual}} preseason poll of media members {{covering}} the Big East conference, Virginia Tech was picked to finish second among Big East teams, behind only Miami.

5|$|After the Hokies' {{participation}} in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game, the Virginia Tech entered the 2000-2001 college football season with high expectations. Until late in the season, those <b>hopes</b> <b>were</b> borne out, and it appeared as if the Hokies {{would return to the}} national championship game. After a late-season loss to No.3-ranked Miami, however, Tech was knocked out of contention for the national title. Following the conclusion of its 10–1 season, No. 6 Tech was selected to participate in the Gator Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the No. 16 Clemson Tigers, who had finished 9–2 during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 1916, Townshend {{launched}} several {{attacks in}} an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad, the Battle of the Wadi, the Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila Redoubt. These attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and the cost was heavy with both sides suffering high casualties. In February food, and <b>hopes</b> <b>were</b> running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease spread rapidly and could not be contained or cured and Townshend surrendered in April 1916.

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial <b>hopes</b> <b>were</b> that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.|$|E

His and Carleton's <b>hopes</b> <b>were</b> dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. A few of his boats were landed, but most were driven off by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City.

5|$|The union between Norway and Sweden, {{imposed by}} the Great Powers in 1814, had been under {{considerable}} strain through the 1890s, the chief issue in question being Norway's rights to its own consular service.

It seemed, early in the 20th century that agreement {{between the two countries}} might be possible, but <b>hopes</b> <b>were</b> dashed when negotiations broke down in February 1905. The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by Christian Michelsen, whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|While Bolton {{finished}} 4th {{the following}} season, the next 20 years {{would prove to}} be a fallow period.

This stay in the Third Division lasted just two years before the club were promoted as champions in 1972–73. <b>Hopes</b> <b>were</b> high at Burnden Park in May 1978 when Bolton sealed the Second Division title and gained promotion to the First Division. However, they only remained there for two seasons before being relegated.|$|E
5|$|After their {{invasion}} in Operation Weserübung, Hitler vowed {{that he would}} never again leave Norway, and favored annexing Denmark as a German province even more due to its small size and relative closeness to Germany.

He was also among the group of more esoteric National Socialists who believed either Iceland or Greenland to be the mystical land of Thule, a purported original homeland of the ancient Aryan race. From a military point of view, the Kriegsmarine command hoped to see the Spitsbergen, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Isles and possibly the Shetland Isles (which were also claimed by the Quisling regime) under its domination to guarantee German naval access to the mid-Atlantic.|$|E
