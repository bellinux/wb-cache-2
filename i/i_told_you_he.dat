60|$|COKESON. [In {{a whisper}} to James] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> wanted nourishment.|$|E
60|$|There, my dear, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't want to {{be bothered}} with us.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Why, Mr Moore," [...] he begins, sort of soothing; {{when the}} small brother, who's been staring at Jerry, chips in. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was cheeky.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Crewe; [...] "it doesn't cost {{anything to}} look at flowers, that's what they're for. Cost something to put 'em in. I got that little feller Ridley to lay 'em out--I believe <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He's</b> just beginning. Hello, Alice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More fool, Lawrence!" [...] {{retorted}} Miss Howard. [...] "Of course Alfred Inglethorp murdered poor Emily--as <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well, Fanny, what's {{the use of}} recollecting all our foolish first impressions. <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was {{the most}} able man in the parish.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't do {{less than}} Mr. Dosson. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> waived the {{question}} of money and he was splendid. We can't be more mercenary than he." ...|$|E
60|$|BARBARA. Oh {{there you}} are, Mr Shirley! [Between them] This is my father: <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was a Secularist, didn't I? Perhaps you'll {{be able to}} comfort one another.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> is a Mr. Adams of Boston, and {{a distant}} {{connection}} of the Sewells. I met him when I was visiting at Judge Sewell's in Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] cried Miss Howard. [...] "Haven't <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{the man is}} a villain? Haven't <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> would murder her in her bed? Haven't I {{always hated}} him like poison?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, as <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> never dies. It is he who causes {{others to}} die, {{as if you}} go to Pongo-land doubtless you will find out," [...] Babemba added grimly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I shall {{do nothing}} of the kind. If <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>he</b> said, then I should {{have to tell the}} next man all that you may say. Would that be fair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> {{was not at}} {{the place}} of meeting,' De Stancy replied. And taking from his pocket the bag of ready money he placed it intact upon the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right!" [...] said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening. [...] "Your woman's wit {{hits the}} mark. He is a child--an {{absolute}} child. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was a child, you know, when I first mentioned him." ...|$|E
6000|$|They vanish {{in tobacco}} smoke, Those visionary maids - I feel a sharp and sudden poke Between the shoulder-blades - [...] "Why, Brown, my boy! Your growing stout!" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> would find me out!) ...|$|E
60|$|Old Morton (stiffly). <b>I</b> {{have already}} <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> is an {{appointee}} of my son's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Lady Fawn. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> what <b>he</b> said to me. And then he {{went and}} wrote this. Is he not noble and good,--and so kind? You shall read it,--but you'll give it me back, Lady Fawn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was it proper or {{improper}} when Mr. Belton made {{an offer}} to you,--as I knew he would do, of course; as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> would? Was that so improper {{that it could not}} be told?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely; and {{his wife}} went home to her fathers; when affairs went awry, his temper sympathized with them; he used her ill; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> would be a tyrant to her some day; as to him--" ...|$|E
60|$|WISE. He was so; and yet, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> counted {{above all}} {{this kind of}} sinning to be a badge of his honour; he {{reckoned}} himself a man's fellow when {{he had learned to}} swear and curse boldly.|$|E
60|$|Wise. He was so; and yet, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> counted, above all, {{this kind}} of sinning, to be {31c} a Badge of his Honour: He {{reckoned}} himself a mans Fellow when he had learnt to Swear and Curse boldly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{that is no}} matter,' said she, quickly. 'I had {{rather see}} after Philip than anything. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how <b>he</b> was made my charge, you know. And Laura! Only will it not be too tiring for you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Pen, dearest Pen," [...] {{cried out}} Helen in {{an excess of}} joy. [...] "I <b>told,</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> Doctor, <b>he</b> was not--not what you thought:" [...] and the tender {{creature}} coming trembling forward flung herself on Pen's shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{chance is}} slight, {{but it must}} not be neglected. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> is staying at the Metropole. I should suggest that we call upon him there as soon as possible. Shall we say after a bath and breakfast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it used {{to belong}} to the Winthrops, you know," [...] replied the other. [...] "Now a new man's got it; a man from Montreal named Jenkins. Hoggs comes for the shooting; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was a lovely shot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When he is {{gathered}} to his fathers, a great light will be extinguished in Israel. You {{wanted to know}} something about the Tombs of the Kings; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was your man. How full he was! His mind, sir, is an egg.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you {{not know}} that, Matteo? Of {{course it was}} Francisco! As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> has got brains; and {{if it had not}} been for him, we should {{certainly}} never have been rescued. Giulia and I owe him everything--don't we, Giulia?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need the}} money, and I need it now," [...] he replied doggedly. [...] "It's not for myself, {{but for that}} friend <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about. <b>He's</b> in a peck of trouble, and he's got to get his lift now or not at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{then fell}} across the Irish porter <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> me {{whereabouts}} <b>I</b> could get lodgings, and advised me {{to apply to}} {{one of the men who}} let out a number of sedan chairs, to hire one out to me by the week.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} have me say? If <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> was dying for love, you would say, I was trying to cheat you; and now because I don't tell you so, <b>you</b> say that <b>he</b> is wanting in devotion. I must say you are hard to please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be my dog,--they color 'em {{as we used}} {{to paint}} over trick horses. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was a {{valuable}} chap, and those that stole him hide him that way, else he'd be no use, don't you see? because we'd know him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the description, sir? My {{father is}} much {{interested}} on that point, for, as I believe <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> {{has a strong}} suspicion that the fellow {{is the man who}} was transported more than eight years ago to Australia, and who made his escape from the prison there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hishmel, Hishmel?" [...] said Rachel. [...] "Oh! I know, {{he means}} Ishmael. There, mother, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was {{something}} biblical, {{and of course}} Ishmael dwelt in the wilderness, didn't he, after his father had behaved so badly to poor Hagar, and was a wild man whose hand was against every man's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{doubt about}} it. I {{believe he has}} always betrayed every one who has ever trusted him. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> what <b>he</b> was, some time since; did I not? But, Mark, why on earth have you let it {{go so far as}} this? Would not Forrest help you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have as good," [...] said he. [...] "There is the Italian knave Fortunio {{enrolled}} yesterday, as <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> knows neither her wealth nor her identity; nor {{if he did}} {{could he}} enter into traffic with her, for he knows no French, and she no Italian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>you</b> weren't, <b>he</b> beamed. Honestly, you've {{only got}} to lift your little finger and--Oh, good Lord, there's Algie!' ...|$|R
