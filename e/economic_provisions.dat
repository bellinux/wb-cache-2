40|$|Insider trading {{defendants}} are sentenced under the general <b>economic</b> crime <b>provisions</b> of the U. S. Sentencing Guidelines. These provisions provide a chart, which prescribes a gradually increasing offense level based on “the gain {{resulting from the}} offense. ” Only two circuit courts have yet to define “gain” for sentencing purposes, resulting in a split in methodology. Due to the tremendous weight the Guidelines place {{on the amount of}} “gain” when calculating a sentence, the potential result of using different methodologies to calculate “gain” is the difference between freedom and years of incarceration. This Note examines the problems involved with both of the methods of calculating “gain” for sentencing purposes applied by the circuits. This Note proposes a reexamination and restructuring of the Guidelines’ <b>economic</b> crime <b>provisions</b> in order to focus the determination of a defendant’s sentence away from an unstable monetary figure and toward other factors that truly reflect the culpability of the defendant.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{do-it-yourself}} (DIY) home improvement, this article extends theorizing on productive consumption, domestic masculinity, and social class. Based on interviews with informants varying in cultural capital endowments, the findings reveal that productive consumption shapes domestic masculinity in relation to class-mediated identity conflicts and ideals. Among high-cultural-capital (HCC) informants, DIY home improvement counters the burdens of knowledge work. The suburban home materializes as a leisurely venue for productive consumption where HCC informants fashion themselves as suburban-craftsmen involved in autotherapeutic labor. Low-cultural-capital (LCC) informants' involvement in DIY home improvement is animated by a different identity conflict and identity ideal. Due to limits on fulfilling normative expectations for <b>economic</b> <b>provisioning,</b> LCC informants liken home to a workplace. Through productive consumption at home, LCC informants enact an identity ideal of family-handyman, thus fashioning themselves as rightful, masculine family stewards...|$|R

Russia used these charters to co-opt Romanian boyars by protecting their privileges, including their tax-exempt status and oligarchic control of the government. However flawed, the charters gave Romanians their first taste of government by law. The Règlement provided for elected assemblies of boyars to choose each prince, reformed the principalities' judicial systems, and established public education. At the same time, the documents' <b>economic</b> <b>provisions</b> enabled the boyars to stiffen peasant obligations and reduced the peasants' freedom of mobility.
