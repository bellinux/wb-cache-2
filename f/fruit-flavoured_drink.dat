5000|$|Acidic {{drinks and}} foods lower the pH {{level of the}} mouth so {{consuming}} them causes the teeth to demineralise. Drinks low in pH levels that cause dental erosion include fruit juices, sports drinks, wine, beer and carbonated drinks [...] Orange and apple juices are common culprits among fruit juices. Carbonated drinks such as colas, lemonades are also very acidic, as are <b>fruit-flavoured</b> <b>drinks</b> and dilutables. Frequency rather than total intake of acidic juices {{is seen as the}} greater factor in dental erosion; infants using feeding bottles containing fruit juices (especially when used as a comforter) are therefore at greater risk of acid erosion.|$|R

50|$|Fruitopia is a <b>fruit-flavoured</b> <b>drink</b> {{introduced}} by The Coca-Cola Company in 1994 and targeted at teens and young adults. According to New York Times business reports, it was invented {{as part of}} a push by Coca-Cola to capitalize on the success of Snapple and other flavored tea drinks. The brand gained substantial hype in the mid-1990s before enduring lagging sales by decade's end. While still available in Canada and in Australia as a juice brand, in 2003, Fruitopia was phased out in most of the United States where it had struggled for several years. However, select flavors have since been revamped under Coca-Cola's successful Minute Maid brand. Use of the Fruitopia brand name continues through various beverages in numerous countries, including some McDonald's restaurant locations in the United States carrying the drink still to this day.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Agar {{contains}} a high amount of soluble fibre {{and has been}} shown to delay gastric emptying (GE) without impacting on glycaemic response (GR). The current study aimed to further the limited data on the effect of agar on metabolism by assessing the effects on GE and GR as well as appetite- and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). Methods: In this randomized control trial, eleven healthy volunteers were tested on two occasions following an overnight fast. Following baseline and resting measurements, volunteers were either fed a <b>fruit-flavoured</b> <b>drink</b> (liquid) or consumed a fruit-flavoured jelly (jelly). The two were exactly the same in composition except the jelly contained 4 g of agar crystals. Both contained 50 g of available carbohydrate. DIT was measured using indirect calorimetry, GE using the C sodium acetate breath test, appetite using visual analogue scale and GR using finger prick blood samples. Results: The jelly significantly delayed GE across all time points - latency phase (p = 0. 07), lag phase (p = 0. 04), half-time (p < 0. 0001), ascension time (p = 0. 025). The jelly also increased all appetite parameters - hunger (p = 0. 006), fullness (p = 0. 035), desire to eat (p = 0. 03) and prospective consumption (p = 0. 011). However, {{there were no significant differences}} in either GR or postprandial DIT between the liquid and jelly. Conclusion: Agar delays GE and increases appetite but does not change GR or DIT most probably due to the increase in viscosity caused by the agar jelly. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Polyphenols, {{a complex}} group of {{secondary}} plant metabolites, including flavonoids and phenolic acids, {{have been studied}} in depth for their health-related benefits. The activity of polyphenols may, however, be hampered when consumed together with protein-rich food products, due to the interaction between polyphenols and proteins. To that end we have tested the bioavailability of representatives {{of a range of}} polyphenol classes when consumed for five days in different beverage matrices. In a placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study, 35 healthy males received either six placebo gelatine capsules consumed with 200 mL of water, six capsules with 800 mg polyphenols derived from red wine and grape extracts, or the same dose of polyphenols incorporated into 200 mL of either pasteurized dairy drink, soy drink (both containing 3. 4 % proteins) or <b>fruit-flavoured</b> protein-free <b>drink.</b> At the end of the intervention urine and blood was collected and analysed for a broad range of phenolic compounds using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Liquid Chromatography–Multiple Reaction Monitoring–Mass Spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy techniques. The plasma and urine concentrations of the polyphenols identified increased with all formats, including the protein-rich beverages. Compared to capsule ingestion, consumption of polyphenol-rich beverages containing either dairy, soy or no proteins had minor to no effect on the bioavailability and excretion of phenolic compounds in plasma (118 % ± 9 %) and urine (98 % ± 2 %). We conclude that intake of polyphenols incorporated in protein-rich drinks does not {{have a major impact on}} the bioavailability of a range of different polyphenols and phenolic metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diseases {{affecting}} the oral cavity {{are the most}} prevalent chronic conditions in the world, and affect all ages, sexes, and nationalities. Diet is a strong predictor of oral health, and beverage consumption may affect oral health outcomes; however, there has been relatively little research on the association between the balance of beverages in the diet and oral health outcomes. Methods: The current study used data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) to determine {{the impact of the}} type and frequency of beverage consumption on oral health, as well as the interaction between beverages. The first round of data collection for the CHMS took place between March 1, 2007 and March 31, 2009, and involved 5604 Canadians between the ages of 6 and 79 from across Canada. The sample targeted individuals in privately occupied dwellings, and is representative of 97 % of the Canadian population. The CHMS consisted of two components: a household questionnaire to collect sociodemographic information, health history, and information on personal habits, and a clinical examination to collect anthropometric measures, blood and urine samples, and oral health measures. For our current analysis, age was restricted to age 12 - 30 inclusive, with 16 participants removed for missing responses giving a final sample size of 1534. The current analysis examined a number of different types of beverages, including water, milk, regular soft drinks, diet soft <b>drinks,</b> fruit juices, <b>fruit-flavoured</b> <b>drinks,</b> vegetable juices, sport drinks, and alcohol; and four oral health outcomes: dental decay, periodontal health, self-rated oral health (SROH), and a general oral health index (OHX). Descriptive tests and Poisson and Ordinal Regression were used to determine whether an association existed between the variables of interest, and if so, the magnitude of this association. Four models, each consisting of three sub-models, were fitted in order to address the hypotheses and research questions. Due to the complex sampling nature of the CHMS, survey weights were used as outlined by Statistics Canada, and clustering and bootstrapped analyses were carried out in order to account for the complex nature of the data. Results: 	A number of the beverage variables, as well as other covariates, were associated with oral health outcomes. Soft drink consumption was associated with all of the oral health outcomes in the main effects models with increased soft drink consumption having a detrimental effect on oral health. Fruit-flavoured beverage consumption was significant with a negative impact in the dental decay main effects model, and water consumption was significant for the SROH main effects model, having a positive effect on SROH as the frequency of water consumption increased. Milk was significant and beneficial in all index models, and the milk and sugary- or acidic-beverage interaction variables were significant in all index models except for the sugary index model for dental decay. A number of the covariates were also found to be significant: age was associated with all dental decay, periodontal health and OHX models with higher age being associated with poorer oral health, sex was significant in the dental decay models as well as the index models for SROH with females having better oral health, income and frequency of dental care were significant in all of the SROH models (higher income and more frequent visits to health care professionals being associated with better SROH), frequency of flossing was associated with all of the dental decay models in a detrimental way, and fibre consumption was significant in the dental decay models as well as the index models for periodontal health and OHX and had a positive impact on oral health. All other beverage variables and covariates were not significant in any model. Discussion: 	Consumption of some beverages, specifically regular soft <b>drinks,</b> <b>fruit-flavoured</b> beverages, water and milk, had a small but significant effect on oral health outcomes. It was also found that milk consumption is protective over sugary or acidic beverage interaction, but the interaction between water and sugary and acidic beverages {{does not seem to be}} significant. The small magnitude of association suggests oral health outcomes are highly multi-factorial in etiology and oral health status is the result of an accumulation of life exposures. Further investigations would benefit from the inclusion of information regarding access to fluoridated water, as well as longitudinal studies. Overall, the current findings contribute evidence on the importance of minimizing consumption of regular soft <b>drinks</b> and <b>fruit-flavoured</b> beverages, and replacing these drinks with those with more beneficial oral health effects such as milk and water...|$|R
50|$|According to Thomas and Davenport (1985), early {{reports of}} {{spoilage}} in mayonnaise and salad dressing due to Z. bailii {{date back to}} the beginning of the 20th century. More detailed investigations in the 1940s and 1950s confirmed that Z. bailii was the main spoiler in cucumber pickles, sundry pickled vegetable mixes, acidified sauces, etc. Around the same time, fermentation spoilage incidents occasionally appeared in fruit syrups and beverages preserved with moderate benzoic acid levels (0.04 - 0.05% (w/w)). Again, Z. bailii was identified as the spoilage source. Nowadays, despite great improvements in formulation control, food processing equipment and sanitation technologies (e.g. automated clean-in-place), the yeast remains highly problematic in sauces, acidified foods, pickled or brined vegetables, fruit concentrates and various non-carbonated fruit drinks. Z. bailii is also well recognized as one of the main spoilers in wines due to its high resistance to combinations of ethanol and organic acids at low pH. Furthermore, the spoilage by this yeast has been expanding into new food categories such as prepared mustards, <b>fruit-flavoured</b> carbonated soft <b>drinks</b> containing citrus, apple and grape juice concentrates. The ability of Z. bailii in spoiling a wide range of foods is a reflection of its high resistance to many stress factors. Therefore, it has been included in the list of most dangerous spoilage yeasts by several authors.|$|R
