5|$|Level-5 {{collaborated with}} Studio Ghibli {{to produce the}} game's {{animated}} sequences, and the game features graphics and visuals replicating the traditional animation style of Studio Ghibli films. The collaboration began when musician Naoya Fujimaki, who had previously worked with both companies, introduced Level-5 president Akihiro Hino to Studio Ghibli president Toshio Suzuki. At the time, Studio Ghibli had completed work on Ponyo (2008), and the animation team had no ongoing projects, which influenced Suzuki's decision to collaborate with Level-5. Another <b>influencing</b> <b>factor</b> of the collaboration was witnessing Hino's passion for the project. Studio Ghibli approached the production process {{in the same way}} that they would create an animated film. Work on the animation began in July 2008, and took much longer than the predicted three months.|$|E
25|$|In {{literature}} {{several factors}} are named for explaining why language competence is decreasing. Many researchers, however, regard {{the level of}} competence of the learner as essential for attrition. It is said that the higher the level of competence, the less attrition will occur. Thus, {{a reference to the}} theory of the critical threshold can be drawn. Similar to this theory it is claimed, that according to conducted studies, the higher the level of competence of the learner {{at the end of the}} incubation period, the fewer will be lost. Therefore duration, success and intensity of the language instruction or language input in general is vitally important. Weltens (1987) divides the factors influencing language attrition into three categories: characteristics of the acquisition process (method of instruction, length of exposure, proficiency before attrition, relationship between L1 and the FL), characteristics of the attrition period ('post exposure' and length of the attrition period), and learner characteristics. The second category are sociopsychological factors, as the attitude towards the target language and culture and aligned with the motivation for acquiring the language. Further, factors, which are settled in the language environment, should be considered as well, e.g. the status and prestige of the language are meaningful, too. Another frequent occurring factor is age. A variable that seems to be quite important, especially observing language attrition in children. Even though children are regarded as the better foreign language learner, their cognitive development is less progressed compared to adults. Further, usually they haven't learned to write or read in any language, and usually particularly not in the second language at all. Therefore their literacy skill in the L2 is very limited if not even there yet. Cohen (1989) conducted a study observing young children. He found out, that the attrition in an 8-year-old boy was stronger than the one in his 12-year-old sister. Tomiyama, suggested on the basis of her findings, that these children might not lose their knowledge of the L2 completely, moreover the access to such information is inaccessible and may vanish with time passing by. At the beginning of the 80s another, so far unnoticed factor, was introduced into the research field. Socioaffective factors as attitude, orientation and motivation are now accounted. On account of that, he established a socio-educational model of language acquisition. Thereby motivation and attitude influence the workload of the individual to keep their language competence. Further, individuals, who have positive attitudes towards the target language, seek possibilities and opportunities during the incubation period to retain their language competence (Gardner 1987: 521). However, the factor motivation is hardly considered examining language attrition. Especially during the last 10–15 years it became more and more acknowledged in the field of language acquisition rather than attrition. Only Gardner considered motivation as a possible factor influencing attrition. Even until today it is hardly recognised as an <b>influencing</b> <b>factor</b> and therefore exist only a few studies about motivation and its effects.|$|E

2500|$|The Canton Viaduct {{was erected}} in 1835 by the B, {{one of the}} first New England railroads, shortly after its 1831 founding. Thomas B. Wales, one of the {{original}} families of Boston, and owner of the T.B. Wales & Co. Shipping Company, was the first president of the B, The Taunton Branch Railroad, as well as the Western Railroad Corporation. [...] Due to his friendship with prominent New England families, including the Revere family, they were able to bring the Canton Viaduct to fruition. [...] The T.B. Wales & Co. clipper ships brought raw materials for manufacturing companies from its dock (Wales Wharf) and Counting House (Long Wharf) to various areas in New England. [...] Without the influence of individuals such as Thomas B. Wales, Joseph Warren Revere, owner of the Revere Copper Company and major stockholders (most of whom were Board members), the Canton Viaduct would not have been built. [...] There were better routes through other towns for the location of the railroad line from Boston to Providence. [...] However, building the railroad through Canton placed the line close to Paul Revere's Copper Rolling Mill, where a half mile spur (using strap rails and horse power) connected the mill to Canton Junction and undoubtedly gave a boost to Revere's copper business. The other <b>influencing</b> <b>factor</b> that caused the Canton Viaduct to be built was a fatal accident in 1832 on the Granite Railroad, which used inclined planes to cross a valley. The original plans called for the use of inclined planes to cross the Canton River Valley (...) , but they were changed after the inclined plane accident, and a viaduct was built instead. [...] This unique viaduct was designed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Officer and West Point graduate - Captain [...] [...] He was assisted by engineers, Major George Washington Whistler (McNeill's brother-in-law), Major General Isaac Ridgeway Trimble and General [...] The viaduct was built by the Dodd & Baldwin company from Pennsylvania. [...] Around this time, Russia was interested in building railroads. [...] Tsar Nicholas I sent workmen to draw extensive diagrams of the Canton Viaduct. [...] He later summoned Whistler to Russia as a consulting engineer to design the Moscow–Saint Petersburg Railway, on which two viaducts were modeled after the Canton Viaduct. [...] A [...] viaduct of similar design is on display at the Oktyabrsky Railroad Museum in St. Petersburg.|$|E

40|$|Shallow {{foundations}} in granular {{soils are}} designed {{such that the}} settlements are within tolerable limits. Schmertmann's (1970) method {{is one of the}} most rational methods for computing settlements of footings in granular soils, and is commonly used world-wide. The method relies on a strain <b>influence</b> <b>factor</b> that varies with depth. Schmertmann et al. (1978) proposed separate strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> for axi-symmetric and plane strain loading situations, representing circular and strip footings. The objective of this paper is to revisit Schmertmann's <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> using FLAC and FLAC 3 D, explicit finite difference codes used widely in geotechnical modelling, and the theory of elasticity. Linear elastic and non-linear elastic constitutive models were used in the analysis. The <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> derived are compared with those proposed by Schmertmann. For square and rectangular footings, the problem becomes three-dimensional and therefore FLAC 3 D was used in the analysis. The strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> are developed for footings with breadth/length ratios of 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 0. The strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors</b> for the rectangular footings are presented along with those for the circular and strip footings. The effect of Poisson's ratio was also investigated. While verifying the original strain <b>influence</b> <b>factors,</b> the new factors proposed for the rectangular footings will be valuable in the design of shallow foundations on granular soils. The use of non-linear elastic constitutive model is more realistic than the traditional linear elastic model, and the differences are discussed...|$|R
