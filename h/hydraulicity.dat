50|$|Hydration is the {{mechanism}} by which hydraulic binders such as Portland cement develop strength. A hydraulic binder is a material that can set and harden submerged in water by forming insoluble products in a hydration reaction. The term <b>hydraulicity</b> or hydraulic activity {{is indicative of the}} chemical affinity of the hydration reaction.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} composition of a slag varies considerably {{depending on the}} composition of the raw materials in the iron production process. Silicate and aluminate impurities from the ore and coke are combined in the blast furnace with a flux which lowers the viscosity of the slag. In the case of pig iron production the flux consists mostly of a mixture of limestone and forsterite or in some cases dolomite. In the blast furnace the slag floats on top of the iron and is decanted for separation. Slow cooling of slag melts results in an unreactive crystalline material consisting of an assemblage of Ca-Al-Mg silicates. To obtain a good slag reactivity or <b>hydraulicity,</b> the slag melt needs to be rapidly cooled or quenched below 800 °C in order to prevent the crystallization of merwinite and melilite. To cool and fragment the slag a granulation process can be applied in which molten slag is subjected to jet streams of water or air under pressure. Alternatively, in the pelletization process the liquid slag is partially cooled with water and subsequently projected into the air by a rotating drum. In order to obtain a suitable reactivity, the obtained fragments are ground to reach the same fineness as Portland cement.|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic lime is {{also called}} water lime. Hydraulic lime {{contains}} lime with silica and/or alumina and sets with {{exposure to water}} and can set under water. Natural hydraulic lime (NHL) is made from a limestone which naturally contains some clay. Artificial hydraulic lime is made by adding forms of silica and/or alumina such as clay to the limestone during firing, or by adding a pozzolana to pure lime. Hydraulic limes are classified by their strength: feebly, moderately and eminently hydraulic lime. Feebly hydraulic lime contains 5-10% clay, slakes in minutes, and sets in about three weeks. It is used for less expensive work and in mild climates. Moderately hydraulic lime contains 11-20% clay, slakes in one to two hours, and sets in approximately one week. It is used for better quality work and exterior walls in freezing climates. Eminently hydraulic lime contains 21-30% clay, slakes very slowly, and sets in approximately a day. It is used in harsh environments such as damp locations and near saltwater. Hydraulic lime is off-white in color. [...] "The degree of <b>hydraulicity</b> of mortars will affect many characteristics. By selecting an appropriate ratio of clay to limestone mortars that carbonate or set hydraulically to a varying extents can be designed for particular application requirements such as setting time, strength, colour, durability, frost resistance, workability, speed of set {{in the presence of}} water, vapour permeability etc." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{two basic}} types of {{hydraulic}} limes are {{natural hydraulic lime}} (NHL) and artificial hydraulic lime (AHL): [...] Natural hydraulic lime (NHL) is produced by heating (calcining) limestone that naturally contains clay and other impurities: no materials may be added to create the <b>hydraulicity.</b> In the United States NHL may be called hydrated hydraulic lime (HHL) per ASTM C-141 Standard Specification for Hydrated Hydraulic Lime for Structural Purposes. Artificial hydraulic lime (AHL) or artificial lime (AL) becomes hydraulic when hydraulic and/or pozzolan materials are added either before or after burning in a lime kiln. Artificial limes are more specifically identified as hydraulic lime (HL), as defined European Norm 459 (EN-459), [...] "Consists of lime and other materials such as Portland cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials."; formulated lime (FL) (EN-459) consists of [...] "...mainly of hydrated lime and or NHL with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material.

40|$|Masonry mortars for {{underwater}} {{works such}} as bridge piers, harbours and mill ponds are of hydraulic nature. This paper investigates the raw materials and production technology {{of a number of}} these mortars. It focuses on the assessment of <b>hydraulicity</b> and the phenomena of delayed sulfate formation and alkali silica reaction (ASR) leading to damage. <b>Hydraulicity</b> is probably the most important property of a binder. Not only it governs a mortar’s cohesiveness and intrinsic bond therefore ruling physical properties and durability, but it also determines site application and performance. Samples of mortars from several structures including Annesley Bridge, St John’s Bridge, Dun Laoghaire Harbour and Dundrum Millpond were analyzed with petrography and X-ray diffraction. All the mortars displayed evidence of eminent binder <b>hydraulicity</b> including unhydrated clinker relics of different composition and hydraulic minerals. The identification of specific hydraulic minerals was difficult under the microscope, however, both irresolvable C-S-H, portlandite and other unidentified hydraulic phases were recorded. Blast furnace slags undergoing hydraulic reaction were noted, suggesting the addition of artificial pozzolans; and reactive aggregate showing pozzolanic reaction was also found. In relation to mortar durability, secondary reactions involving microsilica aggregate (ASR) leading to fracturing by expansion were evidenced; and delayed ettringite formation was also common in the mortars studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAl-Andalus mortar is {{an ancient}} binding {{material}} (lime mortar) that was used for centuries in numerous historical buildings in Al-Andalus, Granada (Spain). The physico-chemical and microscopic properties of Al-Andalus mortars in Granada were studied {{as part of an}} investigation into the mineral raw materials present in the territory of Spain. Scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction analyses of eight main types of mortars were performed to show the presence of calcite, gypsum, quartz, and muscovite minerals with organic fibers.
