25|$|Arguably, either {{position}} is potentially unfair; {{if a person}} is made to sign a contract under duress, and the contract contains an arbitration clause highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that arbitration tribunal.

However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.|$|E

25|$|John becomes greatly angered, {{tearing the}} arrest warrant to shreds and {{threatening}} Herrick and Cheever with a musket until Elizabeth calms {{him down and}} surrenders herself. He calls Hale a coward and asks him why the accusers' every utterance goes unchallenged. Hale is conflicted, but suggests that perhaps this misfortune has befallen Salem because of a great, secret crime that must be brought to light. Taking this to heart, John orders Mary to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> with him and expose the other girls' lies, but she refuses. Aware of John's affair, she warns him that Abigail is willing to expose it if necessary. John is shocked but determines the truth must prevail, whatever the personal cost.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 Tafari was {{diagnosed}} with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical treatment under the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners would have to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.|$|E
25|$|The legislature's vote to {{fold the}} TBTA into {{the newly created}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) could {{technically}} {{have led to a}} lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders, since the bond contracts were written into state law it was unconstitutional to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the right of approval over such actions. However, the largest holder of TBTA bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the Chase Manhattan Bank, headed then by David Rockefeller, the governor's brother. No suit was filed. Moses could have directed TBTA to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> against the action, but having been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out—the promised role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out of power.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{concerns}} expressed {{to his office}} in November 2007 that there were actions underway to overwrite email tapes and the Governor's Office was not complying with the Sunshine Law, AG Jay Nixon appointed special investigators on November 15 to study what was taking place. Nixon's team had to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>court</b> {{in the spring of}} 2008 to get a ruling on whether the governor's office was required to comply with their requests for information, {{at the expense of the}} state. Through various legal maneuverings, the court ruled in favor of the investigation, appointing two Special Attorneys General to lead it. The governor never was deposed. Eventually the completion of the investigation was extended to February 2009 because of the volume of materials that needed to be reviewed. The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Associated Press filed petitions in August 2008 as intervening plaintiffs to gain preliminary and injunctive relief, declaratory judgment that the emails were public records under the state Sunshine Law, and access to the emails under discussion.|$|E
