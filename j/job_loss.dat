50|$|According to the Economic Policy Institute's study, 61% {{of the net}} <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> due {{to trade}} with Mexico under NAFTA, or 415,000 jobs, were {{relatively}} high paying manufacturing jobs. Certain states with heavy emphasis on manufacturing industries like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and California were significantly affected by these <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b> For example, in Ohio, Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA-TAA identified 14,653 jobs directly lost due to NAFTA-related reasons like relocation of U.S. firms to Mexico. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Keystone Research Center attributed 150,000 <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> {{in the state to}} the rising U.S. trade deficit. Since 1993, 38,325 of those <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> are directly related to trade with Mexico and Canada. Although many of these workers laid off due to NAFTA were reallocated to other sectors, the majority of workers were relocated to the service industry, where average wages are 4/5 to that of the manufacturing sector.|$|R

30|$|Theoretically, whether {{changes in}} minimum wages {{lead to higher}} {{employment}} or <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> depends on where existing wages are set relative to workers’ marginal product of labor (MPL). If existing wages are set much below the MPL, {{as in the case}} of a monopsonistic firm, a moderate increase in minimum wages can benefit workers without leading to <b>job</b> <b>losses,</b> because the firm still profits from hiring workers, even at a higher wage rate (Rebitzer and Taylor, 1995). On the other hand, in the case of a competitive labor market where equilibrium wages equal the MPL, a minimum wage increase will lead to <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|R

This trade destruction provides some evidence that the massive 1989 - 93 Canadian <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> were not primarily caused by the FTA. Th authors further show that FTA tariff cuts account for no more than 15 percent of the Canadian <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b> Restated, other factors (including the fight against inflation) explain more than 85 percent of the <b>job</b> <b>losses.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Since 2000, {{there has}} been a clear {{division}} in the economic growth of North Carolina's urban and rural areas. While North Carolina's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth, low unemployment, and rising wages, many of the state's rural counties have suffered from <b>job</b> <b>loss,</b> rising levels of poverty, and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas. However, the population of the state's urban areas is steadily increasing.|$|E

25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been <b>job</b> <b>loss.</b> Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. {{produces}} approximately 18% of the world's manufacturing output, a {{share that}} has declined as other nations developed competitive manufacturing industries.

In addition, growth in telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, heavy machinery and other industries along with declines in low end, low skill industries such as clothing, toys, and other simple manufacturing have resulted in some U.S. jobs being more highly skilled and better paying. There has been much debate within the United States on whether the decline in manufacturing jobs are related to American unions, lower foreign wages, or both.|$|E

The quantitative impact on <b>job</b> <b>losses</b> remains modest in the case of cost-saving motives. The simple divide between low and high wage locations hides substantial heterogeneity within both groups.
