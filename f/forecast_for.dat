It was again updated on July 1 to include 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, to accommodate for tropical storms Colin and Danielle. On July 5, TSR released their fourth <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the season, slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. On August 5, TSR released their final <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the season, lowering {{the numbers to}} 15 named storms and 7 hurricanes due to the influence that La Niña being less than anticipated previously.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an area of low pressure. A large circulation quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late on August 19 while located 345mi (555km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status on August 22.|$|E
5|$|CSU {{issued a}} more {{detailed}} update on April7, upping their forecast to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 150. More confidence in the weakening of El Niño (and thus lower vertical wind shear) and the continuation of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean were cited. Two days later, TSR revised their forecast upward to 16.3 named storms, 8.5 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 159 units. In their April21 update, WSI predicted the most active year since the record-breaking 2005 season, with 16 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes. Five days later, North Carolina State University (NCSU) released their only <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the season, with 15 to 18 named storms and 8 to 11 hurricanes. TSR largely maintained their <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> their May25 release. The next day, TWC/WSI again raised their forecast to 18 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), meanwhile, released their forecast prediction for the 2010 season on May27. The organization called for an active to extremely active year including 14 to 23 named storms, 8 to 14 hurricanes, and 3 to 7 major hurricanes, referencing {{a continuation of the}} active era that began in 1995.|$|E
40|$|Since 1993 the Centre of Policy Studies {{has been}} using the MONASH model to produce year-by-year <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> the Australian economy, {{typically}} with forecast horizons of about ten years. MONASH is a large dynamic applied general equilibrium model. The MONASH forecasting system takes as inputs macro-economic forecasts from Syntec Economic Services, <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> the agricultural and mining sectors from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> international tourism from the Bureau of Tourism Research, and scenarios on technical change from extrapolations of recent historical experience. The MONASH model then produces consistent <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> 112 industries, 56 regions and 282 occupations. The occupational forecasts give projections of the demand for the ASCO unit groups {{in each of the}} six Australian States. These forecasts provide a background for assessing the skills likely to be required in the Australian workforce in the next decade.

5|$|In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson {{published}} {{the first attempt}} at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a hydrostatic variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations, Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> {{the state of the}} atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude.

5|$|On December7, 2011, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), {{a public}} {{consortium}} consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at University College London, issued an extended-range forecast predicting an above-average hurricane season. In its report, TSR noted that tropical cyclone activity could be about 49% above the 1950–2010 average, with 14.1 (±4.2) tropical storms, 6.7 (±3.0) hurricanes, and 3.3 (±1.6) major hurricanes anticipated, and a cumulative ACE index of 117 (±58). Later that month on December21, Weather Services International (WSI) issued an extended-range forecast predicting a near average hurricane season. In its forecast, WSI {{noted that a}} cooler North Atlantic Oscillation not seen in a decade, combined with weakening La Niña, {{would result in a}} near-average season with 12named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. They also predicted a near-average probability of a hurricane landfall, with a slightly elevated chance on the Gulf Coast of the United States and a slightly reduced chance along the East Coast of the United States. On April 4, 2012, Colorado State University (CSU) issued their updated <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the season, calling for a below-normal season due to an increased chance for the development of an El Niño during the season. In April 2012, TSR issued their update <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the season, slightly revising down their predictions as well.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, 2003, NOAA {{published}} a <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the East Pacific hurricane season, {{the first time}} it had done so. The scientists predicted a 50% chance of below normal activity this season, due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop. La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific, which is the opposite of its effect in the Atlantic.|$|E
30|$|The {{process of}} subjectively {{compiling}} seasonal <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> South Africa continued unabated for about 10  years, despite {{the evidence that}} objective forecast combination schemes can hold great benefit (Klopper and Landman 2003). However, when verification on 7  years of consensus forecasts was completed (Moatshe 2008), {{it was discovered that}} <b>forecast</b> skill <b>for</b> austral mid-summer rainfall of the consensus forecasts was lower than the skill associated with the consensus rainfall <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> spring and for autumn. This result is in contrast to verification results obtained from raw model output that shows that austral mid-summer predictability is the highest. Although the consensus <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> spring and autumn did not experience the same skill deterioration as the consensus <b>forecasts</b> <b>for</b> mid-summer, it was decided to follow the international trend to develop objective multi-model systems. A modelling effort to investigate the advantages of objectively combining seasonal probabilistic forecasts was subsequently completed in 2008 (Landman et al. 2009 b).|$|R

5|$|On June1, Klotzbach's team issued their updated <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the 2012season, {{predicting}} thirteen named {{storms and}} five hurricanes, of which {{two of those}} five would further intensify into major hurricanes. The university stated {{that there was a}} high amount of uncertainty concerning whether or not an El Niño would develop in time to hinder tropical development in the Atlantic basin. They also stated there was a lower than average chance of a major hurricane impacting the United States coastline in 2012. On June6, Tropical Storm Risk released their second updated <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the season, predicting fourteen named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. In addition, the agency called for an Accumulated Cyclone Energy index of 100. Near-average sea surface temperatures and slightly elevated trade winds for cited for lower activity compared to the 2010 and 2011hurricane seasons. Tropical Storm Risk continued with their forecast of a near-average probability of a United States impact during the season using the 1950–2011 long-term normal, but a slightly below-average chance of a United States landfall by the recent 2002–2011 normal.|$|E
5|$|On March5, 2003, meteorologists {{from the}} University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium issued an {{extended}} range <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the typhoon season, noting {{the likelihood of}} near average tropical cyclone activity {{as a result of}} projected neutral sea surface temperatures. The forecast indicated the potential for 26.2tropical storms, compared to the 10– and 30-year average of 27.8 and 26.3storms, respectively. The following month, the group raised their <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast. A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near-average season in their final August forecast update, which predicted 27tropical storms. The group was very accurate in their forecasts, with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> the 2005 {{season was}} {{produced}} by the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) in the second month of the year. In their report, the organization cited a list of analog years – 1952, 1957, 1985, 1991, and 1993 – with similar oceanic and atmospheric patterns. An overall total of 17 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes was forecast, above the average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), meanwhile, released their seasonal outlook on May16, predicting 11 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes. The organization noted that when the Atlantic basin was busier than average, as expected in 2005, the eastern Pacific generally saw lesser activity. That same day, NOAA issued a <b>forecast</b> <b>for</b> activity across the central Pacific, expecting 2 to 3 tropical cyclones to occur across the basin. A normal season averaged 4 to 5 tropical cyclones, including 1 hurricane. A near-normal El Niño–Southern Oscillation existed across the equatorial Pacific throughout 2005, which indicated conditions generally less conducive for activity there.|$|E
