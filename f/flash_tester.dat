40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{characterisation}} of 85 rear-line-contacted silicon concentrator {{solar cells}} on one single wafer requires a fast, automated measurement system. In this paper an {{easy to use}} needle array measurement system is presented, which allows an automated sequential measurement of dark and light IV curves of all cells on one wafer. For acquiring IV curves under high illumination levels (up to 500 suns), a <b>flash</b> <b>tester</b> is presented, which permits measurements of cell parameters of high lifetime silicon concentrator solar cells without suffering from transient errors. This is achieved through a nearly constant voltage at the cell during one flash. The IV curves acquired with this new <b>flash</b> <b>tester</b> are in very good agreement with the ones acquired with a standard steady-state measurement setup...|$|E
50|$|The {{products}} {{at that time}} were mainly precision-engineered laboratory equipment, {{but some of the}} first electromechanical automatic <b>flash</b> point <b>testers</b> were also developed and manufactured.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1873 by Berthold Pensky, who also invented the Pensky-Martens <b>flash</b> point <b>tester.</b> The company is located south of Berlin in Dahlewitz.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>testers</b> are {{commonly}} used for measuring solar cells and modules but in their usual implementation are complex, expensive, and susceptible to transient errors. This work presents a new tester design that is simple, low cost, and reduces transient errors by use of a constant-voltage cell-bias circuit. A novel feature {{of the system is}} that it extracts a family of I 2 V curves over a decade range of light intensity, which provides comprehensive information on cell performance. The new design has been tested and used extensively...|$|R
50|$|After {{working at}} the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin-Dahlem (now the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing für Materialforschung und -prüfung), Berthold Pensky started his own {{business}} manufacturing <b>flash</b> point <b>testers,</b> viscometers, grain testers and partial machinery.|$|R

The founder of the company, Walter Herzog, has moved to Lauda after World War II, and pioneered a few important innovations in the testing of oil and fuels, like first automatic <b>flash</b> point <b>tester,</b> first automatic distillation apparatus, and others.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, the {{removable}} head for <b>flash</b> point <b>testers</b> was patented, thus giving the user {{the option to}} perform flash point tests with an automatic sample changer. This allows the user to accelerate the individual tests since the manual insertion, the required cooling and the manual removal of the sample container are no longer necessary.|$|R
30|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{analyses of}} the neem oil biodiesel were carried out using the Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods [25]. The analyses carried out include pour point determination (ASTM method), cloud point determination (ASTM), flash point determination (ASTM D 93) using Pensky-Martens <b>flash</b> point <b>tester,</b> refractive index determination (using ATAGO Refractometer, RX- 5000 CX, Tokyo, Japan), specific gravity using specific gravity bottle according to AOAC method [25]), moisture content [25], viscosity (using Rion viscometer VTO 4 F, Netherlands), acid value [25], iodine value by Wijs method [25], peroxide value [25], saponification value [25], higher heating value (HHV) determination calculated model developed by Demirbas and Kara [26], cetane number (CN) determination using correlation reported by Patel [27] and Krisnangkura [28].|$|R
