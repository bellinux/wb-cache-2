5|$|Stage 1 (30 {{minutes to}} 12 hours) {{consists}} of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms and looks similar to alcohol poisoning. Poisoned individuals {{may appear to}} be intoxicated, dizzy, lacking coordination of muscle movements, <b>drooling,</b> depressed, and have slurred speech, seizuring, abnormal eye movements, headaches, and confusion. Irritation to the stomach may cause nausea and vomiting. Also seen are excessive thirst and urination. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, <b>drooling,</b> and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E

40|$|Die <b>drool</b> {{phenomenon}} {{is defined as}} unwanted spontaneous accumulation of extruded plastics on die exit face(s) of extrusion die during plastics extrusion process. Such accumulated material builds up on die exit face(s) and frequently or continually sticks onto the extruded product and by this way reduces {{the quality of the}} product. When the die <b>drool</b> appears, the extrusion process must be shut down and the die exit face(s) must be manually cleaned, which is time consuming as well as money consuming. Die <b>drool</b> has been observed from the beginning of plastics extrusion and the first published remark about it was made in 1946. For a long time it was considered as only an engineering problem and even if a wide range of suppressing ideas based on modification of extrusion dies, plastics materials, and processing conditions have already been patented, its source remained unclear. During the last few years, a number of experimental as well as theoretical research papers focusing on its fundamental nature have been published. Nowadays, die <b>drool</b> is considered as a fundamental rheological phenomenon. The force which drives the building up of extruded plastics on die exit face(s) is negative pressure (suction) occurring in the die exit edge(s) region where the free surface of the extruded plastics is created. Moreover, two different die <b>drool</b> types (external and internal) exist. The formation mechanisms of external/internal die <b>drool</b> are based on negative pressure occurring in the die exit region together with deformation of free extrudate surface/material separation wherever inside the extrusion equipment, respectively. From the processing point of view, the internal die <b>drool</b> is much more problematic than the external one, primarily due to a higher build up rate and compact shapes of the accumulated <b>drool</b> mass. Two theories of internal die <b>drool</b> formation mechanism based on wall slip theories (flow-induced molecular weight fractionation and stress-induced cohesive chain disentanglement) have been recently proposed and tested. In this historically ordered review, breakthrough works in the field of die <b>drool</b> research are presented, many ways to suppress it are shown, techniques for its quantitative evaluation and experimental methods for its analytical investigation are introduced, external and internal die <b>drool</b> types are explained, and theories of external as well as internal die <b>drool</b> formation mechanism are presented and discussed in depth, which can be especially helpful for plastics extrusion experts {{as well as for the}} rheological community. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a <b>drooling</b> monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said <b>drooling</b> monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|E

[...] Severe trismus may occur in when the muscles of mastication are involved in an odontogenic infection, making any surgical treatment impossible. Immunocompromised individuals are less able to fight off infections, and antibiotics are usually given. Evidence of systemic involvement (such as a fever higher than 38.5°C, cervical lymphadenopathy, or malaise) also indicates antibiotic therapy, as do rapidly spreading infections, cellulitis, or severe pericoronitis. <b>Drooling</b> and difficulty swallowing are signs that the airway may be threatened, and may precede difficulty in breathing.

Every Treehouse of Horror episode since this one must have Kang and Kodos as characters, states an unofficial Simpsons rule.

In the script, Kang and Kodos were shown as [...] "an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo". The finished design {{was based on the}} cover of an EC Comics issue.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{outlines}} <b>DROOL,</b> a novel {{knowledge representation}} scheme for supporting {{early stages of}} the design of multi-technology systems. The key idea behind <b>DROOL</b> is that mechatronic systems should be considered as interlocking flows of matter, energy and information. This provides a powerful framework for thinking about important aspects of conceptual design, and an equally powerful structure for organising a design representation scheme. The paper presents an object model for <b>DROOL,</b> and shows how the scheme describes design concepts at various levels of abstraction, in terms of component hierarchies and interlocking flows. The development of <b>DROOL</b> is part of the FACADE Project, whose aim is to develop intelligent computer tools to facilitate communication among designers with different specialties in concurrent engineering projects. The FACADE System comprises a suite of interfaces with different visual representations to support different conceptual design activities, with a single underlying product representation: <b>DROOL.</b> Development is concentrating on two interfaces with alternative visual representations in which designers can describe the flows of matter, energy and information in mechatronic systems: blob diagrams and concept arrays.
