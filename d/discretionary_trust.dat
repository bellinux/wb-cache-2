25|$|A <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> in Canadian and English trusts {{law is a}} trust {{where the}} {{beneficiaries}} and/or their entitlements to the trust fund are not fixed, but {{are determined by the}} criteria set out in the trust instrument by the settlor. It is sometimes referred to as a family trust in Australia or New Zealand. Where the <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> is a testamentary trust, it is common for the settlor to leave a letter of wishes for the trustees to guide them as to the settlor's wishes in the exercise of their discretion. Letters of wishes are not legally binding documents.|$|E
25|$|Because under a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust,</b> no one {{beneficiary}} {{could be}} said to have title to any trust assets prior to a distribution, this made discretionary trusts a powerful weapon for tax planners. Inevitably, the surge in popularity has led to a legislative response in most jurisdictions, thus in many countries there are now considerable tax disadvantages to discretionary trusts, which has predictably hampered their use outside the scope of charitable trusts.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of living trusts in South Africa, namely vested <b>trusts</b> and <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts.</b> In vested trusts, the {{benefits}} of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed, whereas in <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit.|$|R
25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust.</b> For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rights of}} {{individual}} beneficiaries under a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> being uncertain, {{it was open}} to question {{to what extent the}} beneficiaries of a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> (if all of adult age and sound mind) could utilise the rule in Saunders v Vautier. It had been held that beneficiaries under a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> could do so, although that authority was decided pre-McPhail v Doulton, where to be valid the trustees {{had to be able to}} draw up a [...] "complete list" [...] of beneficiaries. That notwithstanding, leading commentators have suggested that provided all of the beneficiaries could be ascertained, they should still retain the right to terminate the trust under the rule, so long as it is an exhaustive <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust.</b>|$|E

50|$|The House of Lords {{held for}} powers of appointment, objects were {{sufficiently}} certain if any given individual {{could be said}} to be in, or not in, the class. (So this was more relaxed than list certainty, which requires everyone to be said to be in the class.) Lord Upjohn reaffirmed the list certainty test for <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts,</b> but then in McPhail v Doulton, the list certainty test was abandoned for <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|Re Gulbenkian’s Settlements Trusts 1968 UKHL 5 is an English trusts law case, {{concerning}} {{the certainty of}} trusts. It held that while the 'is or is not' test was suitable for mere powers, the complete list test remained the appropriate test for <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts.</b> It was only a year later in McPhail v Doulton that the 'is or is not' test was considered appropriate for <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> by a different panel of their lordships.|$|R

2500|$|Discretionary trust: In a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust,</b> {{certainty}} of object is satisfied {{if it can}} be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary (i.e., whether there is a 'class' of beneficiaries, which a person can be said to belong to). In that way, persons who satisfy that criterion (who are members of that class) can enforce the trust. Re Baden’s Deed Trusts; McPhail v Doulton ...|$|E
2500|$|Asset protection: Trusts {{may allow}} {{beneficiaries}} to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote. For example, a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust,</b> {{of which the}} settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary, but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary. In such an arrangement the settlor {{may be in a}} position to benefit from the trust assets, without owning them, and therefore in theory protected from creditors. In addition, the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name (e.g., [...] "The Teddy Bear Trust"). These strategies are ethically and legally controversial.|$|E
2500|$|In Re Locker's Settlement [...] 1 WLR 1323 the {{trustees}} of a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> {{did not make}} any distributions {{for a number of}} years based upon the expressed wishes of the settlor. The trust then fell dormant, and after several more years, {{the trustees}} sought directions. The court held that their discretionary powers continued, and that they should exercise it in respect of the dormant years now as they should have done at the time. The court reaffirmed that if trustees refuse to distribute income, or refuse to exercise their discretion, although the court could not compel it be exercised in a particular manner, it could order that the trustees be replaced.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} with {{a duty to}} consider exercising discretion in non-exhaustive <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> is more complicated, as the duty to exercise discretion can be satisfied by deciding to accumulate.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> {{and powers}} in English law are {{elements}} of the English law of trusts, specifically of express trusts. Express trusts are trusts expressly declared by the settlor; normally this is intended, although there are situations where the settlor's intentions create a trust accidentally. Normal express trusts are described as [...] "fixed" [...] trusts; the trustees are obliged to distribute property, with no discretion, to the fixed number of beneficiaries. <b>Discretionary</b> <b>trusts,</b> however, are where the trustee has discretion over his actions, although he is obliged to act. The advantages of <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> are that they provide flexibility, and that the beneficiaries hold no claim to the property; as such, they cannot seek to control it, and it cannot be claimed for their debts. A power, or [...] "mere power", on the other hand, is where {{not only does the}} holder have discretion over his actions, he has discretion over whether to act in the first place.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> still serve {{a useful}} function, despite their {{original}} source of popularity (tax savings) having diminished in most countries. They still {{continue to be}} used for these reasons, among others: ...|$|R
2500|$|In a fixed {{trust the}} {{beneficiary}} has a specific proprietary right {{in relation to}} the trust fund. [...] Each beneficiary of a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust,</b> in contrast, is dependent upon the trustees to exercise their power of selection favourably. In Gartside v IRC [...] AC 553 the Inland Revenue argued that as each beneficiary might be entitled to income from the trust fund, each should be charged as if he were entitled to the whole of the fund. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the House of Lords rejected this argument. Even where there is a sole member of the class remaining, so long as {{there is a possibility that}} another member of the class could come into existence, that member is not considered a sole beneficiary for purposes of taxation liability.|$|E
2500|$|Where a fixed trust {{gives the}} trustee no {{discretion}}, and a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> gives the trustee discretion and requires him to exercise it, powers go a step further. A [...] "mere power", while not a trust obligation, grants the holder {{of the power}} the ability to exercise it, but without any requirement to do so. These powers are normally given to trustees; Hudson gives {{the example of a}} situation where the trust instrument states that [...] "the trustee may advance £1,000 to X". The trustee has the power to advance £1,000, but as evidenced by the word [...] "may", is not required to. However, the trustee is bound to consider exercising his powers, and must be able to justify his use. In Re Hay's ST, Megarry VC said that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Normal express trusts are [...] "fixed" [...] trusts; the {{property}} is held for a fixed number of beneficiaries, and the trustee is obliged to distribute property without any discretion over who gets what. In a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust,</b> however, the trustee has discretion over his actions, although he is obliged to use it. Alastair Hudson gives {{the example of a}} trust [...] "that [...] shall divide the £1,000 between any of my sons who become unemployed, with the power to retain the whole of that £1,000 for the remainder beneficiary". This is a discretionary trust; the word [...] "shall" [...] means the trustee is forced to exercise his power, while the [...] "power to retain the whole of that £1,000" [...] gives him discretion over whether to retain the money. Discretionary trusts are regularly used, because they provide flexibility; in this situation, for example, the money could be retained and redistributed in a different form if one beneficiary develops some urgent need for it. They also help protect the trust fund. In fixed trusts, the potential beneficiaries have the equitable ownership of their property; in discretionary trusts, this is not the case. Because of this, {{the property}} cannot be made liable for their debts or controlled by them.|$|E
5000|$|The EU {{withholding}} tax is levied only on individuals {{and not on}} companies, <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts,</b> foundations, stiftungs, anstalts, investment funds, etc., except in very special circumstances, e.g. a [...] "bare trust".|$|R
25|$|Characteristically, <b>{{discretionary}}</b> <b>trusts</b> {{provide for}} a discretionary distribution of income only, {{but in some cases}} the trustees also have a power of appointment with respect to the capital in the trust, i.e. the corpus.|$|R
2500|$|Gartside v IRC {{concerned}} a non-exhaustive discretionary trust; however, in Re Weir's Settlement [...] 1 Ch 657 and Sainsbury v IRC [...] Ch 712, the courts {{held that the}} same analysis was equally applicable to exhaustive <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{creation}} of a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> {{is different from the}} {{creation of}} any other type of express trust, due to the requirement of certainty of objects. This doctrine is that, for an express trust to be valid, the trust document must say with certainty who the beneficiaries there are. This is a problem with discretionary trusts, which can contain a class of beneficiaries rather than a list of named ones. The leading test of certainty of objects here is the [...] "any given postulant test", laid down in Re Gulbenkian. This states that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, when a potential beneficiary comes before them, that he either is or is not a beneficiary. The test was applied to discretionary trusts in McPhail v Doulton. The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden (No. 2); however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate new tests and reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid. Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a [...] "core number" [...] of beneficiaries who were certain.|$|E
2500|$|The final [...] "certainty" [...] {{the courts}} require {{is to know}} to some {{reasonable}} degree who the beneficiaries are to be. Again, the courts have become increasingly flexible, and intend to uphold the trust if at all possible. In Re Gulbenkian's Settlements (1970) a wealthy Ottoman oil businessman and co-founder of the Iraq Petroleum Company, Calouste Gulbenkian, had left a will giving his trustees [...] "absolute discretion" [...] to pay money to his son Nubar Gulbenkian, and family, but then also anyone with whom Nubar had [...] "from time to time [...] employed or residing". This provision of the will was challenged (by the other potential beneficiaries, who wanted more themselves) as being too uncertain in regard to who the beneficiaries were meant to be. The House of Lords held that the will was still entirely valid, because even though one {{might not be able}} to draw up a definite list of everybody, the trustees and a court could be sufficiently certain, with evidence of anyone who [...] "did or did not" [...] employ or house Nubar. Similarly, this [...] "is or is not test" [...] was applied in McPhail v Doulton. Mr Betram Baden created a trust for the employees, relatives and dependants of his company, but also giving the trustees [...] "absolute discretion" [...] to determine who this was. The settlement was challenged (by the local council that would receive the remainder) on the ground that the idea of [...] "relatives" [...] and [...] "dependants" [...] was too uncertain. The House of Lords held the trust was clearly valid because a court could exercise the relevant power, and would do so [...] "to give effect to the settlor's or testator's intentions." [...] Unfortunately, when the case was remitted to the lower courts to determine what in fact the settlor's intentions were, in Re Baden's Deed Trusts, the judges in the Court of Appeal could not agree. All agreed the trust was sufficiently certain, but Sachs LJ thought it was only necessary to show that there was a [...] "conceptually certain" [...] class of beneficiaries, however small, and Megaw LJ thought a class of beneficiaries had to have [...] "at least a substantial number of objects", while Stamp LJ believed that the court should restrict the definition of [...] "relative" [...] or [...] "dependant" [...] to something clear, such as [...] "next of kin". The Court of Appeal in Re Tuck's Settlement Trusts was more clear. An art publisher who had Jewish background, Baronet Adolph Tuck, wished to create a trust for people who were [...] "of Jewish blood". Because of mixing of faiths and ancestors over generations, this could have meant a very large number of people, but in the view of Lord Denning MR the trustees could simply decide. Also the will had stated that the Chief Rabbi of London could resolve any doubts, and so it was valid for a second reason. Lord Russell agreed, although on this point Eveleigh LJ dissented, and stated that the trust was only valid with Rabbi clause. Divergent views in some cases continued. In Re Barlow's Will Trusts, Browne-Wilkinson J held that concepts (like [...] "friend") could always be restricted, as a last resort, to prevent a trust failing. By contrast in one highly political case, a High Court judge found that the West Yorkshire County Council's plan to make a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> to distribute £400,000 [...] "for the benefit of any or all of the inhabitants" [...] of West Yorkshire, with the aim to inform people about the effects of the council's impending abolition by Margaret Thatcher's government, failed because it was (apparently) [...] "unworkable". It remained unclear whether some courts' attachment to strict certainty requirements was consistent with the principles of equitable flexibility.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rights of}} {{individual}} beneficiaries under a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> being uncertain, {{it was open}} to question {{to what extent the}} beneficiaries of a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> (if all of adult age and sound mind) could utilise the rule in Saunders v Vautier. It had been held that beneficiaries under a <b>discretionary</b> <b>trust</b> could do so, although that authority was decided pre-McPhail v Doulton, where to be valid the trustees {{had to be able to}} draw up a [...] "complete list" [...] of beneficiaries.

25|$|A {{disposition}} is taxable in Ireland {{if it is}} {{of property}} in Ireland, or if either the disponer or the beneficiary was resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland at {{the date of the}} disposition. Special rules apply for <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> rose sharply after {{the decision of}} the House of Lords in McPhail v Doulton [...] AC 424 where Lord Wilberforce restated the test for certainty of objects in connection with <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts.</b> Previously, it had been understood that for the trust to be valid, the trustees {{had to be able to}} draw up a [...] "complete list" [...] of all the possible beneficiaries, and if they could not do so, the trust was void. [...] But Lord Wilberforce held that provided it could be said of any person whether they were [...] "in or out" [...] of the class, as described by the settlor, the trust would be valid.|$|R
2500|$|The {{holder of}} a mere power is {{therefore}} {{free to do}} what he wants with the property he holds; if he fails to consider his exercise of the power, the courts may force him to do so. In relation to certainty of objects, mere powers are also a problem, {{for the same reason that}} <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> are. The leading test for mere powers is also the [...] "any given postulant" [...] test, which was laid down in Re Gulbenkian. The traditional distinction between trusts and powers has been that [...] "a trust is obligatory, a power discretionary"; the problem is that <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts,</b> while <b>trusts,</b> contain <b>discretionary</b> elements, to the point where they have been called [...] "powers in the nature of trusts"; a trust which [...] "whilst it masquerades under the guise of a mere power, has more of the characteristics of a trust proper".|$|R

500|$|<b>Discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> are trusts {{which require}} that the {{trustees}} exercise their powers, {{in the same way}} as a fixed trust, but allow some discretion in how to do so, in a similar manner to mere powers. Since trustees hold the discretionary power to choose how to act under an established boundary set out by the settlor of a trust, evidential certainty is not relevant and does not affect <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> anyway. The leading test of certainty of objects here is also the [...] "any given postulant test", applied to <b>discretionary</b> <b>trusts</b> in McPhail v Doulton. The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (no 2); however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid. Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a [...] "core number" [...] of beneficiaries who were certain. Megaw LJ's stand reflects the current position. Otherwise, trusts would have been failed if there is one individual who cannot be said to be the [...] "given postulant".|$|R
