60|$|The Prince's {{party was}} now in a doleful plight. Every one was very hungry; they were in an open plain, no house was visible, and they knew not which way to go. They wandered about for some time, looking for a brook or a spring where they might quench their thirst; and then a rabbit sprang out from some bushes. The whole party {{immediately}} started off {{in pursuit of the}} rabbit. They chased it here, there, backward and <b>forward,</b> through <b>hollows</b> and over hills, until it ran quite away and disappeared. Then they were more tired, thirsty, and hungry than before; and, to add to their miseries, when night came on the sky was cloudy, and the course-marker could not set his instrument by the stars. It would be difficult to find sixteen more miserable people than the Prince and his companions when they awoke the next morning from their troubled sleep on the hard ground.

On {{the surface of the}} noble area, once thronged with bustling crowds passing to and fro in every direction as their various destinations or caprices might lead them, not twenty moving figures were now discernible. These few, who still retained their strength or the resolution to pace the greatest thoroughfare of Rome, stalked backwards and <b>forwards</b> incessantly, their <b>hollow</b> eyes fixed on vacancy, their wan hands pressed over their mouths; each separate, distrustful, and silent; fierce as imprisoned madmen; restless as spectres disturbed in a place of tombs.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{rear-mounted}} engine, {{the differential}} lies between the transmission and engine, so {{drive to the}} transmission from the engine is carried <b>forward</b> via a <b>hollow</b> turbine shaft from the engine mounted torque converter to the transmission gearbox. Power from the gearbox was carried rearward again to the differential pinion gear via yet another, concentric hollow shaft of larger diameter. A small concentric shaft inside the turbine shaft operated the front pump of the transmission to permit engagement of drive/reverse ranges when the car was stopped or moving slowly; at speeds over 15 mph, a differential-driven (from the car motion) rear pump of smaller capacity and greater efficiency took over and the front pump shut down to improve fuel economy.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a method to}} control remotely the Terahertz (THz) source in air based on the bifilamentation of femtosecond laser pulses. By fine tuning the time delay between the two pulses, a significant modulation of the THz intensity from bifilamentation is observed. The phenomenon is attributed to the molecule quantum lensing effect around the air molecule revival time which changes the separation between the two neighboring plasma producing filaments. In the past few years, considerable progress has been achieved {{in the development of}} THz radiation sources and their applications. Many applications in security [1], health [2] or art preservation [3] require THz illumination of distant targets or samples. This raises a serious problem because of the strong absorption of THz radiation by water vapor. For instance, a THz pulse around 1. 5 THz is reduced by 12. 05 dB within 50 m of propagation in air with humidity content of only 39. 4 % [4]. Recently, several approaches have addressed this issue. One approach exploits the femtosecond filamentation process in air. The plasma column formed by a filament emits bursts of THz radiation along a <b>forward</b> oriented <b>hollow</b> cone [5]. Since it is easy to displace the filament plasma longitudinally, the THz radiation source can b...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid alloys among gold, {{palladium}} and platinum {{become a}} new category of catalysts primarily due to their enhanced catalytic effects. Enhancement means not only their effectiveness, but also their uniqueness as catalysts for the reactions that individual metals may not catalyze. Here, preparation of hollow Au@Pd and Au@Pt core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) and their use as electrocatalysts are reported. Galvanic displacement with Ag NPs is used to obtain hollow NPs, and higher reduction potential of Au compared to Ag, Pd, and Pt helps to produce hollow Au cores first, followed by Pd or Pt shell growth. Continuous and highly crystalline shell growth was observed in Au@Pd core-shell NPs, but the sporadic and porous-like structure was observed in Au@Pt core-shell NPs. Along with hollow core-shell NPs, hollow porous Pt and hollow Au NPs are also prepared from Ag seed NPs. Twin boundaries which are typically observed in large size (> 20 nm) Au NPs were not observed in hollow Au NPs. This absence {{is believed to be}} due {{to the role of the}} hollows, which significantly reduce the strain energy of edges where the two lattice planes meet. In ethanol oxidation reactions in alkaline medium, hollow Au@Pd core-shell NPs show highest current density in <b>forward</b> scan. <b>Hollow</b> Au@Pt core-shell NPs maintain better catalytic activities than metallic Pt, which is thought to be due to the better crystallinity of Pt shells as well as the alloy effect of Au cores. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, a {{specially}} designed pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) hollow fiber membrane has been successfully developed and applied in the PRO process to demonstrate its potential for power generation. The membrane fabrication method {{is similar to that}} used for making thin-film composite (TFC) <b>forward</b> osmosis <b>hollow</b> fiber membranes, but further optimization and improvement have led to a new type of TFC hollow fiber membranes with much greater mechanical strength in addition to its excellent separation property and high water flux. The TFC PRO hollow fiber membranes have a water permeability (A) of 9. 22 × 10 - 12 m/(sPa), salt permeability (B) of 3. 86 × 10 - 8 m/s and structural parameter (S) of 4. 6 × 10 - 4 m. It can withstand hydrostatic pressure as high as 9 bar with its relatively large dimension of 0. 98 mm lumen diameter. This PRO hollow fiber membrane is superior to all other PRO membranes reported in the open literature in terms of power density. A power density as high as 10. 6 W/m 2 can be achieved using seawater brine (1. 0 M NaCl) and wastewater brine (40 mM NaCl), which suggests that the newly developed PRO hollow fiber membrane has great potential to be applied in PRO processes to harvest salinity gradient energy. A higher pressure is preferred as it allows generation of higher power density (pressures of 12 bar may be optimal for seawater as the high salinity stream), and this can be realized by reduced fiber dimension. Further optimization of the membrane structure will be performed. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Grain {{size and}} {{lubricating}} conditions influence material flow behaviours in micro metal forming processes. In this study, the brass (JIS C 2700) tubes with 1. 1 mm outer diameter and 0. 5 mm inner diameter were treated by annealing at 400 ºC, 500 ºC and 600 ºC to obtain various microstructures {{with the grain}} sizes of 20 µm, 34 µm and 80 µm, respectively. The treated tubes were machined and grounded to be 0. 6 mm length specimens for the experiments of micro <b>forward</b> and backward <b>hollow</b> extrusion. Three lubricating conditions, which were dry, full and punch lubricated conditions, were {{carried out in the}} experiments. By comparing the upper cup height and rod length of the extruded specimens with the calibration curves established by finite element simulations, it is possible to estimate the friction factors in the processes. The results show that the dry conditions lead to stronger friction effects and thus larger friction factors. Moreover, the friction factor increased with grain size and stroke for all conditions...|$|R
50|$|The AR-18's {{action is}} powered by a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The gas piston is of 3-piece design to {{facilitate}} disassembly, with a <b>hollow</b> <b>forward</b> section with 4 radial gas vent holes fitting around a stainless steel gas block projecting rearwards from the foresight housing. The gas is vented from the barrel and travelled via a vent through the foresight housing into the hollow front section of the piston, which causes it to move rearwards a short distance. The rear end of the piston emerges through the barrel extension to contact the forward face of the bolt carrier, causing it in turn to move rearwards. The bolt itself is of similar configuration to the AR-15 with 7 radial locking lugs engaging corresponding recesses in the barrel extension, and the extractor in place of the 8th lug. The bolt is moved {{into and out of the}} locked position via a cam pin that engaged a helical slot in the bolt carrier, which rides on two metal guide rods (each with its own return spring) instead of contacting the receiver walls, providing additional clearance for foreign matter entering the receiver. Unlike the AR-15, the cocking handle fits directly into a recess in the bolt carrier and reciprocates with it during firing, allowing the firer to force the breech closed or open if necessary. The cocking handle slot has a spring-loaded cover that can be closed by the user to prevent debris entering the receiver, and it will open automatically as the bolt carrier moves rearwards after the first shot. The recoil springs are housed within the receiver, differing from the AR-15 which houses its more elaborate buffer mechanism in the buttstock. The AR-18's compact design enables the use of a side-folding stock with a hinging mechanism (which proved to be less than adequately rigid).|$|R
5000|$|The supply {{situation}} in Kharkov was now catastrophic; artillerymen after firing their last rounds, were abandoning their guns to fight as infantrymen. The army's supply depot had five trainloads of spare tank tracks {{left over from}} [...] "Zitadelle" [...] but very little else. The high consumption of ammunition {{in the last month}} and a half had cut into supplies put aside for the last two weeks of August and {{the first two weeks of}} September; until the turn of the month the army would have to get along with fifty percent of its daily average requirements in artillery & tank ammunition. XI Army Corps now had a combat strength of only 4,000 infantrymen, one man for every ten yards of front. General Erhard Raus explains the intensity of the constant Russian attacks: [...] "On 20 August the Russians avoided mass groupings of tanks, crossed the brook valley simultaneously in a number of places, and disappeared into the broad cornfields that were located ahead of our lines, ending at the east-west rollbahn several hundred metres in front of our main battle line. Throughout the morning Soviet tanks worked their way <b>forward</b> in the <b>hollows</b> up to the southern edges of the cornfields, then made a mass dash across the road in full sight. [...] "Das Reich"'s Panthers caught the leading waves of T-34's with fierce defensive fire before they could reach our main battle line. Yet wave after wave followed, until Russian tanks flowed across in the protecting <b>hollows</b> and pushed <b>forward</b> into our battle positions. Here a net of anti-tank and flak guns, Hornet 88mm tank destroyers, and Wasp self-propelled 105mm field howitzers trapped the T-34's, split them into small groups, and put large numbers out of action. The final waves were still attempting to force a breakthrough in concentrated masses when the Tigers and StuG III self-propelled assault guns, which represented our mobile reserve s behind the front, attacked the Russian armour and repulsed it with heavy losses. The price paid by the 5th Guards Tank Army for this mass assault amounted to 184 knocked out T-34's. [...] Wöhler, recognizing the hopelessness of the situation, did not prove anymore resolute, in view of the harsh realities facing the defenders of Kharkov, he knew that the depleted Infantry regiments could not hold their positions without copious artillery support. Two days after taking command of 8th Army, Wöhler also asked Manstein for permission to abandon the city. Regardless of Hitler's demand that the city be held, Wöhler and Manstein agreed that the city could not be defended for long, given the diminishing German strength and the overwhelming size of Soviet reserves.|$|R
