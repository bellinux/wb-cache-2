40|$|Summary The {{present report}} is a {{continuation}} of an interim report dated 8 th August, 1951. The latter- report dealt with the flow in a model casing whereas the present reports deals with a similar investigation on the ‘Reavell’ compressor <b>inlet</b> <b>casing</b> which is {{to be part of the}} 9 in x 9 in supersonic wind tunnel installation, In the basic condition the flow had a circumferential instability* caused by the splitting of the inlet flow around the central shaft fairing. In addition the main flow through the casing was under-turned by approximately 200, Consequently the flow at the exit annulas was unsteady and changes of 300 in the exit flow direction were found. It was also found that at least four guide vanes were stalled in any one flow configuration. The instability was prevented by a flat dividing plate placed behind the central shaft fairing, but smooth flow at exit, in the vicinity of the plate, was only possible when curved fairings were added to both sides of the plate. A gauze screen, of 30 wires per inch, placed at entry, partly reduced the unsteadiness at exit but it had little effect on the flow direction and did not unstall the guide vanes. A perforated plate, having 15. inch diameter holes and 50 per cent blockage, similarly placed, had little or no effect. The guide vanes were unstalled by adding curved extensions to their leading edges. The large changes in the flow direction across the annulus at exit were, however, only reduced by modifying the internal contour of the casing. With these modifications flow angle variations of between 5 ° and 10 ° were obtained at exit. The velocity at exit was not uniform over the exit passages between the guide vanes, but the variations, which were not unduly large, were caused by secondary flows and the wakes from the vanes. This investigation has clearly shown that in the basic condition the unsteady, non-uniform flow at the exit from the <b>inlet</b> <b>casing,</b> which is immediately upstream of the first stage of the compressor, will tend to cause periodic stalling of the rotating blades in that stage. Since the relative velocities are high the danger of running into stn 3 ling flutter cannot be overlooked, especially as the cascade effect may reduce the critical flutter speed of the isolated blade. Stalling flutter, which usually takes place in the fundamental torsional mode, may be aggravated by a high order resonance occuring at the given rotational speed of the compressor. The suggested' modifications to the design of the <b>inlet</b> <b>casing</b> should prevent stalling of the first stage blades 'of the compressor caused by upstream, unsteady, non-uniform flow...|$|E
40|$|The {{cavitation}} {{assessment for}} the space shuttle main engine high pressure oxidizer turbopump is documented. A model of the flow through the pump was developed. Initially, a computational procedure was {{used to analyze the}} flow through the <b>inlet</b> <b>casing</b> including the prediction of wakes downstream of the casing vanes. From these flow calculations, cavitation patterns on the inducer blades were approximated and the damage rate estimated. The model correlates the heavy damage on the housing and over the inducer with unsteady blade surface cavitation. The unsteady blade surface cavitation is due to the large incidence changes caused by the wakes of the upstream vanes. Very high cavitation damage rates are associated with this type of cavitation. Design recommendations for reducing the unsteady cavitation include removing the set of vanes closest to the inducer and modifying the remaining vanes...|$|E

40|$|A 1 / 5 {{scale model}} rotor {{representative}} of a current technology, high bypass ratio, turbofan engine was installed and tested in the W 8 single-stage, high-speed, compressor test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). The same fan rotor was tested previously in the GRC 9 x 15 Low Speed Wind Tunnel as a fan module consisting of the rotor and outlet guide vanes mounted in a flight-like nacelle. The W 8 test verified that the aerodynamic performance and detailed flow field of the rotor as installed in W 8 were representative of the wind tunnel fan module installation. Modifications to W 8 were necessary {{to ensure that this}} internal flow facility would have a flow field at the test package that is representative of flow conditions in the wind tunnel installation. Inlet flow conditioning was designed and installed in W 8 to lower the fan face turbulence intensity to less than 1. 0 percent in order to better match the wind tunnel operating environment. Also, inlet bleed was added to thin the casing boundary layer to be more {{representative of a}} flight nacelle boundary layer. On the 100 percent speed operating line the fan pressure rise and mass flow rate agreed with the wind tunnel data to within 1 percent.

The results differ considerably from those usually obtained in two dimensional cascades. There was no sign of the usual secondary loss core and for the thick boundary layers the circumferentially averaged total pressure increased along stream surfaces near to the casing, this implies a negative secondary loss. The explanation appears to be that low energy fluid from the upstream casing boundary layer is transported radially inwards along the blade surface or wake and is discharged into the mainstream over the whole of the blade span. *Replace...|$|R

40|$|Models of {{thermomechanical}} pulp processes must handle {{a large number}} of physical variables and machine specific parameters at different scales. Some variables, measured in the refining zone, will be invaluable when spanning the material and energy balances and thereby they provide essential information to the models. In this paper, measurements of temperature profile and plate gaps from a full-scale CD-refiner are used as model inputs together with process variables such as motor load, production, dilution water, <b>inlet</b> pressure and <b>casing</b> pressure. Two independent models, a micro-model describing fluid mechanics between the refining bars and an extended entropy model (macro-model) describing the material and energy balances for a complete refiner are used to get a realistic estimate of the pulp dynamic viscosity inside the refining zone. The models comprise a multi-scale concept and it is shown that the variability in the estimated pulp dynamic viscosity {{is directly related to the}} fiber energy efficiency in a micro-as well as in a macro perspective. To produce homogeneous pulp quality at energy efficient process conditions, it is concluded that large variations in the pressure pulses must be reduced. This can be performed by optimizing refining segments as well as stabilizing conditions by improved control strategies...|$|R

The data collected from this research facility will verify and increase the fidelity of CFD models used to design modern industrial gas turbine compressors for Siemens. Siemens provided the aerodynamic design for the compressor while Purdue {{was responsible for the}} <b>inlet,</b> exhaust, and <b>casing</b> designs. At design point, the four-stage compressor has a corrected mass flow rate of 20. 16 kg/s (44. 44 lbm), a corrected rotational speed of 1350 RPM, and a pressure ratio of 1. 09. The compressor is 1. 25 m (4. 1 ft.) in diameter and has a 12. 5 cm (4. 92 in.) annulus height. ^ The aerodynamic and mechanical designs of the inlet and exhaust were completed during this phase of research. The inlet and exhaust systems were designed to maximize work space within the lab. The throttle is also housed within the exhaust system and is controlled by three linear actuators.

40|$|Hydropower is a {{versatile}} renewable {{source of power}} generation able to change rapidly operating conditions. Hydropower plants may today work over a larger operating range than designed for due {{to the introduction of}} renewable sources of energy and the deregulation of the electricity market. Such operating conditions may involve large stresses and losses due to complex unsteady and transient flow phenomena, which have {{to be taken into account}} under design or refurbishment phase. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the design and refurbishment process is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility, detailed flow description and cost-effectiveness comparing to model testing used since a century in the development of turbines. However, issues have still to be resolved due to the combined flow physics involved in hydropower machines such as partly separated flow at curved surfaces, vortices, unsteadiness, swirl flow, strong adverse pressure gradients, convoluted geometry as well as numerical artefacts. Therefore, experimental data in such complicated systems are required to validate numerical simulations and develop more accurate models. The first part of this thesis is a numerical investigation of the three-dimensional flow of the axial Hölleforsen model spiral casing and distributor, where the influence of the penstock on the flow is analysed using different turbulence models and inlet boundary conditions. Comparisons with experimental results indicate the importance of the penstock to perform accurate simulation in the present case. Therefore, detailed inlet boundary conditions are necessary to simulate accurately the spiral casing flows if the penstock is not included in the simulation. The second part of the thesis focuses on an experimental investigation of an axial hydropower turbine model known as Porjus U 9. The measurements are part of a project aiming to investigate experimentally the flow in different regions of the machine to build a data bank in order to validate numerical simulations and study scale-up efficiency between model and prototype, since the corresponding prototype is available for similar experiments. The investigation was performed at 3 different working points: part load, best efficiency point and high load. The inlet flow of the spiral casing as well as some sections in the spiral casing and draft tube are investigated with a two components laser Doppler anemometer (LDA). To improve the signal quality and measurement accuracy refractive index matching optical box was mounted on the circular pipe of the spiral <b>casing</b> <b>inlet.</b> LDA result of the mean velocities and corresponding RMS are presented to investigate the flow before the runner and at the inlet of the spiral casing, since the flow is influenced by the existence of a bend before the inlet. The results of the draft tube measurements are also presented.

40|$|Lecturepg. 11 In 1991, {{four large}} double suction cooling pumps were {{installed}} at a chemical plant in Texas. Although these pumps met performance specifications {{on the test}} stand, they proved to be noisy when installed. Sound power levels greater than 93 dbA were observed. Pumping applications involving cooling water have been especially difficult to solve over the tears, due {{to the presence of}} dissolved air inherent in a cooling tower sump. Water that contains large amounts of dissolved air changes the apparent required net positive suction head (NPSH). In such applications, traditional correction techniques failed because the entire system was not analyzed, and the source of the noise generation could not be pinpointed. This paper deals with the steps involved with obtaining a solution to this problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed on the pump and impeller. Initial investigation revealed that the impeller was not the source of the problem. The <b>casing</b> <b>inlet</b> was then analyzed. The model indicated the presence of separation in the suction nozzle, causing a flow distortion at the impeller eye. A unique guide ring was developed to minimize the flow separation. The CFD analysis was revised to reflect the new geometry, and a significant improvement in the flow was predicted. A prototype guide ring was manufactured and installed in one of the four pumps. Pressure profiles were obtained by experiment to validate the analyses. The results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{turbines}} exhibit {{total load}} rejection during operation {{because of high}} fluctuations in the grid parameters. The generator reaches no-load instantly. Consequently, the turbine runner accelerates to high speed, runaway speed, in seconds. Under common conditions, stable runaway is only reached if after a load rejection, the control and protection mechanisms both fail and the guide vanes cannot be closed. The runner life {{is affected by the}} high amplitude pressure loading at the runaway speed. A model Francis turbine was used to investigate the consequences at the runaway condition. Measurements and simulations were performed at three operating points. The numerical simulations were performed using standard k-", k-! shear stress transport (SST) and scale-adaptive simulation (SAS) models. A total of 12. 8 million hexahedral mesh elements were created in the complete turbine, from the spiral <b>casing</b> <b>inlet</b> to the draft tube outlet. The experimental and numerical analysis showed that the runner was subjected to an unsteady pressure loading up to three-times the pressure loading observed at the best efficiency point. Investigates of unsteady pressure pulsations at the vaneless space, runner and draft tube are discussed in the paper. Further, unsteady swirling flow in the blade passages was observed that was rotating at a frequency of 4. 8 -times the runaway runner angular speed. Apart from the unsteady pressure loading, the development pattern of the swirling flow in the runner is discussed in the paper.

40|$|AbstractWith a {{decrease}} in orders for their regular standard cargo-pump for chemical tankers, Frank Mohn Fusa started developing a new cargo-pump for the Offshore Supply Vessel market. This meant designing a pump which both {{should be able to}} pump high viscous oil-emulsion and a fluid called drilling-mud, which is a mixture of salt-water and small particles of barite stone. The first test performed when the thesis started showed that their initial design would not withstand the erosion from the particles for a long enough period of time; this because both the pump impeller and the pump volute casing suffered from heavy erosion. This master thesis has the objective of first quantifying the erosion in the original design and then comparing the CFD-simulations with real physical tests. From these results, together with analytical estimations of the erosion on the components and in compliance with erosion and fluid mechanical theory, a recommendation for a new design will be given. CFD-results for this new design will also be given. There is also a focus on finding the areas where erosion often occurs. Recommendations for material choice and coating are given for the original design. The results from the impeller simulations show that there are still some unknown variables in the prediction of erosion in CFD. While the steady state simulation differs quite much from the physical test, the transient simulation gives a better prediction for the pump impeller. It is found that the boundary layer in the grid has a large influence for the prediction of particle erosion. For the impeller it is found that the new design is a better solution than the original open impeller in regards to erosion rates, both at full-load and in the best efficiency point, while they are almost equal at part-load. The result from the pumps volute casing gives a good representation of the measured erosion from the physical test. The volute <b>casings</b> <b>inlet</b> tongue in the original design is a region where design changes are needed, since it has a high erosion rate caused by high velocity and high impinging angle. The new volute casing designed in this thesis, where the volume expansion is changed from radial to axial, gives better results, having approximately three times less maximum erosion rate at the inlet tongue. The analytical model used in this thesis gives a good estimation for some of the surfaces, while others differs to some degree from the CFD calculations. This is mainly caused by forces acting on the particles that are not accounted for in the analytical model. </p...|$|R
