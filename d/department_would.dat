5|$|As {{part of a}} {{reorganization}} of government departments, the post-secondary education portfolio {{was removed from the}} Department of Education and became part of the new Department of Advanced Education and Skills. Along with post-secondary education the new <b>department</b> <b>would</b> be responsible for apprentices, advanced studies and take over much of the responsibilities of the former Department of Human Resources, Labour and Employment. The Department of Education would be responsible for K-12 education, early childhood learning and the province's libraries.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, EES {{director}} Vaughan {{became the}} director of the School of Ceramic Engineering. He was {{the director of}} the station until 1940, when he accepted a higher-paying job at the Tennessee Valley Authority and was replaced by Harold Bunger (the first chairman of Georgia Tech's chemical engineering department). When the ceramics department was temporarily discontinued due to World War II, the current students found wartime employment. The <b>department</b> <b>would</b> be reincarnated after the war under the guidance of Lane Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington {{at the behest of the}} State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State <b>Department</b> <b>would</b> now conduct the investigation.|$|E

5|$|As of 1999, the State Department {{was paying}} $360,000 {{per year to}} lease the suite on a rolling basis; the lease is renewed every ten years with an {{optional}} one or two year short-term extension. In 2015, it was announced the State <b>Department</b> <b>would</b> no longer permit staff to be housed at the Waldorf-Astoria, due to security concerns arising from the recent purchase of the property by Chinese business interests. Whether the decision would impact {{the status of the}} residence was not made clear, however, as of March 2016 the hotel was still being occupied by the U.S. ambassador.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model <b>department</b> <b>would</b> also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Reports as to {{the size}} of the mosque have varied considerably. Ali Mangera of Mangera Yvars Architects, {{submitted}} a proposal for the design competition, stated that his design would accommodate up to 40,000visitors simultaneously, with the potential for expanding to contain 70,000people. These figures led to much consternation. London Borough of Newham Councillor Alan Craig, of the Christian Peoples Alliance, criticised the development plans on the grounds that they would change the character of the local area, making it predominantly Muslim, and has called for a public inquiry into the mosque's development. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Newham planning <b>department</b> <b>would</b> refuse the mosque's application, as a project of that size had the potential to cause damage to community relations in the area.|$|E

50|$|Firefighters {{have begun}} to utilize helmet cams {{as a tool to}} assess their {{responses}} to fires and allow non-firefighters to see the reality of what occurs inside a burning building.

5|$|The {{prevention}} of dengue fever in Taiwan was always most successful in Tainan City. In 2007, however, outbreaks {{in the city}} was almost unstoppable.

She {{was involved in the}} placement of art at the library so that visitors to every <b>department</b> <b>would</b> have the opportunity to view the works of art, including European prints and rare engravings that span several centuries.|$|E
50|$|Some {{health care}} systems put psychologists and psychiatrists under the {{category}} of primary care providers. In this case, short hospital stays and consultation-liaison services to other medical <b>departments</b> <b>would</b> fall under secondary health care.

5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior <b>Department</b> <b>would</b> be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since {{there seemed to be no}} official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War <b>Department</b> <b>would</b> try to reissue the medals.|$|E
