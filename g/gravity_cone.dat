40|$|Sheffield (2011) {{introduced}} an inventory accumulation model which encodes a random planar map decorated by {{a collection of}} loops sampled from the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) model. He showed that a certain two-dimensional random walk associated with an infinite-volume version of the model converges in the scaling limit to a correlated planar Brownian motion. We improve on this scaling limit result by showing that the times corresponding to FK loops (or "flexible orders") in the inventory accumulation model converge in the scaling limit to the π/ 2 -cone times of the correlated Brownian motion. This statement implies a scaling limit result for the joint law of the areas and boundary lengths of the bounded complementary connected components of the FK loops on the infinite-volume planar map. In light of the encoding of Duplantier, Miller, and Sheffield (2014), the limiting object coincides with the joint law of the areas and boundary lengths of the bounded complementary connected components {{of a collection of}} CLE_κ loops on an independent Liouville quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>cone.</b> Comment: 58 pages, 8 figures, version 3 contains a new section which explicitly proves a scaling limit result for areas and boundary lengths of components of FK loop...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were two-fold: (1) to examine possible seed and cone characteristics and their usefulness as seed maturity indices, and (2) {{to examine the effects}} of artificial ripening on seed maturation and germination. Cone fresh weight, cone length, cone specific <b>gravity,</b> <b>cone</b> color, seed fresh weight, seed development, seed wing color and embryo/embryo cavity ratio were studied to determine their usefulness as maturity indices. The artificial ripening treatments incLuded: (1) detached cones stored outdoors in the shade, and (2) detached cones stored outdoors in the shade with their basal end setting in moist perlite. With maturity, grand fir seed germination increased linearly without any leveling off prior to seed dispersal. Due to the erratic nature of noble fir seed germination no definitive pattern was observed. Artificial ripening techniques were beneficial for both species, increasing germination above that of the control and also increasing the rate of germination. Seedling vigor, as measured by oven dry weight, was also improved by artificially ripening the immature cones. Dry outdoor storage of cones produced more total sound seed that moist outdoor storage. The ratio of embryo length to the length of the embryo cavity was the single most useful index of seed maturity found. Seed wing color and degree of seed wing attachment also appear to be useful in assessing seed maturity. Cone color and cone specific gravity were beneficial cone characteristics found for determining seed maturity. The most marked changes in biochemical constituents of ripening seed were the steady accumulation of reserves, i. e crude fat and protein nitrogen, and structural components. Soluble sugar, amino acid and starch contents decreased with maturity, while crude fat and nitrogenous compounds increased. During artificial ripening an even more significant increase in crude fat and nitrogenous compounds occurred, thus reflecting a conversion from mobile to storage forms. The decrease in organic materials of cone scales also was associated with mobilization of these materials by maturing seeds. An even more significant decrease in these materials occurred after the cones had been picked and stored outdoors, suggesting translocation of substances from cone scales to ripening seeds...|$|E

40|$|Relationship {{between the}} speed of gravity cg and {{the speed of}} light ce in the bi-metric theory of gravity is discussed. We reveal that {{the speed of light}} is a {{function}} of the speed of gravity which is a primary fundamental constant. Thus, experimental measurement of relativistic bending of light propagating in time-dependent gravitational field directly compares the speed of gravity versus the speed of light and tests if there is any aether associated with the gravitational field considered as a transparent ‘medium’ with the constant refraction index. Key words: gravitation – gravitational waves – relativity – instrumentation: interferometers Any assumption that the fundamental speed (of light) in Maxwell’s theory is different from the fundamental speed (of gravity) in Einstein’s theory of general relativity inevitably leads to a bi-metric theory of gravity operating with two metric tensors. One of them, gαβ, introduces a <b>gravity</b> null <b>cone</b> along which weak gravitational waves propagate with speed cg, while the other, ˜gαβ makes a light null cone along which electromagnetic waves propagate with speed ce.

40|$|Kostrov's (1974) {{algorithm}} for seismic-strain tensor computations, in {{the version}} implemented by Wyss et al. (1992 a) for error estimates, {{has been applied}} to shear-type earthquakes occurring beneath the Etna volcano during 1990 - 1996. Space-time variations of strain orientations and amplitudes have been examined jointly with ground-deformation and gravimetric data collected in the same period and reported in the literature. Taking also into account the information available from volcanological observations and structural geology, we propose a model assuming that hydraulic pressure by magma emplaced in nearly north-south vertical structures produces the E-W orientation of the maximum compressive strain found in the upper 10 km beneath the crater area. In contrast, regional tectonics deriving from the slow, north-south convergence between the African and European plates appear to play a dominant role in the generation of stress and strain fields at crustal depths deeper than 10 km below the volcano. According to our interpretation, the progressive ascent of magma through the upper crust prior to eruption produces the observed <b>gravity</b> changes, <b>cone</b> inflation and unusual seismic strain rate in the upper 10 km associated with a more sharply defined seismic deformation regime (i. e. very small confidence limits of the epsilon 1 orientation). In agreement with this model, deflation revealed by ground-deformation data {{during the course of the}} major 1991 - 1993 eruption was accompanied by a practically nil level of shallow seismicity...|$|R
40|$|Several space {{missions}} such as GRACE, GRAIL, ACES {{and others}} rely on intersatellite com- munications (ISC) between two satellites {{at a large}} distance one from another. This {{is not only a}} technical problem because for example for the GRAIL-mission all the observables for the two radio links at the K and Ka- bands (26 GHz and 32 GHz) for intersatellite ranging and also the navigation observables for the S- and X- bands (2 GHz and 8 GHz) should be formulated within the General Relativity Theory (GRT). The same approach should be applied to the inter- satellite GPS-communications (in perspective also between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations). In this paper a theoretical approach has been developed for ISC between two satellites moving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits based on the introduction of two <b>gravity</b> null <b>cones</b> with origins at the emitting-signal and receiving-signal satellites. The two null cones account for the variable distance between the satellites and their uncorrelated motion. The most important consequence of the theory is the obtained condition for ISC. This theory places also a restriction on the ellipticity e of the orbit (e less or equal than 0. 816496580927726). For the typical GPS orbital parameters the condition for ISC gives a value E = 45. 00251 [deg] for the eccentric anomaly angle, which is surprisingly close to the value for the true anomaly angle f = 45. 54143 [deg] and also to the angle of disposition of the satellites in the GLONASS satellite constellation (the Russian analogue of the American GPS) - 8 satellites within one and the same plane equally spaced at 45 deg. The paper is the first step towards constructing a new and consistent relativistic physical theory of ISC between moving (non-stationary) satellites.

40|$|Let $\gamma\in(0, 2) $ and let $h$ be {{the random}} {{distribution}} on $\mathbb C$ which describes a $\gamma$-Liouville quantum <b>gravity</b> (LQG) <b>cone.</b> Also let $\kappa= 16 /\gamma^ 2 > 4 $ and let $\eta$ be a whole-plane space-filling SLE$_\kappa$ curve independent from $h$ and parametrized by $\gamma$-quantum mass {{with respect to}} $h$. We study a family $\{\mathcal G^\epsilon\}_{\epsilon> 0 }$ of planar maps associated with $(h,\eta) $ called the LQG structure graphs (a. k. a. mated-CRT maps) which we conjecture converge in probability in the scaling limit {{with respect to the}} Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a random metric space associated with $\gamma$-LQG. In particular, $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ is the graph whose vertex set is $\epsilon \mathbb Z$, with two such vertices $x_ 1,x_ 2 \in\epsilon\mathbb Z$ connected by an edge iff the curve segments $\eta([x_ 1 -\epsilon,x_ 1]) $ and $\eta([x_ 2 -\epsilon,x_ 2]) $ share a non-trivial boundary arc. Due to the peanosphere description of SLE-decorated LQG due to Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield, the graph $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ can be expressed as an explicit functional of a correlated 2 d Brownian motion, so can be studied without any reference to SLE or LQG. We prove non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of a graph-distance ball in $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ which are consistent with the prediction of Watabiki for the dimension of LQG. Using subadditivity arguments, we also prove that there is an exponent $\chi> 0 $ for which the expected graph distance between generic points in the subgraph of $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ corresponding to the segment $\eta([0, 1]) $ is $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1) }$, and this distance is extremely unlikely to be larger than $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1) }$. In the special case when $\gamma=\sqrt 2 $, we show that the diameter of this subgraph of $\mathcal G^\epsilon$ is of order $\epsilon^{-\chi+o(1) }$ with high probability.
