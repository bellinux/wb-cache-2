The contribution (b) into the strain-voltage SPM was not calculated previously, while the contribution (c) was not even predicted before, while our estimations performed for correlated oxides show that strength of (c) appeared comparable with (a,b). For the case of ion-blocking tip and substrate electrode mainly the changes in holes (electrons) concentration contribute into the voltage-dependent mechanical displacement of the film surface, directly registered by strain SPM. Thus, we predict that the SPM measurements of the <b>ionic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> surface displacement could provide important information about the local changes of the acceptors (donors) charge state and electron (hole) -phonon correlations via the deformation potential.

40|$|Thallium bromide (TlBr) is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} <b>ionic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> with excellent radiation detection properties. However, at room temperature, TlBr devices polarize under an applied electric field. This phenomenon not only degrades the charge collection efficiency of the detectors but also promotes chemical reaction of the metal electrodes with bromine, resulting in an unstable electric field and premature failure of the device. This drawback has been crippling the TlBr semiconductor radiation detector technology {{over the past few}} decades. In this exhaustive study, this polarization phenomenon has been counteracted using innovative bias polarity switching schemes. Here the highly mobile Br− species, with an estimated electro-diffusion velocity of 10 − 8 cm/s, face opposing electro-migration forces during every polarity switch. This minimizes the device polarization and availability of Br− ions near the metal electrode.

Here we have investigated by first-principles quantum mechanical methods models of the two most commonly reported AgBiS 2 crystal structures, the room temperature matildite structure, and the metastable schapbachite. Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation (xc) functional reveal that matildite can be 0. 37 eV per AgBiS 2 stoichiometry unit more stable than a schapbachite structure in bulk, and that the latter, in its ordered form, may display a metallic electronic structure, precluding its use for solar light harvesting. This points out the fact that AgBiS 2 nanocrystals used in solar cells should present a structure based on matildite. Matildite is found to be an indirect gap semiconductor, with an estimated band gap of ∼ 1. 5 eV according to DFT based calculations using the more accurate hybrid xc functionals.

In particular, we show how the ripples are expected to disappear when the indentation rate is below a critical value or, alternatively, when the sliding velocity or the lateral stiffness of the contact are too high. The model results are compared to atomic force microscopy experiments on a solvent-enriched polystyrene surface, where the rippling formation is enhanced at room temperature, compared to bulk melts. A similar approach could be employed to describe rippling phenomena on larger scales. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
