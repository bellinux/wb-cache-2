40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} image quality and {{diagnostic}} {{performance of a}} contrast agent-specific inversion-recovery (IR) steady-state free precession (SSFP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence performed by using an intravascular contrast agent (<b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium) with those of a commonly used T 2 -prepared SSFP sequence performed by using an extravascular (gadopentetate dimeglumine) and an intravascular (<b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium) contrast agent in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local ethics committee and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approved this study. Patient informed consent was obtained. Twenty-three patients with CHD were examined by using a 1. 5 -T MR imaging unit and a 32 -channel coil. Gadopentetate dimeglumine and <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium {{were used in the}} same patient on consecutive days. Vessel wall sharpness, contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs), image quality, and diagnostic performance achieved by using the IR SSFP sequence with <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium were compared with those achieved by using the T 2 -prepared SSFP sequence with gadopentetate dimeglumine and <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium and with those achieved at respective contrast material-enhanced MR angiographic examinations. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare categoric variables; t tests were used to compare continuous variables. RESULTS: Use of the IR SSFP sequence with <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium significantly improved vessel wall sharpness, CNRs, and image quality (P <. 05 for all) for all investigated intra- and extracardiac structures compared with the T 2 -prepared SSFP sequence with gadopentetate dimeglumine and <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium and the respective contrast-enhanced MR angiographic examinations. With use of the IR SSFP sequence with <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium, new, unsuspected diseases (five [22 %] of 23) were diagnosed, while other diseases could be excluded (15 [65 %] of 23). Information available from echocardiography (n = 23), conventional angiography (n = 4), and/or surgery (n = 1) confirmed all diagnoses. CONCLUSION: IR SSFP with <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium improved image quality and diagnostic performance, allowing a more accurate and complete assessment of cardiovascular anatomy in patients with CHD compared with T 2 -prepared SSFP with gadopentetate dimeglumine and <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium and respective contrast-enhanced MR angiographic examinations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: To compare an albumin-bound {{gadolinium}} chelate (<b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium) and an extracellular {{contrast agent}} (gadobenate dimeglumine), {{in terms of}} their effects on myocardial longitudinal (T 1) relaxation time and partition coefficient. Materials and Methods: Study subjects underwent two imaging sessions for T 1 mapping at 3 tesla with a modified look-locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) pulse sequence to obtain one pre-contrast T 1 map and two post-contrast T 1 maps (mean 15 and 21 min, respectively). The partition coefficient was calculated as ΔR 1 myocardium /ΔR 1 blood, where R 1 is 1 /T 1. Results: A total of 252 myocardial and blood pool T 1 values were obtained in 21 healthy subjects. After gadolinium administration, the myocardial T 1 was longer for <b>gadofosveset</b> than for gadobenate, the mean difference between the two contrast agents being − 7. 6 ± 60 ms (p = 0. 41). The inverse was true for the blood pool T 1, which was longer for gadobenate than for <b>gadofosveset,</b> the mean difference being 56. 5 ± 67 ms (p < 0. 001). The partition coefficient (λ) was higher for gadobenate than <b>gadofosveset</b> (0. 41 vs. 0. 33), indicating slower blood pool washout for <b>gadofosveset</b> than for gadobenate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the protein-specific response of r 1 and r 2 relaxivities of commercially available gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents to variation of plasma-protein concentrations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, contrast agent (<b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium, gadoxetate disodium, gadobutrol, and gadoterate meglumine) dilution series (0 - 2. 5 mmol Gd/L) were prepared with plasma-protein (human serum albumin [HSA] and immunoglobulin G [IgG]) concentrations at physiological (42 and 10 g/L HSA and IgG, respectively, Normal) and at 3 pathological levels with HSA/IgG concentrations of 10 / 10 (solution Alb low), 42 / 50 (IgG mild), and 42 / 70 (IgG severe) g/L. Contrast-agent molar relaxivities and relaxivity-enhancing protein-contrast-agent interaction coefficients were determined on the basis of inversion-recovery and spin-echo data acquired at 1. 5 and 3. 0 T at 37 °C. Protein-induced magnetic resonance imaging signal changes were calculated. RESULTS: The effective r 1 and r 2 molar relaxivities consistently increased with albumin and IgG concentrations. At 1. 5 T, the r 1 values increased by 10. 2 (<b>gadofosveset),</b> 4. 3 (gadoxetate), 1. 3 (gadobutrol), and 1. 1 L s mmol (gadoterate), respectively, from the Alb low to the IgG severe solution. At 3. 0 T, the r 1 values increased by 2. 9 (<b>gadofosveset),</b> 2. 3 (gadoxetate), 0. 7 (gadobutrol), and 0. 9 (gadoterate) L s mmol, respectively. An excess of IgG most strongly increased the r 1 of gadoxetate (+ 40 and + 19 % at 1. 5 and 3. 0 T, respectively, from Normal to IgG severe). An albumin deficiency most strongly decreased the r 1 of <b>gadofosveset</b> (- 44 % and - 20 % at 1. 5 and 3. 0 T, respectively, from Normal to Alb low).

40|$|BACKGROUND: High-quality {{non-invasive}} imaging of {{the deep}} venous system in the thorax is challenging, but nevertheless required for diagnosis of vascular pathology {{as well as for}} patient selection and preoperative planning for endovascular procedures. PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic quality of Gadofosveset-enhanced thoracic magnetic resonance venography, seven consecutive patients with suspected or known disease affecting the central thoracic veins were compared to seven consecutive magnetic resonance venography using conventional gadolinium-based contrast agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnostic capability, defined as the ability to assess vessel patency and pathologic conditions, for the major thoracic deep venous segments was assessed by two-independent readers. Both reviewers rated the overall subjective image quality on a four-graded scale, and inter-rater variability was analyzed using unweighted and weighted Cohen's kappa values. RESULTS: Diagnostic capability was generally considerably higher in the <b>Gadofosveset</b> group for all examined vessel segments. The overall images quality rating was significantly higher for the <b>Gadofosveset</b> group with a mean rating of 2. 9 and 2. 7 for the two-independent readers, compared to 1. 2 and 1. 0 for the control croup.

40|$|Hepatic vein {{stenosis}} {{is a rare}} but serious complication following liver transplantation. Multiple modalities can {{be utilized}} to image the hepatic vasculature. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) provides certain advantages over ultrasound, computed tomography angiography and digital subtraction venography. MRV utilizes the same imaging principles of magnetic resonance angiography in order to image the venous system.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} angiography (MRA) provides noninvasive {{visualization of}} the vascular supply of soft tissue masses and vascular pathology, without harmful radiation. This {{is important for}} planning an endovascular intervention, and helps to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the treatment. MRA with conventional extracellular contrast agents relies on accurate contrast bolus timing, limiting the imaging window to first-pass arterial phase. The recently introduced blood pool contrast agent (BPCA), <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium, reversibly binds to human serum albumin, resulting in increased T 1 relaxivity and prolonged intravascular retention time, permitting both first-pass and steady-state phase high-resolution imaging. In our practice, high-quality MRA serves as a detailed "roadmap" for the needed endovascular intervention. Cases of aortoiliac occlusive disease, inferior vena cava thrombus, pelvic congestion syndrome, and lower extremity arteriovenous malformation are discussed in this article. MRA was acquired at 1. 5 T with an 8 -channel phased array coil after intravenous administration of <b>gadofosveset</b> (0. 03 mmol/kg body weight), at the first-pass phase. In the steady-state, serial T 1 -weighted 3 D spoiled gradient echo images were obtained with high resolution. All patients underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and endovascular treatment. MRA and DSA findings of vascular anatomy and pathology are discussed and correlated. BPCA-enhanced MRA provides high-quality first-pass and steady-state vascular imaging.

Sixteen (9 symptomatic, 7 asymptomatic) patients with 70 % to 99 % carotid stenosis (according to NASCET criteria) were included (13 men, 3 women, mean age 67. 6 years). All patients underwent baseline precontrast MR imaging of the carotid plaque. Immediately after completion of the baseline examination, 0. 03 mmol/kg <b>gadofosveset</b> was administered. At 24 hours postinjection, the acquisition was repeated. Twelve patients were scheduled for carotid endarterectomy. Carotid endarterectomy specimens were HE-, CD 31 -, CD 68 -, and albumin-stained to correlate signal enhancement with plaque composition, intraplaque microvessel density, and macrophage and albumin content. A random intercept model {{was used to compare}} signal enhancement between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, adjusting for size of various plaque components. This study was approved by the institutional medical ethics committee. All participants gave written informed consent. Signal enhancement (SE) of the plaque was significantly higher in symptomatic patients compared with asymptomatic patients (median log SE 0. 182 vs. - 0. 109, respectively, P < 0. 001). A positive association (as expressed by a regression coefficient beta = 0. 0035) was found between signal enhancement on the log scale and intraplaque albumin content (P = 0. 038). There was no association between signal enhancement and various other plaque components. In this study, the potential of gadofosveset-enhanced human carotid plaque MR imaging for identification of high-risk plaques was demonstrated.

All study subjects were examined with a 1. 5 T MRI scanner with a WB-MRA technique and application of a single dose injection of the blood-pool contrast agent <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium. First pass phase was performed with a resolution of 1. 6 x 1. 01. 5 mm at four different table positions {{with the use of a}} test-bolus injection for which each study subject's individual circulation time was calculated. Subsequently, steady state phase was performed in all four table positions with a resolution of 1. 0 x 1. 0 x 1. 0 mm. The preferred standard of reference was selected for each vascular segment according to a 5 -point-score. Two independent, blinded readers evaluated all imaging data. Differences in the stenosis quantification between first pass phase and combined first pass and steady state phase were calculated with a 95 % confidence interval approach with an adjusted Chi-squared test. The overall image quality was evaluated with a scoring system. All lesions, additionally detected by WB-MRA, were assessed. In a conference with a radiologist and a vascular surgeon, the results of the WB-MRA were discussed and the changes in therapeutic patient management following the WB-MRA were evaluated. The diagnostic accuracy of first pass MRA (531 segments of 49 study subjects) was 81. 7 % (95 % CI 73. 7 - 89. 8), the diagnostic accuracy of the combined first pass and steady state MRA was 94. 7 % (95 % CI 92. 4 - 97. 1). The lower boundary of the 95 % CI was 5. 6 %. The combined first pass and steady state MRA showed a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for the detection of arterial stenoses compared to the first pass MRA alone. The sensitivity and specifity for the diagnosis of diseased vascular segments was 67. 6 % (95 % CI 52. 8 - 82. 5) and 88. 6 % (95 % CI 81. 9 - 95. 4) for the first pass MRA, and 93 % (95 % CI 89. 8 – 97. 0) and 98 % (95 % CI 96. 3 – 99. 6) for the combined first pass and steady state MRA. The number of non-diagnostic vascular segments was 14 / 191 (7. 3 %) for the first pass MRA. In 13 of 14 of these segments, the steady state MRA was rated diagnostically sufficient. Thus, the number of non-diagnostic segments was reduced to 1 / 191 (0. 5 %). Image quality in first pass was rated good in 34. 5 %, moderate in 21. 5 %, and excellent in 20. 5 %. In the steady state phase 91 % of the evaluated segments were diagnostic, 8. 9 % non-diagnostic. The therapeutic patient management was changed in 11 / 49 (22 %) of the patients due to the results of the WB-MRA. WB-MRA with the use of the blood-pool contrast agent <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium increased the accuracy to detect arterial stenoses with the additional high resolution steady state phase. The WB-MRA technique after administration of <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium is a robust examination method for patients with atherosclerotic disease and its broad clinical use for the detection of systemic arterial disease is feasible. The image quality of the WB-MRA was mainly good in first pass and steady state MRA. Optimization of the sequence protocol and the evaluated body regions could further increase the spatial resolution in future studies. The results of the WB-MRA in 50 patients changed therapeutic patient management in 22 % of the cases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{describe}} a method that assesses the hyperemic microvascular blood plasma volume of the calf musculature. The reversibly albumin binding contrast agent <b>gadofosveset</b> was used in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) to assess the microvascular status in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and healthy controls. In addition, the reproducibility of this method in healthy controls was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten PAD patients with intermittent claudication and 10 healthy control subjects were included. Patients underwent contrast-enhanced MR angiography of the peripheral arteries, followed by one DCE MRI examination of the musculature of the calf. Healthy control subjects were examined twice on different days to determine normative values and the interreader and interscan reproducibility of the technique. The MRI protocol comprised dynamic imaging of contrast agent wash-in under reactive hyperemia conditions of the calf musculature. Using pharmacokinetic modeling the hyperemic fractional microvascular blood plasma volume (V(p), unit: %) of the anterior tibial, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was calculated. RESULTS: V(p) was significantly lower for all muscle groups in PAD patients (4. 3 ± 1. 6 %, 5. 0 ± 3. 3 % and 6. 1 ± 3. 6 % for anterior tibial, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, respectively) compared to healthy control subjects (9. 1 ± 2. 0 %, 8. 9 ± 1. 9 % and 9. 3 ± 2. 1 %). Differences in V(p) between muscle groups were not significant. The coefficient of variation of V(p) varied from 10 - 14 % and 11 - 16 % at interscan and interreader level, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using DCE MRI after contrast-enhanced MR angiography with <b>gadofosveset</b> enables reproducible assessment of hyperemic fractional microvascular blood plasma volume of the calf musculature. V(p) was lower in PAD patients than in healthy controls, which reflects a promising functional (hemodynamic) biomarker for the microvascular impairment of macrovascular lesions...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to prospectively {{evaluate}} first-pass i. v. gadofosveset-enhanced MR angiography in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease for visualization of the pedal arteries and stenosis or occlusion of those arteries with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography as the reference standard. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (nine women, 11 men; age-range 58 - 83 years) were prospectively enrolled. <b>Gadofosveset</b> first-pass contrast-enhanced MR angiography was performed with a 1. 5 -T system, a dedicated foot coil, and cuff compression to the calf. Arterial segments were assessed for degree of arterial stenosis, arterial visibility, diagnostic utility, and venous contamination. Detection of vessel stenosis or occlusion was evaluated in comparison with findings at digital subtraction angiography. The unpaired Student's t test was used to test arterial visibility with the two techniques. RESULTS: First-pass MR angiography with <b>gadofosveset</b> had good diagnostic utility in 83. 9 % of all segments and no venous contamination in 96. 8 % of all segments. There was no difference between the performance of intraarterial digital subtraction angiography and that of i. v. contrast-enhanced MR angiography in arterial visibility overall (p = 0. 245) or in subgroup analysis of surgical arterial bypass targets (p = 0. 202). The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of i. v. gadofosveset-enhanced MR angiography for characterization of clinically significant stenosis and occlusion were 91. 4 %, 96. 1 %, and 93. 9 %. In the subgroup analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 85. 5 %, 96. 5 %, and 92. 1 %. CONCLUSION: Gadofosveset-enhanced MR angiography of the pedal arteries in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease has arterial visibility equal to that of digital subtraction angiography and facilitates depiction of clinically significant stenosis and occlusion...|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} of GBCAs in routine clinical use are extracellular fluid (ECF) agents. After injection, they initially distribute in the intravascular space, before rapidly diffusing across the vascular membranes into the interstitial space, eventually establishing an equilibrium between the intravascular and interstitial compartments after approximately 10  min. ECF GBCA agents that demonstrate weak plasma protein binding, such as gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA), help increase relaxivity {{compared to the}} other ECF GBCAs [58]. <b>Gadofosveset</b> trisodium (Gd-DTPA-DO 3 A/MS- 325) is currently the only intravascular GBCA licensed by the FDA. It was licensed by the European Medicines Agency for distribution in the European Union (EU) in 2005, but was voluntarily withdrawn from commercial use in the EU by the manufacturer in 2011. It is a linear ionic agent, which binds strongly to albumin, limiting its diffusion into the extravascular space [59].|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} {{measured}} the longitudinal and transverse (T 2 * relaxivity curves for ProHance (Gadoteridol), Vasovist (<b>Gadofosveset)</b> and deoxyhemoglobin at 1. 5, 3. 0, and 7. 0 Tesla. The plots of R(1) versus both contrast agent and deoxyhemoglobin concentration were linear. The plots of R 2 * versus deoxyhemoglobin concentration showed a quadratic dependence. R 2 * versus contrast agent concentration showed a parabolic dependence {{with a minimum}} occurring at contrast agent concentrations of approximately 1. 5 mM, corresponding to an accessible concentration in vivo. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to {{support the hypothesis that}} the minimum results from the susceptibility of the red blood cells being matched to the susceptibility of the plasma. Relaxivity values (s(- 1) mM(- 1)) for R 2 * and R 1 for all agents and all three field strengths are given...|$|E
30|$|GBCAs {{with high}} relaxivity that remain within the blood-pool {{are the most}} {{attractive}} from an image quality point of view, however, safety considerations {{should be taken into}} account when choosing an agent. Gadobenate dimeglumine has the highest relaxivity of the ECF GBCAs, and <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium is the only intravascular GBCA. These are both linear ionic agents, placing them in the intermediate risk category for NSF in susceptible patients, and at potentially higher risk for cerebral deposition. The current commercially available GBCA with the most favourable risk profile in terms of NSF and cerebral deposition is the macrocyclic ionic agent gadoterate meglumine. This agent has inferior protein binding and relaxivity compared with some of the other GBCAs, but this is offset by its safety profile. There have to-date been no reported cases of NSF with this agent, even in patients with severe renal dysfunction [51, 52], and it is also the only GBCA in which cerebral deposition has not been demonstrated [56].|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} angiography (MRA) is {{an established}} noninvasive imaging modality for detection {{and evaluation of}} vascular pathologies in children with congenital heart disease. Standard first-pass (FP) –MRA uses a 3 -dimensional MRA sequence with an extracellular contrast agent, in which spatial resolution is limited by breath-hold duration, and image quality (IQ) is limited by motion artifacts. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the diagnostic confidence, IQ, and image artifacts of standard FP-MRA to a high-resolution, motion compensated steady-state (SS) –MRA of the thoracic vasculature in children and adolescents with congenital heart disease using a blood-pool contrast agent (<b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium). SS-MRA of the thoracic vasculature (technically successful in 90 % of patients) offers superior diagnostic confidence and IQ compared with FP-MRA and shows fewer motion-related image artifacts. In addition, SS-MRA revealed findings missed by FP-MRA. Therefore, SS-MRA may prove specifically beneficial for imaging of thoracic vessels that are small and/or subject to motion...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim was (i) to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of equilibrium-phase high spatial resolution (EP) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) at 1. 5 T using a blood pool contrast agent for the preoperative evaluation of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator branches (DIEP), and (ii) to compare image quality with conventional first-pass CE-MRA. Methods: Twenty-three consecutive patients were included. All patients underwent preoperative CE-MRA to determine quality and location of DIEP. First-pass imaging after a single bolus injection of 10 mL <b>gadofosveset</b> trisodium was followed by EP imaging. MRA data were compared to intra-operative findings, which served as the reference standard. Results: There was 100 % agreement between EP CE-MRA and surgical findings in identifying the single best perforator branch. All EP acquisitions were of diagnostic quality, whereas in 10 patients {{the quality of the}} first-pass acquisition was qualified as non-diagnostic. Both signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher for EP imaging in comparison with first-pass acquisitions (p, 0. 01). Conclusions: EP CE-MRA of DIEP in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing a breast reconstruction procedure is highly accurate in identifying the single best perforator branch at 1. 5 Tesla (T). Besides accuracy, image quality of EP imagin...|$|E
40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential of visualizing chronic myocardial infarction in patients using the intravascular CA MS- 325 (<b>gadofosveset,</b> EPIX Pharmaceuticals, Mass, USA). Methods. Nine patients were enrolled in a clinical phase II multicenter trial for MRCA and perfusion imaging using MS- 325. They had objective evidence of chronic myocardial infarction as visualized by previously performed late gadolinium (Gd) enhancement imaging (LGE) with a conventional extracellular Gd-DTPA CA (Magnevist, Bayer Healthcare, Germany, 0. 2 [*]mmol/kg/body weight) serving as reference standard. A prepulse-optimized LGE study was performed immediately and at several time points after injection of MS- 325 (0. 05 [*]mmol/kg/body weight). The number and localization of segments demonstrating LGE with MS- 325 as well as signal intensities were compared with the reference standard (Gd-DTPA). Results. Using MS- 325, LGE could be detected at every time point in all 9 patients. The accuracy of LGE with MS- 325 as compared to LGE with Gd-DTPA was highest 54 ± 4 minutes after contrast injection, resulting in a sensitivity of 84 % with a specificity of 98 %. Conclusion. The intravascular CA MS- 325 has the potential to visualize chronic myocardial infarction. However, in comparison with Gd-DTPA, the transmural extent and the number of segments are smaller...|$|E
