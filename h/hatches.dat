5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow <b>hatches</b> to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, <b>hatches</b> must be large, but large <b>hatches</b> present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the <b>hatches,</b> and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBased on the {{analysis}} of 11 morphometric variables of body (total length, body area and perimeter, myotome height and eye diameter) and yolk sac (length, height, area, perimeter and volume) of pike larvae, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate how larval size at <b>hatching</b> and growth of larvae <b>hatched</b> from single egg batches vary according to three <b>hatching</b> times: early, mid and late. <b>Hatching</b> time structures strongly pike larval morphometrics. Early <b>hatched</b> larvae have smaller body sizes at <b>hatch,</b> faster growth and higher yolk use efficiency than late <b>hatched</b> ones. Early <b>hatched</b> larvae seem to be premature and <b>hatch</b> at precocious developmental stage whereas late <b>hatched</b> individuals continue their growth within the egg shell and <b>hatch</b> at larger size but with lower reserves (yolk). A compensatory growth phase was observed for the early <b>hatching</b> pike larvae particularly during the first 5 days post <b>hatch.</b> Consequently, no significant difference in body parameters was recorded from day 10 post <b>hatching</b> whatever the <b>hatching</b> time. The higher growth accomplished by early <b>hatched</b> larvae may be related to a particular metabolic activity that converts more efficiently yolk into body tissues...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated <b>hatching</b> {{is one of}} few defences {{available}} to embryos, and is effective against many egg-stage risks. We present the first analysis of genetic variation in <b>hatching</b> plasticity, examining premature <b>hatching</b> of American toad embryos in response to pathogenic water moulds. We reared eggs from half- and full-sib families in the presence and absence of water mould. <b>Hatching</b> age and hatchling size showed low cross-environment genetic correlations, suggesting that early-induced <b>hatching</b> can evolve largely independently of spontaneous <b>hatching.</b> We found less phenotypic and additive genetic variation for early-induced <b>hatching</b> than spontaneous <b>hatching,</b> and a stronger correlation between egg and induced hatchling sizes. Directional selection by the pathogen may have eroded variation in early-induced <b>hatching,</b> pushing it against the constraint of <b>hatching</b> gland development.

40|$|International audienceSize, {{caloric value}} and {{chemical}} composition were measured separately in the progeny of two northern pike (Esox lucius) females at 3 -day intervals during the endogenous feeding period from <b>hatching</b> to final yolk resorption. Tissue, yolk and entire larvae were analysed separately in {{three groups of}} larvae that <b>hatched</b> at different times (between 88 and 106 degree-days post-fertilization). An integrated approach with the Gompertz model was used to compute the yolk conversion efficiency and time to maximum tissue size in early, mid and late <b>hatched</b> larvae. At <b>hatching,</b> unresorbed yolk of early <b>hatched</b> larvae contained more energy (39. 20 J) and more protein (0. 99 mg) compared to the yolk of larvae that <b>hatched</b> later (38. 13 J and 0. 92 mg protein for late <b>hatched</b> larvae, p < 0. 05). In contrast, {{a significant reduction in}} tissue weight (- 0. 7 mg DW) and protein content (- 0. 5 mg) was found in early <b>hatched</b> larvae compared to those which <b>hatched</b> later (p < 0. 05). Between days 9 and 12 post-hatching (108 and 144 degree-days post-hatching), close to the final yolk resorption, late <b>hatched</b> larvae stopped growing and their tissue began to be resorbed. This tissue resorption time was delayed in early <b>hatched</b> larvae which presented {{at the end of the}} experiment a greater tissue weight than late <b>hatched</b> ones. Yolk conversion efficiency in term of energy from <b>hatching</b> to complete yolk resorption stage was significantly higher for early and mid <b>hatched</b> larvae (51 %) compared to late <b>hatched</b> ones (44 %) (p = 0. 004). Furthermore, the time to maximum tissue size was found to be negatively related to <b>hatching</b> time which implies that early <b>hatched</b> larvae take longer time to switch from one developmental stage to the next. The maximum tissue dry weight and energy content were found to be reached at approximately the same age post-fertilization for both early <b>hatched</b> and late <b>hatched</b> larvae, suggesting that the principal steps in a fish's lifespan are better correlated with time of fertilization than <b>hatching</b> time...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Within certain {{limitations}} of timing, embryos {{of one of}} the two species, Bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) and Japanese quail (Cotumix cotumix japonica), influ-enced the <b>hatching</b> time of embryos of the other species when embryonating eggs of the two species were in contact during the latter stages of incubation. When the expected <b>hatching</b> time of Bobwhite quail was approximately three days later than that of Japanese quail, neither species exerted a significant influence over the <b>hatching</b> time of the other. Virtual synchroniza-tion of <b>hatching</b> time was achieved when Japanese quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> approxi-mately two days ahead of Bobwhite quail and was accomplished by a significant speeding-up of <b>hatching</b> time of the Bobwhite quail coupled with a significant retarding of <b>hatching</b> time of the Japanese quail. Synchronization occurred where Japanese quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> approximately one day ahead of Bobwhite quail; however, in this case, the synchronization was achieved solely by a significant retarding of <b>hatching</b> time of the Japanese quail. When eggs of the two species were set at such a time that they were expected to <b>hatch</b> at approximately the same time, synchronization of <b>hatching</b> time was easily achieved. Where Bobwhite quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> approximately one day ahead of Japanese quail, sycnhronization of <b>hatching</b> time was not achieved even though <b>hatching</b> time of the Japanese quail was sig-nificantly speeded-up. Where Bobwhite quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> two days ahead of Japanese quail, neither species exerted a significant influence over the <b>hatching</b> time of the other...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hatching</b> {{care has}} been {{reported}} for many taxonomic groups, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The sophisticated care that occurs around <b>hatching</b> time {{is expected to have}} an adaptive function supporting the feeble young. However, details of the characteristics of the adaptive function of <b>hatching</b> care remain unclear. This study investigated the <b>hatching</b> care of the subsocial shield bug, Parastrachia japonensis (Heteroptera: Parastrachiidae) to verify its function. Results show that the P. japonensis mothers vibrated the egg mass intermittently while maintaining an egg-guarding posture. Then embryos started to emerge from their shells synchronously. Unlike such behaviors of closely related species, this vibrating behavior was faint, but lasted more than 6 h. To investigate the effect of this behavior on <b>hatching</b> synchrony and <b>hatching</b> success, we observed the <b>hatching</b> pattern and the <b>hatching</b> rate in control, mother-removed, and two artificial vibration groups. Control broods experienced continuous guarding from the mother. Intermittent artificial vibration broods were exposed to vibrations that matched the temporal pattern of maternal vibration produced by a motor. They showed synchronous <b>hatching</b> patterns and high <b>hatching</b> rates. However, for mother-removed broods, which were isolated from the mother, and when we provided continuous artificial vibration that did not match the temporal pattern of the maternal vibration, embryo <b>hatching</b> was not only asynchronous: some embryos failed to emerge from their shells. These results lead us to infer that <b>hatching</b> care in P. japonensis has two functions: <b>hatching</b> regulation and <b>hatching</b> assistance. Nevertheless, severa...|$|R
