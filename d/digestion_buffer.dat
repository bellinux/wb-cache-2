50|$|Samples are {{prepared}} in a standard, non-reducing loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. No reducing agent or boiling are necessary since these {{would interfere with}} refolding of the enzyme. A suitable substrate (e.g. gelatin or casein for protease detection) {{is embedded in the}} resolving gel during preparation of the acrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the SDS is removed from the gel (or zymogram) by incubation in unbuffered Triton X-100, followed by incubation in an appropriate <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer,</b> for an optimized length of time at 37 °C. The zymogram is subsequently stained (commonly with Amido Black or Coomassie Brilliant Blue), and areas of digestion appear as clear bands against a darkly stained background where the substrate has been degraded by the enzyme.|$|E
5000|$|An {{undesirable}} {{side effect}} {{of the use of}} proteolytic enzymes is the self digestion of the protease. To avoid this, in the past Ca2+-ions were added to the <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer.</b> Nowadays most suppliers offer modified trypsin where selective methylation of the lysines limits the autolytic activity to the arginine cutting sites. Unmodified trypsin has its highest activity between 35°C and 45°C. After the modification, the optimal temperature is changed to the range of 50°C to 55°C. Other enzymes used for in-gel digestion are the endoproteases Lys-C, Glu-C, Asp-N [...] and Lys-N. These proteases cut specifically at only one amino acid e.g. Asp-N cuts n-terminal of aspartic acid. Therefore a lower number of longer peptides is obtained.|$|E
50|$|For the {{digestion}} {{the proteins}} fixed in the matrix of the gel {{have to be}} made accessible for the protease. The permeation of the enzyme to the gel is believed to be facilitated by the dehydration of the gel pieces by treatment with acetonitrile and subsequent swelling in the <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer</b> containing the protease. This procedure relies on the presumption that the protease permeates to the gel by the process of swelling. Different studies about the penetration of the enzymes to the gel showed the process to be almost completely driven by diffusion. The drying of the gel does not seem to support the process. Therefore, the improvement of the in-gel digestion has to be achieved by the reduction {{of the way of the}} enzyme to its substrate e.g. by cutting the gel to pieces as small as possible.|$|E
40|$|Peptide mapping and {{analysis}} using capillary electrophoresis Capillary electrophoresis (CE) {{has proven to}} be a powerful tool in peptide analysis especially for: • protein identification by peptide mapping; • re-analysis of peptide fractions collected by HPLC prior to sequencing; • purity checking of synthetic peptides. This Application Note focuses on the first two areas. The methodological aspects of peptide analysis are described, including the optimization of protein <b>digestion</b> <b>buffers,</b> electrophoretic conditions, reproducibility, detection sensitivity and spectral analysis...|$|R
2500|$|A major {{application}} for ESI is {{the field of}} protein mass spectrometry. Here, the MS {{is used for the}} identification and sizing of proteins. The identification of a protein sample can be done in an ESI-MS by de novo peptide sequencing (using tandem mass spectrometry) or peptide mass fingerprinting. Both methods require the previous digestion of proteins to peptides, mostly accomplished enzymatically using proteases. As well for the digestion in solution as for the in-gel <b>digestion</b> <b>buffered</b> solutions are needed, whose content in salts is too high and in analyte is too low for a successful ESI-MS measurement. Therefore, a combined desalting and concentration step is performed. Usually a reversed phase liquid chromatography is used, in which the peptides stay bound to the chromatography matrix whereas the salts are removed by washing. The peptides can be eluted from the matrix by the use of a small volume of a solution containing a large portion of organic solvent, which results in the reduction of the final volume of the analyte. In LC-MS the desalting/concentration is realised with a pre-column, in off-line measurements reversed phase micro columns are used, which can be used directly with [...] microliter pipettes. Here, the peptides are eluted with the spray solution containing an appropriate portion of organic solvent. The resulting solution (usually a few microliters)is enriched with the analyte and, after transfer to the spray capillary, can be directly used in the MS.|$|R

The viability of three dairy microorganisms Streptococcus thermophilus, Brevibacterium aurantiacum and Hafnia alvei was measured during in vitro and in vivo digestion. S. thermophilus was highly sensitive to gastric stress, and was {{not found in the}} duodenal compartment. B. auranticum was moderately sensitive to gastric stress but resistant to duodenal stress. H. alvei was highly resistant to both stresses. LIVE/DEAD confocal microscopy´s images, probed the effect of low pH on microorganisms survival. However, in vivo analyses (16 S rRNA gene metabarcoding) failed to confirm in vitro observations since tested microorganisms were not detected. Despite of the different evolutions during <b>digestion</b> on <b>buffer</b> capacity, lipolysis, and rheological characteristics, we did not observe any protective effect of the dairy matrices on microorganisms survival...|$|R
50|$|After {{finishing}} the digestion the peptides generated {{in this process}} have to be extracted from the gel matrix. This is accomplished by one or several extraction steps. The gel particles are incubated with an extraction solution and the supernatant is collected. In the first extraction, {{almost all of the}} peptide is recovered, the repetition of the extraction step can increase the yield of the whole process by only 5-10%. To meet the requirements of peptides with different physical and chemical properties an iterative extraction with basic or acidic solutions is performed. For the extraction of acidic peptides a solution similar to the concentration and composition of the <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer</b> is used; basic peptides are extracted in dependence to the intended mass spectrometric method with a low concentrated acidic solution of formic acid for ESI and trifluoroacetic acid for MALDI respectively. Studies on model proteins showed a recovery of approximately 70-80% of the expected peptide yield by extraction from the gel.Many protocols contain an additional fraction of acetonitrile to the extraction solution which, in concentrations above 30% (v/v), is effective in reducing the adsorption of peptides to the surface of reaction tubes and pipette tips. The liquid of the pooled extracts is evaporated in a centrifugal evaporator. If the volatile salt ammonium bicarbonate was used for the basic extraction, it is partially removed in the drying process. The dried peptides can be stored at -20°C for at least six months.|$|E

A sample containing 100 μg of 25 / 45 fraction protein dissolved in 50 μl of protein denaturation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 6 M urea, 4 mM DTT, pH 8.0) was digested at 37 °C with 5 μg of trypsin in 300 μl of <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer</b> (50 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM CaCl 2, pH 7.6). Aliquots containing 20 μg of the 25 / 45 fraction were removed after 0 h (undigested control containing no enzyme), 2 h, 24 h, and 48 h of incubation. Digestion was stopped by adding 3 μl of 50 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to each aliquot and immediately storing the samples at - 80 °C. Digestion with proteinase K (Fisher Scientific, St. Louis, MO) was performed in similar fashion, except that proteinase K was used at a concentration of 0.1 μg/μl in <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer</b> comprising 50 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM CaCl 2, pH 7.5, and digestion was stopped by adding 5 μl of 50 mM PMSF to each 20 μg aliquot. All samples were lyophilized to dryness and then reconstituted in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE through duplicate 18 % resolving gels (15 μl/lane).

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping of telogen phase hairs in particular, and hair shaft in general, is presented. A number of extraction procedures in common use were investigated and the quantities of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) delivered were quantified via a real-time PCR assay. The extracts {{were subjected to}} two variations on AmpFℓST® Profiler Plus™ PCR amplification strategies (extended cycles, two rounds of PCR) and the genotypes compared. Nuclear DNA was found to persist in human hair shafts, albeit at very low levels. Full Profiler Plus™ profiles consistent with the hair donor were obtained from 100 mg hair shaft samples (bleached and unbleached). These were, however, mixed profiles, indicating low copy number (LCN) contamination in the extracts. Single telogen hair clubs and single hair shafts delivered partial profiles with usually only one allele of heterozygous loci. Telogen phase hairs yielded {{the same amount of}} nuDNA (and no more) as hairshafts (either anagen or telogen). Whether hair shafts dissolved or not in lysis buffer had no effect on either the quantitated yield of DNA or on the chance of obtaining a correct genotype. These results provide evidence that genomic DNA resides on the exterior of the hair shaft and we use this information to suggest an optimal procedure for nuDNA extraction from keratinised hair samples: soaking hairs in simple <b>digestion</b> <b>buffers</b> containing Tris–HCl, a salt and a chelating agent without prior cleaning of the hair shafts. It is proposed that cleaning removes most of the recoverable DNA. This procedure was applied to obtain genotypes from 3 cm hair shafts which matched reference profiles from the donors at up to 9 out of 10 AmpFℓST® Profiler Plus™ STR loci. When the genotyping success was measured by counting the number of matches between the two dominant alleles at each locus for each extract with the reference DNA profile of the hair donor, the success was found to be highly dependent on the donor. The number of matching alleles varied between not less than 10 for one donor to no more than two for another donor. These results may well be linked to the environmental experience of the hairs from each donor prior to removal...|$|R

40|$|It was {{previously}} shown that digestion of human IgG 1 /kappa myeloma proteins with pepsin {{in the presence}} of 8 M-urea produces fragments which differ from other proteolytic fragments of IgG, including those produced by peptic <b>digestion</b> in aqueous <b>buffers.</b> The two large urea/pepsin fragments each consist of three peptides, and together account for all of the constant region of the light chains and most of the constant region of the heavy chains. Myeloma proteins of subclasses IgG 2, IgG 3 and IgG 4 with kappa light chains were digested with pepsin in 8 M-urea, and the resulting fragments compared with those produced from IgG 1 /kappa proteins. Gel filtration, starch- and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis have shown that the peptides from each subclass are analogous with those from IgG 1. A brief investigation of the products of urea/pepsin digestion of myeloma proteins with lambda light chains has shown that in these proteins light-chain cleavage occurs at residue leucine- 182, instead of or as well as at residue 117, where cleavage takes place in kappa chains. Comparison of sequences around sites of urea/pepsin cleavage has shown that pepsin has quite restricted specificity under these conditions...|$|R

40|$|Microwave-assisted {{proteolytic}} digestion often yields misscleaved peptides, {{attributed to}} incomplete hydrolysis reactions between enzymes and substrates. The number of missed cleavages {{is an important}} parameter in proteome database searching. This study investigates how various factors affect digestion processes. Optimum conditions for microwave-assisted digestion (50 mM Tris buffer, 30 min at 60 °C, and enzyme to protein molar ratio of 1 : 5) were determined. The digestion products obtained from eight standard proteins were characterized based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Experimental {{results indicate that the}} digestion temperature, reaction time, enzyme to substrate ratio, and <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer</b> affect the number of misscleaved peptides and incomplete digestion percentages. Although all protein molecules in a sample could be digested into peptides within a few minutes under microwave irradiation, longer reaction times or methods to maximize the enzyme activity should be considered if digestion completeness is a major concern...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Monokines are glycoproteins, {{synthesised}} by macrophages, which exert various {{effects on}} the organism. The most important monokines are interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and IL- 6. This paper reports on immunohistochemical techniques developed {{for the detection of}} IL-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α in fixed and paraffin-embedded pig tissues (spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, liver and kidney). Different fixatives (buffered formalin, acetic formalin, paraformadehyde-lysine-periodate and Bouin solution), and antigen unmasking techniques (permeabilisation with Tween 20, pronase enzymatic <b>digestion</b> and microwave-citrate <b>buffer)</b> were used. We describe different protocols for detection of monokines using polyclonal antibodies against the studied monokines. No signal was obtained with monoclonal antibodies against pig-TNF-α and human IL- 1 α. Bouin solution was shown to be the best fixative for immunohistochemical detection of IL- 1 α, TNF-α, and IL- 6, using permeabilisation with Tween 20 as an unmasking antigen method. Acetic formalin was shown to be the best fixative for IL- 1 β detection, not needing antigen retrieval techniques. Macrophages were identified as the main cytokine-producing cells, although other types of cells also stained positively to some cytokines.

Strain differentiation was unsuccessful with the automated ribotyping system, producing a single characteristic EcoRI fingerprint common to all group II strains. RAPD analysis of C. botulinum group II strains was not consistently reproducible with primer OPJ- 6 or OPJ- 13, apparently discriminating between epidemiologically related strains.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of real-time PCR methods, competitive PCR techniques {{continue to play}} an important role in nucleic acid quantification because of the significantly lower cost of equipment and consumables. Here we describe a shifted restriction-site competitive PCR (SRS-cPCR) assay based on a modified type of competitor. The competitor fragments are designed to contain a recognition site for a restriction endonuclease that is also present in the target sequence to be quantified, but in a different position. Upon completion of the PCR, the amplicons are digested in the same tube with a single restriction enzyme, without the need to purify PCR products. The generated competitor- and target-specific restriction fragments display different sizes, and can be readily separated by electrophoresis and quantified by image analysis. Suboptimal digestion affects competitor- and target-derived amplicons to the same extent, thus eliminating the problem of incorrect quantification as a result of incomplete digestion of PCR products. We have established optimized conditions for a panel of 20 common restriction endonucleases permitting efficient <b>digestion</b> in PCR <b>buffer.</b> It is possible, therefore, to find a suitable restriction site for competitive PCR in virtually any sequence of interest.

The waste to be treated was very strong, with a COD of 59 000 mg/l and was almost entirely soluble, with a high organic content. Experiments showed that the waste could be treated by the anaerobic submerged filter, with a maximum loading applicable for extended periods of 10 kg COD/(m³day), based on the void volume of the filter. The reduction in COD effected by the filter at these loadings varied between 40 and 60 % of the applied COD, of which only approximately 70 % was biologically degradable. Loadings of up to 16 kg COD/(m³day) were applied with 40 % COD reduction, but digestion at these loadings seemed unstable and could not be continued for long periods.

One {{of the most striking}} examples is the hairpin ribozyme, which was shown to exhibit two to three orders of magnitude variation in folding kinetics between molecules. Although averaged behavior of single molecules matched the bulk solution data, {{it was not possible to}} exclude rigorously the possibility that the variations around the mean values arose from different ways of interacting with the surface environment. To test this, we minimized the molecules’ interaction with the surface by encapsulating DNA or RNA molecules inside 100 - to 200 -nm diameter unilamellar vesicles, following the procedures described by Haran and coworkers. Vesicles were immobilized on a supported lipid bilayer via biotin-streptavidin linkages. We observed no direct binding of DNA or RNA on the supported bilayer even at concentrations exceeding 100 nM, indicating that these molecules do not bind stably on the membrane. Since the vesicle diameter is smaller than the resolution of optical microscopy, the lateral mobility of the molecules is severely constrained, allowing long observation periods. We used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, nuclease <b>digestion,</b> and external <b>buffer</b> exchange to show that the molecules were indeed encapsulated within the vesicles. When contained within vesicles, the natural form of the hairpin ribozyme exhibited 50 -fold variation in both folding and unfolding rates in 0. 5 mM Mg 2 +, which is identical to what was observed from the molecules tethered directly on the surface. This strongly indicates that the observed heterogeneity in dynamic properties does not arise as an artifact of surface attachment, but is intrinsic to the nature of the molecules...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{are various}} methods of {{processing}} adipose tissue before culture, {{depending on the}} adipose tissue samples. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare several modifications of culturing and sub-culturing procedures of adipose tissue to fit the condition in our laboratory. Method: This is a descriptive study that was done in the Immunology and Endocrinology Integrated Laboratory, University of Indonesia, from  October 2009 to April 2010. Three adipose tissue processing procedures, various amount of seeding and two subculture methods were compared in term of cell yield and time needed. In the first procedure, collagenase- 1 digestion was done in 30 minutes, cell seeding were 24, 000 and 36, 000 per flask; in the second procedure, collagenase- 1 digestion was done in 60 minutes, cell seeding were 24, 000, 48, 000, and 72, 000 per flask; and in the third procedure, the adipose tissue remnants from the first  procedure were again digested for another 45 minutes, cell seeding were 74, 000, and 148, 000 per flask. Difference in subculture methods were the presence or absence of washing step. Result: Procedure 1 yielded the lowest amount of cell, and after culture, the cells grew very slow, and was contaminated before harvest of primary culture. Procedure- 2 and - 3 succeeded to yield primary cultures. Some of the cultures were contaminated, so that further subculture was not  applicable, and only one tissue processing procedure (procedure 2 : 60 minute collagenase- 1 <b>digestion,</b> without lysis <b>buffer,</b> cell seeding 48, 000 and 72, 000) could complete the three subcultures. Though some of the procedures could not be completed, final result could be concluded. Conclusion: In this preliminary study, 60 minute colagenase- 1 digestion with intermittent shaking every 5 minutes and cell seeding around 50, 000 or more, followed by subculture method without washing step gave the best result.

40|$|A {{reproducible}} {{technique for}} fixation of tissue, RNA extraction and reverse transcription {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) analysis from paraffin-embedded leprosy biopsies, has been developed and used to study the mRNA profiles. This approach is valuable in retrospective analysis of gene expression, and the handling of infectious biopsy material is also minimized. Among the methods of RNA extraction compared, the most efficient method {{was found to be}} incubation of the tissue sections in <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer</b> followed by extraction with Trizol. The experimental conditions were optimized for first strand cDNA synthesis and PCR, and used to measure the quantity of cytokine transcripts in biopsy materials. Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) mRNA was detectable in all cases examined, which correlates well with other earlier reports using frozen tissues. However, IL- 5 transcripts were present in 60 % of the biopsies, unlike the earlier reports which showed IL- 5 mRNA in all LL cases. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) mRNA was detected in 80 % of the biopsies, and this confirmed earlier immuno-cytochemical data which showed TGF-beta protein in all cases. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA was found in about 60 % of the biopsies; whereas interferon gamma mRNA was detected in 30 % of the LL cases. In conclusion, the results obtained in our study confirm and extend earlier observations which examined cytokines in peripheral blood cells and dermal lesions of leprosy. The simplicity of this method would allow the examination {{of a large number of}} samples across the spectrum of leprosy...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased lipoprotein(a) is a {{risk factor}} for atherosclerosis, and its {{concentration}} in serum is inversely correlated with the size of the apoliprotein(a) [apo(a) ] component. The size of the apo(a) gene is determined mainly by the Kringle IV size polymorphism. We have optimized and characterized pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for apo(a) genotyping. METHODS: Established PFGE protocols were adjusted. The changes included the following: (a) increased DNA yields by the use of all leukocytes for isolation from either 3 mL of fresh EDTA whole blood or 250 microL of frozen buffy coats; (b) increased efficiency of Kpn 1 digestion by the inclusion of a <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer</b> wash; (c) reduction of assay time by the use of capillary blotting; (d) increased sensitivity by the use of four digoxigenin-labeled apo(a) probes; and (e) identification using a single film by the inclusion of a digoxigenin-labeled lambda marker probe in addition to apo(a) probes in the hybridization mix. RESULTS: In older Caucasians, 93 % (buffy coats, n= 468) were heterozygous for apo(a) gene size. An inverse correlation between serum lipoprotein(a) and the sum of Kringle IV alleles was found (y = - 23 x + 1553; r = - 0. 442; n = 468). Gel-to-gel variation was minimal (3 %). Imprecision (SD) was one Kringle IV repeat (control sample containing eight fragments of 72 - 233 kb; n= 34 electrophoretic runs). CONCLUSIONS: The practicality and sensitivity of the apo(a) genotyping technique by PFGE were improved, and accuracy and reproducibility were preserved. The optimized procedure is promising for apo(a) genotyping on frozen buffy coats from large epidemiological studies...|$|E

O isolamento de protoplastos de Magnaporthe grisea foi facilitado com Novozym 234, contudo, este complexo enzimático encontra-se indisponível no mercado. Assim, objetivou-se comparar a eficiência de enzimas líticas disponíveis comercialmente na obtenção de protoplastos de M. grisea. Paralelamente, analisaram-se estabilizadores osmóticos, tempos de digestão e freqüência de regeneração. Maior produção de protoplastos foi obtida com o uso simultâneo de Lysing Enzymes e Cellulase Onozuka R- 10. O uso de 10 ou 15 mg de cada complexo enzimático, em 3 mL de estabilizador osmótico, resultou em maior liberação de protoplastos. O melhor estabilizador osmótico foi MgSO 4 1, 2 M / NaH 2 PO 4 0, 01 M, pH 5, 8, seguido por MgSO 4 0, 8 M / NaH 2 PO 4 0, 01 M, pH 5, 8. O isolamento de protoplastos foi monitorado a cada 60 minutos, atingindo o máximo após incubação por 3 a 6 horas.

40|$|Matrix metallo-proteases {{constitute}} {{a family of}} extracellular zinc-dependent endopeptidases {{that are involved in}} degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and other bioactive non-ECM molecules. A plethora of studies have implicated important roles for MMPs in many diseases (including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases) and normal biological processes. Our understanding of the complex roles of MMPs is, however, still limited, which is illustrated by the poor performance of broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors in clinical trials. The regulation of MMP activity by post-translational mechanisms is a complicating factor in MMP biology and pathology, and diminishes the effectiveness of conventional "expression-based" proteomic methods to study MMPs. The ability to profile MMPs based on functionally related activities would greatly facilitate research about their involvement in pathological processes. This thesis describes the development of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based integrated system for the selective detection of active MMPs in complex biological samples. Throughout the thesis, purified recombinant MMP- 12 (catalytic domain) is used as a model enzyme. Chapter 2 demonstrates the feasibility of activity-based MMP- 12 enrichment through batch extractions with an immobilized inhibitor affinity sorbent. A broad-range MMP inhibitor (PLG-NHOH) was immobilized on a Sepharose support with a ligand density of 9. 8 mmol/L. The functionality of the inhibitor after immobilization was demonstrated with batch extractions of MMP- 12 added to buffer, resulting in extraction yields around 97 %. Quantification was done indirectly using an activity assay to determine unbound MMP- 12. Active MMP- 12 could also be selectively extracted when added to serum (after inactivation of the endogenous inhibitor α 2 -macroglobulin with trypsin) at a low level. Experiments with the endogenous inhibitors TIMP- 1 and α 2 -macroglobulin revealed that MMP- 12 extraction is strictly activity-dependent. Chapter 3 considers the automation of the extraction which is needed for on-line coupling to downstream analytical steps. Samples containing MMP- 12 in buffer were extracted at different flow rates using cartridges packed with inhibitor affinity sorbent. Besides faster extractions and a reduced number of manual manipulations, higher extraction yields (98. 9 % - 99. 3 %) were obtained over the whole flow rate range compared to batch extractions. Application of the method to synovial fluid from a rheumatoid arthritis patient followed by gelatin-zymography revealed a strong enrichment of distinct MMPs from this biological sample that were not clearly visible in the original sample. The use of an auto-sampler and a solid-phase extraction (SPE) workstation allowed full automation of the extraction procedure. MMP- 12 extractions were optimized, showing that ligand density is an important factor with a clear extraction yield optimum around 4 to 10 mmol/L. Conditioning of the Sepharose affinity sorbent for 1 week prior to use resulted in a further increase in extraction yield. Under optimal conditions, an extraction yield of 99. 5 % was reached with a cartridge contact time of only 13 s for MMP- 12. The efficacy of the extraction method for activity-based MMP profiling was further improved by the use of a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor with nmol/L affinity (TAPI- 2), which resulted in increased extraction yields for all tested MMPs. Extraction yields ranging from 98. 8 % to 99. 8 % were obtained for MMP- 1, - 7, - 8, - 10, - 12, and - 13, while for MMP- 9 (full length and catalytic domain) extraction yields of 96. 1 % and 98. 4 % were reached (all at a cartridge contact time of 19 s). This effective enrichment of MMPs illustrates the possibility to enrich from dilute samples with low levels of endogenous MMPs. In Chapter 4, we investigated the chemical modification (acetylation) of immobilized trypsin (on a Sepharose and a polystyrene support) for enhanced digestion efficacy in integrated protein analysis platforms. Complete digestion of cytochrome c was obtained with modified-trypsin beads with a contact time of only 4 sec, while corresponding unmodified-trypsin beads gave incomplete digestion. The digestion rate of myoglobin, a protein known to be rather resistant to proteolysis, was not altered by acetylating trypsin and required a buffer containing 35 % acetonitrile to obtain complete digestion. The use of acetylated-trypsin beads led to fewer interfering tryptic autolysis products, indicating an increased stability of this modified enzyme. Importantly, the modification did not affect trypsin's substrate specificity, as the peptide map of myoglobin was not altered upon acetylation of immobilized trypsin. Kinetic digestion experiments in solution with low-molecular-weight substrates and with cytochrome c confirmed the increased catalytic efficiency (lower KM and higher kcat and increased resistance to autolysis of trypsin upon acetylation. Because of the increased trypsin activity, the digestion rate is enhanced, which facilitates on-line digestion of low-abundance proteins with higher yields and in less time. These are favourable properties of the modified trypsin reactor and should make it a valuable tool in automated protein analysis systems. Chapter 5 deals with the implementation of the extraction and the digestion cartridge into an integrated system for automated, activity-based profiling of MMPs. Enrichment was followed by on-line digestion in an immobilized acetylated trypsin reactor. Hyphenation of the sample pre-treatment steps to a nanoLC-MS system was achieved by loading tryptic MMP- 12 peptides on a reversed-phase trap column, followed by backflush elution to a 50 -µm reversed-phase silica-based monolith capillary column coupled to a nanoESI interface and an ion trap mass spectrometer. The use of non-ionic surfactants in the sample pre-treatment steps resulted in better sensitivity, probably because on-line digestion efficiency is improved and non-specific adsorption is suppressed. The completely automated method is able to analyse a sample every 75 min. Spiking of MMP- 12 at 4 pmol into 500 µL urine resulted in selective detection of tryptic MMP- 12 peptides with high intensities. At sub-pmol MMP- 12 levels the signal dropped strongly, but some tryptic MMP- 12 peptides were still detected at 0. 25 pmol in 100 µL injections (from buffer) with good signal-to-noise ratios. Though the developed system has not been extensively tested with biological samples to detect active endogenous MMPs, several aspects should likely be improved in order to achieve this. One important limiting factor in obtaining low or sub-fmol sensitivity is probably the rate of digestion in the trypsin reactor. Despite the relatively high concentration of immobilized trypsin and the chemical modification, the digestion rate is still limited by the protein substrate concentration (due to Michaelis-Menten kinetics). The use of support materials with less diffusional transport limitations such as monolithic materials in both the enrichment and the digestion step will likely result in improved digestion rates at low MMP concentrations. Captured MMPs can be eluted from a monolithic extraction cartridge in a smaller volume and thus be digested at higher concentration in digestion reactor, resulting in improved digestion kinetics. Reduced diffusional transport limitation in the trypsin reactor may also contribute to a further improvement of the digestion kinetics at low MMP concentrations. Digestion kinetics may also be further improved through the investigation of other types of chemical modifications of immobilized trypsin. Hydrophilic protein modifications generally result in an enhanced thermal stability and may permit the use of elevated digestion temperatures to achieve faster digestion kinetics. A decreased binding of hydrophobic peptides to immobilized trypsin, resulting in higher peptide yields and a lower carry-over is an additional advantage of hydrophilic modifications. Chapter 5 demonstrated a positive effect of non-ionic surfactant additions to the extraction and <b>digestion</b> <b>buffers</b> on the mass spectrometric MMP- 12 peptide signals. Yet, higher levels of these surfactants have an adverse effect on the effective capacity (due to overloading) of the reversed-phase trap column and will pollute the ESI interface. The option to include an ion-exchange step, either on- or off-line to wash away high levels of surfactant prior to reversed-phase trapping, should thus be a subject of further research. Care must to be taken, however, not to introduce too many system steps, which would result in high system complexity accompanied by low robustness. Validation (LOD, LOQ, day-to-day and intra-day variation) of the integrated analytical system should be performed before application to clinical studies, once the system has been further optimized. The aspect of quantification of detected MMPs should also be addressed in future research. To correct for different yields of the different steps, ideally an internal standard with a known concentration, added to the biological sample, should be used. This can be achieved by using isotopically labelled MMPs (produced by expression in a host organism which is grown on 15 N-enriched medium). To broaden the applicability of the developed system to a more diverse group of metallo-proteases, the use of affinity sorbents with a cocktail of immobilized metallo-protease inhibitors targeting different types of enzymes can be investigated. Through the use of affinity sorbents targeting completely different protein classes (of low abundance), the developed system can be potentially applied {{in a wide range of}} studies. The requirement for different elution conditions with each type of affinity sorbent affects the on-line coupling with the digestion reactor and is the main step which needs to be evaluated before the system can be used to analyse other protein classes. Digestion reactors with immobilized proteases, other than trypsin, may be required to ensure elution-digestion compatibility. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the microsatellite alterations in phenotypically normal esophageal squamous epithelium and meta plasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence. METHODS: Forty-one specimens {{were obtained from}} esophageal cancer (EC) patients. Histopathological assessment identified 23 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 18 adenocarcinomas (ADC), including only 8 ADC with Barrett esophageal columnar epithelium (metaplasia) and dysplasia adjacent to ADC. Paraffin-embedded normal squamous epithelium, Barrett esophageal columnar epithelium (metaplasia), dysplasia and esophageal tumor tissues were dissected from the surrounding tissues under microscopic guidance. DNA was extracted using proteinase K <b>digestion</b> <b>buffer,</b> and DNA was diluted at 1 : 100, 1 : 1000, 1 : 5000, 1 : 10000 and 1 : 50000, respectively. Seven microsatellite markers (D 2 S 123, D 3 S 1616, D 3 S 1300, D 5 S 346, D 17 S 787, D 18 S 58 and BATRII loci) were used in this study. Un-dilution and dilution polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed, and microsatellite analysis was carried out. RESULTS: No statistically {{significant difference was found}} in microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of un-diluted DNA between SCC and ADC. The levels of MSI and LOH were high in the meta plasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma sequence of diluted DNA. The more the diluted DNA was, the higher the rates of MSI and LOH were at the above 7 loci, especially at D 3 S 1616, D 5 S 346, D 2 S 123, D 3 S 1300 and D 18 S 58 loci. CONCLUSION: The sequence of metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma is associated with microsatellite alterations, including MSI and LOH. The MSI and LOH may be the early genetic events during esophageal carcinogenesis, and genetic alterations at the D 3 S 1616, D 5 S 346 and D 3 S 123 loci {{may play a role in}} the progress of microsatellite alterations.
