5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included <b>hardwood</b> <b>floors,</b> crown molding, windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Environmental impacts {{associated}} with building materials are under increasing scrutiny in the US. A gate-to-gate life-cycle inventory (LCI) of solid strip and solid plank <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> production {{was conducted in}} the eastern US for the reporting year 2006. Survey responses from <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturing facilities in this region accounted for nearly 28 % of total US solid <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> production for that year. This study examined the materials, fuels, and energy required to produce solid <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring,</b> coproducts, and the emissions to air, land, and water. SimaPro software was used to quantify the environmental impacts {{associated with}} the reported materials use and emissions. Impact data were allocated on their mass contribution to all product and coproduct production of 1. 0 m 3 (oven-dry mass basis) of solid <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring.</b> Carbon flow and transportation data are provided {{in addition to the}} LCI data. Results of this study are useful for creating a cradle-to-gate inventory when linked to LCIs for the hardwood forest resource and the production of solid hardwood lumber in the same region...|$|R

25|$|The {{building}} {{was owned by}} actress Pia Zadora for several years. The store's closure resulted in a redevelopment opportunity, and the City of Dallas acquired the building for $3.4 million in 1999. Post Properties then leased the building {{from the city and}} converted the historic structure into 143 loft apartments, featuring <b>hardwood</b> <b>floors</b> and a rooftop sky terrace.

25|$|Due to its {{location}} amongst the earthworks of the fort, the barracks {{has become a}} centrepiece of Fort Malden. The building was designed based on the simple, standardized military bungalow layout of the 1800s. This prominent building stands out amongst {{the rest of the}} fort structures due to its long, rectangular shape, as well as its distinctive red brick exterior. Large bay windows along the entranceway compliment the front porch and wooden doors. As this building was part of the restoration process that took place over the late twentieth century, its interior layout has been altered with refinished <b>hardwood</b> <b>floors</b> and additions to all three sections of the core of the building. The restoration also included the reconstruction of chimneys, doors, and windows.|$|E

The rooms featured <b>hardwood</b> <b>floors,</b> marble fireplaces, and detailed cast-plaster crown molding. Originally the penthouse apartment was to be for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife but Wanamaker died in 1928 before the building was completed. Rodman Wanamaker's wife lived there only briefly, as {{she did not like}} the ringing bell in the tower overhead. The penthouse floors were converted to office use in 2000 by creative agency Red Tettemer + Partners. The firm Agoos/Lovera Architects modernized the basic office space on the 24th floor while preserving the ornate molding and materials that decorate the rest of the former penthouse space.|$|E
500|$|The Alumnae Gymnasium was {{designed}} in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. While Tubby's original designs had called for the building to be constructed from stone, the revised plans he submitted in February 1889 replaced that stone with red brick. The structure stands two stories tall and features on its southwestern corner a rounded tower. Inlaid high into the patterned brickwork of its walls were Diocletian windows which originally served to provide light to the swimming pool while preventing passersby from seeing into the swimming area. The pool itself was lined with marble and fed by an artesian well [...] deep. The room that would later become the Aula featured a fireplace adorned with terra cotta and raftered ceilings [...] high. Recent renovations have returned the Aula space to its original state, with visible rafters, terra cotta accents, and <b>hardwood</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|E

40|$|A nation–wide {{survey of}} <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> {{manufacturers}} {{was conducted in}} the spring of 1998. The objectives of the study were to determine the differences in beliefs towards certification between certified and non–certified <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturers and to explore the decision to certify and the implications of that decision. Those objectives were chosen because certification is a developing phenomenon of which there are some aspects that remain unknown. The survey consisted of a mail questionnaire that was sent to more than 250 <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturers. The questionnaire was used to collect demographic and attitudinal information from the respondents about certification. The second part of the research used the Analytic Hierarchy Process to model the decision process <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturers go through when deciding whether or not to certify. Data were collected as part of the mail questionnaire.

2500|$|The [...] "Old Dorms" [...] {{refer to}} four {{original}} purpose-built student housing structures {{to the immediate}} north of Westlands in what is frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "central campus". Dudley Lawrence, one of the sons of William and Sarah Lawrence, achieved the remarkable feat of constructing three of these buildings in one year (1926–1927). The halls were designed by William Augustus Bates, who repeated the Neo-Tudor style of Westlands through the use of stone and timber materials, and mansard roofs. [...] The interiors are also in keeping with the English Tudor architectural style found on most of the older buildings in the area, with thick plaster walls, <b>hardwood</b> <b>floors,</b> and leaded windows (since replaced with more energy-efficient double-pane windows). MacCracken, built a few years later than the other three, is situated to the south of Dudley Lawrence. The original elegant living rooms that were found in each building, excepting MacCracken, are now used as classrooms.|$|E
2500|$|The 19th Ward is a {{southwest}} neighborhood {{bordered by}} Genesee Street, West Avenue, the Erie Canal, and {{is across the}} river from the University of Rochester. Now known by its slogan [...] "Urban by Choice", in the early 19th century the area was known as Castle Town, after Castle Inn, a tavern run by Colonel Isaac Castle. By the early 1820s, however, the area became overshadowed by developments in the north that would later become downtown Rochester. Due to a tumultuous bend in the Genesee river, the area was home to skilled boatsmen that assisted boats traveling north to Rochester and the area was consequently known during this time as [...] "The Rapids". In the 1890s, as Rochester expanded, the area became a prosperous residential area that thrived as the city grew. By 1930 it was a booming residential area for doctors, lawyers, and skilled workers; it includes the still prestigious Sibley Tract development. Homes in the originally upper-class neighborhood typically have gumwood trim, leaded glass, fireplaces, <b>hardwood</b> <b>floors,</b> and open porches. In the 1960s, property values declined as the population of Rochester did, the area experienced white flight accelerated by school busing, blockbusting, and race riots downtown, and crime increased, with violence, drug use, and neglected property further diminishing property values.|$|E

This paper finds the energy and emissions for recovering softwood framing lumber and <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> from an old house for installation in a new house. Recovering wood displaces primary production of new wood products and avoids the end-of-life (EOL) burdens for the old house. We used a cradle-to-gate life cycle analysis and examined the EOL burdens for the wood products when disposed of including the effect of biogenic CO 2. Results showed that recovering softwood framing lumber and <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> for reuse consumed 320 and 761 MJ/m 3 while displacing primary production energy of 6, 467 and 7, 763 MJ/m 3, respectively. Burning wood for energy at EOL avoided coal power production. GWP increased by two to four times when including biogenic CO 2.
