50|$|Two {{processes}} {{influencing the}} functionality of a filter are ripening and regeneration.At {{the beginning of}} a new <b>filter</b> <b>run,</b> the filter efficiency increases simultaneously with the number of captured particles in the medium. This process is called filter ripening. During filter ripening the effluent might not meet quality criteria and must be reinjected at previous steps in the plant. Regeneration methods allow the reuse of the filter medium. Accumulated solids from the filter bed are removed. During backwashing, water (and air) is pumped backwards through the filter system. Backwash water may partially be reinjected in front of the filter process and generated sewage needs to be discarded. The backwashing time is determined by either the turbidity value behind the filter, which must not exceed a set threshold, or by the head loss across the filter medium, which must also not exceed a certain value.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{filtration}} and {{the effects}} of pre-ozonation on direct filtration performance were evaluated and compared with conventional water treatment performance in a pilot plant study. Performance measures including coagulant demand, turbidity, colour, total organic carbon, head loss development, <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time, back wash water consumption, filtration solids volume and iron and manganese were examined for a water source with low turbidity and high organic matter content. The optimal coagulant dosage established for in-line direct filtration was much lower than that required for conventional treatment of the same raw water. Direct filtration preceded by ozonation achieved similar, or substantially higher, turbidity removal efficiencies with a significantly lower alum coagulant dosage. Pre-ozonation was effective in lowering turbidity, colour, head loss development and iron and manganese levels but was not significant in removing TOC. Pre-ozonation increased <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time by about 7 % when compared with the case of no ozonation treatment. The back wash consumption was 5 % of total water produced and solids volume produced by coagulation and direct filtration alone was 8 % of the back wash water used.

Coagulation properties of secondary wastewater effluent, such as optimum coagulation pH, coagulation efficiency for turbidity and color and size distribution of floc particles, were almost the same when alum and PAC were used as coagulants. The optimum pH range for coagulation of turbidity and color with aluminum coagulants were 4. 5 - 6. 0, and with ferric chloride 3. 5 - 4. 5. Ferric iron coagulant had the same effects on coagulation of turbidity and floc formation as aluminum coagulants, but had higher effect on coagulation of color. The over-all removal efficiency for turbidity as well as color and the run length of the filter were almost the same and decreased with an increase in filtration rate when aluminum coagulants were used. The other hand, the efficiency did not change with filtration rate and the decrease in <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> length with filtration rate was smaller when ferric iron coagulant was used.

40|$|Granular media {{filtration}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} complicated water treatment processes to operate and design. There are currently no bench scale tests which can accurately predict the performance of filters over the course of a <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> and therefore pilot plant trials should be carried out whenever filters are to be designed or modified in any way. However, the costs of pilot plant trials are often prohibitive. This paper describes the design and operation of a pilot filtration plant for an investigation into the performance of various filter designs at higher filtration rates. In this study, maintaining a constant filtration rate over the course of the <b>filter</b> <b>run,</b> even in the absence of an operator, was particularly important. All the filter designs evaluated in this study were supposed to maintain a constant filtration rate while the water level above the filter media also remained constant. In practice, this required a valve on the filter effluent to open gradually over the course of a run as the filter bed clogged up. Commercially available control valves are generally too large for pilot plant applications. Furthermore, including any kind of electronic or hydraulic system to operate the valve substantially increases the cost of the plant. In this study, the authors were able to develop a cheap and simple rate control system to maintain the required filtration rates and filter level. The design and operation of this device is described along with other aspects of the plant hydraulics...|$|E

Methods for {{the combination of these}} information sources are summarised under the keyword data assimilation. The report covers fundamentals and methodological development for the assimilation of the operational air quality measurements into the chemistry transportation model REM/Calgrid. The results are concentration fields consisting of both {{observations and}} modelling results, which can be used in air quality assessment. The optimum interpolation and Kalman filter are techniques of data assimilation and are based on the theory of spatial stochastic processes. An equipment is developed in order to adapt these methods to the heterogeneous characteristics the air quality measurements. The report starts with an introduction and an extensive literature survey over data assimilation and mapping of air quality data. Three different covariance models for the optimum interpolation are developed in order to describe the heterogeneous and temporally variable spatially covarance structure of ozone, NO_ 2, NO, SO_ 2 and PM 10. Thereby, different air quality regimes are considered. The empirically estimated covariance models were compared with the dynamic modelled covariance models of a Kalman <b>filter</b> <b>run.</b> In a further step the spatial representativeness of individual measuring stations is determined by the comparison with surrounding measurements.

40|$|Biologically active filters, or {{biological}} filters, remove particles and harness the metabolic capacity of bacteria attached to filtration media, {{in the form}} of a biofilm, to metabolize biodegradable organic matter (BOM). Pilot-scale biological filtration experiments were carried out at the Mannheim Water Treatment Plant in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada to evaluate the impact of capping material selection and nutrient amendments for granular activated carbon (GAC) filters, on both traditional and biological filtration performance parameters. Traditional filtration parameters included filter effluent turbidity, head loss development, and <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time. Biological filtration performance was evaluated by total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) removal. The top 20 cm layer of GAC (d 10 = 1. 3 mm) was replaced by a capping material with a larger effective size in three of the five pilot-scale filter columns—such use of capping layers in rapid biological filtration for drinking water treatment has not been reported previously. The capping materials that were investigated were an expanded clay (EC) aggregate (d 10 = 1. 7 mm) and a plastic “pinwheel” style medium (diameter = 2. 5 cm). A stoichiometric carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C:N:P) ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 is most commonly referenced in the drinking water industry as being ideal for microbial growth in distribution systems and biological filters. The nutrient amendment experiments studied the impact of amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 and 100 : 20 : 2, in a systematic and controlled manner. The monitoring and experimental program was conducted over 14 months to account for seasonal water quality and temperature effects. The results of this study have several implications for optimizing the design and operation of biological filters for drinking water treatment. The capping materials delayed terminal head loss by 10 - 40 hours, compared to the control GAC filter, and significantly reduced the rate of head loss accumulation at all temperature ranges without negatively impacting filter effluent turbidity or BOM removal. There were no significant differences in <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time at cold water conditions between each of the filter configurations; however, both capping layers extended <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time at warm water conditions. Replacing a relatively small layer of media with one that has a larger effective size can lead to more robust filter operation. At cold water conditions, amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 or 100 : 20 : 2 of the GAC or EC capped filters did not yield significant differences in either traditional {{or biological}} filtration performance. The observed reduction of SRP and no reduction in NH 3 -N concentrations suggest that the system was phosphorus limited but not nitrogen limited; however, the performance of the filters was not nutrient limited. The maximum stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of consumed nutrients by the biological filters was 100 : 0 : 10; thus, it was concluded that a C:N:P ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 was not optimal for performance enhancement at cold water conditions. At warm water conditions, amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of the GAC filter to either 100 : 10 : 1 or 100 : 20 : 2 did not yield any improvements in traditional or biological filtration performance. Reductions in the NH 3 -N and SRP concentrations at the effluent of the nutrient-amended GAC filter suggests that it was both nitrogen and phosphorus limited, but not with respect to operational performance or BOM removal. Amending the influent stoichiometric C:N:P ratio to 100 : 10 : 1 of the EC capped filter led to a significant increase in its <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time, while increasing the influent ratio to 100 : 20 : 2 improved both <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time and rate of head loss accumulation; however, no improvements in BOM removal were observed. The long length of time required to observe improvements in filter performance at warm water conditions indicates that nutrient enhancement strategies may not be suitable for biological filters that operate in climates that experience short, or no periods of warm water conditions. Similar to the nutrient-amended GAC filter, reductions in the NH 3 -N and SRP concentrations at the effluent of the nutrient-amended EC capped filter suggest that it was also nitrogen and phosphorus limited. The observed improvements in performance of the nutrient-amended EC capped filters, but not the GAC filter, suggests that nutrient enhancement strategies can be beneficial but at certain conditions only. The stoichiometric C:N:P ratio of consumed nutrients by the biological filters ranged between 100 : 67. 3 : 6. 0 to 100 : 153. 3 : 7. 4; thus, it was concluded that a C:N:P ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 was not optimal for performance enhancement at warm water conditions. Residual amounts of SRP measured at the effluent of the nutrient-amended filters at all temperature ranges and nutrient dosing rates, suggests that there is a maximum amount of phosphorus can be metabolized by the biological filters. The plastic capped filter outperformed or matched the performance of the nutrient-amended filters in terms of the rate of head loss accumulation and <b>filter</b> <b>run</b> time, without any loss in performance in terms of turbidity trends or DOC removal at cold or warm water conditions. This suggests that using capping materials can be a cost effective way to improve biological filtration hydraulic performance, and is operationally less complicated than a nutrient addition system. However, adding capping layers to existing filters may require modifications to their operation...|$|E
