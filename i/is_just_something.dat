The soundtrack {{also received a}} score of 4.5/5 from Heather Phares of AllMusic. Jørn Tillnes, writing for Soundtrack Geek, highlighted the opening theme as [...] "one of the better main themes for any television series out there. It is epic and massive, and that theme <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> you give yourself up to. It’s that good and can’t be missed." [...] Jonathan Weilbaecher praises the soundtrack as doing [...] "a supreme job mixing emotion with epic, a trick that even the very best {{have a hard time}} with." ...|$|E
500|$|During his {{childhood}} and adolescence, Divine was called [...] "Glenn" [...] by {{his friends and}} family; as an adult, he used the stage name [...] "Divine" [...] as his personal name, telling one interviewer that both [...] "Divine" [...] and [...] "Glenn Milstead" [...] were [...] "both just names. Glenn is the name I was brought up with, Divine is the name I've been using for the past 23 years. I guess it's always Glenn and it's always Divine. Do you mean the character Divine or the person Divine? You see, it gets very complicated. There's the Divine you're talking to now and there's the character Divine, which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I do to make a living. She doesn't really exist at all." [...] At one point he had the name [...] "Divine" [...] officially recognized, as it appeared on his passport, and {{in keeping with his}} personal use of the name, his close friends nicknamed him [...] "Divy".|$|E
500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E

5000|$|Forster {{later said}} of the song, [...] "Grant wrote this. It sounded like a pop song right from the word go. He was a very, very melodic songwriter.

500|$|Itachi has ranked {{high in the}} Weekly Shonen Jump {{popularity}} {{polls for}} the series, continuously placing in the top 10. He was ranked in fifth position in the polls of 2011, his highest ranking to date. The character received generally positive reviews from several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media. IGN reader Jason Van Horn characterized Itachi as [...] "badass" [...] and jokingly mentioned {{that he is a}} character to be afraid of since, in his first fight in the series, he does not make any remarkable move. He found that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> about the cold and numb Itachi," [...] that makes the viewer [...] "want to breakout in chills". IGN's Charles White liked the episode where the relationship between young Sasuke and Itachi is revealed, and hoped to see more of their past to resolve the mystery of Itachi's character commenting that learning about their [...] "past has been intriguing". NTT customers voted him as their tenth favorite black haired male anime character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Itachi as one of his favorite characters from Naruto.|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting for}} Lasers to be released, Fiasco {{completed}} another album, titled [...] [...] He was unsure if the Food and Liquor II {{would ever be}} released, though he released the song [...] "Go To Sleep" [...] from the record [...] "out of desperation" [...] to put out new music. He also pursued numerous side projects {{in the midst of}} the delay. [...] In April 2010, Fiasco formed the hip hop collective All City Chess Club along with Pharrell, Asher Roth, B.o.B, The Cool Kids, Charles Hamilton, Blu, Diggy Simmons, Wale, J. Cole, & Dosage. [...] The group has so far made one song, a remix of Fiasco's [...] "I'm Beamin". [...] Additionally, On July 16, 2010, Fiasco released his rock side-project Japanese Cartoon's debut EP In The Jaws of the Lords of Death. Japanese Cartoon was influenced by a variety of musical genres, with Fiasco saying, [...] "I've always been a fan of all music...Hip hop <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I actually know how to do but I always had aspirations to participate in other forms of music. Once I got to create some hip hop, it was like, 'Okay, what am I going to do now?' So my artistic side was like, 'Yo, let's do some rock music.'" ...|$|E

About the release, she explained: [...] "I'm not a singer, this <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that I'm {{doing for}} fun. It's not like I'm {{worried about getting}} a chart position or number one, this is purely for fun. Whether people like it or not, I'm doing it." ...|$|E

5000|$|WWE {{professional}} wrestler Seth Rollins previously used a Curb Stomp as his finishing move. Rollins {{said that}} he stopped using the move as [...] "from a PR standpoint... it was too perceptually violent... I never hurt anyone with it.

2500|$|Finally Kurzweil {{addresses}} {{identity with}} futuristic scenarios involving cloning a nonbiological version of someone, or gradually turning that same person into a nonbiological entity one surgery at a time. In {{the first case}} {{it is tempting to}} say the clone is not the original person, because the original person still exists. Kurzweil instead concludes both versions are equally the same person. He explains that an advantage of nonbiological systems is [...] "the ability to be copied, backed up, and re-created" [...] and this <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> people will have to get used to. Kurzweil believes identity [...] "is preserved through continuity of the pattern of information that makes us" [...] and that humans are not bound to a specific [...] "substrate" [...] like biology.|$|E
2500|$|Nobody's Daughter was {{released}} on April 26, 2010 worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received by music critics with moderately positive acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, but noted [...] " [...] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers... She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. But at least she remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E
