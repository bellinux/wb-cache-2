This is the state of marginal instability (MI), a stable equilibrium between forcing by the trade winds (which works to reduce Ri) and turbulence (which works to increase Ri). Besides providing insight into the physics of deep cycle turbulence, MI is easily recognized in moored records of currents and density, and may therefore provide a valuable <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> in historical data where direct turbulence measurements were not made. In this initial study, the seasonal cycle of MI is described. MI is present for 9 months of the year but disappears in March, April, and May, consistent with the recently discovered springtime minimum of equatorial turbulence...|$|E

(May 2014) Burkely Ashton Pettijohn Department of Marine Sciences Texas A&M University Research Advisor: Dr. Ayal Anis Department of Marine Sciences Turbulence {{is a major}} {{mechanism}} for transport of waterborne constituents such as nutrients, pollutants, and sediments, thus, directly controlling sustainability of marine ecosystems. Turbulence activity and its control mechanisms are poorly understood, and measurement of turbulence intensities {{has proven to be}} a cumbersome task. To more clearly understand these physical processes, a suite of sensors were deployed in a threatened bay (La Paz, Mexico) : conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors (CTDs) on a tight mooring line (allowing the construction of density profiles), alongside current profilers, and a free-falling turbulence profiler. Turbulence activity was examined, as well as the contributions to particle transport and mixing. Furthermore, relationships between Thorpe displacements, TL, and dissipation rates of turbulence kinetic energy, ?, were explored. This will assist in allowing ? (an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> intensities) to be estimated indirectly from more common and affordable measurement methods. The data show a clear tidal influence on internal waves and the physical properties of the water, and tides strongly influence turbulence events. Because tides and topography are fundamental to the creation of internal waves, the topography of the bay is vital to the production of turbulence. Moreover, the relationship between TL and ? shows influence by the gradient Richardson number, Ri. Where large values of Ri tend to not support larger values of TL, and is defined as a nonlinear relationship in the form of: ? = N^ 3 *. 026 TL ^ 1. 019; where N is the buoyancy frequency...|$|E
40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} fresher foods has necessitated {{the use of}} non-thermal {{technologies}} in processing milk. Two Dean Flow UV reactors (1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID × 1 / 322 ̆ 2 Thick 2 ̆ 6 1 / 82 ̆ 2 ID × 1 / 322 ̆ 2 Thick) were designed in the laboratory. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the efficacy of designed UV reactors at four levels of Reynolds numbers (Re) on inactivation of Escherichia coli W 1485 cells and Bacillus cereus spores in raw cow milk (RCM), commercially processed skimmed cow milk (SCM) and raw soymilk (RSM). RCM, SCM and RSM were inoculated separately with E. coli W 1485 and B. cereus spores and were treated through the designed reactors for a residence time of 11. 3 ± 0. 1 s, equivalent to an UV dose of 0. 05 J/ml in 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID reactor and 0. 02 J/ml in 1 / 82 ̆ 2 ID reactor. Four levels of Re were tested in the range of 181 - 1372. The influence of tube diameter (thickness of milk exposed to UV) and Re (<b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence)</b> at constant residence time (11. 3 ± 0. 1 s) on inactivation of both the bacteria in both the UV reactors was analyzed using two-way ANOVA with proc GLM in SAS software. E. coli was inactivated to non-detectable levels (≥ 7. 8 log 10 CFU/ml) in SCM from the second level of Re (532. 2) in 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID reactor. E. coli was also inactivated significantly (3 ̆e 5 logs) in RSM at the highest Re (1372) but this was not achieved in the case of RCM (712. 7). Increasing the residence time to 14. 2 s or greater (17 s) (equal to UV dose of 0. 06 and 0. 08 J/ml) inactivated E. coli cells to non-detectable levels in RCM using 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID reactor at the highest level of Re (712. 7). Reduction of E. coli cells were in the range of 0. 45 - 7. 78 logs whereas B. cereus spores were in range of 1. 06 - 3. 29 logs in all types of milk used in this study. The interaction effect of tube diameter and Re was statistically significant for E. coli cells in RCM, and SCM; B. cereus spores in SCM, and RSM (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) whereas this was statistically non significant for E. coli cells in RSM and B. cereus spores in RCM (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). Main effects of Reynolds number, and tube diameter were statistically significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) on inactivation of B. cereus spores in RCM and E. coli cells in RSM. Inactivation efficiencies for both bacteria were higher in 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID reactor than 1 / 82 ̆ 2 ID reactor. Using the 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID reactor at highest level of Re (RCM Re = 712. 7, RSM Re = 1372), inactivation of standard plate count (SPC) present in RSM and RCM, and lipid oxidation during storage period (0, 1, 3 and 7 days) were measured. Inactivation of SPC in UV-treated RSM (3 logs) was lower than thermal pasteurization at 72 °C for 20 s (7 logs). In case of RCM, the SPC was inactivated to 1. 9 logs from 4. 2 logs. Sensory evaluation (olfactory) of UV treated, untreated (milk passed through the 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID reactor while the UV lights turned off), and fresh RCM (control) suggested no change in flavor after treatment and upto 1 day after storage in refrigerated condition, but a perceivable change in the quality of UV treated and untreated cow milk were observed during the 3 rd and 7 th days when compared with fresh RCM (milked same day). RCM was treated with different UV dose levels (0. 04, 0. 05, 0. 08, 0. 12 and 0. 16 J/ml) to examine the effect of UV light on malondialdehyde and other reactive substances using TBARS test kit. Reactive substances such as malondialdehyde content increased as the UV dose increased. The presence of malondialdehyde and other reactive substances were not significantly different (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in both thermal and UV-pasteurized soymilk; whereas these substances were found to be higher in UV-treated RCM after 7 days of storage than the untreated milk stored for 7 days at 4 °C and the fresh RCM. The designed reactors 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID and 1 / 82 ̆ 2 ID reactors were useful to inactivate bacteria present in milk. But, the inactivation efficiency was more in 1 / 162 ̆ 2 ID reactor than 1 / 82 ̆ 2 ID reactor...|$|E

40|$|Turbulent {{fluctuations}} of both {{velocity and}} temperature fields, issuing from high-resolution large-eddy simulations, have been analyzed in convective boundary layers. The numerically simulated flows are strongly anisotropic at large scales: {{this is due}} both to the action of buoyancy and to the imposed geostrophic wind. Their relative weight is varied so that one experiment’s results are much more convective than the other. To properly disentangle anisotropic properties, the authors exploit both standard statistical indica-tors, like skewness coefficients, and the three-dimensional rotational group decomposition SO(3). Two main conclusions can be drawn. First, despite the strong anisotropies at large scales, isotropy is statistically recovered at scales {{much smaller than the}} large ones.

Meteorological analyses for the special reporting periods were made objectively by computer using only standard upper air rawinsonde measurements.

The period of radical innovation that occurred in the PC industry after the period of high entry/exit was characterized by large changes in market shares and relative growth rates. Besides market share instability, different indices of stock price volatility (excess volatility and idiosyncratic risk) also prove to successfully capture periods of radical innovation.

A generic type of solar panel was considered at three different ground clearances. For the range of ground clearance values considered in the study, {{the results show that}} an increase in the clearance produces stronger vortex shedding fluctuations, higher shedding frequencies, and larger mean and unsteady wind loading. For the smallest ground clearance, an irregular vortex shedding was observed. The flow structures formed in the wake are analyzed using various <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> characteristics including the vorticity and the λ 2 criterion. The flow structures suggest a complex formation and subsequent shedding of vortices. The absence of regular vortex shedding at the smallest ground clearance and the presence of the same at the mid-ground clearance value suggests a reference for minimizing the unsteady wind loading of solar panels. Furthermore, the unsteady results reveal that the lower sections of the panel are more vulnerable to wind loading...|$|R

The studied flames could be acoustically driven, to simulate phenomena important in LP combustion technologies. In combination with novel image post processing techniques we show how the data obtained {{can be used to}} track the flame front contour in a plane defined by the illuminating laser sheets. We consider effects of chemistry and convective fluid motion on the dynamics of the observed displacements and analyse the influence <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> and acoustic forcing on the observed contour velocity, a quantity we term as s (d) (2 D). We show that this quantity is a valuable and sensitive <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> flame <b>turbulence</b> interactions, as (a) it is measurable with existing experimental methodologies, and (b) because computational data, e. g. from large eddy simulations, can be post processed in an identical fashion. s (d) (2 D) is related (to a two-dimensional projection) of the three-dimensional flame displacement speed s (d), but artifacts due to out of plane convective motion of the flame surface and the uncertainty in the angle of the flame surface normal have to be carefully considered. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate such effects for several distributions of flame front angle distributions, and it is shown conclusively that s (d) (2 D) is a sensitive <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> a quantity related to s (d) in the flames we study. s (d) (2 D) was shown to increase linearly both with turbulent intensity and with the amplitude of acousting forcing for the range of conditions studied...|$|R

The variability of these parameters due to propagation through atmosphere was analyzed for different aircraft Mach number and altitude groups. The low Mach number/low altitude group had significantly greater variation in rise time, overpressure, and loudness level than the high Mach number/high altitude group. The loudness of measured booms were found to have a variation of up to 25 dB relative to the loudness of boom predicted for a non-turbulent atmosphere. This is due primarily to the steeper ray paths of the high Mach number/high altitude group and the corresponding shorter distances traveled by these rays through the lower atmosphere resulting in reduced refraction effects. The general trend of decreased overpressure and loudness level with increasing lateral distance was also seen. Sonic boom signatures from early morning flights had less variation in rise time and overpressure than afternoon flights because <b>of</b> reduced <b>turbulence.</b> Measures <b>of</b> asymmetry (difference between compression and expansion portion of the signature) showed that the variability in Delta loudness level was greater than the variability in Delta overpressure due to the large influence <b>of</b> <b>turbulence</b> on rise time. Lastly, analysis of data within 50 percent of lateral cutoff showed that the mean value for overpressure and loudness level was independent of time of day but that the frequency with which it occurred was greater in the morning.

30|$|As the derived {{statistical}} {{positions for}} one year of data are still rather distinct, the cause seems to be regular and persistent. The spread of the detected positions originates from the beam width and short term random variabilities, though. A <b>turbulence</b> model <b>of</b> nonuniform scattering properties, e.g., more anisotropic behavior at the edges and isotropic turbulence {{in the center of}} a distinct layer was proposed by Hocking (1989); Woodman and Chu (1989), causing refractive index fluctuations that would explain some of the observed effects. Enhanced spectral width at altitudes above 80  km and a high number of detected scatterers with IDI techniques are certainly an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> enhanced <b>turbulence,</b> but a rather equivalent offset between the nominal beam directions and the detected scattering positions is also seen at lower altitudes, where the spectra are very narrow. Therefore, the observed anisotropy is at least not exclusively caused by turbulence scattering, but likely to some extent is also related to specular scattering, which was also quoted by Hocking and Röttger (2001) and references within. In a future study, the temporal evolution and altitudinal variability of the scattering positions throughout the year will be investigated. Analyzing additional beam pointing directions with larger zenith angle as well as the relation to turbulence and ionization level might give additional information to characterize and clarify the observations done so far.|$|R
