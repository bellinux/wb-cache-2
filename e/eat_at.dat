5|$|Restaurant menu: During {{the early}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{expanding}} trade and commerce brought money and {{people to the}} Song Chinese capital. The world's first restaurants sprang up and food like dumplings and noodles became available to the masses for a small price. Urban shopkeepers of the merchant middle class often had little time to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> home, so they ventured out to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> a variety of establishments such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and restaurants which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and drama theaters; this along with traveling foreigners and Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand {{for a variety of}} flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many black workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{association}} of body mass index (BMI) and weight gain with <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants and similar establishments or <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work among 10 European countries of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. SUBJECTS: This study included a representative sample of 24, 310 randomly selected EPIC participants. METHODS: Single 24 -h dietary recalls with information on the place of consumption were collected using standardized procedures between 1995 and 2000. Eating at restaurants was defined to include all eating and drinking occasions at restaurants, cafeterias, bars and fast food outlets. Eating at work included all eating and drinking occasions at the workplace. Associations between <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants or <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work and BMI or annual weight changes were assessed using sex-specific linear mixed-effects models, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: In southern Europe energy intake at restaurants was higher than intake at work, whereas in northern Europe <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work appeared to contribute more to the mean daily intake than <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants. Cross-sectionally, <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants was found to be positively associated with BMI only among men (β=+ 0. 24, P= 0. 003). Essentially no association was found between BMI and <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> work among both genders. In a prospective analysis among men, <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants was found to be positively, albeit nonsignificantly, associated with weight gain (β=+ 0. 05, P= 0. 368). No association was detected between energy intake at restaurants and weight changes, controlling for total energy intake. CONCLUSION: Among men, <b>eating</b> <b>at</b> restaurants and similar establishments was associated with higher BMI and possibly weight gain...|$|R
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> home, so they chose {{to go out and}} <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E

50|$|Lunch, the {{abbreviation}} for luncheon, {{is a light}} meal typically <b>eaten</b> <b>at</b> midday. The origin of the words lunch and luncheon relate to a small snack originally <b>eaten</b> <b>at</b> {{any time of the}} day or night. During the 20th century the meaning gradually narrowed to a small or mid-sized meal <b>eaten</b> <b>at</b> midday. Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day after breakfast. The meal varies in size depending on the culture, and significant variations exist in different areas of the world.|$|R

The men retreated, but four were shot and killed. Slain with St. Vrain were John Fowler, William Hale, and Aaron Hawley. An account of the massacre from Gen. George W. Jones, who was St. Vrain's brother-in-law {{and the man who}} identified his body, said the warriors had scalped the dead men, but also cut off the hands, head, and feet of St. Vrain and removed his heart.

5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to <b>eat</b> <b>at</b> night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E
