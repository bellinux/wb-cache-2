5|$|Some {{writers have}} {{explained}} the crucifixion darkness {{in terms of}} sunstorms, heavy cloud cover, {{the aftermath of a}} volcanic eruption, or a khamsin <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> that tends to occur from March to May. A popular work of the nineteenth century described it as an 'oppressive gloom' and suggested this was a typical phenomenon related to earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{team were}} at home against the New England Revolution of MLS for the fifth round, on July 8. They easily won with goals from Conor Casey and Le Toux. The latter's strike made him the modern-era Open Cup goals leader {{with a total of}} 14 scored in his career. Le Toux had a strong history with Seattle and the tournament before moving to the Union in 2009; he {{previously}} played for the second-division incarnation of the Sounders and won the 2009 Open Cup with the MLS side. He would later be named the runner-up to the year's Most Valuable Player of the Tournament. A <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> accompanied by thunder and lightning halted the game for an hour after the 61st minute, but the Revolution could not recover from the two-goal deficit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> {{occur during}} summer months with peak in May and June, They are locally known as Andhi. These <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> are quite violent. <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> {{during the early}} summer {{indicates}} {{the arrival of the}} monsoons while <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> in the autumn indicate the arrival of winter.|$|R
50|$|Major <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> are a {{frequent}} occurrence, as well. During November 2004, {{a number of}} major <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> hit Chad, originating in the Bodélé Depression. This is a common area for <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> (occurring, on average, 100 days every year).|$|R
2500|$|Another {{factor that}} can reduce {{received}} power is {{dust in the}} atmosphere, especially <b>dust</b> <b>storms.</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> have occurred quite frequently when Mars is closest to the Sun. Global <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> in 2007 reduced power levels for Opportunity and Spirit so much they could only run {{for a few minutes}} each day. It was predicted that <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> might hit later in 2016 as well.|$|R
25|$|On 14 July 2006 {{a severe}} <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> hit the Quetta valley for three {{consecutive}} days, reducing visibility {{to less than}} a kilometer. Again on 23 July 2007, another <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> enveloped {{the city and its}} surroundings, reducing visibility to less than a kilometer but also affected both air and vehicle traffic.|$|E
25|$|The term {{sandstorm}} is {{used most}} often {{in the context of}} desert sandstorms, especially in the Sahara, when, in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility, a considerable amount of larger sand particles moves closer to the surface. The term <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> {{is more likely to be}} used when finer particles are blown long distances, especially when the <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> affects urban areas.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> in Adelaide {{on the day of}} the bushfires.|$|E
5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to <b>dust</b> <b>storms.</b> These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|R
3000|$|... (pL,[*]pS)[*]=[*](0.95,[*] 0.5) {{used for}} {{binarization}} {{is just an}} example and actually depends on the individual motivation of the segmentation of <b>dust</b> <b>storms.</b> If one is investigating the size distributions of <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> including small <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> one has to decrease pL. If the shape of relatively large <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> is a major target, both pL and pS should be large. The sensitivity of these results to location and season is discussed in the next section.|$|R
40|$|This note is {{an attempt}} to resolve some misconceptions {{regarding}} the historical record of the Martian atmospheric phenomena referred to as 'dust storms,' but often called yellow storms, yellow clouds, planetwide <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> global <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> great <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> etc. The known frequency of planet-encircling storms will be specifically addressed. Better knowledge of the sizes, frequencies, and locations of Martian <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> is needed for atmospheric modeling and for future mission planning...|$|R

25|$|An ominous sign {{of things}} to come {{occurred}} on the afternoon of 8 February, when Melbourne was enveloped by a giant <b>dust</b> <b>storm.</b> The dust cloud was over 300 metres high and 500 kilometres long and was composed of an estimated 50,000 tonnes of topsoil from the drought-ravaged Wimmera and Mallee areas of north-west Victoria. Leading a dry cool change and preceded by record temperatures, the <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> cut visibility in Melbourne to 100 metres, creating near darkness for almost an hour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> cause soil {{loss from}} the dry lands, and worse, they {{preferentially}} remove organic matter and the nutrient-rich lightest particles, thereby reducing agricultural productivity. Also the abrasive {{effect of the}} storm damages young crop plants. <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> also reduced visibility affecting aircraft and road transportation. In addition <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> also create problems due to complications of breathing in dust.|$|R
50|$|Global <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> have {{occurred}} {{at least nine}} times since 1924 including 1977, 1982, 1994, 2001 and 2007; the 2007 <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> nearly ended {{the functioning of the}} solar-powered U.S. Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Global <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> obscured Mars when the Mariner 9 orbiter arrived there in 1971, and it took several weeks for the dust to settle down and allow for clear imaging of the surface of Mars. It was predicted that Mars global <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> are likely to occur in the fall of 2016, but they had not started when the EDM attempted its landing.|$|R
40|$|Observations by the Viking Orbiters and Landers {{have made}} {{substantial}} contributions {{to an understanding}} of the episodic, planetary-scale <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> on Mars. These and other observations pertinent to the great <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> are reviewed in this paper; most of the emphasis is on the atmospheric/climatic aspects of these great storms. Specifically, observations concerning the optical properties of the airborne dust, the frequency of occurrence of great <b>dust</b> <b>storms,</b> and the kinematics of their evolution are summarized. Special attention is given to the various estimates derived from Viking data of atmospheric dust opacity. Within this observational framework, various physical mechanisms underlying the generation, evolution, and decay of the Martian great <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> are discussed...|$|R

25|$|On November 11, 1933, a {{very strong}} <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> {{stripped}} topsoil from desiccated South Dakota farmlands in {{just one of a}} series of severe dust storms that year. Beginning on May 9, 1934, a strong, two-day <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> removed massive amounts of Great Plains topsoil in one of the worst such storms of the Dust Bowl. The dust clouds blew all the way to Chicago, where they deposited 12 million pounds of dust. Two days later, the same storm reached cities to the east, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. That winter (1934–1935), red snow fell on New England.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that dust storms on Mars could play a role in storm formation similar to that of water clouds on Earth. Observation since the 1950s has shown that the chances of a planet-wide <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> in a particular Martian year are approximately one in three.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> are {{considered}} major natural disasters that cause many damages {{to society and}} environment in Iraq and surrounded deserted regions. The aim {{of this research is}} to analyze and study the synoptic patterns leading to the formation of <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> in Iraq. Analysis are based on satellite images, aerosols index and synoptic weather maps. Two severe <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> occurred over Iraq on February 22, 2010, and on December 10, 2011 were analyzed. The results showed that <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> form when a low-pressure system forms over Iran causing Shamal winds blow; they carry cool air from that region towards warmer regions like eastern Syria and Iraq. In some cases, this low-pressure system is followed by a high-pressure system brining more cold air to the region and pushing dust toward south. <b>Dust</b> <b>storms</b> are initiated from source regions near Iraq-Syria borders by the existence of negative vertical velocity, which causes dust particles to be lifted upwards, and the strong westerly wind drives dust to travel eastward...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the quantitative prediction of <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> in China. Some <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> were observed in China for the period of 1 - 5 May 2005. These dust events have been simulated using an integrated wind erosion modeling system (IWEMS) which simulates all stages of dust cycle, from dust emission and transport to deposition. WMO 3 hourly synoptic reporting data for six spring seasons (March-May) from 2000 to 2005 in East Asia and GIS data were used to establish the database of dust source. These data sets are implemented to IWEMS model to simulate the intensive <b>dust</b> <b>storms</b> observed in China in terms of temporal and spatial variations of dust concentrations, starting and ending times of the <b>dust</b> <b>storms.</b> It is found that the model simulates quite well the observed concentrations and the starting and ending times of <b>dust</b> <b>storms.</b> The predicted spatial patterns and temporal evolutions of dust events and the predicted near-surface dust concentrations are found to agree well with the observations...|$|R

25|$|A <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> or sandstorm, a {{meteorological}} phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions, arises when a gust front passes {{or when the}} wind force exceeds the threshold value where loose sand and dust are removed from the dry surface. Particles are transported by saltation and suspension, causing soil erosion from one place and deposition in another.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Meteorology has {{reported}} that 2002 through 2005 were the warmest summers in Sydney since records began in 1859. The summer of 2007–08, however, {{proved to be the}} coolest since 1996–97 and is the only summer this century to be at or below average in temperatures. In 2009, dry conditions brought a severe <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> towards eastern Australia.|$|E

25|$|Dust {{from the}} erosion of deserts in {{northern}} and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects. In {{the first four months}} of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms. In April 2002, one <b>dust</b> <b>storm</b> alone dumped nearly 50,000tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.|$|E
