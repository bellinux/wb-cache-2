5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it <b>is</b> <b>several</b> orders of {{magnitude}} above the mutation rate. Hence, it is being supported by selection. Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant. The black form may {{be an example of}} heterozygote advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|The large {{magnitude}} of solar energy available {{makes it a}} highly appealing source of electricity. The United Nations Development Programme in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837 exajoules (EJ).

5|$|The queen only lays 10–20 eggs in {{the very}} early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony <b>is</b> <b>several</b> years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the selection of Virginia Tech and Boston College, concerns about potential attendance at the 2008 ACC Championship Game arose. Because the same matchup resulted in such low attendance at the 2007 championship game in Jacksonville, it was doubted that Tampa, which <b>is</b> <b>several</b> hundred miles further south and more distant from the two schools, could attract as many spectators as the previous season's game. Adding {{to the problem of}} selling tickets was the 2008 economic crisis, which many fans cited as a reason for not purchasing tickets. By the Wednesday before the game, Virginia Tech had sold just 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets it was required by contract to sell. There also were questions about how many local fans would attend. To mitigate the problems seen in Jacksonville the year before, ticket prices were lowered from $65 to $25, and it was hoped that the lower capacity of Tampa's Raymond James Stadium compared with Jacksonville Municipal Stadium would allow for a quicker sellout. The campaign to attract more fans was moderately successful, as 30,000 of the 43,000 tickets not assigned to either school were sold by December 1, five days before the game. Team ticket sales were abysmal, however, as Virginia Tech and Boston College combined to sell just 5,000 tickets of the 20,000 allotted to the two teams.|$|E
5|$|Dragon kiln: Dragon kilns were {{traditional}} Chinese kilns {{used for}} Chinese ceramics. According to recent excavations in Shangyu District {{in the northeast}} of Zhejiang province and elsewhere, {{the origins of the}} dragon kiln may go back as far as the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 to 1046 BCE), and is linked to the introduction of stoneware, fired at 1200°C or more. These kilns were much smaller than later examples, at some 5–12 metres long, and also sloped far less. The type had certainly developed by the Warring States period, and by the Eastern Wu kingdom (220–280 CE), there were over 60 kilns at Shangyu. Thereafter it remained the main design used in southern China until the Ming dynasty. The pottery areas of south China are mostly hilly, whereas those on the plains of north China typically lack suitable slopes; here the mantou kiln type predominated. The Nanfeng Kiln in Guangdong province <b>is</b> <b>several</b> centuries old and still functioning. It was a producer of Shiwan ware as well as architectural ceramics, and today also functions as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a {{magnetic}} field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets {{the magnetic field}} of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field <b>is</b> <b>several</b> times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from {{the centre of the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change <b>is</b> <b>several</b> orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|Sierra Leone is {{a country}} in West Africa, close to the equator, with an area of 71,740 square {{kilometres}} (27,700 square miles)—similar in size to South Carolina or Scotland. It shares land borders with Guinea and Liberia and is bordered to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The country became a British colony in 1808, though British influence {{began in the late}} 18th century when former slaves were settled in the area that became known as Freetown, now the capital city. Freetown lies on a peninsula, and is separated from the country's main airport, Lungi, by the estuary of the Sierra Leone River, which <b>is</b> <b>several</b> miles wide. The colony was granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1961 and Sir Milton Margai was appointed its first prime minister. He was replaced in 1962 by his brother, Albert, who was defeated by Siaka Stevens in the 1967 general election. Stevens was overthrown within hours by the commander of the army, but was later reinstated after the commander was himself overthrown. Sierra Leone became a republic in 1971, and Stevens was installed as its first president.|$|E

5|$|The halo ring appears {{brightest}} in forward-scattered light, {{in which}} it was extensively imaged by Galileo. While its surface brightness is much less than that of the main ring, its vertically (perpendicular to the ring plane) integrated photon flux is comparable due to its much larger thickness. Despite a claimed vertical extent of more than , the halo’s brightness is strongly concentrated towards the ring plane and follows a power law of the form z−0.6 to z−1.5, where z is altitude over the ring plane. The halo’s appearance in the back-scattered light, as observed by Keck and HST, is the same. However its total photon flux <b>is</b> <b>several</b> times lower than that of the main ring and is more strongly concentrated near the ring plane than in the forward-scattered light.|$|E
