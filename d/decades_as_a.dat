5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed for many <b>decades</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat to {{protected}} {{areas such as}} forests and parks.

The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
