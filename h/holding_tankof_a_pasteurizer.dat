40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with the down-stream propagation of waves over initially still water. Such a study {{is relevant to}} generate waves of large amplitude in wave <b>tankof</b> <b>a</b> hydrodynamic laboratory. Input {{in the form of}} a time signal is provided at the wave-maker located at one side of the wave tank; the resulting wave then propagates over initially still water towards the beach at the other side of the tank. Experiments show that nonlinear effects will deform the waves and may lead to large wave with waves height larger than twice the original input; the deformation may show itself as peakingand splitting. It is direct scientific interest to understand and quantify the nonlinear distortion; it is also much practical interest to know at which location in the wave tank,the extreme position, the waves will achieve their maximum amplitude and to know the amplitude amplification factor. To investigate this, a previously introduced concept called Maximal Temporal Amplitude (MTA) is used: at each location the maximum over time ofthe wave elevation. An explicit expression of the MTA cannot be found in general from the governing equations and generating signals. In this paper we will use Boussinesq modeland third order approximation theory to calculate the approximate extreme positions and amplification factor for wave-group that originate from initially bi-chromatic type of wave. The wave is described by superposition of two monochromatic waves. We show that, the extreme position depends on the amplitude and the wave length of the group.

40|$|Observation of {{microorganisms}} adhering to metal surfaces {{is more difficult}} than of those adhering to glass or translucent polymers and usually requires special techniques as e. g. epifluorescent microscopy, scanning electron microscopy or removal of adhering microorganisms followed by plating. In this paper, the use of metallurgical microscopy to observe microorganisms adhering to metal surfaces is described. The method is simple, attachment of the vertical illumination set up required to an ordinary light microscope is relatively cheap, and no additional manipulations are necessary. The image quality is high and individual adhering microorganisms can be easily observed, even without employing additional image analysis techniques. As {{an example of the}} application of this technique, the influence of Ca 2 + ions on the adhesion of three strains of dairy Streptococcus thermophilus to 316 -L stainless steel was studied. Using a parallel plate flow chamber with a stainless steel bottom plate and a glass top plate, adhesion was measured in situ on the bottom plate under moderate flow (15 s(- 1)) in an adhesion buffer with various amounts of CaCl 2 added. Neither the initial deposition rates nor the numbers of organisms adhering after 200 min showed systematic variation with the amounts of CaCl 2 added. However, for S. thermophilus G 1 initial the deposition rates with 1 mM CaCl 2 were much higher (2170 cm(- 2) s(- 1)) than was the case without CaCl 2, or with 5 mM CaCl 2 added (approximately 1300 cm(- 2) s(- 1)). For S. thermophilus B and N- 12 the initial deposition rates were only slightly higher with 5 mM CaCl 2 than without CaCl 2 or without 1 mM CaCl 2 added.

Additionally, its in-line connection to a traditional pasteurization tube provides enough energy to run the MST unit, without addition of exogenous heat energy. Thus, the energy-saving characteristics and the previous results serve to demonstrate the effectiveness of the LTST process.|$|R

40|$|Brämhults Juice AB is a Swedish company {{producing}} fresh {{juice for}} the Scandinavian market. Fresh juice {{is rich in}} taste but has limited durability and must be treated with special care throughout the whole supply chain. Not only will {{the quality of the}} product be affected if mistreated, but there are also contamination risks meaning that people actually could get sick, although the risk is very small. There are also other kinds of flow-related risks like single-sourced packages. To reduce the risk of spoiled juice, Brämhults installed <b>a</b> <b>pasteurizer</b> in their production process during spring 2005. An interesting question is how this affected the risks in the supply chain flow. One of the authors (Paulsson 2007) has in another study developed a model, called the DRISC (Disruption Risks In Supply Chains) model, for the structuring, evaluation and handling of risks related to disruptions in the product flow in the supply chain. The DRISC model, seen from the angle of an individual (focal) company in the supply chain, covers all product flow-related disruption risks in the total supply chain from natural resources to the delivered final product, and makes it possible to classify them into 15 different risk exposure boxes, of which 3 boxes have “known result impact” and 12 have “expected result impact”, and also to summarize them in a figure for the total negative result impact. The risk analysis phase of the model is applied in the project to Brämhults juice before and after the installation of the pasteurizer in order to see the effects on the risk "picture". The analysis showed that there was an increase in two of the three “known result impact boxes” and a decrease in the third one. There was also a decrease in eight of the “expected result impact boxes”, and the remaining four were unchanged. Especially interesting is that the three risks linked to market confidence, which before were high or very high, were now all medium. There has also been a change towards comparatively more known result impacts and fewer expected result impacts. The investment in the pasteurizer was about 2 million SEK, and there was a minor increase in the operating costs by 800. 000 SEK annually. Since the costs for returns and withdrawals caused by spoiled juice, which before the pasteurizer were about 6 million SEK annually, dropped by about 90 %, the investment has had a payback time of about 5 months. But the pasteurizer also prolonged durability from 10 to 18 days, thereby making it possible for Brämhults to change from distribution by the company’s own drivers and lorries to all the different shops over to transporting to a limited number of DCs (distribution centres) belonging to different food chains. If we split the pasteurizer investment 50 / 50 on risk and on distribution, we will get a payback time concerning the risk part of the investment of only 2 to 3 months, indicating that it was a very profitable investment. In the costs for returns and withdrawals, only the direct, immediate costs are included. If the negative effects of disruptions on future sales are also considered, the payback time will be even shorter...|$|R

Raw milk used is provided by Blue Nile Dairy and Kordi Farms. Raw milk from both dairy farms usually is mixed before processing. Milk fat is standardized to 3 – 3. 2 % and the milk is pasteurized using <b>a</b> HTST <b>pasteurizer.</b> In the present study, raw milk was analyzed for some chemical, physical and microbial properties, 120 samples of CAPO pasteurized milk from six different batches were examined. These pasteurized milk samples were stored at both 5 o C and 10 o C. The analysis was carried out every second day up to 9 days for microbial, chemical and physical properties. The presence of Brucella antibody, antibiotic and phosphatase enzyme was also examined. The log total bacteria counts of pasteurized milk were found to be 2. 534 ± 0. 09 cfu/ml and 2. 448 ± 0. 064 cfu/ml, while log coliform bacterial counts were 0. 235 ± 0. 031 and 0. 223 ± 0. 034 cfu/ml for milk samples stored at 5 o C and 10 o C, respectively. The log of thermoduric counts of pasteurized milk revealed 1. 492 ± 0. 044 and 1. 375 ± 0. 047 cfu/ml and log psychrotrophic counts were 0. 24 ± 0. 066 and 0. 481 ± 0. 071 cfu/ml, respectively. Chemical and physical properties of pasteurized milk were conducted. The data showed that fat results were 3. 33 ± 0. 009 and 3. 35 ± 0. 001 %, protein were 3. 2 ± 0. 021 and 3. 22 ± 0. 020 % and lactose were 4. 02 ± 0. 02 and 4. 01 ± 0. 027 % for the samples stored at 5 o C and 10 o C, respectively. The ash content revealed 0. 717 ± 0. 003 and 0. 718 ± 0. 003 %, SNF 7. 91 ± 0. 023 and 7. 91 ± 0. 025 %. Density was reported as 1. 028 ± 0. 088 and 1. 028 ± 0. 094 and freezing points (o C) were - 0. 448 ± 0. 002 and - 0. 447 ± 0. 002, respectively. Also the result showed that the titratable acidity was found as 0. 141 and 0. 145 % and pH were 7. 06 ± 0. 002 and 7. 07 ± 0. 002, respectively. However pasteurized milk samples were found to be negative to the milk ring test, antibiotic and phosphatase test. The shelf life of pasteurized milk tested in the {{present study was}} 9 days. Hence it is concluded that the pasteurized milk produced by Blue Nile Dairy Company (CAPO) was of high quality. However raw milk supply needs improvement of hygienic quality...|$|R
