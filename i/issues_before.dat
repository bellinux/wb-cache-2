5|$|At {{the same}} time that the first issue of New Worlds appeared, a {{separate}} British magazine called Fantasy was launched by Walter Gillings, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. Fantasy lasted for only three <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of Fantasy by publishing a fanzine, titled Fantasy Review, beginning in March 1947.|$|E

5|$|Cyan {{proposed}} Myst to Sunsoft for $265,000—more {{than double}} {{what they thought}} it would cost to develop the game, but ultimately less than Myst cost to produce.

An Xbox One patch to bring support for Twitch streaming video was designed to coincide with Titanfall release. Respawn announced that the release version was finalized for distribution ("gone gold") on February 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The French {{submarine}} Mariotte (Q74) was {{a submarine}} {{built for the}} French Navy prior to World War I. Intended to accompany the fleet, she was designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was unsatisfied with her performance on the surface, the boat had a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before or during the following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and the navy spent years fixing the various <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction. During the war, she participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in the cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles.|$|E

5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|Forsythe Racing {{teammates}} Tagliani and Carpentier rounded {{out the top}} ten qualifiers; Carpentier was {{hampered by}} an electrical problem which overheated his engine {{and was unable to}} improve his time when his blowoff valve opened {{between the first and second}} turns. Adrián Fernández was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten; his best lap time was more than two-tenths of a second slower than Bräck. Fittipaldi's car developed a large amount of oversteer and reduced his pace in turn four and he took 12th. Jimmy Vasser and Oriol Servià took the 13th and 14th positions; Servià's car had oversteer after his first timed lap and drove into the pit lane where his crew made adjustments allowing him to drive faster for his second attempt. Nakano, 15th, had a large amount of understeer which slowed him in turn four. Dixon moved from his back-up car to his primary vehicle for qualifying and took 16th. Manning worked on his race setup but gearbox <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> the session prevented his team from focusing on a qualifying tune and he qualified in 17th. Mario Domínguez and Jourdain completed the qualifiers; Jourdain reduced his speed through the third and fourth turns after he oversteered and his slower pace prevented him from spinning.|$|E

5|$|After {{both the}} British Industrial Syndicalist Education League (ISEL), a {{short-lived}} syndicalist organization {{heavily involved in}} the strike wave in Britain from 1910, and the Dutch syndicalist union National Labor Secretariat (NAS) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913, the FVdG {{was the first to}} express support. There were difficulties in organizing the congress, and the largest syndicalist union worldwide— the CGT— refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions. Despite these challenges, the First International Syndicalist Congress took place at Holborn Town Hall in London from September 27 to October 2. British, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, French, Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Brazilian, and Argentine organizations—both labor unions and political groups— had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG, which was represented by Karl Roche, Carl Windhoff, and Fritz Kater. There were also links with Norwegian, Polish, and American groups. Kater was elected co-president of the congress alongside Jack Wills. After Wills was forced to resign, Kater served as co-president with Jack Tanner. The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues, the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement (as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands) should be risked. The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism, while their Italian, French, and Spanish counterparts, most notably Alceste De Ambris of the Italian USI, were more intent on preventing further division. Accordingly, the congress was divided {{on the question of whether}} its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded. The opponents of a new organization prevailed, but the congress agreed to establish an Information Bureau. The Information Bureau was based in Amsterdam and published the Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste. The congress was considered a success by most who attended, with the notable exception of De Ambris. A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years' time in Amsterdam. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the congress did not take place. The Bulletin only published for eighteen <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> the war caused it to cease publication.|$|E
5|$|For 2002, Courage Compétition {{began running}} a factory team again (using a Judd-engined C60), whilst Pescarolo Sport {{continued}} with their Peugeot-engined C60. The 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Catalunya saw Courage's Thed Björk, Derichebourg and Cottaz take fifth overall, whilst Pescarolo's Boullion and Bourdais won the race. At the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Estoril, it was Cottaz and Derichebourg who took second for Courage, whilst Boullion and Franck Lagorce finished fourth for Pescarolo. At the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Brno, Cottaz and Derichebourg took another second for Courage, whilst Pescarolo did not compete. Three C60s were entered for the 2002 24 Hours of Le Mans; Courage selected Cottaz, Derichebourg and Björk to drive their car, whilst Pescarolo ran Boullion, Lagorce and Bourdais {{in one of}} their C60-Peugeots, and Stéphane Ortelli, Ukyo Katayama and Éric Hélary drove their other car. Although the C60 of Ortelli/Katayama/Hélary succombed to engine trouble after 144 laps, the other Pescarolo-entered C60 finished tenth overall, and ninth in class whilst the Courage-entered C60 finished 15th overall, and 11th in class. Pescarolo reverted to a single-car entry for the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Magny-Cours, which, with Bourdais and Boullion at the wheel, finished in second; the Courage-entered car, driven by Cottaz and Derichebourg, succumbed to electrical <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> completing a lap. Courage did not run their car again, whilst Pescarolo's Boullion and Lagorce took third at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Dijon, before Bourdais and Boullion finished the season with a victory at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Spa. Courage finished the season tied with Dome on 97 points in the SR1 Constructor's Championship, but lost the title to Dome as they had won a single race less.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{attempted}} to trade quarterback Jay Cutler to the Titans for their #2 overall pick, but Tennessee was not interested. Eventually, the Bears drafted West Virginia receiver Kevin White with the seventh-overall pick; considered the top receiver in the 2015 draft class by NFL.com analyst Mike Mayock, White caught 109 passes for 1,447 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2014. In the second round, Florida State defensive lineman Eddie Goldman was selected; considered a first-round prospect {{who had fallen}} due to his toughness, the 2014 Associated Press All-American recorded 35 tackles, four sacks and eight tackles for loss in his final college season. With their third-rounder, Oregon center Hroniss Grasu was drafted; the 2013 and 2014 Rimington Trophy finalist, the Bears were convinced by guard Kyle Long to draft his former Oregon teammate. With White and Grasu's selections, this {{marked the first time}} since 2008 that the Bears drafted at least two offensive players with their first three picks. In the fourth round, Michigan State running back Jeremy Langford was selected; during his time with Michigan State, he recorded 2,967 rushing yards and 40 touchdowns on 577 carries, while also recording 18 games with 100+ rushing yards, the third-most in school history. He holds the Spartans' record for the most consecutive Big Ten Conference games with 100 rushing yards with 15, ending his college career with 16. The Bears drafted their second defensive player in the fifth round, Penn State safety Adrian Amos; having started 38 consecutive games for the Nittany Lions, Amos recorded 42 tackles and three interceptions in 2014, with career totals of 149 tackles, seven interceptions, three sacks and nine tackles for loss. The Bears' final pick of the draft was in the sixth round, drafting TCU tackle Tayo Fabuluje; the 2012 Big 12 Conference Newcomer of the Year, he skipped football in 2013 due to family <b>issues</b> <b>before</b> returning in 2014 to help TCU win the Big 12 title.|$|E
