25|$|Kew, {{the area}} in which Kew Gardens are situated, {{consists}} mainly of the gardens themselves and a small surrounding community. Royal residences in the area which would later influence the layout and construction of the gardens began in 1299 when Edward I moved his court to a manor house in neighbouring Richmond (then called Sheen). That manor house was later abandoned; however, Henry VII built Sheen Palace in 1501, which, under the name Richmond Palace, became a permanent royal residence for Henry VII. Around the start of the 16th century courtiers attending Richmond Palace settled in Kew and built large houses. Early royal residences at Kew included Mary Tudor's house, which was in existence by 1522 when a driveway was built to connect it to the palace at Richmond. Around 1600, the land that would become the gardens was known as Kew Field, a large <b>field</b> <b>strip</b> farmed by one of the new private estates.|$|E

25|$|Early landowners in St. Louis were {{required}} to enclose their lots with wooden or stone fencing for security reasons, and lots contained sheds, barns, vegetable gardens and sometimes fruit trees. No retail or commercial district existed, and business generally was conducted in homes or in the market square. Houses ranged from one-room huts to large, multiroom buildings such as Lacl√®de's stone headquarters. Most homes, however, were square, of poteaux-en-terre construction, and with steep oak shingle roofs with long overhangs in typical Creole design. The residents depended on common land south of the town for firewood and pasture land, which extended from Third Street west nearly three miles, north to Mill Creek, and south for several miles until the 1790s when it was truncated for the new settlement of Carondelet, Missouri. The commons were continually reduced in size after the mid-1780s due to land grants to new settlers, and the remaining land not granted became Lafayette Park in 1838. In addition to access to the commons, each lot owner was granted individual use of a <b>field</b> <b>strip</b> measuring one arpent wide and forty arpents long. Each strip {{was part of a}} larger group of fields that were platted at the same time; a total of four such fields were created between 1766 and 1769, and by the 1790s nearly 6,000 acres were under cultivation around St. Louis. In spite of this agriculture, fur trading was the major focus of many residents.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, most M1911A1s had been {{replaced}} by the Beretta M9, though a limited number remain in use by special units. The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in particular were noted for continuing the use of M1911 pistols for selected personnel in MEU(SOC) and reconnaissance units (though the USMC also purchased over 50,000 M9 pistols.) For its part, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issued a requirement for a [...]45 ACP pistol in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) trials. This resulted in the Heckler & Koch OHWS becoming the MK23 Mod 0 Offensive Handgun Weapon System (itself being heavily based on the 1911's basic <b>field</b> <b>strip),</b> beating the Colt OHWS, a much modified M1911. Dissatisfaction with the stopping power of the 9mm Parabellum cartridge used in the Beretta M9 has actually promoted re-adoption of pistols based on the [...]45 ACP cartridge such as the M1911 design, along with other pistols, among USSOCOM units in recent years, though the M9 remains predominant both within SOCOM and in the U.S. military in general.|$|E

50|$|The P320 was {{designed}} to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous slide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be <b>field</b> <b>stripped</b> with no tools. Additionally, the firearm can also be <b>field</b> <b>stripped</b> without depressing the trigger, an additional safety feature to prevent negligent discharge of the weapon.|$|R

50|$|Related to the Braunton Great Field and Braunton Marsh, this {{landscape}} type is {{set back from}} the river Taw {{to the south and}} protected from westerly maritime influence by Saunton Sands and Braunton Burrows. Its key characteristics include; open flat landform, often with distinct vegetated floodplain edge, shallow watercourses screened by riparian vegetation, pastoral or arable land use with variable field sizes, rare survival of medieval open <b>field</b> <b>strip</b> system (Braunton Great Field), unenclosed or with stone walls and hedges as well as drainage ditches, unsettled, narrow winding lanes, open internally with views out screened by boundary vegetation, estuarine or river valley character and exceedingly tranquil.|$|E
50|$|The pistol's toothy surface, and grooved grips, {{provide good}} grip even with wet hands. The K100 also {{features}} ambidextrous controls, supporting both left and right-handed users. When field stripping models made prior to 2012, the forward {{part of the}} trigger guard unlatches from the gripframe and is flexed downward out of the frame. With the forward part of the trigger guard flexed downward, the slide moves farther to the rear than normal and can be pulled to the extreme rear and then lifted up and off the frame. The <b>field</b> <b>strip</b> is roughly similar to the Walther PPK/PPKS fieldstrip except that the triggerguard is not hinged on the K100, instead its polymer construction allows it to flex downward.|$|E
5000|$|The {{slide and}} barrel are high {{strength}} steel and the frame is aluminum alloy. Available finishes are black matte, nickel, and a two-tone with a nickel finished slide and satin black frame. All the available finishing styles are non-reflective. The polymer grips are integrated [...] "wraparound" [...] style. The trigger is double-action for the first shot, single-action thereafter. The magazine is double stack and the slide remains open after the last round is fired. The magazine release button can be reversed for left-handed shooters {{and it has a}} [...] "round in the chamber" [...] indicator. It is one of the easiest, if not the easiest, semi-automatic handgun to <b>field</b> <b>strip</b> for cleaning.|$|E

5000|$|The L98A2 Cadet GP Rifle is {{a version}} of the British Armed Forces' L85A2 (both part of the SA80 family of weapons) adapted to fire only on a {{semi-automatic}} setting. In order to become proficient on the weapon and pass the one-star Skill at Arms (SAA) test, cadets must show they can handle the weapon safely, perform stoppage drills, and <b>field</b> <b>strip</b> the weapon for daily cleaning. Once this has been done, cadets can fire the weapon using blank rounds in field exercises and with live rounds on a range possibly gaining marksman qualification badges based on their accuracy. There is also a deactivated version of the GP Rifle, the L103A2 DP (Drill Purpose), this is generally used for teaching cadets the basics of the weapon they are handling and for rifle drill. Cadets also learn to handle and fire the Rifle No 8 [...]22 calibre rifle on a 25 m rifle range.|$|E
