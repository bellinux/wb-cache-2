5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{red list}} of {{threatened}} species includes one mayfly: Tasmanophlebi lacuscoerulei, the large blue lake mayfly, {{which is a}} native of Australia and is listed as endangered because its alpine habitat <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to climate change.|$|E
5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
5|$|Argentina <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> {{and will}} likely be {{significantly}} impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E

5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to hard winters, {{especially}} if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} uses {{in vitro}} biological assays such as PCR-ELISA or Fluorescence in situ hybridization. The assay detects a molecule, often in low concentrations, {{that is a}} marker of disease or risk in a sample taken from a patient. Preservation of the sample before analysis is critical. Manual handling should be minimised. The fragile RNA molecule poses certain challenges. As part of the cellular process of expressing genes as proteins, it offers a measure of gene expression but it <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to hydrolysis and breakdown by ever-present RNAse enzymes. Samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or incubated in preservation agents.|$|E

50|$|They <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> at exposed waterholes or in {{plantations}} {{where they}} are preyed on by lanner falcons and black sparrowhawks respectively. In addition they are preyed on by reptiles, wild cats, jackals, genets, herons, storks, eagles and barn owls. Nests <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to birds, snakes and locally, grey squirrel.|$|R
5|$|Myrmecia ants deter many {{potential}} predators {{due to their}} sting. The blindsnake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens consumes the larvae and pupae of Myrmecia, while avoiding the potent sting of the adults, which it <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) also eats the eggs and larvae. Nymphs of the assassin bug species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants to themselves by {{trying to make the}} ant sting them, by waving its hind legs around to attract a potential prey item. Body remains of Myrmecia have been found in the stomach contents of the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis). The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), the black currawong (Strepera versicolor), and the white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) prey on these ants, but few are successfully taken.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia terminalis {{grows in}} a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is {{essential}} for many species to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before the next fire.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes {{are usually}} {{together}} in pairs or small groups consisting of families, {{such as a}} mated pair and their young, or a male with several females having kinship ties. The young of the mated pair remain with their parents to assist in caring for new kits. The species primarily feeds on small rodents, though it may also target rabbits, game birds, reptiles, invertebrates and young ungulates. Fruit and vegetable matter is also eaten sometimes. Although the red fox tends to kill smaller predators, including other fox species, it <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to attack from larger predators, such as wolves, coyotes, golden jackals and medium- and large-sized felines.|$|E
30|$|Personal {{information}} such as country of birth and place of birth can <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to informed guessing. The use of questions {{in the public domain}} can <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to guessing. It may not be true for all, but traditionally people use a common family and surname. Jobling [31] indicates that from five thousand years ago, fathers have passed their surname to children. The analysis of answers to profile question “Father’s surname” in the learning phase revealed that, 64 % of participants had a common surname as their fathers’ and can <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to guessing attack.|$|R

5|$|Survival horror {{refers to}} a subgenre of horror video games. The player {{character}} <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> and under-armed, which puts emphasis on puzzle-solving and evasion, rather than violence. Games commonly challenge the player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition. Another major theme throughout the genre is that of isolation. Typically, these games contain relatively few non-player characters and, as a result, frequently tell much of their story second-hand through the usage of journals, texts, or audio logs.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Valley is {{surrounded}} by a number of interconnected fault systems and <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms. The area was equipped with an array of strong motion seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby earthquakes and seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events. Four of the region's known strike-slip faults and one additional newly discovered normal fault all broke the surface during the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The alloy {{of copper}} and nickel, called cupronickel, {{is used in}} low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US 5-cent coin (currently called a nickel) {{consists}} of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations. Shakudō is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4–10%, that can be patinated to a dark blue or black color.|$|E

5|$|The {{floral emblem}} for its {{home state of}} New South Wales, Telopea speciosissima has {{featured}} prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since Australian federation. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to various fungal diseases and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Horticulturists have also developed hybrids with T.oreades and T.mongaensis which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Java {{is the most}} densely {{populated}} island on earth, and <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to both large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, due to its location near the Sunda Trench, a convergent plate boundary where the Australian tectonic plate is subducting beneath Indonesia. Three great earthquakes occurred {{in the span of}} three years to the northwest on the Sumatra portion of the trench. The 2004 M9.15 Sumatra–Andaman, the 2005 M8.7 Nias–Simeulue, and the 2007 M8.4 Mentawai earthquakes produced the largest release of elastic strain energy since the 1957/1964 series of shocks on the Aleutian/Alaska Trench.|$|E
5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness {{relates to the}} ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it <b>is</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E
