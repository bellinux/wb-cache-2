5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|Byte {{magazine}} {{published an}} assembly language version of Spacewar in 1977 that {{ran on the}} Altair 8800 and other Intel 8080-based microcomputers using an oscilloscope as the graphical display and a lookup table for orbits, {{as well as a}} three-dimensional variant in 1979 written <b>in</b> <b>Tiny</b> BASIC. More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 emulator, was made available to play on the internet in 2012. The only working PDP-1s that are known to exist are kept in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, where demonstrations of the machine are held, which include playing Spacewar.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{last week}} of {{production}} was fraught with issues. Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage; the lights were faulty, and three people were nearly electrocuted. On January 26, 1979, the film finally wrapped after 125 days. The three leads (Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley) delivered their final lines at 4:50 pm. Before the crew could go home, a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V'Ger. The script prescribed a heavy emphasis on lighting, with spiraling and blinding white lights. Collins was covered <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> dabs of cotton glued to his jacket; these highlights were designed to create a body halo. Helicopter lights, 4000–watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker's fusion with the living machine. The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew. The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles {{in the air to}} be illuminated, creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard. During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly, and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print.|$|E

25|$|A tea bag is a small, porous paper, silk or nylon sealed bag {{containing}} {{tea leaves}} for brewing tea. Tea bags were invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1903.

25|$|The {{historical}} orthography {{is found}} in most Japanese dictionaries, such as Kōjien.

Ellipses are used to save space when the historical and modern spellings are identical. Older editions of the Kōjien gave priority to the historical orthography.|$|E

[...] "Oh, it must be lovely, living on a houseboat," [...] said Ethelbertha, with a gasp of ecstasy; [...] "it must be like living in a doll's house." ...|$|R

The anterior and posterior dorsal fins are hyaline, with the first few membranes of the spinous dorsal fin dusted <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> brown spots. The anal, ventral and pectoral fins are also hyaline, with the pectoral having a greenish upper margin and base. The caudal fin is whitish with dark margins.|$|E
25|$|Other {{materials}} were also scavenged, such as Klim cans; tin cans that had originally held powdered milk {{supplied by the}} Red Cross for the prisoners. The metal in the cans could be fashioned into various tools and items, for example scoops and lamps, fueled by fat skimmed off soup served at the camp and collected <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> tin vessels, with wicks made from old and worn clothing. The main use of the Klim tins, however, was for the extensive ventilation ducting in all three tunnels.|$|E
25|$|During {{production}} of the series' third season, Charlie Adler left the show due to a conflict with the producers. Adler was upset {{that he had not}} landed a role in Animaniacs while voice actors with smaller roles <b>in</b> <b>Tiny</b> Toon Adventures like Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche, and Frank Welker were given starring roles in the new series. John Kassir replaced Adler {{for the remainder of the}} show's run. Joe Alaskey, the voice of Plucky Duck, also left Tiny Toons for financial reasons, but returned when an agreement was reached with the studio.|$|E

25|$|Hausgemacht (German for home-made, often {{abbreviated}} as HG) {{refers to}} clandestine absinthe (not {{be confused with}} the Swiss La Clandestine brand) that is home-distilled by hobbyists. It {{should not be confused with}} absinthe kits. Hausgemacht absinthe is produced <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> quantities for personal use and not for the commercial market. Clandestine production increased after absinthe was banned, when small producers went underground, most notably in Switzerland. Although the ban has been lifted in Switzerland, some clandestine distillers have not legitimised their production. Authorities believe that high taxes on alcohol and the mystique of being underground are likely reasons.|$|E
25|$|Fulco {{was born}} <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> Paincourtville in Assumption Parish in South Louisiana, to Rosario Fulco {{and the former}} Concetta Russo, both natives of Cefalù, Sicily. He was the twelfth of {{thirteen}} children. The Fulcos moved to Shreveport in 1909, where Frank was educated in the Shreveport public schools and graduated from C.E. Byrd High School in 1928. He attended Tulane University in New Orleans, {{where he was a}} member of the boxing team. In 1934, Fulco married the former Josie Tritico (1914–2001) of Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish in southwestern Louisiana. The marriage lasted until Fulco's death; Josie died two years later.|$|E
25|$|The phrase {{sweatshop}} {{was coined}} in 1850, meaning a factory or workshop where workers are treated unfairly, for example having low wages, working {{long hours and}} in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York {{for more than one}} century. Many of them worked <b>in</b> <b>tiny,</b> stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley’s Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create ‘sweating system’ of workers. (Blackburn, 1991) The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s.  This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>tiny</b> villages {{where there}} was no {{permanent}} Nazi military presence, such as Dąbrowa Rzeczycka, Kępa Rzeczycka and Wola Rzeczycka near Stalowa Wola, some Jews were able to openly participate in the lives of their communities. Olga Lilien, recalling her wartime experience in the 2000 book To Save a Life: Stories of Holocaust Rescue, was sheltered by a Polish family in a village near Tarnobrzeg, where she survived the war despite the posting of a 200 deutsche mark reward by the Nazi occupiers for information on Jews in hiding. Chava Grinberg-Brown from Gmina Wiskitki recalled in a postwar interview that some farmers used the threat of violence against a fellow villager who intimated the desire to betray her safety. Polish-born Israeli writer and Holocaust survivor Natan Gross, in his 2001 book Who Are You, Mr. Grymek?, told of a village near Warsaw where a local Nazi collaborator was forced to flee when it became known he reported the location of a hidden Jew.|$|E
25|$|The wing {{included}} three clawed fingers; however, unlike in some more primitive theropods, the longest two fingers were not separate, but were bound {{together by the}} skin and other tissue forming the wing, so Anchiornis was functionally two-fingered. These bound fingers were incorporated into a post-patagium, or flap of skin and other tissues that helped support the bases of the main wing feathers. Like the toes, the skin around {{the bottom of the}} fingers was covered <b>in</b> <b>tiny,</b> rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the finger bones was twice as thick as the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the fingers were straight and smooth without any major creases at the joints. Scales and skin around the fingers is very rarely preserved in fossils of early pennaraptorans, the only notable exceptions being Anchiornis and Caudipteryx, which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings.|$|E
25|$|The 'Diwan-E-Khas' (Sabha Niwas) or the 'Hall of Private Audience' is an enchanting chamber, {{with the}} ceiling painted in rich {{red and gold}} colours, which still looks vibrant. It is a major {{attraction}} in the Mubarak Mahal courtyard. This chamber, functioning now as an art gallery, has exhibits of exquisite miniature paintings (of Rajastahni, Mughal and Persian art), ancient texts, embroidered rugs, Kashmir shawls and carpets. The ceiling is richly decorated. At present, it is an art gallery showcasing enthralling painted ceilings and rare ancient handwritten original manuscripts of Hindu scriptures (the Hindu holy scripture of the Bhagavad Gita handwritten <b>in</b> <b>tiny</b> script). Also seen in the art gallery is the Royal throne (called as Takth-e-Rawal) that was {{the seat of the}} Maharaja during public audience. It was mounted on an elephant or carried by palanquin bearers during the Maharajas visit outside the palace. At the entry gateway to the hall, two large elephants, each made out of single marble rock are on display.|$|E
