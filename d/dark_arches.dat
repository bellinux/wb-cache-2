Much of it is supported on Victorian brick-vaulted arches situated just off Neville Street which contain a centre consisting of cafés, restaurants, shops and exhibition spaces called Granary Wharf, known locally as the <b>Dark</b> <b>Arches.</b>|$|E
500|$|The archipelago's {{isolation}} {{has resulted}} in a lack of biodiversity. The most successful colonists with nearly two hundred species are the flies followed by beetles with approximately 140 species. There are no bees on the islands so the flies are probably important pollinators of plants. One beetle, the rare and endangered weevil, Ceutorhynchus insularis, [...] is known from only Dùn and the Westmann Islands, an archipelago off the south-west coast of Iceland. Less than one hundred species of butterfly and moth occur, compared to 367 recorded on the Western Isles. Red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) and painted lady (Vanessa cardui) are two of only seven species of butterflies, both well known and common migrants. Common summer moths are the antler (Cerapteryx graminis), <b>dark</b> <b>arches</b> (Apamea monoglypha) and the migrant silver Y (Autographa gamma). One unusual moth recorded is the least carpet (Idaea rusticata), an occasional migrant, and in the UK, usually recorded in the south-east of England. On 4 September 2014 a rare vagrant oleander hawk-moth (Daphnis nerii) was recorded. Oleander is not found in the UK every year, and the larva have never been recorded in the Britain.|$|E

We {{looked again}} at the heap of skulls and skeletons before us, and we {{observed}} that they were all small and that the articles of clothing intermingled with them and lying about were all women's apparel. These, then, were all women and girls. From my saddle I counted about a hundred skulls, not including those that were hidden beneath the others in the ghastly heap nor those that were scattered far and wide through the fields. The skulls were nearly all separated {{from the rest of the}} bones – the skeletons were nearly all headless. These women had all been beheaded...and the procedure seems to have been, as follows: They would seize a woman, strip her carefully to her chemise, laying aside articles of clothing that were valuable, with any ornaments and jewels she might have about her. Then as many of them as cared would violate her, and the last man would kill her or not as the humour took him....We looked into the church which had been blackened by the burning of the woodwork, but not destroyed, nor even much injured. It was a low building with a low roof, supported by heavy irregular arches, that as we looked in seemed scarcely high enough for a tall man to stand under. What we saw there was too frightful for more than a hasty glance. An immense number of bodies had been partially burnt there and the charred and blackened remains seemed to fill it half way up to the low <b>dark</b> <b>arches</b> and make them lower and darker still, were lying in a state of putrefaction too frightful to look upon. I had never imagined anything so horrible. We all turned away sick and faint, and staggered out of the fearful pest house glad to get into the street again. We walked about the place and saw the same thing repeated over and over a hundred times. Skeletons of men with the clothing and flesh still hanging to and rotting together; skulls of women, with the hair dragging in the dust. bones of children and infants everywhere. Here they show us a house where twenty people were burned alive; there another where a dozen girls had taken refuge, and been slaughtered to the last one, as their bones amply testified. Everywhere horrors upon horrors..." ...|$|E

60|$|Not {{five seconds}} had passed when {{he rose to}} the water’s surface—but what a change {{had taken place in}} that short time, in all his {{thoughts}} and feelings! Life—life in any form, poverty, misery, starvation—anything but death. He fought and struggled with the water that closed over his head, and screamed in agonies of terror. The curse of his own son rang in his ears. The shore—but one foot of dry ground—he could almost touch the step. One hand’s breadth nearer, and he was saved—but the tide bore him onward, under the <b>dark</b> <b>arches</b> of the bridge, and he sank to the bottom.|$|E

6000|$|We had half-an-hour, I think, for tea. When I {{had money}} enough, I {{used to get}} half-a-pint of {{ready-made}} coffee and a slice of bread and butter. When I had none, I used {{to look at a}} venison shop in Fleet Street; or I have strolled, at such a time, as far as Covent Garden Market, and stared at the pineapples. I was fond of wandering about the Adelphi, because it was a mysterious place, with those <b>dark</b> <b>arches.</b> I see myself emerging one evening from some of these arches, on a little public-house close to the river, with an open space before it, where some coal-heavers were dancing; to look at whom I sat down upon a bench. I wonder what they thought of me! ...|$|E
60|$|Ricardo, {{leaning forward}} too, his nervous force gone, crestfallen like a beast of prey that has missed its spring, met her big grey eyes looking at him--wide open, observing, mysterious--from under the <b>dark</b> <b>arches</b> of her courageous eyebrows. Their faces {{were not a}} foot apart. He ceased feeling about his aching throat and dropped the palms of his hands heavily on his knees. He was not looking at her bare shoulders, at her strong arms; he was {{looking down at the}} floor. He had lost one of his straw slippers. A chair with a white dress on it had been overturned. These, with {{splashes}} of water on the floor out of a brusquely misplaced sponge-bath, were the only traces of the struggle.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} (that is, the next Minimul day, which is Munza night) crept slowly by. Nod was never left alone. Every hour the little soft-shuffling Mouse-faces tended and fed and watched him, and burnt little magic sticks around him. Three dead Skeetoes, with fast-shut eyes, {{lay on the}} floor, shot by their {{poisoned}} darts in the dusk of the evening, when he was carried into the big fire-chamber, or kitchen, again. They were soon skinned and trussed by the hungry Minimuls, and stretched along the spit. The smell of their roasting rose up in smoke. At last came sleeping-time again. And then, when all was silent, Nod rose softly from his grass-mat, and stealing down the low, narrow earth-run, looked out into the kitchen where he had lain all day. The fire was dying in faintly glowing embers. All was utterly still. But which way should he go now, he wondered, to seek his brothers? And which of these <b>dark</b> <b>arches</b> led to the open forest, the snow, and the Assasimmon? ...|$|E
60|$|The night passed, {{the gloom}} turned gray, the dawn stole cool and pale into the cañon. When Nas Ta Bega drove the mustangs into camp the lofty ramparts {{of the walls}} were rimmed with gold and the <b>dark</b> <b>arch</b> of Nonnezoshe began to lose its steely gray.|$|R

Conflicting currents met, and wrestled; and one <b>dark</b> <b>arch</b> led to channels, seaward tending.|$|R

60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had left the}} Hospital behind me, and was again setting towards the river; and in a short {{breathing}} space I was on Westminster-bridge, regaling my houseless eyes with the external walls of the British Parliament--the perfection of a stupendous institution, I know, and the admiration of all surrounding nations and succeeding ages, I do not doubt, but perhaps a little the better now and then for being pricked up to its work. Turning off into Old Palace-yard, the Courts of Law kept me company {{for a quarter of}} an hour; hinting in low whispers what numbers of people they were keeping awake, and how intensely wretched and horrible they were rendering the small hours to unfortunate suitors. Westminster Abbey was fine gloomy society for another quarter of an hour; suggesting a wonderful procession of its dead among the <b>dark</b> <b>arches</b> and pillars, each century more amazed by the century following it than by all the centuries going before. And indeed in those houseless night walks--which even included cemeteries where watchmen went round among the graves at stated times, and moved the tell-tale handle of an index which recorded that they had touched it at such an hour--it was a solemn consideration what enormous hosts of dead belong to one old great city, and how, if they were raised while the living slept, there would not be the space of a pin's point in all the streets and ways for the living to come out into. Not only that, but the vast armies of dead would overflow the hills and valleys beyond the city, and would stretch away all round it, God knows how far.|$|E
60|$|Alice hesitated no longer; but {{giving her}} Narragansett[4] a smart {{cut of the}} whip, {{she was the first}} to dash aside the slight {{branches}} of the bushes, and to follow the runner along the dark and tangled pathway. The young man regarded the last speaker in open admiration, and even permitted her fairer though certainly not more beautiful companion to proceed unattended, while he sedulously opened the way himself for the passage of her who has been called Cora. It would seem that the domestics had been previously instructed; for, instead of penetrating the thicket, they followed the route of the column; a measure which Heyward stated had been dictated by the sagacity of their guide, in order to diminish the marks of their trail, if, haply, the Canadian savages should be lurking so far in advance of their army. For many minutes the intricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue; after which they emerged from the broad border of underbrush which grew along the line of the highway, and entered under the high but <b>dark</b> <b>arches</b> of the forest. Here their progress was less interrupted, and the instant the guide perceived that the females could command their steeds, he moved on, at a pace between a trot and a walk, and at a rate which kept the sure-footed and peculiar animals they rode, at a fast yet easy amble. The youth had turned to speak to the dark-eyed Cora, when the distant sound of horses' hoofs, clattering over the roots of the broken way in his rear, caused him to check his charger; and, as his companions drew their reins at the same instant, the whole party came to a halt, in order to obtain an explanation of the unlooked-for interruption.|$|E
60|$|It {{is almost}} the correct {{literary}} sentiment to deplore the revolutionary improvements of Mr. Chambers and his following. It is easy to be a conservator of the discomforts of others; indeed, it is only our good qualities we find it irksome to conserve. Assuredly, in driving streets through the black labyrinth, a few curious old corners have been swept away, and some associations turned out of house and home. But what slices of sunlight, what breaths of clean air, have been let in! And what a picturesque world remains untouched! You go under <b>dark</b> <b>arches,</b> and down dark stairs and alleys. The way is so narrow that you can lay a hand on either wall; so steep that, in greasy winter weather, the pavement is almost as treacherous as ice. Washing dangles above washing from the windows; the houses bulge outwards upon flimsy brackets; you see a bit of sculpture in a dark corner; {{at the top of}} all, a gable and a few crowsteps are printed on the sky. Here, you come into a court where the children are at play and the grown people sit upon their doorsteps, and perhaps a church spire shows itself above the roofs. Here, in the narrowest of the entry, you find a great old mansion still erect, with some insignia of its former state—some scutcheon, some holy or courageous motto, on the lintel. The local antiquary points out where famous and well-born people had their lodging; and as you look up, out pops the head of a slatternly woman from the countess’s window. The Bedouins camp within Pharaoh’s palace walls, and the old war-ship is given over to the rats. We are already a far way from the days when powdered heads were plentiful in these alleys, with jolly, port-wine faces underneath. Even in the chief thoroughfares Irish washings flutter at the windows, and the pavements are encumbered with loiterers.|$|E

50|$|Thematically {{the novels}} draw upon Welsh mythology, {{particularly}} the Mabinogion. The novels are not, however, retellings of those myths, a point Alexander himself makes in an author's note for The Book of Three: {{stories have been}} conflated, and characters have been changed in both role and motive, so a student of Welsh culture should be prepared as Arawn becomes the books' <b>dark</b> <b>arch</b> enemy and Gwydion's negative traits are replaced with unclouded heroism.|$|R
60|$|We {{came up to}} the steps, and I was so {{crippled}} {{with fatigue}} and so dizzy and sick with the thin air, that I hardly knew what I was doing. We entered a low-browed, <b>dark,</b> <b>arched,</b> stone passage, smelling dismally of antiquity and dogs, when a brisk voice accosted me in the very choicest of French, and in terms of welcome as gay and courtly as if we were entering a salon.|$|R

5000|$|Botteghe Oscure was {{established}} in 1948.

6000|$|On {{the night}} of that day, while the hammers were still ringing by gaslight in the {{unfinished}} shop; while Brown and Jones were still busy with the goods, and Mrs. Jones was measuring out to the shop-girls yards of Magenta ribbon, short by an inch, Robinson again {{walked down to the}} bridge.

6000|$|There was {{a lovely}} garden to Mr. Spenlow's house; and though {{that was not the}} best time of the year for seeing a garden, it was so beautifully kept, that I was quite enchanted. There was a charming lawn, there were {{clusters}} of trees, and there were perspective walks that I could just distinguish in the <b>dark,</b> <b>arched</b> over with trellis-work, on which shrubs and flowers grew in the growing season. 'Here Miss Spenlow walks by herself,' I thought. 'Dear me!' ...|$|R
60|$|Little Gyp, aged {{nearly four}} and a half that first of May, {{stood at the edge of}} the tulip border, bowing to two hen turkeys who were poking their heads elegantly here and there among the flowers.

50|$|Although the arches {{appear to}} be part of one single structure, closer {{inspection}} reveals that it is a series of independent viaducts two or four tracks wide.
