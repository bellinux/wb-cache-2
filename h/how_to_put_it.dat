They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns {{how to do a}} straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E

This extended to a ten-shot lead after five holes in the final round. Kaymer found trouble in the bunkers, resulting in a round of 75 and a fall to third place behind Frenchman Gary Stal, who secured his first European Tour victory, and world number one Rory McIlroy. Speaking after the round, Kaymer told the media that he was [...] "in shock" [...] at the result: [...] "I'm surprised and shocked," [...] the German said. [...] "I don't really know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into words. It was very, very surprising today. It will take me {{a few days to}} reflect on this.

5000|$|Just as {{important}} as (if not more important than) any particular law was the value the rabbis placed on legal study and debate. The sages of the Talmud believed that when they taught the Oral Torah to their students, they were imitating Moses, who taught the law {{to the children of}} Israel. Moreover, the rabbis believed that [...] "the heavenly court studies Torah precisely as does the earthly one, even arguing about the same questions." [...] Thus, in debating and disagreeing over the meaning of the Torah or <b>how</b> best <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into practice, no rabbi felt that he (or his opponent) were in some way rejecting God or threatening Judaism; on the contrary, it was precisely through such arguments that the rabbis imitated and honored God.|$|R

500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and <b>how</b> she tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|R
