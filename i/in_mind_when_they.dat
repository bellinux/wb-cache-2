However, the resultant script changed along the way, with Souders eventually calling it [...] "a smorgasbord of what everybody wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perez was {{nominated}} for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress {{for her role in}} Peter Weir's 1993 film Fearless. She attended the ceremony with her father. In 1997, she starred in Perdita Durango, a controversial film in which many scenes of excessive violence, sex and nudity were edited out of the version released in the United States but remained intact in the version released throughout Latin America. In 1999, Perez starred in Nancy Savoca's The 24 Hour Woman. She provides the voices of Click, the camera, on Nick Jr.'s Go, Diego, Go! and Chel, a beautiful native woman in the DreamWorks Animation film The Road to El Dorado. She played corrupt police officer Carol Brazier in the Judd Apatow-produced film Pineapple Express, co-starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. Perez appeared on an episode of [...] in October 2009 about pedophiles' rights. Executive producer Neal Baer said the writers had Perez <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> wrote the role of a young sexual abuse victim's mother. She suffered a serious injury during the filming of the episode. Most recently, Perez is the subject of an album by Felt entitled [...] Perez was in a Mike Nichols production of The Play What I Wrote.|$|E

60|$|They set off {{early the}} next morning, and after his forced march, Gladwyne found the load given him {{sufficiently}} heavy. He was badly jaded, aching all over, and disturbed <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> camped near {{the summit of the}} divide late in the afternoon without his having been able to secure a word with Millicent alone. He felt that he must gain her consent to a formal engagement before Lisle let fall any hint of his suspicions, which he did not believe had been done so far. Afterward, knowing Millicent, he thought she would staunchly refuse to listen to anything to his discredit, and he could, if it were needful, ascribe Lisle's attack to jealousy. He must, however, also contrive to push on ahead of the party, on some excuse, and obliterate any remaining trace of the former expedition's provision caches; then he would be safe.|$|E
6000|$|What {{is true of}} tailed men {{applies to}} native answers about myths and customs when the {{questions}} are asked by persons who have not won {{the confidence of the}} people nor discovered their real beliefs by long and patient observation. This must be borne in mind when missionaries tell us that savages believe in one supreme deity, in a mediator, and the like, and it must be borne <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> tell us that savages have no supreme being at all. Always we must be wary! A very pleasing example of inconsistency in reports about the same race may be found in a comparison of the account of the Khonds in the thirteenth volume of the Royal Asiatic Society with the account given by General Campbell in his Personal Narrative, The inquirer in the former case did not know the Khond language, and trusted to interpreters, who were later expelled from the public service. General Campbell, on the other hand, believed himself to possess [...] "the confidence of the priests and chiefs," [...] and his description is quite different. In cases of contradictions like these, the anthropologist will do well to leave the subject alone, unless he has very strong reasons for believing one or other of the contending witnesses.|$|E

60|$|Again, it {{is a point}} {{worth noting}} that {{a great many of}} the very big animals which people have <b>in</b> their <b>minds</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> talk vaguely about {{everything}} having been so very much bigger 'in those days' have become extinct within a very late period, and are often, from the geological point of view, quite recent.|$|R
6000|$|The Kinetic class {{consists}} of types, various, of course, and merging insensibly along the boundary into the less representative constituents of the Poietic group, but distinguished {{by a more}} restricted range of imagination. Their imaginations do not range beyond the known, experienced, and accepted, though within these limits they may imagine as vividly or more vividly than members of the former group. They are often very clever and capable people, {{but they do not}} do, and they do not desire to do, new things. The more vigorous individuals of this class are the most teachable people in the world, and they are generally more moral and more trustworthy than the Poietic types. They live,--while the Poietics are always something of experimentalists with life. The characteristics of either of these two classes may be associated with a good or bad physique, with excessive or defective energy, with exceptional keenness of the senses in some determinate direction or such-like [...] "bent," [...] and the Kinetic type, just as the Poietic type, may display an imagination of restricted or of the most universal range. But a fairly energetic Kinetic is probably the nearest thing to that ideal our earthly anthropologists have <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> speak of the [...] "Normal" [...] human being. The very definition of the Poietic class involves a certain abnormality.|$|E
60|$|If {{there is}} one moment in a man's life when his {{interest}} for {{the world at large}} pales before the engrossing character of his own emotions, it is assuredly when that man first falls in love. Then, if never before, the world within excludes the world without. For of all our human passions none is so isolating as the tenderest. To shut that one other being in, we must of necessity shut all the rest of mankind out; and we do so with a reckless trust in our own self-sufficiency which has about it a touch of the sublime. The other millions are as though they were not, and we two are alone in the earth, which suddenly seems to have grown unprecedentedly beautiful. Indeed, it only needs such judicious depopulation to make of any spot an Eden. Perhaps the early Jewish myth-makers had some such thought <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> wrote their idyl of the cosmogony. The human traits are true to-day. Then at last our souls throw aside their conventional wrappings to stand revealed as they really are. Certain of comprehension, the thoughts we have never dared breathe to any one before, find a tongue for her who seems fore-destined to understand. The long-closed floodgates of feeling are thrown wide, and our personality, pent up from the time of its inception for very mistrust, sweeps forth in one uncontrollable rush. For then the most reticent becomes confiding; the most self-contained expands. Then every detail of our past lives assumes an importance which even we had not divined. To her we tell them all,--our boyish beliefs, our youthful fancies, the foolish with the fine, the witty with the wise, the little with the great. Nothing then seems quite unworthy, as nothing seems quite worthy enough. Flowers and weeds that we plucked upon our pathway, we heap them in her lap, certain that even the poorest will not be tossed aside. Small wonder that we bring as many as we may when she bends her head so lovingly to each.|$|E
5000|$|Mortimer Adler {{recognized}} the confusion {{resulting from the}} fact that there are [...] "several different objects men have <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> use the word freedom." [...] In The Idea of Freedom, Adler resolved this confusion by distinguishing the [...] "three kinds of freedom" [...] that various writers have <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> use the word. He calls these three kinds of freedom (1) [...] "circumstantial freedom," [...] (2) [...] "natural freedom," [...] and (3) [...] "acquired freedom."

Various aspects of chunking and coarticulation are discussed in view of their role in the production and perception of music, and it is suggested that coarticulation is an integral element of music and should be more extensively explored in the future...|$|R
