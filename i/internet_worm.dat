The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where confidential information can be transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a simple solution called “Buttercup ” to counter against attacks based on buffer-overflow exploits (such as CodeRed, Nimda, Slammer, and Blaster). We have implemented our idea in SNORT, and included 19 return address ranges of buffer-overflow exploits. With a suite of tests against 55 TCPdump traces, the false positive rate for our best algorithm is as low as 0. 01 %. This indicates that, potentially, Buttercup can drop 100 % worm attack packets on the wire while only 0. 01 % of the good packets will be sacrificed...|$|R

As part of our investigation, we crawl the Gnutella P 2 P network over a 12 day period collecting file names and file popularity statistics.

40|$|Abstract. From the {{appearance}} of CodeRed and SQL Slammer worm, {{we have learned that}} the early detection of worm epidemics is important to reduce the damage caused by their outbreak. One prominent characteristic of <b>Internet</b> <b>worms</b> is to choose next targets randomly by using a random generator. In this paper, we propose a new worm detection mechanism by checking the random distribution of destination addresses. Our mechanism generates the traffic matrix and checks the value of rank of it to detect the spreading of <b>Internet</b> <b>worms.</b> From the fact that a random binary matrix holds a high value of rank, ADUR (Anomaly Detection Using Randomness check) is proposed for detecting unknown worms based on the rank of the traffic matrix. From the experiments on various environments, we show that the ADUR mechanism effectively detects the spread of new worms in an early stage, even when there is only one host infected in a monitoring network. ...|$|R
