30|$|Non-{{governmental}} {{and governmental}} agencies are demanding for environmentally friendly mud systems. This increase in environmental awareness {{has made the}} drilling mud service companies to re-evaluate some of the chemicals and materials used as additives for mud systems. In this study, some <b>green</b> <b>materials</b> were considered as possible substitutes for PAC R in water-based drilling fluid systems. The rheological properties of four water-based mud systems with typical compositions were studied at 80 and 150  °F. These two temperature ranges were necessary so as to evaluate the effect of temperature on the viscosity, plastic viscosity and yield point properties of these mud systems formulated with these <b>green</b> <b>materials</b> as viscosifier. These <b>green</b> <b>materials</b> were processed to powder form and sieved to their finest particle sizes to reduce amount of solute that will {{be present in the}} water-based drilling fluid formed with the materials. The properties of the formulated mud systems were analyzed using API standard. These <b>green</b> <b>materials</b> behaved optimally as viscosifiers for the formulated water-based mud systems under ambient temperature. Also the mud systems behaviour at 150  °F showed a reduction in the flow properties at this high temperature as recorded in the literatures. From the results of the experiment, we can say that Kian (Averrhoa carambola L.) has the characteristic of being a substitute for PAC R when beneficiated for water-based drilling fluids.|$|R
