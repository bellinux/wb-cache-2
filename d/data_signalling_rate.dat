50|$|Cables having {{characteristics}} {{different from}} the twisted pair 24 AWG, 52.5 pF/meter (16 pF/foot), can also be employed within bounds mentioned above. First, determine the absolute loop resistance and capacitance values of the typical 24 AWG cable provided by the cable length associated with the <b>data</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>rate</b> desired from the figure. Then convert those values to equivalent lengths of the cable actually used. For example, longer distances would be possible when using 19 AWG, while shorter distances would be necessary for 28 AWG.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{permissible}} {{length of}} cable separating the master and slave {{is a function}} of <b>data</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>rate</b> and is influenced by the tolerable signal distortion, the amount of longitudinally coupled noise and ground potential differences introduced between the master and the slave circuit. Accordingly, users are advised to restrict cable length to a minimum.The type and length of the cable used must be capable of maintaining the necessary signal quality needed for the particular application. Furthermore, the cable balance must be such as to maintain acceptable crosstalk levels, both generated and received.|$|E

Twenty signals of crustal strains and tilts (DC) observed with extensometers and tiltmetersand of some other geophysical data, and ten signals of short-period (SP) and long-period (LP) seismic waves observed at three satellite stations are telemetered to the Observatory by a telephoneline with the <b>data</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>rate</b> of 4800 bits/sec. The dynamic range of the signals is 78 db forthe SP and LP data, and 66 db for the DC data, respectively. The output signals are recordedin both analog and digital forms. Seven DC signals and three SP data are also transmitted in the same way to the DisasterPrevention Research Institute, which is about 200 km distant from the Observatory.

40|$|Multiple side-bands are {{generated}} {{from a single}} laser diode {{with the aid of}} optical carrier suppression, which facilitates the transmission of reduced-rate parallel streams mapped to the side-bands. As a benefit, all the signal processing tasks including demultiplexing of a high <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> into multiple low <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> <b>signals</b> can be performed at the central unit. The technique can also be useful in reducing the effect of dispersion in case of high frequency Radio Over Fiber (ROF) communications by transmitting a single high <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> <b>signal</b> as multiple low <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> <b>signals</b> using the side-bands generated. We demonstrate the duplex transmission of a bit-rate of 768 Mbit/s over a 50 km fiber using three side-bands in each direction.

50|$|A January 2013 {{press release}} from the USB group {{revealed}} plans to update USB 3.0 to 10 Gbit/s (1250 MB/s). The group ended up creating a new USB specification, USB 3.1, which was released on 31 July 2013, replacing USB 3.0 standard. USB 3.1 specification takes over existing USB 3.0's SuperSpeed USB transfer rate, now calling it USB 3.1 Gen 1, and introduces a faster transfer rate called SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps, also called USB 3.1 Gen 2, putting it on par with a single first-generation Thunderbolt channel. The new mode's logo features a caption stylized as SUPERSPEED+. The USB 3.1 standard increases the maximum <b>data</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>rate</b> to 10 Gbit/s (1250 MB/s), double that of SuperSpeed USB, and reduces line encoding overhead to just 3% by changing the encoding scheme to 128b/132b.
