5|$|Street {{entertainment}} at Covent Garden {{was noted}} in Samuel Pepys's diary in May 1662, when he recorded the first {{mention of a}} Punch and Judy show in Britain. Impromptu performances of song and swimming were given by local celebrity William Cussans in the eighteenth century. Covent Garden is licensed for street entertainment, and performers audition for timetabled slots {{in a number of}} venues around the market, including the North Hall, West Piazza, and South Hall Courtyard. The courtyard space is dedicated to classical music only. There are street performances at Covent Garden Market <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> except Christmas Day. Shows run throughout the day and are about 30 minutes in length. In March 2008, the market owner, CapCo, proposed to reduce street performances to one 30-minute show each hour.|$|E
5|$|The Staten Island Railway {{provides}} full-time {{local service}} between Saint George and Tottenville {{along the east}} side of the borough. There is currently no subway service offered for those residents living on the western or northern sides of the borough, but Staten Island light rail has been proposed for these corridors. The MTA is planning to implement Bus Rapid Transit on the North Shore, while a study is underway to determine whether light rail should be implemented on Staten Island's west shore. The line has a route bullet similar to other subway routes: the letters SIR in a blue circle. It is used on timetables, on the MTA's site, and on some signage, but not on trains. The line runs 24 hours a day <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> (since May 10, 2015, the overnight service is on a 30-minute headway) and is one of only six mass-transit rail lines in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago 'L', the Green Line of the Minneapolis-St. Paul METRO, the PATH lines, and the New York City Subway).|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other Christian {{denominations}} {{derived from the}} 16th century Puritanism, many Friends do not observe religious festivals (e.g. Christmas, Lent, or Easter), but instead believe that Christ's birth, crucifixion, and resurrection, should be commemorated <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> For example, many Quakers feel that fasting at Lent, but then eating in excess at other {{times of the year}} is hypocrisy and therefore many Quakers, rather than observing Lent, live a simple lifestyle all the year round (see Testimony of Simplicity). These practices are {{often referred to as the}} testimony against times and seasons.|$|E
