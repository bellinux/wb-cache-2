5|$|Fundamental {{rights for}} Indians {{have also been}} aimed at {{overturning}} the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination {{on the grounds of}} religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of Indian constitution.|$|E
5|$|Related to privacy, the ACLU {{engaged in}} several battles {{to ensure that}} {{government}} records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family <b>Educational</b> <b>Rights</b> and Privacy Act, which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights, {{embodied}} in Part III of the Constitution, guarantee civil rights to all Indians, {{and prevent the}} State from encroaching on individual liberty while simultaneously placing upon it an obligation to protect the citizens' rights from encroachment by society. Seven fundamental rights were originally provided by the Constitution– right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and <b>educational</b> <b>rights,</b> right to property and right to constitutional remedies. However, the right to property was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment in 1978.|$|E

5|$|They {{concluded}} that the 'Greek lands' are located in a privileged geographic location {{at the crossroads of}} three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa, however, as the Ottoman administration was incapable of reinforcing the rule of law, economic activity couldn't flourish. Thus, they addressed the political and economic instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled to maintain control over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that lack of control, many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no <b>educational</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cultural and <b>Educational</b> <b>rights,</b> {{given in}} Articles 29 and 30, are {{measures}} {{to protect the rights}} of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by enabling them to conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination. Article 29 grants any section of citizens having a distinct language, script culture of its own, the right to conserve and develop the same, and thus safeguards the rights of minorities by preventing the State from imposing any external culture on them. It also prohibits discrimination against any citizen for admission into any educational institutions maintained or aided by the State, on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. However, this is subject to reservation of a reasonable number of seats by the State for socially and educationally backward classes, as well as reservation of up to 50percent of seats in any educational institution run by a minority community for citizens belonging to that community.|$|E

This first concession to women's <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.|$|E
25|$|Thomas D'Arcy McGee, an Irish-Montreal journalist, {{became a}} Father of Confederation in 1867.

He was instrumental in enshrining <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> for Catholics as a minority group in the Canadian Constitution. In 1868, he was assassinated in Ottawa. Historians are not sure who the murderer was, or what were his motivations. One theory is that a Fenian, Gaylord O'Neiel Whelan, was the assassin, attacking McGee for his recent anti-Raid statements.

The Albanian government claimed that although the Greek Army was evacuating the region, it was being replaced by guerrilla fighters organized by the Greek authorities. Meanwhile, on March 7, 1914, Prince William of Wied arrived in Albania and immediately ordered the Dutch colonel Lodewijk Thomson to negotiate with the Northern Epirote representatives. Thompson met with Karapanos on March 10, and proposed a limited local administration for Northern Epirus under a Christian governor in addition to guarantees of religious and <b>educational</b> <b>rights.</b> Thompson's initiative was dismissed by the Northern Epirote side.|$|E

25|$|Right-wing critics Morton and Knopff {{have raised}} several {{concerns}} about the Charter, notably by alleging {{that the federal government}} has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups. In their book The Charter Revolution & the Court Party, Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Trudeau and Chrétien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the Court Challenges Program to support minority language <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> claims. Morton and Knopff also assert that crown counsel has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights, particularly gay rights and women's rights.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Clifford won a {{landmark}} {{civil rights and}} education case before the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. In Williams v. Board of Education, Clifford argued against the Tucker County Board of Education's decision to shorten the school year for African-American school children from nine months to five months, keeping a full term for white students. Mrs. Carrie Williams, the colored school's teacher, approached Clifford. He encouraged her to continue teaching for the full nine months, regardless of funding. Clifford then {{filed a lawsuit against}} the school board for Williams' back pay. Clifford won the case at a jury trial, and then won again before the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. The Court's decision bolstered equal <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> for African-American students statewide.|$|E
25|$|Since 1982, both parliaments {{have had}} {{to comply with the}} Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalized a number of {{fundamental}} human rights and <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> of minorities in all provinces (education is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada). Prior to this, Quebec was effectively the sole province required constitutionally to finance the educational needs of its linguistic minority. Ontario and Quebec are both required to finance schools for their principal religious minorities (Roman Catholic in Ontario, Protestant in Quebec), but only in Quebec is the minority almost completely composed of speakers of the minority language. (Quebec also provided English schools for anglophone Roman Catholics.) In 1997, an amendment to the constitution allowed for Quebec to replace its system of denominational school boards with a system of linguistic school boards.|$|E

25|$|A {{political}} stalemate {{between the}} French- and English-speaking legislators, {{as well as}} fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the American Civil War, led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The British North America Act took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the British North America Act to safeguard existing <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> and privileges of Protestant and the Catholic minority. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority.

500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal <b>educational</b> <b>rights</b> were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women {{to be careful about}} marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E

Under the IDEA, FAPE is defined as an educational program that is individualized to a specific child, designed to meet that child's unique needs, provides access to the general curriculum, meets the grade-level standards established by the state, and from which the child receives educational benefit. The United States Department of Education issues regulations that define and govern the provision of FAPE.|$|R
