I have quantified energy independence for the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in order to statistically analyze the possible relationship between energy independence and political and economic globalization.

A third trihydroxy acid, 8,9,12-trihydroxy-5Z,10E,14Z eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin C3 or TrXC3), has been detected in rabbit and mouse aorta tissue incubated with arachidonic acid. The metabolism of HxA3 to TrXA3 and HXB3 to TrX is accomplished by soluble epoxide hydrolase in mouse liver; since it is widely distributed in various tissues of various mammalian species, including humans, soluble epoxide hydrolase may be the principal enzyme responsible for metabolizing these and perhaps other hepoxilin compounds. It seems possible, however, that other similarly acting epoxide hydrolases such as microsomal epoxide hydrolase or epoxide hydrolase 2 may prove to hepoxilin hydrolase activity. While the trihydroxy products of hepoxilin synthesis are {{generally considered to be}} inactive and the sEH pathway therefore considered as functioning to limiting the actions of the hepoxilins, some studies found that TrXA3, TrXB3, and TrXC3 were more powerful than HxA3 in relaxing pre-contracted mouse arteries and that TrXC3 was a relatively potent relaxer of rabbit pre-contracted aorta.|$|E

25|$|In {{the above}} models, the nucleons may occupy orbitals in pairs, due to being fermions, which allows to explain even/odd Z and N effects {{well-known}} from experiments. The exact nature and capacity of nuclear shells differs {{from those of}} electrons in atomic orbitals, primarily because the potential well in which the nucleons move (especially in larger nuclei) {{is quite different from}} the central electromagnetic potential well which binds electrons in atoms. Some resemblance to atomic orbital models may be seen in a small atomic nucleus like that of helium-4, in which the two protons and two neutrons separately occupy 1s orbitals analogous to the 1s orbital for the two electrons in the helium atom, and achieve unusual stability for the same reason. Nuclei with 5 nucleons are all <b>extremely</b> <b>unstable</b> and short-lived, yet, helium-3, with 3 nucleons, is very stable even with lack of a closed 1s orbital shell. Another nucleus with 3 nucleons, the triton hydrogen-3 is unstable and will decay into helium-3 when isolated. Weak nuclear stability with 2 nucleons {NP} in the 1s orbital is found in the deuteron hydrogen-2, with only one nucleon in each of the proton and neutron potential wells. While each nucleon is a fermion, the {NP} deuteron is a boson and thus does not follow Pauli Exclusion for close packing within shells. Lithium-6 with 6 nucleons is highly stable without a closed second 1p shell orbital. For light nuclei with total nucleon numbers 1 to 6 only those with 5 do not show some evidence of stability. Observations of beta-stability of light nuclei outside closed shells indicate that nuclear stability is much more complex than simple closure of shell orbitals with magic numbers of protons and neutrons.|$|E
25|$|The {{years after}} the end of the War of Independence were <b>extremely</b> <b>unstable,</b> and would {{continue}} to be unstable through most of the rest of the 19th century. Dolores and San Miguel adopted the names of Dolores Hidalgo and San Miguel de Allende in honor of those who began the independence movement and in 1826, the first constitution of the state of Guanajuato was adopted. Like much of the rest of the country, Guanajuato was affected by the prolonged fighting between Liberal and Conservative factions as well as the foreign incursions that dominated the 19th century. Guanajuato's status vacillated between state (when Liberals were in charge) and department (when Conservatives held the upper hand). Under Liberal ideals, educational institutions such as the Colegio de la Santisima Trinidad and the Colegio de la Purisima Concepción were secularized and under control of the State. In 1847, General Gabriel Valencia raised an army of 6,000 men to fight the U.S. invasion of Mexico. In 1848, in opposition to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, General Marian Paredes, General Manuel Doblado and priest Celedonio Dómeco de Jarauta revolted, taking the state capital, but they were defeated and Domeco was executed by firing squad. In 1855, Conservative Manuel Doblado, then the governor of Guanajuato, forced Juan Álvarez out of the presidency after he took power from Antonio López de Santa Anna. In 1858, the government under President Benito Juárez moved from Mexico City to the city of Guanajuato before moving again to Manzanillo and then Veracruz during the Reform War. During this three-year period, the state would vacillate various times between the Liberals and Conservatives. In 1863, it was taken over by the French as they installed Maximilian I as emperor of Mexico. Maximillian did not reign long but the governor he appointed for Guanajuato, Florencio Antillón remained in Guanajuato until 1877.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Ensemble Kalman {{filter and}} Ensemble square root filters are data {{assimilation}} {{methods used to}} combine high dimensional nonlinear models with observed data. These methods {{have proved to be}} indispensable tools in science and engineering as they allow computationally cheap, low dimensional ensemble state approximation for extremely high dimensional turbulent forecast models. From a theoretical perspective, these methods are poorly understood, {{with the exception of a}} recently established but still incomplete nonlinear stability theory. Moreover, recent numerical and theoretical studies of catastrophic filter divergence have indicated that stability is a genuine mathematical concern and can not be taken for granted in implementation. In this article we propose a simple modification of ensemble based methods which resolves these stability issues entirely. The method involves a new type of adaptive covariance inflation, which comes with minimal additional cost. We develop a complete nonlinear stability theory for the adaptive method, yielding Lyapunov functions and geometric ergodicity under weak assumptions. We present numerical evidence which suggests the adaptive methods have improved accuracy over standard methods and completely eliminate catastrophic filter divergence. This enhanced stability allows for the use of <b>extremely</b> cheap, <b>unstable</b> forecast integrators, which would otherwise lead to widespread filter malfunction...|$|R
