40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Recent {{findings}} indicate that metabolic disturbances are involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology and influence the susceptibility to treatment, directing attention towards anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and pioglitazone. Liraglutide, a drug of the glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) family, is also anti-diabetic and weight-reducing and is moreover, directly neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory in {{a broad spectrum of}} experimental models of brain disease. In this study we investigate the potential for this FDA-approved drug, liraglutide, as a treatment for MS by utilizing the experimental model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Methods: EAE was induced in 30 female Lewis rats that subsequently received twice-daily liraglutide (200 µg/kg s. c.) or saline. Healthy controls were included (saline, n= 6, liraglutide, n= 7). Clinical score and weight were assessed daily by blinded observers. Animals were killed at peak disease severity (day 11) or if exceeding <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> (clinical score ≥ 4). Protein levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), amyloid precursor protein (APP, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were determined. Results: Liraglutide treatment delayed disease onset (group clinical score significantly > 0) by two days and markedly reduced disease severity (median clinical score 2 vs. 5; p= 0. 0003). Fourteen of 15 (93 %) of vehicle-treated rats reached the <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> (clinical score ≥ 4) by day 11 compared to 5 of 15 (33 %) of liraglutide-treated rats (p= 0. 0004). Liraglutide substantially increased the mitochondrial antioxidant MnSOD (p< 0. 01) and reduced the neurodegenerative marker APP (p= 0. 036) in the brain. GFAP levels were not significantly changed with drug treatment (p= 0. 09) Conclusion: We demonstrate, for the first time, that liraglutide treatment delays onset of EAE in Lewis rats and is associated with improved protective capacity against oxidative stress. These data suggest GLP- 1 receptor agonists should be investigated further as a potential therapy for MS. Keywords: GLP- 1, EAE, Multiple Sclerosis, liraglutide, MS, MnSOD, AP...|$|E
30|$|The {{limitations}} {{of our study}} are the rather small numbers of animals per group. Our data are therefore underpowered to exclude that the observed beneficial effect of nalbuphine on the wellbeing of Wistar rats had an adverse effect on mortality. No repeated blood sampling was performed in long-term experiments. However, repetitive blood sampling (e.g., via tail vein under brief sedation) likely would have influenced the outcome during the 48 -h mortality study. Premature termination of experiments affected the outcome. A clinical score of six had been defined as a <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> by our veterinary committee. There is however scarce evidence in septic rats that this threshold corresponds to imminent death. Within the short-term experiments, {{the order of the}} low and high nalbuphine dose was always the same; therefore, a bias due to the order of the experiment cannot be excluded. Finally, we cannot provide data on possible immune system changes in sepsis due to nalbuphine. However, interactions of the immune system with opioids have mainly been reported for morphine [26, 27]. In CLP mice, buprenorphine or tramadol had some effects on white blood cells and cytokines [28, 29].|$|E
40|$|Solid {{tumors in}} {{mice and rats}} may be induced by the {{administration}} of chemical carcinogens or viruses, inoculation with tumor cell lines, transplant of tumor fragments, or they may also occur spontaneously in certain rodent strains. Solid tumor growth may be debilitating for the animal. Therefore, the health and welfare of test subjects need to be continually assessed and documented {{in order to maximize}} data acquisition while minimizing pain and distress. To that end, tumor studies commonly require special consideration of humane endpoints which are the point at which pain or distress in an experimental animal is prevented, terminated, or relieved. The use of humane endpoints contributes to refinement by providing an alternative to experimental endpoints that may result in unrelieved or severe animal pain and distress.

40|$|AbstractVaccine potency {{and safety}} testing is {{characterized}} by extensive use of laboratory animals and a relatively high percentage of test methods that involve severe pain and distress. This is particularly true for tests {{that are based on}} infection or challenge with a virulent microorganism. Traditionally, vaccine potency tests on inactivated vaccines require a vaccination–challenge procedure using severe clinical signs or even lethality as endpoints. For several of these vaccines, 3 R methods have been developed that include a nonclinical endpoint, ultimately resulting in reduction of animal numbers and a significant decrease in severity level. An example is the use of serology in potency testing of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccines. For some potency tests, however, replacement of the challenge procedure is not (yet) possible, and the implementation of <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints</b> might be an approach to limit the level and duration of pain and distress. The application of these endpoints is now allowed in most pharmacopoeias. Establishing <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints</b> in vaccine potency testing requires the identification of parameters that are predictive of death, or severe clinical signs, in the animal during the observation period. As a case study, we present the results of work we performed on the identification of <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints</b> in whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccine potency testing (the mouse protection test or the Kendrick test). In this potency test, mice are challenged by intracerebral route 14 days after immunization with a lethal dose of virulent B.  pertussis microorganisms. Animals are observed for 14 days, and the number of mice per dose group surviving this period is used for probit analysis and estimation of potency. We have studied two types of humane endpoints: clinical signs and pathophysiological parameters (body weight and body temperature). Clinical signs in a wP potency test range from piloerection, hunched back posture, apathy, and convulsions to moribund condition. Also body temperature drops, and animals lose up to 50 % of their body weight post-challenge. Parameters were “validated” for relevance (prediction of death within the observation period) and reliability. Recommendations are given for implementation of <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints</b> in vaccine potency testing, also taking into account potential obstacles...|$|R

To evaluate mucopolysaccharidosis-like features of the feline SD model, we utilized radiography, MRI, echocardiography, histopathology and GAG quantification of both central nervous system and peripheral tissues/fluids. The feline SD model exhibits cardiac valvular and structural abnormalities, skeletal changes and spinal cord compression that are consistent with accumulation of GAGs, but are much less prominent than the severe neurologic disease that defines the <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> (4. 5 +/- 0. 5 months).

40|$|Background: GM 1 -gangliosidosis is a glycosphingolipid (GSL) {{lysosomal}} {{storage disease}} {{caused by a}} genetic deficiency of acid b-galactosidase (bgal), which results in the accumulation of GM 1 -ganglioside and its asialo-form (GA 1) primarily in the CNS.

Currently, there are no effective therapies {{for the treatment of}} GM 1 -gangliosidosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we examined the effect of thalamic infusion of AAV 2 / 1 -bgal vector in adult GM 1 mice on enzyme distribution, activity, and GSL content in the CNS, motor behavior, and survival. Six to eight week-old GM 1 mice received bilateral injections of AAV vector in the thalamus, or thalamus and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) with pre-determined endpoints at 1 and 4 months post-injection, and the <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint,</b> or 52 weeks of age. Enzyme activity was elevated throughout the CNS of AAV-treated GM 1 mice and GSL storage nearly normalized in most structures analyzed, except in the spinal cord which showed, 50 % reduction compared to age-matched untreated GM 1 mice spinal cord. Survival was significantly longer in AAV-treated GM 1 mice (52 wks) than in untreated mice.

Glycolipids are the principal storage product in GM 1 gangliosidosis whose pathogenic mechanism is not completely understood. Targeted lipidomics analysis was performed to better define disease mechanisms and identify markers of disease progression for upcoming clinical trials in humans. 36 sphingolipids and subspecies associated with ganglioside biosynthesis were tested in the cerebrospinal fluid of untreated GM 1 cats at a <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> (∼ 8  months), AAV-treated GM 1 cats (∼ 5 years old), and normal adult controls. In untreated GM 1 cats, significant alterations were noted in 16  sphingolipid species, including gangliosides (GM 1 and GM 3), lactosylceramides, ceramides, sphingomyelins, monohexosylceramides, and sulfatides. Variable degrees of correction in many lipid metabolites reflected the efficacy of AAV gene therapy. Sphingolipid levels were highly predictive of neurologic disease progression, with 11 metabolites having a coefficient of determination (R 2) > 0. 75.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether a change in burrowing behaviour could provide an indication of disease onset and potentially be applied as a <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint.</b> Baseline burrowing behaviour was measured in healthy animals on three occasions by determining the weight of gravel displaced from a hollow tube. Mucositis was then induced in the same animals by intraperitoneal injection of 5 -fluorouracil (150 [*]mg/kg) and burrowing behaviour recorded over three consecutive days. Standard measures of disease progression, including body weight loss and clinical score, were also made. The presence of mucositis was confirmed at necropsy by findings of decreased duodenal and colon lengths, and reduced liver, spleen and thymus weights in comparison with non-treated control animals. Histological score of the jejunum and ileum was also significantly increased. Mucositis onset coincided with a decrease in mean burrowing behaviour which was progressive, however this result did not achieve statistical significance (P[*]=[*] 0. 66). We conclude that burrowing may be a useful indicator of inflammation in the mucositis model, although this requires further characterization.

Here we develop a rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) virus-like particle (VLP) -based vaccine designed for immunotherapy against HPV 16 positive tumours. An RHDV-VLP, modified to contain the universal helper T cell epitope PADRE and decorated with an MHC I-restricted peptide (aa 48 – 57) from the HPV 16 E 6, was tested for its immunotherapeutic efficacy against the TC- 1 HPV 16 E 6 and E 7 -expressing tumour in mice. The E 6 -RHDV-VLP-PADRE was administered therapeutically {{for the treatment of}} a pre-existing TC- 1 tumour and was delivered with antibodies either to deplete regulatory T cells (anti-CD 25) or to block T cell suppression mediated through CTLA- 4. As a result, the tumour burden was reduced by around 50 % and the median survival time of mice to the <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> was almost doubled the compared to controls. The incorporation of PADRE into the RHDV-VLP was necessary for an E 6 -specific enhancement of the anti-tumour response and the co-administration of the immune modifying antibodies contributed to the overall efficacy of the immunotherapy. The E 6 -RHDV-VLP-PADRE shows immunotherapeutic efficacy, prolonging survival for HPV tumour-bearing mice.

In the perioperative period, the improvement of safety and ef- ficacy of anesthesia and analgesia are critical aspects.

Relative dose effects and relative dose variations were calculated for the CUT and COM. The requisite sample sizes were estimated and the importance of survival rates to assess rebleeds during recovery was evaluated by correlating initial blood loss to mortality. Relative dose effects increased with higher doses in both models. The COM was more sensitive at lower doses than the CUT, had up to 82 % less variation across doses and clearly showed superior accuracy. Only 5 % of the sample size required for the CUT would be needed to establish non-inferiority between a specific therapeutic dose in haemophilia A mice and healthy wild-type animals. A strong statistically significant correlation was found between initial blood loss and mortality within 24 h.

About 10 % of cases are inherited, of which 20 % {{are due to}} mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) gene. Riluzole, the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved ALS drug, prolongs survival by only a few months. Experiments in transgenic ALS mouse models have shown decreasing levels of mutant SOD 1 protein as a potential therapeutic approach. We sought to develop an efficient adeno-associated virus (AAV) -mediated RNAi gene therapy for ALS. METHODS: A single-stranded AAV 9 vector encoding an artificial microRNA against human SOD 1 was injected into the cerebral lateral ventricles of neonatal SOD 1 (G 93 A) mice, and impact on disease progression and survival was assessed. RESULTS: This therapy extended median survival by 50 % and delayed hindlimb paralysis, with animals remaining ambulatory until the <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint,</b> which was due to rapid body weight loss. AAV 9 -treated SOD 1 (G 93 A) mice showed reduction of mutant human SOD 1 mRNA levels in upper and lower motor neurons and significant improvements in multiple parameters including the numbers of spinal motor neurons, diameter of ventral root axons, and extent of neuroinflammation in the SOD 1 (G 93 A) spinal cord. Mice also showed previously unexplored changes in pulmonary function, with AAV 9 -treated SOD 1 (G 93 A) mice displaying a phenotype reminiscent of patient pathophysiology.

In this study, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9 -mbetagal vector infused systemically in adult GM 1 mice (betaGal(-/-)) at 1 x 10 (11) or 3 x 10 (11) vector genomes (vg). Biochemical analysis of AAV 9 -treated GM 1 mice showed high betaGal activity in liver and serum. Moderate betaGal levels throughout CNS resulted in a 36 - 76 % reduction in GM 1 -ganglioside content in the brain and 75 - 86 % in the spinal cord. Histological analyses of the CNS of animals treated with 3 x 10 (11) vg dose revealed increased presence of betagal and clearance of lysosomal storage throughout cortex, hippocampus, brainstem and spinal cord. Storage reduction in these regions was accompanied by a marked decrease in astrogliosis. AAV 9 treatment resulted in improved performance in multiple tests of motor function and behavior. Also the majority of GM 1 mice in the 3 x 10 (11) vg cohort retained ambulation and rearing despite reaching the <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> due to weight loss. Importantly, the median survival of AAV 9 treatment groups (316 - 576 days) was significantly increased over controls (250 - 264 days).

Enzyme activity was elevated throughout the CNS of AAV-treated GM 1 mice and GSL storage nearly normalized in most structures analyzed, except in the spinal cord which showed ∼ 50 % reduction compared to age-matched untreated GM 1 mice spinal cord. Survival was significantly longer in AAV-treated GM 1 mice (52 wks) than in untreated mice. However the motor performance of AAV-treated GM 1 mice declined over time at a rate similar to that observed in untreated GM 1 mice. Our studies show that the AAV-modified thalamus {{can be used as a}} 'built-in' central node network for widespread distribution of lysosomal enzymes in the mouse cerebrum. In addition, this study indicates that thalamic delivery of AAV vectors should be combined with additional targets to supply the cerebellum and spinal cord with therapeutic levels of enzyme necessary to achieve complete correction of the neurological phenotype in GM 1 mice...|$|E
40|$|Public {{concern on}} issues such as animal welfare or the {{scientific}} validity and clinical value of animal research is growing, resulting in increasing regulatory demands for animal research. Abiding to the most stringent animal welfare standards, while having scientific objectives as the main priority, is often challenging. To do so, endpoints of studies involving severe, progressive diseases need to be established considering how early in the disease process the scientific objectives can be achieved. We present here experimental studies of tuberculosis (TB) in mice as a case study for an analysis of present practice and a discussion of how more refined science-based endpoints can be developed. A considerable proportion of studies in this field involve lethal stages, and the establishment of earlier, reliable indicators of disease severity will {{have a significant impact on}} animal welfare. While there is an increasing interest from scientists and industry in moving research in this direction, this is still far from being reflected in actual practice. We argue that a major limiting factor is the absence of data on biomarkers that can be used as indicators of disease severity. We discuss the possibility of complementing the widely used weight loss with other relevant biomarkers and the need for validation of these parameters as endpoints. Promotion of ethical guidelines needs to be coupled with systematic research in order to develop humane endpoints beyond the present euthanasia of moribund animals. Such research, as we propose here for chronic infection, can show the way for the development and promotion of welfare policies in other fields of research. Research on chronic infection relies heavily on the use of animals, as only the integral animal body can model the full aspect of an infection. That animals are generally made to develop a disease in infection studies exacerbates the tension between human benefit and animal well-being, which characterizes all biomedical research with animals. Scientists typically justify animal research with reference to potential human benefits, but if accepting the assumption that human benefits can offset animal suffering, it still needs to be argued that the same benefits could not be achieved with less negative effects on animal welfare. Reducing the animal welfare problems associated with research (“refinement” [1]) is therefore crucial in order to render animal-based research less of an ethical problem and to assure public trust in research. Studies that are designed to measure time of death or survival percentages present a particularly challenging situation in which at least some of the animals are made to die from the disease. These studies are frequent in experimental research on severe infections. The scientific community, industry, and regulatory authorities have responded to the ethical concerns over studies in which animals die from severe disease by developing new policies and guidelines for the implementation of humane endpoints as a key refinement measure (e. g., [2]–[4]). The most widely used definition considers a <b>humane</b> <b>endpoint</b> to be the earliest indicator in an animal experiment of severe pain, severe distress, suffering, or impending death [5], underlining that ideally such indicators should be identified before the onset of the most severe effects. Euthanizing animals, rather than awaiting their “spontaneous” death, is important to avoid unnecessary suffering in studies in which data on survival is thought to be required for scientific or legal reasons. However, several questions remain open regarding how humane endpoints are to be applied to address real animal welfare problems. We used TB experiments in mice as a case study to highlight the potential to establish biomarkers of disease progress that can replace survival time as a measure of disease severity.

30|$|Experimental animal {{models have}} been created and refined for over 80  years to {{investigate}} the development, management, and treatment of sepsis [1], and have contributed to many important advances {{in our understanding of}} sepsis pathophysiology [2]. Recognizing the ethical implications of using animals in research, the “ 3 Rs”—Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction—form the guiding principles for ethical standards when conducting animal research [3]. These guidelines exclude death as an endpoint, and suggest the use of surrogate markers of death to establish <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints</b> where possible. Surrogate markers of death involve using criteria related to pain, suffering, and/or illness, such as clinically relevant scoring systems that semi-quantitatively assess the physical appearance and/or behavior of an animal [4 – 6], in order to gauge the time at which animals should be humanely euthanized [7]. These decisions must be carefully balanced with minimizing premature termination of animal studies, which may lead to incomplete observations and may necessitate use of even more animals [7, 8]. Improvements are necessary to achieve more ethical and humane treatment of animals in research related to critical care medicine [7, 9, 10], and specifically for experimental sepsis research [10], where clear endpoint markers have not been established for the gold standard sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).|$|R
40|$|Objective: Pain, distress, or {{discomfort}} {{should be}} minimized during experimental procedures using animals. The {{goal of this}} work was to establish <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints</b> for a model of bladder cancer chemically-induced by N-butyl-N-(4 -hydroxybutyl) -nitrosamine (BBN). Methods: Procedures were made {{in accordance with the}} European Directive 2010 / 63 /EU. Twelve Wistar rats were used. The carcinogen agent BBN was administered in drinking water during 20 weeks. After this, they consumed only water until 35 weeks of the experimental protocol. During the protocol was used a scoring sheet where biological variables were registered daily to monitor animal welfare. Results: No animals died during the experimental protocol. Four animals showed signs of haematuria since the fifteenth week after the beginning of the experiment, these animals also exhibited moderate anemia in the last week of the protocol that was evident through the mucosal observations. All animals exhibited a mental status, eyes, ears and whiskers position, response to handling, breathing and hydration within the parameters considered normal for the specie. Conclusion: The animals did not show clinical signs compatible to suffering that justified their sacrifice {{before the end of the}} study. The endpoints established for this model are adequate to bladder cancer studies once no endpoints were reached. FCT (PTDC/DES/ 114122 / 2009) and CI&DETS (PEst-OE/CED/UI 4016...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnimal {{models of}} {{epilepsy}} and seizures, mostly involving mice and rats, {{are used to}} understand the pathophysiology of the different forms of epilepsy and their comorbidities, to identify biomarkers, and to discover new antiepileptic drugs and treatments for comorbidities. Such models represent an important area for application of the 3 Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement of animal use). This report provides background information and recommendations aimed at minimising pain, suffering and distress in rodent models of epilepsy and seizures {{in order to improve}} animal welfare and optimise the quality of studies in this area. The report includes practical guidance on principles of choosing a model, induction procedures, in vivo recordings, perioperative care, welfare assessment, <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints,</b> social housing, environmental enrichment, reporting of studies and data sharing. In addition, some model-specific welfare considerations are discussed, and data gaps and areas for further research are identified. The guidance is based upon a systematic review of the scientific literature, survey of the international epilepsy research community, consultation with veterinarians and animal care and welfare officers, and the expert opinion and practical experience of the members of a Working Group convened by the United Kingdom's National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC 3 Rs) ...|$|R
40|$|Potency {{testing of}} most human and {{veterinary}} rabies vaccines requires vaccination of mice {{followed by a}} challenge test using an intracerebral injection of live rabies virus. The National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM), the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), and their international partners organized an international workshop to review the availability and validation status of alternative methods that might reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals for rabies vaccine potency testing, and to identify priority research and development efforts necessary to further advance alternative methods. Workshop participants agreed that rabies vaccine potency testing using the mouse challenge test should use general anesthesia for intracerebral virus injections, and that <b>humane</b> <b>endpoints</b> should be used routinely {{as the basis for}} euthanizing animals to minimize pain and distress. Workshop participants recommended that a near term priority should be to replace the mouse challenge with a test validated to ensure potency, such as the mouse antibody serum neutralization test (SNT) for adjuvanted veterinary rabies vaccines for which an international collaborative study was recently completed. The workshop recommended that an in vitro antigen quantification test should be a high priority for product-specific validation of non-adjuvanted human and veterinary rabies vaccines. Finally, workshop participants recommended greater international cooperation to expedite development, validation, regulatory acceptance, and implementation of alternative test methods for rabies vaccine potency testing.
