2500|$|The {{valley is}} the primary date-growing region in the United States, {{responsible}} for nearly 95 percent of the nation's crop and is celebrated each year in Indio during the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival. The earliest attempt at growing dates came about in 1890 when the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) imported date palm shoots from Iraq and Egypt. Sixty-eight shoots were distributed across the Southwest U.S. in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Yuma, Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, and several California cites: Indio, Pomona near Los Angeles, Tulare and National City near San Diego. The imports were almost all male seedlings and produced poor fruit. The Coachella Valley showed promise, so USDA horticulturist Bernard Johnson planted a number of shoots that he brought back from Algeria in September 1903. On his own initiative, Johnson imported more shoots from Algeria in 1908 and again in 1912. The area's entire date industry {{can be traced back}} to those original USDA experiments near present-day Mecca. Date palms were grown from present-day Cathedral City to the Salton Sea, but most <b>date</b> <b>groves</b> were overtaken by development by the 1990s. Today, nearly all of the <b>date</b> <b>groves</b> are in the [...] "East Valley" [...] area south of Indio, near Coachella and east of La Quinta.|$|R

50|$|The Sands of Samar {{are located}} near Kibbutz Samar in {{southern}} Israel, 30 kilometers north of Eilat. Once {{part of a}} larger network of dunes, zoning for <b>date</b> <b>groves</b> and other crops, as well as factory pollution and extensive sand mining to support construction projects in Eilat, have vastly reduced the presence of sand dunes in the area. Since Israel's 1994 peace treaty with Jordan, which placed neighboring dunes on the Jordanian side of the border, the Sands of Samar are the last remaining sand dunes on Israel's side of the Arava, constituting a unique and valuable habitat for desert-dwelling organisms. Of the seven square kilometers of dunes that once existed, 2.3 square kilometers remain today.|$|R

I argue that the family's agricultural and non-agricultural activities interrelate: the Atkuppus traded in an area that was intrinsically linked to their reed-cutters' prebend and their profession of reed-cutters (i. e., a trade company set up to cut reeds or to make and sell reed products) or to their ownership of garden land (i. e. a company set up to cultivate their land or to trade off its surplus agricultural produce). status: submitte...|$|R
5000|$|Date palms are {{cultivated}} in Sudan from the Egyptian {{border in the}} North all the way along the Nile south of Khartoum until Sennar. In addition to {{the banks of the}} Nile, isolated occurrences of cultivated date trees occur in the Red Sea Hills in the vicinity of Port Sudan, in Kassala, along the Atbara River, in the deserts around Dongola and far Southwest in Darfur, for example in Wadi Kutum, Wadi Mellit and Barra.
