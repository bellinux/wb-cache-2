Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting {{large sums of money}} from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations. When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, [...] "This committee doesn't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your Republican views." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{revelation of}} Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said {{that much of}} Williams' speech was {{standard}} pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to [...] "attack the head" [...] of running back Frank Gore, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far. His former teammate, NFL Network analyst Michael Irvin, said that he [...] "almost threw up" [...] when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to [...] "never take out a man's knees." [...] Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was [...] "woefully underpunished," [...] especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.|$|E
2500|$|Milo Goes to College {{is cited}} {{as one of}} the most {{significant}} albums of the early-1980s southern California hardcore punk movement. Steven Blush, author of , remarked that its [...] "cheeky love songs disguised as hardcore blasts became the most aped formula in rock." [...] Rock critic Robert Christgau gave it an A- rating, saying [...] "These fishermen don't kid around about what powers hardcore hyperdrive—not simply an unjust society, but also a battered psyche. When they're feeling bad, any kind of power—money, age, ass-man cool, the possession of a vagina—can set off their anarchic, patricidal, 'homo'-baiting, gynephobic rage. But their bad feelings add poignant weight to the doomed vulnerability of the last four songs, which happen to be their hookiest". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the album [...] "Perfect for the little guy who was ever called a nerd and never got the girl. The chainsaw pop combined with earthy humor conveys what is often an inarticulate rage." [...] Hilburn's review was especially affirming for Stevenson, whose father criticized and discouraged his songwriting: [...] "Robert Hillburn was saying something different. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I can write okay, that I'm a decent songwriter. So it served to shut my dad up a little bit, so that I could pursue the band thing a little less encumbered by his stifling attitude." ...|$|E

Then she declared that she had not believed that any part of the world could be as interesting as that region which Mr. Tippengray had been describing to her, and that she was sorry she could not sit there all the morning and listen to him, but duty was duty, and it was necessary for her to return to Lethbury.|$|E

60|$|I awoke at dawn much {{refreshed}} with sleep, {{and having}} washed and clothed {{myself in the}} linen robes that were provided for me, I came into the large room, where food was given me. Scarcely had I finished my meal when my captor, the cacique, entered, accompanied by two men whose appearance struck terror to my heart. In countenance they were fierce and horrible; they wore black robes embroidered with mystic characters in red, and their long and tangled hair was matted together with some strange substance. These men, whom all present, including the chief or cacique, seemed to look on with the utmost reverence, glared {{at me with a}} fierce glee that made my blood run cold. One of them, indeed, tore open my white robe and placed his filthy hand upon my heart, which beat quickly enough, counting its throbs aloud while the other nodded at his words. Afterwards I learned that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I was very strong.|$|E

60|$|The {{girl had}} {{stiffened}} {{a little at}} our approach, as I could see, but a young girl's stiffness is always rather amusing than otherwise, and I did not mind it. Neither, that I could see, did Mr. Glendenning, and it soon passed. It seemed that she had left her mother lying down in her state-room, where she justly imagined {{that if she did}} not see the rapids she should suffer less alarm from them; the young lady had come frankly to the side of Mrs. March as soon as she saw her, and asked if she might sit with her. She now talked to me for a decent space of time, and then presently, without my knowing how, she was talking to Mr. Glendenning, and they were comparing notes of Niagara; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he thought he had seen her at the Cataract House, and she was owning that she and her mother had at least stopped at that hotel.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{this was}} viewing my {{relation}} to the Mertons in any point of view but that in which I wished it to be viewed, or indeed was just. Still it was natural; and the gentleman who spoke, a man of standing and character, no doubt fancied <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> which must prove particularly acceptable to me; another proof how dangerous it is to attempt to decide on other men's feelings or affairs. I could not decline the discourse; and, while the Wallingford went slowly past the Gull, I was compelled to endure the torment of hearing the Mertons mentioned, again and again, in the hearing of Lucy and Grace; on the nerves of the latter of whom I knew {{it must be a}} severe trial. At length we got rid of this troublesome neighbour, though not until Lucy and her father were recognised and spoken to by several of the ladies in the other party. While my late guardian and his daughter were thus engaged, I stole a glance at my sister. She was pale as death, and seemed anxious to go below, whither I led her, most happily, I have every reason to think, as things turned out.|$|E
60|$|Then impetuously he {{told her}} that Mildred had left him and that his {{unhappiness}} had been so great that he almost killed himself. He told her of all that had happened between them, of the birth of the child, and of the meeting with Griffiths, of his folly and his trust and his immense deception. He told her how often he had thought of her kindness and of her love, and how bitterly he had regretted throwing it away: he had only been happy when he was with her, and he knew now how great was her worth. His voice was hoarse with emotion. Sometimes he was so ashamed of what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he spoke with his eyes fixed on the ground. His face was distorted with pain, and yet he felt it a strange relief to speak. At last he finished. He flung himself back in his chair, exhausted, and waited. He had concealed nothing, and even, in his self-abasement, he had striven to make himself more despicable than he had really been. He was surprised that she did not speak, and at last he raised his eyes. She was not looking at him. Her face was quite white, and she seemed to be lost in thought.|$|E

Others see the {{expression}} as simply a comforting exhortation not to worry or be anxious, but to rest confident that God is in control (cf. Phil. 2:12-13). In other places the apostle Paul emphatically underscored the importance of diligent work in study and preparation (I Tim. 4:13-16; II Tim. 2:15).|$|R

6000|$|The {{difficulties}} of the way were greater than had been anticipated. There was no path; the rocks, cliffs, and gullies were precipitous; and the underwood was thick and tangled, insomuch that Mr Cupples sat down once or twice and begged to be left where <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he would take his chance of being caught, and could feed quite well on cocoa-nuts! This, however, was not listened to. Poor Cupples was dragged along, half by persuasion and half by force. Sailors, as a class, are not celebrated for pedestrian powers, and Cupples was a singularly bad specimen of his class. Muggins, although pretty well knocked up before morning, held on manfully without a murmur. The captain, too, albeit a heavy man, and fat, and addicted to panting and profuse perspiration, declared that he was game for anything, and would never be guilty of saying [...] "die" [...] {{as long as there}} was [...] "a shot in the locker." [...] As for Larry O'Hale, {{he was a man of}} iron mould, one of those giants who seem to be incapable of being worn out or crushed by any amount of physical exertion. So far was he from being exhausted, that he threatened to carry Mr Cupples if he should again talk of falling behind. We need scarcely say that Wandering Will was quite equal to the occasion. Besides being a powerful fellow for his age, he was lithe, active, and hopeful, and, having been accustomed to hill-climbing from boyhood, could have left the whole party behind with ease.|$|E
6000|$|About a mile south {{we could}} see, {{rising above the}} rocks, the masts of the British brig which the St. John had {{endeavored}} to follow, which had slipped her cables and, by good luck, run {{into the mouth of}} Cohasset Harbor. A little further along the shore we saw a man's clothes on a rock; further, a woman's scarf, a gown, a straw bonnet, the brig's caboose, and one of her masts high and dry, broken into several pieces. In another rocky cove, several rods from the water, and behind rocks twenty feet high, lay a part of one side of the vessel, still hanging together. It was, perhaps, forty feet long, by fourteen wide. I was even more surprised at the power of the waves, exhibited on this shattered fragment, than I had been {{at the sight of the}} smaller fragments before. The largest timbers and iron braces were broken superfluously, and I saw that no material could withstand the power of the waves; that iron must go to pieces in such a case, and an iron vessel would be cracked up like an egg-shell on the rocks. Some of these timbers, however, were so rotten that I could almost thrust my umbrella through them. They told us that some were saved on this piece, and also showed where the sea had heaved it into this cove, which was now dry. When I saw where it had come in, and in what condition, I wondered that any had been saved on it. A little further on a crowd of men was collected around the mate of the St. John, who was telling his story. He was a slim-looking youth, who spoke of the captain as the master, and seemed a little excited. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> when they jumped into the boat, she filled, and, the vessel lurching, the weight of the water in the boat caused the painter to break, and so they were separated. Whereat one man came away, saying:-- ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she walked}} alone through the shrubberies at Ongar Park she thought much {{of those other}} paths at Clavering, and of the walks {{in which she had}} not been alone; and she thought of that {{interview}} in the garden when she had explained to Harry--as she had then thought so successfully--that they two, each being poor, were not fit to love and marry each other. She had brooded over all that, too, during the long hours of her sad journey home to England. She was thinking of it still when she had met him, and had been so cold to him on the platform of the railway station, when she had sent him away angry because she had seemed to slight him. She had thought of it as she had sat in her London room, telling him the terrible tale of her married life, while her eyes were fixed on his and her head was resting on her hands. Even then, at that moment, she was asking herself whether he believed her story, or whether, within his breast, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> she was vile and false. She knew that she had been false to him, and that he must have despised her when, with her easy philosophy, she had made the best of her own mercenary perfidy. He had called her a jilt to her face, and she had been able to receive the accusation with a smile. Would he now call her something worse, and in a louder voice, within his own bosom? And if she could convince him that to that accusation she was not fairly subject, might the old thing come back again? Would he walk with her again, and look into her eyes as though he only wanted her commands to show himself ready to be her slave? She was a widow, and had seen many things, but even now she had not reached her six-and-twentieth year.|$|E
