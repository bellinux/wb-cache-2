40|$|AbstractPatterning of the {{vertebrate}} hindbrain {{involves a}} segmentation process {{leading to the}} formation of seven rhombomeres along the antero-posterior axis. While recent studies have shed light on the mechanisms underlying progressive subdivision of the posterior hindbrain into individual rhombomeres, the early events involved in anterior hindbrain patterning are still largely unknown. In this paper we demonstrate that two zebrafish Iroquois transcription factors, Irx 7 and Irx 1 b, are required for the proper formation and specification of rhombomeres 1 to 4 and, in particular, for krox 20 activation in r 3. We also show that Irx 7 functionally interacts with Meis factors to activate the expression of anterior hindbrain markers, such as hoxb 1 a, hoxa 2 and krox 20, ectopically in the anterior neural plate. Then, focusing on krox 20 expression, we show that the effect of Irx 7 and Meis 1. 1 is mediated by <b>element</b> <b>C,</b> <b>a</b> conserved cis-regulatory <b>element</b> involved in krox 20 activation in the hindbrain.

However, the mechanisms underlying cooperation between cis-acting elements are poorly documented, notably in vertebrates. The mouse gene Krox 20 encodes a transcription factor required for the specification of two segments (rhombomeres) of the developing hindbrain. In rhombomere 3, Krox 20 is subject to direct positive feedback governed by an autoregulatory enhancer, element A.
