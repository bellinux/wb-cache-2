40|$|The Act {{requires}} that additional information {{be provided by}} creditors to banks and other financial institutions on certain affidavits and summonses when creditors attempt to garnish funds form a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s account. The Act immunizes banks and other financial institutions from liability if the fail to pay money from a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s account if the information needed to positively <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s account is not received by them. The Act further details the procedures a bank must follow when it has property or money in its safe deposit box, which is subject to garnishment by a creditor. The Act immunizes certain association and fiduciary accounts from garnishment proceedings. The Act provides reimbursements to banks and other financial institutions for the costs they incur in turning money or property subject to garnishment over to the court...|$|E
50|$|If {{the court}} authorises the issuing of an emoluments-attachment order {{in terms of}} section 65J(1), the order must be issued in the form {{prescribed}} by the rules, and must contain sufficient information, including the identity number, work number or date of birth of <b>the</b> judgment <b>debtor,</b> to enable <b>the</b> garnishee to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> judgment <b>debtor.</b>|$|R
50|$|This code section then {{requires}} {{a comparison between}} <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> “current monthly income” and the median income for <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> state. If <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> income exceeds <b>the</b> median income, then <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> must apply <b>the</b> means test.|$|R
25|$|The term “sequestration” {{should be}} used only with {{reference}} to a person’s estate. It is <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> estate that is sequestrated, not <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> himself. On <b>the</b> other by, both <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> estate and <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> himself may properly be described as insolvent.|$|R
25|$|Although a {{creditor}} {{may have}} good reason for believing <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is insolvent, he will usually not {{be in a position}} to prove that <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> liabilities exceed his assets. If, however, the creditor can establish that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> has committed one or more “act” of insolvency, he may seek an order sequestrating <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> estate without having to prove that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is insolvent. Therefore, a debtor’s estate may be sequestrated even though he is technically solvent.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to <b>the</b> BAPCPA Amendments, <b>debtors</b> of all incomes could {{file for}} {{bankruptcy}} under Chapter 7. BAPCPA restricted <b>the</b> number of <b>debtors</b> that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> state. If <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> income is above the median income amount of <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> state, <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is subject to a [...] "means test".|$|R
5000|$|Debt settlement, {{also known}} as debt arbitration, debt {{negotiation}} or credit settlement, is an approach to debt reduction in which <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> and creditor agree on a reduced balance that will be regarded as payment in full. During a negotiation period, all payments by <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> are made to the debt settlement company, which typically withholds payments to the creditors, even if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> has paid a lump sum or made payments. Once all <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> accounts are in default due to this non-payment, the debt settlement company has leverage to force <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to accept a reduced lump sum payment as settlement. <b>The</b> <b>debtor's</b> credit rating goes down significantly due to the default, especially if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> was not behind on payments before the negotiation period commenced. Even though the accounts are [...] "settled," [...] the default appears on <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> credit record for seven years. Nevertheless, some debtors prefer this method of debt reduction over bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|If {{the returns}} from the Sheriff's sale was inadequate, or <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> refused to reveal the {{location}} of their property, or if there was fear that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> might seek to flee, the creditor could have <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> imprisoned indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|In a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy ("Reorganization") {{the trustee}} is {{responsible}} for receiving <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> monthly payments and distributing those funds proportionally to <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> creditors. <b>The</b> Bankruptcy Trustee will act on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to guarantee that both the creditors’ and <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> interests are maintained {{in accordance with the}} bankruptcy laws, and will often be required to act as a negotiator between the two parties.|$|R
50|$|The Chairman {{will hold}} the meeting of {{creditors}} and negotiate with <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> and creditors to approve the proposal. It is common for creditors to ask for modifications to the proposal at the meeting. Common modifications put forward by major banks include restricting <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> from obtaining credit, ensuring payments increase if <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> income increases, specifying a minimum return such as 40 pence in the pound, and insisting that the supervisor fails the IVA if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> misses 3 or more payments, and petitions for <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> bankruptcy.|$|R
40|$|The debt {{collection}} process in Anglo-American law {{is based on}} the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s right to receive payment from liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets. Judicial procedures are available to the unsecured creditor for the purpose of converting <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets to cash. Whenever <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s matured liabilities are greater than his assets, the collection process may be characterized as one of 2 ̆ 2 grab law 2 ̆ 2 in which the first creditors to take <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets succeed in effectuating collection. It is an economic necessity for creditors to have an efficient collection mechanism which gives them maximum protection in the event of default by <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> Nonetheless, all states shield <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> from complete destitution by keeping certain property, for example, life insurance proceeds, beyond the reach of creditors. By permitting <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to keep those assets necessary for his economic survival, state exemption laws fulfill important social policies which must be balanced against the need for creditor protection. When a debtor files a petition in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee takes title to most of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s property, thereby enabling the trustee to liquidate <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets for the benefit of creditors. The twofold purpose of federal bankruptcy law is to give <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> a fresh start by discharging his debts and to make an efficient, fair, and equitable distribution of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets among his creditors. By recognizing exemptions, both the Bankruptcy Act now in effect and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 permit <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to keep those assets needed for a fresh start while protecting the rights of creditors with respect to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s nonexempt property...|$|R

50|$|Another {{aspect to}} {{consider}} is whether <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> can avoid a challenge by the United States Trustee {{to his or her}} Chapter 7 filing as abusive.

If so, then the U.S. Trustee may succeed in preventing <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> from receiving a discharge under Chapter 7, effectively forcing <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> into Chapter 13.|$|R

40|$|Bad {{credit or}} loan is the credit problem {{experienced}} repayment difficulties {{due to the}} factors or elements of intentional or due to conditions beyond <b>the</b> ability of <b>debtors.</b> bad credit is highly feared by every bank, because it would interfere with the bank 2 ̆ 7 s financial condition, may even result in the cessation of business activities of the bank. The emergence of non-performing loans including bad credit, basically does not occur suddenly, but through a process. Bad credit can be caused either by the creditors (banks) and debtors. If bad credit happens because <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> does not carry out his achievements as contained in the credit agreement, then before execution collateral, <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> must first be declared in default, which is done through a court decision.
