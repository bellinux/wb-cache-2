40|$|BACKGROUND: Enriching {{poultry meat}} with {{long-chain}} n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n- 3 PUFA) can increase low population intakes of LC n- 3 PUFA, but fishy taints can spoil reheated meat. This experiment determined {{the effect of}} different amounts of LC n- 3 PUFA and vitamin E in the broiler diet on the fatty acid composition and sensory characteristics of the breast meat. Ross 308 broilers (120) were randomly allocated to one of five treatments from 21 to 42 days of age. Diets contained (g kg− 1) 0, 9 or 18 LC n- 3 PUFA (0 LC, 9 LC, 18 LC), and 100, 150 or 200 mg LD [...] tocopherol acetate kg− 1 (E).

40|$|In {{order to}} study {{the cause of the}} {{ecological}} distribution of the Crab-grass and to investigate the properties of this palant as a feeding plant, experiments were planed to ascertain the effects of increasing amounts of lime given to the soil with and without fertilizer, on the composition of the plant; and the results are as follows: plants can thrive on strong acid soil with little exchangeable calcium content, (pH 4. 5, exchange acidity y 1 37 exchangeable calcium 1. 7 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm.) when the soil is supplied with adeqate fertilizer. The optimum point is on a pH value of about 6, exchange acidity y 1 1, and exchangeable calcium 10 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm. As the pH value and calcium content of the soil surpass the optimum point, The plant grows less actively, but its normal growth can be seen till on the alkaline soil such as pH 8. 06, exchange acidity y 1 trace, exchangeable calcium 23 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm. (Table 1) The percentage of calcium contained in the plant becomes higher with increasing rate of liming. Thus content of calcium in the airial part of the plant ranges from 0. 3 ％ at pH 4. 6, exchange acidity y 1 37 exchangeable calcium 1 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm. to 0. 6 ％ at pH 8. 06, exchange acidity y 1 trace, exchangeable Ca 23 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm. and as a whole, it settles at the point of an average 0. 5 ％ (Table 4) On the other hand the amount of phosphorus in the plant is less affected by the addition of CaCO 3 than in the case of calcium and nitrogen, and the percentage of phosphorus in the plant is very low when compared with that of calcium which is given in table 4. The average value of the former is 0. 02 ％. The content of crude protein is increased by the application of the fertilizer, and also by the addition of lime, proportional to the increasing amount of the latter. But liming the soil of pH above 8. 01, causes decrease in the crude protein content of the plant. From the results obtained through these studies it is considered that this plant does not need much Ca and P elements, so that it could flourish on reclaimed land lacking in Ca and P elements. The Crab-grass seems to have a very remarkable degree of adaptability to the Ca content in the soil, so that it could widly distribute over the strong acid soil and lime-stone regions. These studies will give a suggestion {{on the use of the}} Crab-grass as forage plants. メヒシバの生態分布の機構及び其の飼料価値を追究する目的で, 無肥料又は施肥状態に於ける石灰加用のメヒシバ体成分に及ぼす影響につき研究した. メヒシバは適量の肥料分があると, 強酸性で置換石灰の極めて少い土壌（pH 4. 5 ～ 6. 5 置換酸度y 1 37, 置換石灰 1. 7 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm. ）に於てもよく繁茂する. そして生育の最適点は pH 6, 置換酸度 y 1 1, 置換石灰 10 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm. である. それ以上 pH 値が上昇すると幾分生長が落ちるが, pH 8. 06, 置換酸度 y 1 trace, 置換石灰 23 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> gm. に於ても正常に繁茂する. メヒシバ地上部のカルシウム含量は CaCO 3 の添加量の増加と共に上昇する. 即ちカルシウム含量は pH 約 4. 6, 置換酸度 y 1 37, 置換石灰 1. 7 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> mg. で約 0. 3 %, pH 8. 06, 置換酸度 y 1 trace, 置換石灰 23 m. <b>e.</b> / <b>100</b> mg. で 0. 6 ％, 平均約 0. 5 ％である（Table 4 ）. 一方燐の含量は石灰作用の影響が少く, その含量もカルシウムに比して極めて少くて平均約 0. 02 ％にすぎない. 粗蛋白質の含量は適量の施肥及び石灰の加用によつて増加する. しかし pH 8. 01 以上に石灰を加えると粗蛋白質の量は却つて減少する. 以上の結果によつて見るに, メヒシバは石灰及び燐の要求度が少く, 土壌の酸度に対する抵抗力が強いことがメヒシバをして強酸性で, しかも燐成分に乏しい開墾地に跋扈させる所以である. 又土壌中の石灰含量に対する適応力が大きい事が本種が強酸性土壌から石灰岩地帯にかけて広く分布する一つの原因である. 尚本研究による結果は, メヒシバを飼料として利用する際にも役立つであろう...|$|R
40|$|Recreational bathing is an {{activity}} practiced {{by thousands of}} Canadians every year. While its health benefits are numerous, bathing in polluted water {{can also be a}} source of health problems. These problems are generally nonspecific and are difficult to detect through usual health monitoring systems. Most involve ear and eye ailments, febrile respiratory illness and, particularly, gastroenteritis. In 1992, Health Canada recommended microbiological guideline values for recreational water quality. The values are based on the presence of fecal indicator bacteria, namely, enterococci for marine water, and Escherichia coli or fecal coliforms for fresh water. In marine water, the guideline value is set at 35 enterococci/ 100 mL, while in fresh water, the standard is 200 <b>E</b> coli/ <b>100</b> mL or 200 fecal coliforms/ 100 mL when experience demonstrates that over 90 % of the fecal coliforms are E coli.

40|$|AbstractThe {{vaccinia virus}} E 3 gene encodes a 190 -amino acid {{double-stranded}} (ds) RNA-binding protein that antagonizes cellular antiviral response pathways triggered by dsRNA and interferon. The physical and functional {{properties of the}} E 3 protein were determined using recombinant E 3 produced in bacteria and purified to homogeneity. We show by sedimentation and chemical crosslinking that E 3 is a dimer in solution at high ionic strength. E 3 self-associates to form higher order oligomers as ionic strength is reduced from 1 to 0. 1 MNaCl. Structure probing by limited proteolysis suggests that E 3 consists of amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains separated by a trypsin-sensitive bridge at residues Lys- 92 and Arg- 95. The carboxyl-domain of E 3 contains a conserved dsRNA binding motif (dsRBM) found in many other proteins that interact with dsRNA. That the C-terminal domain per se binds to dsRNA was verified by studies of recombinant <b>E</b> 3 (<b>100</b> – 190) purified from bacteria. The affinity of the C-terminal domain for dsRNA was {{comparable to that of}} the full-length E 3 protein (KD∼ 7 to 9 nM). <b>E</b> 3 (<b>100</b> – 190) did not bind to DNA–DNA duplexes or to DNA–RNA hybrids, suggesting that the dsRBM specifically recognizes an A-form helix. <b>E</b> 3 (<b>100</b> – 190) is a dimer in solution; however, unlike the full-sized E 3 protein, <b>E</b> 3 (<b>100</b> – 190) does not form higher order multimers at low ionic strength...|$|R
