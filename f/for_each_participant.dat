Department of the Family must submit an annual plan of operation to the FNS, which describes how it will distribute the funds assigned as nutrition assistance to qualifying persons.

5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. <b>For</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
25|$|The form not {{the content}} of the {{theories}} (conversation theory and interactions of actors theory) return to and is congruent with the forms of physical theories; such as wave particle duality (the set theoretic unfoldment part of conversation theory is a radiation and its reception is the interpretation by the recipient of the descriptions so exchanged, and vice versa). The particle aspect is the recompilation by the listener of what a speaker is saying. Theories of many universes, one at least <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> A and one to participant B- are bridged by analogy.

Using a qualitative research approach, {{guided by the}} classroom ecology paradigm, I used an open-ended questionnaire conducting interpretative inquiry through a semi-structured interview format, which allows <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant???s</b> unique story to be told. <b>Each</b> <b>participant</b> monitored how much or little they shared regarding their own experience in school. The results are presented as personal narratives <b>for</b> <b>each</b> case study <b>participant,</b> and ultimately, through the analysis, all experiences are woven together. Major areas of inquiry include background, language learning, and school experience. The analysis is organized by three major codes: Subtractive Bilingualism, Differential Treatment, and Cultural Value Patterns.

2500|$|Two broad {{categories}} of private pension plans are [...] "defined benefit pension plans" [...] and [...] "defined contribution pension plans." [...] Of these two, Social Security is {{more similar to}} a defined benefit pension plan. In a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits ultimately received are based {{on some sort of}} pre-determined formula (such as one based on years worked and highest salary earned). Defined benefit pension plans generally do not include separate accounts <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant.</b> By contrast, in a defined contribution pension plan each participant has a specific account with funds put into that account (by the employer or the participant, or both), and the ultimate benefit is based on the amount in that account at the time of retirement. Some have proposed that the Social Security system be modified to provide for the option of individual accounts (in effect, to make the system, at least in part, more like a defined contribution pension plan). Specifically, on February 2, 2005, President George W. Bush made Social Security a prominent theme of his State of the Union Address. He described the Social Security system as [...] "headed for bankruptcy", and outlined, in general terms, a proposal based on partial privatization. Critics responded that privatization would require huge new government borrowing to fund benefit payments during the transition years. See Social Security debate (United States).|$|E
2500|$|Intertemporal {{choice is}} {{commonly}} {{measured in the}} laboratory using a [...] "delayed discounting" [...] paradigm, which measures the process of devaluing rewards and punishments that happen in the future. In this paradigm, subjects must choose between a smaller reward delivered soon and a larger reward delivered at a delay in the future. [...] Choosing the smaller-sooner reward is considered impulsive. By repeatedly making these choices, indifference points can be estimated. For example, if someone chose $70 now over $100 in a week, but chose the $100 in a week over $60 now, it can be inferred that they are indifferent between $100 in a week and an intermediate value between $60 and $70. [...] A delay discounting curve can be obtained <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> by plotting their indifference points with different reward amounts and time delays. [...] Individual differences in discounting curves are affected by personality characteristics such as self-reports of impulsivity and locus of control; personal characteristics such as age, gender, IQ, race, and culture; socioeconomic characteristics such as income and education; and many other variables. Lesions of the nucleus accumbens core subregion or basolateral amygdala produce shifts towards choosing the smaller-sooner reward, suggesting the involvement of these brain regions in the preference for delayed reinforcers. [...] There is also evidence that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in delay discounting, although there is currently debate on whether lesions in this region result in more or less impulsivity.|$|E

30|$|There was no {{standardized}} login nomenclature {{established for}} those practicing ultrasound in the CSEAC, {{which led to}} difficulty when collating and analyzing the scans due to the differences in information that each person entered upon logging onto an ultrasound machine.

The topics of the meetings were consistent with a range of issues, goals and objectives as described within the NASA Earth Science Enterprise Strategic Plan and more broadly by the US Global Change Research Program/Our Changing Planet, the more recent Climate Change Program Strategic Plan and the NSF Pathways report. The meetings were chaired by two or more leaders from within the disciplinary focus of each session. 222 scholars for a total of 1097 participants-days were convened under the auspices of this award.

Previous {{reports from}} our lab {{have shown that}} those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have decreased activity and/or coherence in delta, theta, alpha and beta cognitive responses. In the current study, we investigated gamma responses in visual SEO and ERO in 15 patients with AD and in 15 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls. The following parameters were analyzed over the parietal-occipital regions in both groups: (i) latency of the maximum gamma response over a 0 – 800 ms time window; (ii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant's</b> averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses in 3 frequency ranges (25 – 30, 30 – 35, 40 – 48 Hz); and (iii) the maximum peak-to-peak amplitudes <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant's</b> averaged SEO and ERO gamma responses over a 0 – 800 ms time block containing four divided time windows (0 – 200, 200 – 400, 400 – 600, and 600 – 800 ms). There were main group effects {{in terms of both}} latency and peak-to-peak amplitudes of gamma ERO. However, peak-to-peak gamma ERO amplitude differences became noticeable only when the time block was divided into four time windows. SEO amplitudes in the 25 – 30 Hz frequency range of the 0 – 200 ms time window over the left hemisphere were greater in the healthy controls than in those with AD. Gamma target ERO latency was delayed up to 138 ms in AD patients when compared to healthy controls. This finding may be an effect of lagged neural signaling in cognitive circuits, which is reflected by the delayed gamma responses in those with AD. Based on the results of this study, we propose that gamma responses should be examined in a more detailed fashion using multiple frequency and time windows...|$|R
