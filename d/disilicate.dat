25|$|Sorosilicates, also termed <b>disilicates,</b> have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen, {{which results}} in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen. The {{resultant}} common structural element is the 6− group. The most common <b>disilicates</b> by far {{are members of the}} epidote group. Epidotes are found in variety of geologic settings, ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to metapelites. Epidotes are built around the structure 10− structure; for example, the mineral species epidote has calcium, aluminium, and ferric iron to charge balance: Ca2Al2(Fe3+, Al)(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH). The presence of iron as Fe3+ and Fe2+ helps understand oxygen fugacity, which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis.|$|R

5000|$|Recent {{developments}} in CAD/CAM dentistry use special partially sintered ceramic (zirconia), glass-bonded ceramic ("Vitablock") or glass-ceramic ("ips.emax" [...] lithium <b>disilicate)</b> formed into machinable blocks, which are fired again after machining.

5000|$|One of the {{advantages}} of computerized dentistry (CAD/CAM technologies) involves the use of machinable ceramics which are sold in a partially sintered, machinable state that is fired again after machining to form a hard ceramic. Some of the materials used are glass-bonded porcelain (Viablock), lithium <b>disilicate</b> glass-ceramic (a ceramic crystallizing from a glass by special heat treatment), and phase stabilized zirconia (zirconium dioxide, ZrO2). Previous attempts to utilize high-performance ceramics such as zirconium-oxide were thwarted by the fact that this material could not be processed using the traditional methods used in dentistry. Because of its high strength and comparatively much higher fracture toughness, sintered zirconium-oxide can be used in posterior crowns and bridges, implant abutments, and root dowel pins. Lithium <b>disilicate</b> (used in the latest Chairside Economical Restoration of Esthetic Ceramics CEREC product) also has the fracture resistance needed for use on molars. Some all-ceramic restorations, such as porcelain-fused-to-alumina set the standard for high aesthetics in dentistry because they are strong and their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel. Not as aesthetic as porcelain-fused-to-ceramic, many dentists will not use new machine-made [...] "monolithic" [...] zirconia and lithium <b>disilicate</b> crowns on anterior (front) teeth.|$|E

25|$|Minerals are {{classified}} by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses {{by the degree}} of polymerization in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a 4− silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen anions, which gives {{the shape of a}} tetrahedron. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), <b>disilicates</b> (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), inosilicates (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the native elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the environments of cations in alkali silicates measured by X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MASNMR) are considered. Both {{are consistent with the}} modified random network for glass structure in which modifiers form channels percolating through the network. It is proposed that the mechanisms determining the distribution of bridging and non-bridging oxygen atoms at the glass transition are the same as those that promote ionic transport at lower temperatures in the glass. In particular the results of XAFS and MASNMR can be used to predict the activation energy for ionic transport and the magnitude of the electrical conductivity. Values of these parameters for alkali <b>disilicates</b> are in good agreement with those measured directly from transport properties...|$|R

If the CAD/CAM restorative material is zirconia, the restoration becomes [...] "radio-opaque", just as metal restorations are, blocking x-rays. Only alumina, lithium <b>disilicate</b> and some composite resin materials are [...] "radio-lucent", allowing dentists to track potential decay. Zirconia, conventional porcelain-to-metal, and traditional gold and other all-metal crowns block x-ray radiation, disallowing evaluation over time.|$|E

50|$|The Chinese lead-barium glasses {{typically}} present 5 to 15% BaO. The {{source of}} barium {{in the glass}} in not clear; however {{it is possible that}} ancient Chinese glassmakers used witherite (a mineral form of barium carbonate) as an ingredient. The use of a separate ingredient implies that barium had a specific function. This function could have been to flux the glass, by lowering the melting point of the melt; or stabilize the glass, by making it less soluble to water. It could also have been added to opacify the glass. Electron microprobe analysis of glass fragments have shown that the turbidity of certain lead-barium glasses is produced by barium <b>disilicate</b> crystals. This turbidity gives the glasses a jade-like appearance.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} {{polymerization}} can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites). Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. <b>Disilicates</b> (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates {{have two or three}} shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.|$|R

The corrosion of the materials was characterized by the measurement of the weight balance and microstructural investigations. Non-oxide ceramic materials based on silicon exhibited the typical degradation behavior with the formation and evaporation of silicon hydroxides. A different behavior was found in case of oxide materials. Meanwhile ZrO(sub 2) {{was found to be}} stable in this environment, a high corrosion attack was observed for alumina and mullite.

The comparably low flexural strength of 100 to 450 megapascals makes adhesive attachment necessary. Lithium <b>disilicate</b> is a glass ceramic, yet exhibits the material characteristics of oxide ceramics. It is exceptionally hard, yet non-brittle, and translucent. Oxide ceramics in particular are ideal for manufacturing high-strength bridge frameworks and crown copings in the front and on the sides of the mouth.

50|$|Several {{glasses are}} {{utilized}} in transparent armor, such as normal plate glass (soda-lime-silica), borosilicate glasses, and fused silica. Plate glass {{has been the}} most common glass used due to its low cost, but greater requirements for the optical properties and ballistic performance have generated the need for new materials. Chemical or thermal treatments can increase the strength of glasses, and the controlled crystallization of certain glass systems can produce transparent glass-ceramics. Alstom Grid Research & Technology (Stafford, UK), produced a lithium <b>disilicate</b> based glass-ceramic known as TransArm, for use in transparent armor systems with continuous production yielding vehicle windscreen sized pieces (and larger).

In the reaction, calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide and calcium ferrite were by-product, therefore the reaction factors showed significant influence on the synthesis and <b>disilicating</b> efficiency. To explore the synthesis mechanism and optimize the reaction factors, {{the composition of the}} intermediate obtained from the synthesis reaction was investigated through the combination of FTIR, ICP-AES and desilication reaction. The FTIR and desilication reaction results revealed that calcium hydroferrocarbonate is metastable compound in solution, and the reaction temperature and reaction time have significant influence on the systhesis. With the temperature and reaction time increasing, the content of calcium hydroferrocarbonate in the composition first increased and then reduced. The optimal factors were: temperature of 30 degrees C, reaction time of 16 hours, the liquid to solid mass ratio of 20 and rpm of 500 r. min(- 1).

All-ceramic systems tested were lithium <b>disilicate</b> and zirconia veneered by layering technique. Sixty specimens (n= 20) were subjected to shear bond strength. Ten of them were thermal and mechanical cycled. Fracture analysis was performed with stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis was performed across core/veneer interfaces. Thermal and mechanical cycling did not influence on bond strength. However, there was significant difference among systems (< 0. 01). CoCr group presented the highest values, followed by lithium <b>disilicate,</b> and zirconia.

40|$|The {{respective}} {{contributions of}} the charge carrier concentration and mobility to the ionic conductivity in glasses remain an open question. In the present work we calculate these two parameters from conductivity data {{as a function of}} temperature below and above the glass transition temperature, Tg. The basic hypothesis assumes that ionic displacement results from the migration of cationic pairs formed by a partial dissociation, which is a temperature-activated process. Below Tg their migration would follow a temperature-activated mechanism, while a free volume mechanism prevails above this temperature, leading to a deviation from the Arrhenius behavior. Expressions are formulated for the variation in ionic conductivity as a function of temperature in the supercooled and glassy states. Fitting the experimental data with the proposed expressions allows for the determination of characteristic parameters such as the charge carrier formation and migration enthalpies. Based on these values, it is then possible to calculate the charge carrier concentration and mobility in the entire temperature range. At room temperature, the mobility of effective charge carriers is estimated close to 10  4 cm 2 s- 1 V- 1 for alkali <b>disilicates</b> glasses under study, while the ratio between the number of effective charge carriers and the total number of alkali cations is estimated to be 10 - 8 to 10 - 10, comparable to the concentration of intrinsic defects in an ionic crystal or dissociated species from a weak electrolyte solutio...|$|R

In-situ loading experiments were also performed on the topcoat {{in order to establish}} its elastic constants. The ytterbium <b>disilicate</b> was found to have a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion resulting in compressive stresses of approximately 100 MPa throughout the topcoat. In-situ heating experiments revealed a statistically significant stress relaxation in the ytterbium <b>disilicate</b> topcoat upon thermal cycling to temperatures above 1300 °C, indicating the onset of stress relaxation but no cracks were observed in SEM micrographs.

Forty six cuts of each material were made in a custom test device that held the handpiece in a fixed position and moved the sample toward the cutting bur. Measurement of time, temperature change and weight loss were made to describe the cutting efficiency of a diamond bur. The amount of time needed to cut Zirconia was almost three times longer than the time needed to cut Lithium <b>Disilicate</b> and was found statistically significant (P < 0. 001) in an Independent Sample Test. The temperature decreased during the cut, but this change was not significant, suggesting that using water coolant would control temperature change. A Pearson Correlation test demonstrated the duration of the cut was related to both temperature and change of temperature for Zirconia but not for Lithium <b>Disilicate,</b> suggesting that the longer the cut for Zirconia the lower the temperature and the larger the change in temperature. There was a significant difference (P < 0. 001) for material loss for each group and also in the comparison of material loss between the two groups, Zirconia losing double of the weight than Lithium lost. This should be described as a proportional loss, as Zirconia is heavier than Lithium <b>Disilicate,</b> therefore the weight of material loss for Zirconia is greater than for Lithium <b>Disilicate</b> Within the limitations of this study it can be concluded that the amount of time needed to cut Zirconia was almost three times longer than the time needed to cut Lithium <b>Disilicate.</b> There was no significant heat generation when water spray was used.

It was found that the nucleation of the two-stage treatment was more effective than that of the single-stage treatment, resulting in the smaller lithium <b>disilicate</b> crystals (referred as the LD hereafter). Besides, the size of the LD crystals increases with increasing the second heat treatment temperatures, so the second heat treatment temperature should be as lower as possible than the LD crystallization peak temperature on the premise that the LD is the main crystalline phase. Finally, the lithium <b>disilicate</b> glass-ceramic with the crystalline size of about 100 nm was developed, and the real in-line transmission (RIT) value was measured to reach 27. 3 % at the wavelength of 550 nm (d = 2. 0 mm), which is much greater than that of the commercial lithium <b>disilicate</b> glass-ceramics.

The aim of {{the study}} was to provide data on the {{fracture}} strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns and porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP crown cores and to compare that data with the fracture strength of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP crown cores and monolithic lithium <b>disilicate</b> glass-ceramic crowns. Materials and methods. Sixty standardized crowns divided into six groups (n = 10) were fabricated: monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns, brand A, monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns, brand B, veneered high translucent Y-TZP crown cores, brand A, veneered high translucent Y-TZP crown cores, brand B, heat-pressed monolithic lithium <b>disilicate</b> crowns and veneered Y-TZP crown cores. All crowns were thermocycled, cemented onto dies, cyclically pre-loaded and finally loaded to fracture. Results. The monolithic Y-TZP groups showed significantly higher fracture strength (2795 N and 3038 N) compared to all other groups. The fracture strength in the veneered Y-TZP group (2229 N) was significantly higher than the monolithic lithium <b>disilicate</b> group (1856 N) and the veneered high translucent Y-TZP groups (1480 N and 1808 N). Conclusions. The fracture strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns is considerably higher than that of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP crown cores, porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP crown cores and monolithic lithium <b>disilicate</b> crowns. The fracture strength of a crown made of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP is, with a large safety margin, sufficient for clinical use for the majority of patients.
