5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José is {{an ancient}} Maya site located just north of Lake Petén Itzá in the Petén Basin region of the {{southern}} Maya lowlands. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilometres from the modern village of San José, in Guatemala's northern department of Petén. A medium-sized civic-ceremonial centre, {{it was an important}} political and economic centre during the Late Classic period (AD650950).|$|E

5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The July 1, 1919, {{incarnation}} of M-89 was much shorter relative to today's road. Its western terminus {{was at a}} junction with M-11 (later US31, now A-2) near Ganges. It traveled east to Fennville then turned south to Pearl before {{turning back to the}} east towards Allegan on an alignment that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> miles south of the present day configuration. The highway then left Allegan on present day M-222 and terminated at M-13, which is now A-45 east of the US131 freeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} very close to the Coney Island {{amusement}} area. It is close to the Luna Park (formerly Astroland) amusement park; the Scream Zone area, operated by Luna Park; Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park; the Cyclone roller coaster, the Thunderbolt roller coaster; and the amusement area that replaced the former Steeplechase Park. Other nearby attractions include the original Nathan's Famous store and the world-famous Riegelmann Boardwalk. The New York Aquarium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> blocks to the east, though the neighboring West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station is even closer to the aquarium.|$|E

5|$|Typical pulsar periods {{for young}} pulsars {{are of the}} order of one second, and they {{increase}} with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion. The pulse period of PSR B1620-26 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> milliseconds, providing strong evidence for matter transfer. It is believed that as the pulsar's red giant companion expanded, it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe, so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the neutron star.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of thorium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tens of tons per year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, {{and it is}} almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of the hill to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> steps down further east.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E
