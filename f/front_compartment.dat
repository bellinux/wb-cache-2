25|$|The Me 261 {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} features which were highly advanced for its day. The single-spar all-metal wing was designed {{to serve as a}} fuel tank and its depth at the wing root was only slightly less than the height of the fuselage. The fuselage itself was of virtually rectangular section, with space for five crew members, consisting of two pilots seated side-by-side with the radio operator directly behind in the <b>front</b> <b>compartment,</b> while a navigator and a flight engineer were housed in the rear fuselage under a stepped, glazed station.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{enters the}} <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> through two side doors. The driver {{sits on the}} right side of the vehicle while the vehicle {{commander}} sits on the left. Two additional hatches in the roof provide emergency exits for driver and commander. The gunner sits behind commander inside the weapon turret. The engine is located behind the driver, while the left side of the vehicle is fitted with weapon turret. All of the windows are bullet-proof and also further protected by armored shutters, which can be shut entirely, leaving a small observation slit for vision. An armoured hydraulic ramp door at the rear provide access to the troop compartment. Two inward-facing, benches provide seating for 5 troops each. Communications equipment include VHF / FM (anti-jamming and hopping) and GPS with night vision equipment included. Emergency exits are present on both sides of the Anoa as well as three roof hatches in the troop compartment with one rear-facing machine gun mounting on the right cupola. A video camera was also fitted at the rear of the vehicle to help driver while reversing the vehicle.|$|E
500|$|The Holy Thorn Reliquary {{is made of}} gold, enamel, rock crystal, pearls, rubies and sapphires. It is {{just over}} [...] high and weighs [...] There are some areas of damage (including {{what appears to be}} {{deliberate}} removal of enamel in the 19th century), and small losses and repairs; but generally the reliquary is in good condition. The central <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> holding the relic is protected by a thin pane of rock crystal, which has kept it in perfect condition. The enamel is mostly in ronde bosse technique, applied to three-dimensional figures, with white as the dominant colour. White enamel using lead was only recently developed, and very fashionable, dominating many contemporary ronde bosse works. There is also red, green, blue, pink and black enamel. Pure gold is used throughout, which is rare even in royal commissions of such pieces at this period; most use cheaper silver-gilt for the structural framework.|$|E

500|$|The new {{prototype}} {{was much}} closer to what Captain Verdeja had originally planned. The chassis was enlarged, and the engine {{was moved to the}} left side of the <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> of the hull. The volume of the fuel tanks and the thickness of the armor was also increased, while the height of the turret was decreased by sloping the turret's sides. [...] One of the most unusual— at the time— developments for the tank were the tracks, designed to eliminate the possibility of having them slide off when the tank was moving. The tank had a sprocket to the front of the hull, on each side, and a tensioner to the rear. The tracks were guided by four return rollers and four roadwheels. [...] The tracks had previously been tested on the original prototype; they were designed to fit around the roadwheel, and consequently lock themselves into place, avoiding the possibility of slipping off. [...] The construction of the prototype was postponed until May 1940, due to a shortage of funds, and the tank was finally delivered to the proving grounds of Carabanchel for testing. [...] The prototype was denominated the Verdeja1, and competed against a T-26B in a number of different tests. Ultimately, the Verdeja scored a total of 243 points, as compared to 205 scored by the T-26. [...] The testing resulted in a number of modifications, including higher suspension to allow climbing over taller obstacles, the increase in armor thickness, increase of the body width and the creation of an empty space at the rear, to allow for the future installation of a communications radio. [...] After two months work, the Verdeja1 was returned for testing and this time scored a total of 261.98 points. [...] Although the success of this prototype persuaded the Spanish government to issue an order for the construction of 1,000 tanks, ultimately lack of incentives to develop the relevant industrial infrastructure; the poor economic situation after the Spanish Civil War and absence of foreign clients, soon caused the production program to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|The weight {{distribution}} of the P-39 was supposedly the reason for its tendency to enter a dangerous flat spin, a characteristic Soviet test pilots were able to demonstrate to the skeptical manufacturer who {{had been unable to}} reproduce the effect. After extensive tests, it was determined the spin could only be induced if the aircraft was improperly loaded, with no ammunition in the <b>front</b> <b>compartment.</b> The flight manual noted a need to ballast the front ammunition compartment with the appropriate weight of shell casings to achieve a reasonable center of gravity. High-speed controls were light, consequently high-speed turns and pull-outs were possible. The P-39 had to be held in a dive since it tended to level out, reminiscent of the Spitfire. The recommended never-exceed dive speed limit (Vne) was [...] for the P-39.|$|E
60|$|He peered in hastily at {{the other}} three windows. Not a soul {{in any one of}} the {{remaining}} compartments! It was a very empty train, he had noticed himself, when he had got in at Tilgate; the one solitary occupant of the <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> of their carriage, a fat old lady with a big black bag, had bundled out at Chetwood. They were alone in the tunnel--at this end of the train at least; their sole duty now was to make haste and save themselves.|$|E
50|$|The BM Oplot is {{a further}} {{development}} of the previous Oplot, {{which is based on}} the T-84 main battle tank. The tank has a conventional layout with the driver's <b>compartment</b> at the <b>front,</b> fighting <b>compartment</b> in the middle and engine at the rear, accommodating a crew of three members.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rear-wheel drive}} vehicle with four-wheel drive, {{compared}} to a front-wheel drive vehicle with four-wheel drive, will have a less efficient interior packaging since the transmission is often under the <b>front</b> passenger <b>compartment</b> between the two seats, whereas the latter can package all the components under the hood.|$|R
50|$|Dumlupınar {{had been}} rammed by Swedish cargo ship M/V Naboland in her bow torpedo {{room on the}} {{starboard}} side, and started to take water from her <b>front</b> <b>compartments.</b> Due to {{the gravity of the}} damage caused, and the subsequent explosion in her central compartment, Dumlupınar sank within minutes. Most communications were severed along with any electrical power. The 88 surviving men inside the submarine, seeing that the vessel was taking water from the bow, tried to reach the stern to seek shelter in the torpedo room, with many of them perishing in the rapidly rising waters. Of the original 88, only 22 were able to reach and lock themselves in the stern torpedo compartment, and released an emergency communications buoy with the hope of contacting surface rescue workers.|$|R
60|$|The {{compartment}} immediately {{beneath the}} banquette, {{which is the}} <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> {{of the body of}} the coach, is called the coupé. The coupé extends across the whole coach, {{from one side to the}} other; but it is quite narrow. It has only one seat,--a seat facing the horses,--with places upon it for three passengers. There are windows in front, by which the passengers can look out under the coachman's seat when there is a coachman's seat there. The doors leading to the coupé are in the sides.|$|E
60|$|The diligences in France {{are very}} large, and {{are divided into}} {{different}} compartments, with a different price for each. There are usually three compartments below and one above. In the Italian diligences, however, {{or at least in}} the one in which Mr. George and Rollo travelled to Rome, there were only three. First there was the interior, or the body of the coach proper. Directly before this was a compartment, with a glass front, containing one seat only, which looked forward; there were, of course, places for three persons on this seat. This <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> is called the coupé.[1] It is considered the best in the diligence.|$|E
60|$|Behind this domestic, Mr and Mrs Boffin {{took their}} {{seats in the}} back {{compartment}} of the vehicle: which was sufficiently commodious, but had an undignified and alarming tendency, in getting over a rough crossing, to hiccup itself away from the <b>front</b> <b>compartment.</b> On their being descried emerging from {{the gates of the}} Bower, the neighbourhood turned out at door and window to salute the Boffins. Among those who were ever and again left behind, staring after the equipage, were many youthful spirits, who hailed it in stentorian tones with such congratulations as 'Nod-dy Bof-fin!' 'Bof-fin's mon-ey!' 'Down with the dust, Bof-fin!' and other similar compliments. These, the hammer-headed young man took in such ill part that he often impaired the majesty of the progress by pulling up short, and making as though he would alight to exterminate the offenders; a purpose from which he only allowed himself to be dissuaded after long and lively arguments with his employers.|$|E

50|$|A front-loader or loader is {{a tractor}} with an {{engineering}} tool {{which consists of}} two hydraulic powered arms {{on either side of}} the <b>front</b> engine <b>compartment</b> and a tilting implement.

40|$|Direct observation, filmed {{behaviour}} and {{morphological analysis}} {{were used to}} investigate mechanisms of larval feeding and movement in 20 species of Cyclorrhapha (Diptera). Feeding mechanisms refer to techniques of gathering food close to the pharynx entrance prior to sucking it in. A total of 12 mechanisms were recorded. Contrasting mechanisms were associated with saprophagy, phytophagy, mycophagy and zoophagy. Larvae had role-specific, compartmentalised bodies. The rear compartment grips substrates enabling the front ones to scan for food by sweeping {{from side to side}} or up and down. The <b>front</b> <b>compartments</b> extend or lunge to gather food or grip substrates during locomotion. Lower cyclorrhaphans had more disparate mechanisms than higher cyclorrhaphans. In the latter, the size, shape and movements of the thorax, pseudocephalon and head skeleton are diverse. Influences on this diversity are food quality and access conditions at development sites. Movement capabilities and functions were established for many components...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} the coming vehicle was in sight, and all further doubt was at an end. It was the {{diligence}} that now approached by the long street leading into the square--the diligence (in a dazzling new coat of yellow paint) that delivered the first visitors of the season at the inn door. Of the ten travelers released from the middle compartment and the back compartment of the carriage--all from various parts of Germany--three were lifted out helpless, and {{were placed in the}} chairs on wheels to be drawn to their lodgings in the town. The <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> contained two passengers only--Mr. Neal and his traveling servant. With an arm on either side to assist him, the stranger (whose malady appeared to be locally confined to a lameness in one of his feet) succeeded in descending the steps of the carriage easily enough. While he steadied himself on the pavement by the help of his stick--looking not over-patiently toward the musicians who were serenading him with the waltz in [...] "Der Freischutz"--his personal appearance rather damped the enthusiasm of the friendly little circle assembled to welcome him. He was a lean, tall, serious, middle-aged man, with a cold gray eye and a long upper lip, with overhanging eyebrows and high cheek-bones; a man who looked what he was--every inch a Scotchman.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of Rimailho's manipulations, the new tank had become a rather {{cumbersome}} and underpowered vehicle. It lacked a rotating turret, instead using a large overhanging <b>front</b> <b>compartment</b> housing the long 75 mm gun protruding from the nose.|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} carried out by Steyr. The {{suspension}} of the RSO remained unchanged, but the <b>front</b> driver's <b>compartment</b> was replaced with a low, lightly armoured superstructure. The result was a lightweight, cheap to produce, and highly mobile infantry anti-tank weapon. It was more exposed compared to the conventional, open-topped panzerjäger style of tank destroyer, which had a construction cost many times that of a RSO/PaK 40.|$|R
