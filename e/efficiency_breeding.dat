40|$|Abstract We review {{critical}} {{factors associated with}} reproductive performance of female breeding pigs, their lifetime performance and herd productivity in commercial herds. The factors include both sow-level and herd-level factors. High risk sow-level groups for decreasing reproductive performance of female pigs are low or high parity, increased outdoor temperature, decreased lactation feed intake, single inseminations, increased lactation length, prolonged weaning-to-first-mating interval, low birth weight or low preweaning growth rate, a few pigs born alive at parity 1, an increased number of stillborn piglets, foster-in or nurse sow practices and low or high age at first-mating. Also, returned female pigs are at risk having a recurrence of returning to estrus, and female pigs around farrowing are more at risk of dying. Herd-level risk groups include female pigs being fed in low <b>efficiency</b> <b>breeding</b> herds, late insemination timing, high within-herd variability in pig flow, limited numbers of farrowing spaces and fluctuating age structure. To maximize the reproductive potential of female pigs, producers are recommended to closely monitor females in these high-risk groups and improve herd management.

Leaf and growth traits such as assimilation pigments content, dry mass and leaf area of plants were measured. The genotype differences were recognized by chlorophyll a fluorescence fast kinetics method applied on penultimate young wheat leaves. Consequently, heat stress susceptibility {{based on the}} exposure of whole plants in pots to air temperature of 42 oC for 6 hours was measured, too. Rapid chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics method gave us better knowledge about differences among tetraploid wheat genotypes collection comparing to classic assimilation pigments analyse.

40|$|The article aims to {{investigate}} how operational managerial practices {{can contribute to}} improved farm level efficiency at dairy farms. Operational managerial practices are defined as animal health, breeding, and feeding practices. The main contribution of the article is that it investigates aspects that can be adjusted every day to improve farm efficiency. Aspects describing each of the considered managerial practices are regressed on farm level data envelopment efficiency scores based on farm level data from Sweden. The results show that changes in breeding and feeding practices can lead to improved <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Breeding</b> exactly the number of heifers that is needed for replacement of the dairy cows negatively affects long-run technical efficiency. On the other hand, analyzing forage positively affects long-run allocative efficiency and analyzing fodder grain positively affects short-run economic efficiency.

Results from screening of alfalfa at salinity levels of 0 to 3. 2 S m- 1 (0. 1 S m- 1 = 640 mg L- 1 = 10 mM NaCl at 25 ° C) indicated 29 populations exhibited salt tolerance at 2. 8 S m- 1. At salinity levels of 0 to 7. 2 S m- 1, 14 rhizobial strains exhibited salt tolerance at 6. 4 s m- 1. Compatibility, nodulation and nitrogen fixation efficiency in the 29 alfalfa populations and the 14 rhizobial strains under controlled conditions showed that four of the rhizobial strains were highly compatible with all 29 populations. These 29 populations and four strains were then exposed to 0 to 1. 6 S m- 1 NaCl, {{with the result that}} nitrogen was fixed with highly compatible symbionts at 1. 6 S m- 1 NaCl.
