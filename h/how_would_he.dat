500|$|All four modules of the S-series were {{included}} {{as part of}} the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword: [...] "The dungeon of the demi-lich Acererak was, for Gary, a kind of thought experiment: If an undead sorcerer really wanted to keep his tomb from being plundered by greedy adventurers, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> do it? The answer, of course, was to defend the crypt with tricks and traps designed not to challenge the intruders but to kill them dead. And furthermore, to do it in ways so horrific that all but the most determined party would give up and leave well enough alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pei Songzhi {{commented on}} this as follows: [...] "Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's {{character}} {{even though he}} knew that Guan would not remain under him. He did not send his men to pursue Guan Yu when Guan left, so as to allow Guan to fulfil his loyalty. If he did not possess the magnanimity of an overlord, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have allowed this to happen? This was a showcase of Cao Cao's goodness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wei Yan {{was from}} Yiyang Commandery (義陽郡; around present-day Tongbai County, Henan) in Jing Province. As one of Liu Bei's {{personal}} retainers, he followed Liu Bei into Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in 212 {{to attack the}} warlord Liu Zhang. He had many military accomplishments and was assigned as a General of the Standard (牙門將軍). When Liu Bei became King of Hanzhong in 219 after his victory over his rival Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign, he selected Wei Yan {{to be in charge}} of guarding Hanzhong Commandery and appointed him General Who Guards the North (鎮北將軍). This was done in spite of the fact that most of Liu Bei's officers believed that Zhang Fei would be the most likely candidate for the position, which assumed the imminent military responsibility of defending Hanzhong from attacks by Cao Cao. When Liu Bei announced his decision to entrust Wei Yan with that responsibility, his other subordinates were surprised. Liu Bei then asked Wei Yan in front of everyone <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> perform his duty, to which Wei Yan confidently replied, [...] "If Cao Cao mustered all his forces and invaded, let me assist my lord to repel the enemies; if an Assistant-General came with 100,000 troops, let me engulf them for my lord." [...] During his tenure, Wei Yan borrowed the concept of [...] "double gates" [...] from the ancient text Zhou Yi and laid numerous camps along the outskirt and trail exits linking to Hanzhong. His defence mechanism was very effective in driving the enemy out, and his arrangement would be adopted by those who later succeeded his post.|$|E

2500|$|Brittle Innings {{could for}} most intents and {{purposes}} be considered a sequel to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. [...] This simple designation only [...] begins to describe this emotionally and creatively complex story. [...] The novel, published in 1994 by Bantam Books, attempts to answer the questions: What if the doctor's much maligned creation managed to survive his Arctic pursuit? and <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be perceived in modern times? Bishop places him in the American Deep South during World War II playing minor league baseball. [...] Author and critic Brian Stableford writes that [...] "no potential reader should allow himself or herself to be {{put off by the}} seeming freakishness of its premise… There is not a wasted image or phrase in the text, which is extraordinarily rich and eminently readable from beginning to end. [...] It is a very fine book indeed…" [...] Concerning its relationship to Shelley's novel, Stableford writes that [...] "Brittle Innings {{seems to me to be}} the best sequel imaginable." [...] The New York Times book reviewer felt uncomfortable with the mix: [...] "The [...] is the real reason to read Brittle Innings; it has a better narrative and a more meaningful message than the subplot about the literate and sometimes likable monster. Mr. Bishop's fine prose makes each of these plot lines well worth reading, but they belong in separate novels." [...] In his essay [...] "Of (Human) Bondage in Michael Bishop's Brittle Innings" [...] Joe Sanders compares Bishop's young protagonist with Philip Carey of Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage. [...] "Philip Carey's struggle toward maturity is painfully messy…unconsciously he knows what he needs: connection to and then freedom from parental authority so that he can determine his own goals in life. [...] Danny Boles, with similar needs, is certain that he already has found something to believe in: baseball." [...] Sanders concludes [...] "Insofar as the characters of Brittle Innings learn to see life's vivid extremes and as they struggle to see more, they demonstrate that love can sometimes lead not to bondage but freedom." [...] The novel won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1995, and was nominated for the Hugo, World Fantasy, and Campbell Awards that same year.|$|E

60|$|So he {{told the}} {{architect}} all that he wished, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have that house furnished, and about {{the pictures on the}} wall and the knick-knacks on the tables; and he asked the man plainly for <b>how</b> much <b>he</b> <b>would</b> undertake the whole affair.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} on {{his side of the}} bargain. Now came mine. I folded tight my hands in my lap, glanced up at the flaming lamp. <b>How</b> much <b>would</b> <b>he</b> pay me? ...|$|R

60|$|As for me, my {{business}} was his money, and what I could make of him; and after that, if I {{could have found}} out any way to have done it, I would have sent him safe home to his house and to his family, for 'twas ten to one but he had an honest, virtuous wife and innocent children, that were anxious for his safety, {{and would have been}} glad to have gotten him home, and have taken care of him till he was restored to himself. And then with what shame and regret would he look back upon himself! <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> reproach himself with associating himself with a whore! picked up in the worst of all holes, the cloister, among the dirt and filth of all the town! <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be trembling for fear he had got the pox, for fear a dart had struck through his liver, and hate himself every time he looked back upon the madness and brutality of his debauch! <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he,</b> if he had any principles of honour, as I verily believe he had--I say, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> abhor the thought of giving any ill distemper, if he had it, as for aught he knew he might, to his modest and virtuous wife, and thereby sowing the contagion in the life-blood of his posterity.|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> far <b>would</b> <b>he</b> {{follow her}} {{and was it}} {{possible}} to shake him off? Or are such followers so expert that once upon a scent, they are like the Indian hunting dog, inevitable. She must see.|$|R
60|$|Though he {{was angry}} with her, <b>how</b> willingly <b>would</b> <b>he</b> take {{her into his arms}} and assure her of his forgiveness! <b>How</b> anxious <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be to make her {{understand}} that nothing should be spared by him to add beauty and grace to her life! Only, as a matter of course, Mr. Tregear must be abandoned. But he knew of himself that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not know <b>how</b> to begin to be tender and forgiving. He knew that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not know <b>how</b> not to be stern and hard.|$|R
60|$|She {{thought then}} how like unto a ruler of men he was, how much {{strength}} and power did his whole person express. She wondered, {{with a happy}} little feeling of anticipation, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take the news which she would impart to him, what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look when <b>he</b> {{knew that she was}} prepared to crown him with the diadem of Augustus, and to bestow on him the full gifts of her love.|$|R
6000|$|This {{fact was}} a cheering one, {{but there was}} still a dismal enough outlook. Where was he and <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> ever be able to gain the outer world once more? ...|$|E
6000|$|At that question, Barbara {{could not}} help sliding her eyes round. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> stand up to Granny? It was the moment {{to see what he}} was made of. Granny was terrific! ...|$|E

6000|$|Poor Mr. Tippengray was downcast. How {{much time}} must elapse before <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have an {{opportunity}} to deliver the piece of paper he had in his pocket! <b>How</b> long <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be obliged to lounge around by himself waiting for Ida Mayberry to return! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that I {{mean to be}} in {{the least}} afraid of him," [...] she continued. [...] "Perhaps it will be better that I should see him, and if he speaks to me have it out with him. <b>How</b> long <b>would</b> <b>he</b> stay?" ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{a pretty}} {{situation}} this for the Lord Giovanni, and here were fine opportunities for some brave acting under {{the eyes of his}} adored Madonna Paola. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> bear himself now? I wondered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go. I {{have no way}} out of it. Good-bye, Mr. Green; I cannot {{tell you}} how much obliged to you I am." [...] Then he turned back and she went into the station and took two {{first-class}} tickets for Rufford. At that moment Lord Rufford was turning himself comfortably in his bed. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have sprung up, and <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have fled, had he known the evil that was coming upon him! This happened on a Thursday, a day on which, as Arabella knew, the U. R. U. did not go out;--the very Thursday on which John Morton was buried and the will was read at Bragton.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know what}} you 're talking about," [...] he answered. [...] "Fancy me going off with you! What 'd your father say? and--and the rest? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> think of me? And what 'd he do?" ...|$|E

60|$|He {{answered}} boldly, {{and with}} some temper (<b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have answered could he have seen the thousand pound cheque that was reposing upon the table in Philip's rusty pocket-book, and known for what purpose it came there?).|$|E
6000|$|It {{was almost}} too dark now to {{distinguish}} the stranger's features but there seemed a faint suggestion of irony in his voice. 'And how do you suppose your angry naughty child would set about it? It's narrow quarters; <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> begin?' ...|$|E
