500|$|Tim Minear was {{selected}} by Whedon to be the show runner, who serves as the head writer and production leader. According to Whedon [...] " [...] understood the show {{as well as any}} human being, and just brought so much to it that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> though he were always a part of it". Many of the other production staff were selected from people Whedon had worked with in the past, {{with the exception of the}} director of photography David Boyd, who was the [...] "big find" [...] and who was [...] "full of joy and energy".|$|E
500|$|Part of the 2001 {{playback}} {{scene was}} included in Martin Scorsese's documentary , and an early take from the 1970 sessions appeared on the bonus disc accompanying that film's DVD release in late 2011. This demo version, which Harrison introduces as [...] "Awaiting for You All", was included on the compilation [...] (2012). Referring to Harrison's stated regret {{at the amount of}} echo Spector used on All Things Must Pass, compilation producer Giles Martin says of the song's sparse arrangement on Early Takes: [...] "I think this is really cool, it's got a good basic band groove, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> George breaking down a wall of sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|I don’t {{think of}} it as straddling. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{changing}} the line. What I’ve been talking about for years is how in Japan, that line is less defined. Both by the culture and by the post-War economic situation. Japanese people accept that art and commerce will be blended; and in fact, they are surprised by the rigid and pretentious Western hierarchy of [...] "high art." [...] In the West, it certainly is dangerous to blend the two because people will throw all sorts of stones. But that's okay—I’m ready with my hard hat.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{sessions}} for [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. {{to use a}} click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. [...] A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly & the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind. [...] Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, [...] "I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don't think {{it needs to be}} flashy. For War I use a click track, something I haven't used before, it's a way of keeping time in my headphones. When I listened to the music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I'll move on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just about my own style and that's what I wanted to do. I think there is a definite style on War where there isn't on the previous albums." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{private school}} I {{attended}} {{in the company}} of other boys with whom I was brought up was called Densmore Academy, a large, square building of a then hideous modernity, built of smooth, orange-red bricks with threads of black mortar between them. One reads of happy school days, yet I fail to recall any really happy hours spent there, even in the yard, which was covered with black cinders that cut you when you fell. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a penitentiary, and the memory of the barred lower windows gives substance to this impression.|$|E
6000|$|I replied, modestly, that, after all, {{both our}} freedom and our good conduct had their limits, {{and she turned}} quickly about and shook her fan with a {{dramatic}} gesture at Pickering. [...] "No matter, no matter!" [...] she cried; [...] "I should {{like to see the}} country which produced that wonderful young man. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a sort of Arcadia--a land of the golden age. He's so delightfully innocent! In this stupid old Germany, if a young man is innocent he's a fool; he has no brains; he's not a bit interesting. But Mr. Pickering says the freshest things, and after I have laughed five minutes at their freshness it suddenly occurs to me that they are very wise, and I think them over for a week." [...] "True!" [...] she went on, nodding at him. [...] "I call them inspired solecisms, and I treasure them up. Remember that when I next laugh at you!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All {{numbers are}} {{to me as}} images of figures in general; I see them in {{ordinary}} Arabic type (except in some special cases), and they have definite positions in space (as shown in the Fig.). Beyond 100 I am conscious of coming down a dotted line {{to the position of}} 1 again, and of going over the same cycle exactly as before, e.g. with 120 in the place of 20, and so on up to 140 or 150. With higher numbers the imagery is less definite; thus, for 1140, I can only say that there are no new positions, I do not see the entire number in the place of 40; but if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> 11 hundred and 40, I see 40 in its place, 11 in its place, and 100 in its place; the picture is not single though the ideas combine. I seem to stand near 1. I have to turn somewhat to see from 30-40, and more and more to see from 40-100; 100 lies high up to my right and behind me. I see no shading nor colour in the figures." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{will not}} {{dwell on the}} many incongruities hence resulting, by asking how the [...] "originating Mind" [...] is {{to be thought of}} as having states {{produced}} by things objective to it; as discriminating among these states, and classing them as like and unlike; and as preferring one objective result to another. I will simply ask--What happens if we ascribe to the [...] "originating Mind" [...] the character absolutely essential to the conception of Mind, that it consists of a series of states of consciousness? Put a series of states of consciousness as cause, and the evolving Universe as effect, and then endeavor to see the last as flowing from the first. I find it possible to imagine in some dim way a series of states of consciousness serving as antecedent to any one of the movements I see going on; for my own states of consciousness are often indirectly the antecedents to such movements. But how if I attempt to think of such a series as antecedent to all actions throughout the Universe--to the motions of the multitudinous stars through space, to the revolutions of all their planets round them, to the gyrations of all these planets on their axes, to the infinitely-multiplied physical processes going on in each of these suns and planets? I cannot think of a single series of states of consciousness as causing even the relatively small group of actions going on over the Earth's surface. I cannot think of it even as antecedent to all the various winds and the dissolving clouds they bear, to the currents of all the rivers, and the grinding actions of all the glaciers; still less can <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> antecedent to the infinity of processes simultaneously going on in all the plants that cover the globe, from scattered polar lichens to crowded tropical palms, and in all the millions of quadrupeds that roam among them, and the millions of millions of insects that buzz about them. Even to a single small set of these multitudinous terrestrial changes, I cannot conceive as antecedent a single series of states of consciousness--cannot, for instance, think of it as causing the hundred thousand breakers that are at this instant curling over on the shores of England. How, then, is it possible for me to conceive an [...] "originating Mind," [...] which I must represent to myself as a single series of states of consciousness, working the infinitely-multiplied sets of changes simultaneously going on in worlds too numerous to count, dispersed throughout a space that baffles imagination? ...|$|E
