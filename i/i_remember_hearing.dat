500|$|In 2011, Rolling Stone {{magazine}} ranked [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] {{at number}} 45 on [...] "100 Best Songs of the 2000s" [...] list, noting that Minogue had [...] "seduced the U.S. with this mirror-ball classic" [...] and that [...] "we've been hearing {{it at the}} gym ever since." [...] NME ranked the song at number 74 on their [...] "100 Best Track of the Noughties" [...] list, saying it [...] "encapsulated everything enviable in a well-crafted song" [...] and heralding it as Minogue's best single. In 2012, Priya Elan from NME ranked the song at number four on his [...] "The Greatest Pop Songs in History" [...] list, saying: [...] "It was unlike any song <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> before." [...] In 2012, The Guardian included the song in their list of [...] "The Best Number One Records," [...] labelling it to be [...] "sleek, Arctic-blue minimalism, like an emotionally thwarted retelling of Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love." [...] In the same year, PRS for Music, a UK copyright collection society and performance rights organisation which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and composers, named [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] the [...] "Most Popular Song of the Decade" [...] as it received the highest airplay and live covers in the 2000s (decade).|$|E
2500|$|Present party designations {{have become}} empty of all contents... Vastly {{extended}} State expenditure, vastly increased demands from the taxpayer {{who has to}} provide the money, social reform regardless of expense, cash exacted from the taxpayer already at his wits' end—when were the problems of plus and minus more desperate? How are we to measure the use and abuse of industrial organization? Powerful orators find [...] "Liberty" [...] the true keyword, but then <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> from a learned student that of [...] "liberty" [...] he knew well over two hundred definitions. Can we {{be sure that the}} [...] "haves" [...] and the [...] "have-nots" [...] will agree in their selection of the right one? We can only trust to the growth of responsibility; we may look to circumstances and events to teach their lesson.|$|E
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [Frowning.] Ah! yes. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing,</b> at {{the time}} of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.|$|E
6000|$|He caught {{hold of the}} harp, {{turned red}} as a beet, and {{commenced}} to blow. He blew a dinky little tune <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> when <b>I</b> was a kid: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> {{the name}} before. Now then--just for curiosity's sake--what has sent you {{to me on}} this {{extraordinary}} errand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. Have we any {{pedigree}} worthy to {{be compared}} with that of professedly old families? <b>I</b> never <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> of any ancestor further back than my great-grandfather.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah yes, {{they keep}} a {{permanent}} guard there {{on account of}} the value of the securities that they hold. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> it talked of in the City." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy {{he used to}} {{be awfully}} spooney on Mab Grex. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> that they were to have been married, only that neither of them had sixpence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{once used}} to do, {{and to give}} us great fêtes. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> of them before I was out. We must make him resume them. He is immensely rich.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{my heart}} I {{did not believe}} we would ever get through alive. It was almost pitch dark now, and the snow grew deeper every moment. We were chilled to the heart. I thought how nice {{it would be to}} lie down and rest; but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> that that was fatal, and I endeavoured to stumble on with the others. It was {{wonderful}} how the girls kept up, even Cecily. It occurred to me to be thankful that Sara Ray was not with us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see {{how that}} could be," [...] she retorted. [...] "I haven't seen even a bird in the grounds. <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> a single twitter in the trees. The whole place {{appeared}} utterly deserted except for the voice." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> once <b>hearing</b> M. Renan {{say that}} he would sooner live under a {{military}} despotism than under the despotism of the Church, because the former merely limited the freedom of action, while the latter limited the freedom of mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> about her. But {{there are}} no end of people here that I don't know, for they're grown up and altered so since I used to go about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say so; for <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> {{about a man}} {{who sold}} his shadow, and then got into lots of trouble because he had none. We promised to follow them, and we must," [...] said Polly.|$|E
6000|$|... “I say, I’m so sorry,” {{said the}} Sheep, with his apologetic smile. “Of course <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> about the buzzards, but somehow I didn’t connect this bird with them. And {{it was such}} an east shot—” ...|$|E
2500|$|As McMahon later stated, [...] "I {{realised}} what I {{wanted to}} do was work with a good synth player [...] – a very good synth player. So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush and when I heard he was now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanland." [...] They worked on their first composition, [...] "Pulse," [...] inspired by the sound of a heartbeat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Mason, old top," [...] said Freddie, {{entering}} the sitting-room, [...] "I hope you don't mind my barging in like this, {{but the fact}} is things are a bit thick. I'm dashed worried, and I didn't know another soul I could talk it over with. As a matter of fact, I wasn't sure you were in New York at all, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> you say in London that you were popping back almost at once, so I looked you up in the telephone book and took a chance. I'm dashed glad you are back. When did you arrive?" ...|$|R
60|$|This was a {{good deal}} to answer at once, so I just said that <b>I</b> didn't <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> any gong. Tom Myers and his brother George, however, spoke up, and said that they had heard a gong, they thought, but did not know what it was for.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I {{am afraid}} I don't. I live so {{much out of}} the world, and see so few people. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> years ago of an old Lord Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he died of}} {{apoplexy}} {{nearly a}} year ago. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> you say you had to pay money for him; and he left his daughters badly off; {{one of them is}} under-teacher at Miss Firniss's, where I've been to school, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> at {{the time}} that this Buskes (who is a good musician) took one of his victims, who was on the way to execution, into the chapel and played the [...] "Dead March in Saul," [...] or some such piece, over him on the organ.|$|E
25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But <b>I</b> do <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> them. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|R
60|$|I sat {{thinking}} of the pain in my own chest, and wishing <b>I</b> could <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> Annable's jaw smash, and wishing that my knuckles were more bruised than they were—though that was bad enough. I got up, and helped George to rise. He swayed, almost pulling me over. But in a while he could walk unevenly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] ses Bob Pretty, in a {{thoughtful}} voice, to Smith—"I wonder whether you or Mr. Cutts kicked ’em {{in the pond}} while you was struggling with me. Come to think of it, <b>I</b> seem to <b>remember</b> <b>’earing</b> a splash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, indeed," [...] replied Tip, gravely. [...] "These pills may be {{of great}} use to us. I wonder if old Mombi knew {{they were in the}} bottom of the pepper-box. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> her say that she got the Powder of Life from this same Nikidik." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] he {{said with}} a moan. [...] "Each step now is {{carrying}} us lower. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> some of the old hands say the abandoned drifts were a hundred feet or so farther down the hill. We must be considerably below the deepest shaft." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you goose. He {{is not the}} son; he is the grandson. They {{were going}} to make the archdeacon a bishop, and <b>I</b> <b>{{remember}}</b> <b>hearing</b> that he was terribly disappointed. He is getting to be an old man now, I suppose; and yet, dear me, how well I remember his father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] she said, [...] "that <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> {{him talk about}} much else. Every day there was some story he had to tell about what he and you had done. Mighty near the last thing I heard him tell was about {{the time when the}} Indians wounded him, and you crawled out to him through the grass, with a canteen of water, while they--" ...|$|R
60|$|February 23d.--There {{came to see}} me {{the other}} day a young gentleman with a {{mustache}} and a blue cloak, who announced himself as William Allingham, and handed me a copy of his poems, a thin volume, with paper covers, published by Routledge. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>hearing</b> his name, but had never seen any of his works. His face was intelligent, dark, pleasing, and not at all John-Bullish. He said that he had been employed in the Customs in Ireland, and was now going to London to live by literature,-- to be connected with some newspaper, I imagine. He had been in London before, and was acquainted with some of the principal literary people,-- among others, Tennyson and Carlyle. He seemed to have been on rather intimate terms with Tennyson. We talked awhile in my dingy and dusky Consulate, and he then took leave. His manners are good, and he appears to possess independence of mind.|$|R
6000|$|Now thought I to myself, who {{is there}} in the world who could see a man catch hold of the handle of a pistol in the {{recesses}} of a dark place and under a blanket at night, except the owner of that voice which <b>I</b> seemed to <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> in a certain drawing-room in England? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{cried the}} good lady, {{with a very}} roguish smile. [...] "I see how the land lies. Of course, of course, why shouldn't it? <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> about that young man. I have heard about the Girdlestones also. African merchants {{they were in the}} City. You see I know all about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. Mother {{might have had}} them when father was first sent to the asylum for treatment. Although <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> her once say that since father's mind had become {{affected}} he would not trust any one with his affairs, but kept all his money and papers hidden away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! was {{she lost}} at sea? But hold on, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> {{something}} about that." [...] Jack Rooney scratched his head. [...] "Let's see, {{who was it}} told me? Oh, I remember now, Tom Fetjen. He told me something about her getting fast in the ice, but I don't remember the particulars." ...|$|E
5000|$|Former Red Sox player Troy O'Leary {{was interviewed}} and stated he didn't {{remember}} the incident. [...] "I remember the normal union meetings {{in spring training}} where they'd talk about drugs and steroids, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> doctors talking negatively about them, but <b>I</b> don't <b>remember</b> ever <b>hearing</b> anything like, 'OK, {{this is the right}} way to do steroids.' If that happened, I missed that one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} {{that he is a}} mean-hearted caitiff, Myles," [...] said he at last, hesitatingly. [...] "The Earl hath many enemies, and I have heard that he hath stood more than once in peril, having been accused of {{dealings}} with the King's foes. He was cousin to the Earl of Kent, and <b>I</b> do <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> that he had a narrow escape at that time from ruin. There be more reasons than thou wottest of why he should not have dealings with thy father." ...|$|R
2500|$|Absent from Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 are {{top-down}} levels, {{which in}} its predecessor symbolized an enemy attack while {{en route to}} a location. [...] When the game's producer Rey Jimenez was asked why they are being excluded, Jimenez responded “People liked them because they were in the original, but <b>I</b> don’t <b>remember</b> <b>hearing</b> anyone say that was their favorite part of the game. It doesn’t have the swinging, you know?” Jimenez also revealed that with Rearmed 2 level progression will be linear instead of allowing the player to pick and choose their path. [...] Players will, however, be able to return to previous levels using newly acquired abilities and weaponry to access areas they were previously unable to.|$|R
