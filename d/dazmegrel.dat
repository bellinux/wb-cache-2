40|$|Because {{thromboxane}} synthesis enhances gastric mucosal damage we {{have investigated}} whether the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor <b>dazmegrel</b> might be protective to the mucosa. <b>Dazmegrel</b> at {{a dose of}} 1 and 5 mg per rat (4. 8 and 23. 8 mg/kg) significantly reduced {{the damage caused by}} acidified taurocholate. In parallel experiments <b>dazmegrel</b> exerted a selective and dose dependent inhibition of ex vivo thromboxane synthesis by gastric fragments over the dose range in which protection was observed. As <b>dazmegrel</b> can be given to man, these experiments suggest that investigation of mucosal protection would be justified...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{metoprolol}} and the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor <b>dazmegrel,</b> alone and in combination, {{were examined in}} a model of coronary artery occlusion in conscious rats. In a dose (2 mg kg- 1), intravenously, {{that resulted in a}} marked bradycardia (of 50 - 80 beats min - 1) metoprolol did not influence the incidence or severity of the ventricular arrhythmias that occur in the first 20 min following occlusion, nor did it improve survival (assessed at both 20 min and 16 h). In a dose (5 mg kg- 1), intravenously, that in another conscious rat model involving tissue hypoperfusion inhibited thromboxane production, <b>dazmegrel</b> also did not modify ischaemic arrhythmias or survival. In contrast, metoprolol and <b>dazmegrel</b> (2 mg kg- 1 and 5 mg kg- 1 i. v.) when given together prior to coronary artery occlusion, produced a significant reduction in mortality both at 20 min and 16 h (e. g. from 60 - 75 % in the control, metoprolol alone and <b>dazmegrel</b> alone groups and only 25 % in the combined-treatment group). This was due to a decrease in the incidence of terminal ventricular fibrillation. The results suggest that a combination of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with a drug that inhibits thromboxane synthesis may offer more protection against ischaemia-induced ventricular fibrillation than either drug used alone. They suggest a role for both catecholamines and thromboxane in the genesis of ischaemia-induced ventricular fibrillation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} acute {{pretreatment}} with metoprolol, <b>dazmegrel</b> and {{a combination of}} these two drugs has been examined on myocardial infarct size in rats. Ischaemic damage was assessed 4 h after coronary artery occlusion in anaesthetized rats and after 48 h of ischaemia in conscious rats. Infarct size was measured histochemically (by using periodic-acid-Schiff diastase reaction for glycogen) and by standard histological examination (haematoxylin and eosin stain). There was some evidence of protection of the myocardium by metoprolol following 4 h of ischaemia (determined histologically) but this was not apparent 48 h after occlusion. When given alone, <b>dazmegrel</b> had no significant effects on infarct size assessed by either method. A clear reduction in the extent of glycogen depletion and histological damage was observed with the combination of metoprolol and <b>dazmegrel</b> 48 h after the onset of ischaemia. This protection was seen to occur in the horizontal plane of the heart, preventing the extension of the infarct towards the posterior wall of the left ventricle and showing some salvage of the epicardial surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Feeding rats {{with a high}} {{fructose}} diet {{results in}} insulin resistance and hypertension. Fructose-hypertensive rats (FHR) have increased vascular levels of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and thromboxane (TXA 2). We have previously shown that chronic treatment with either the dual endothelin receptor blocker, bosentan, or the thromboxane synthase inhibitor, <b>dazmegrel,</b> prevented fructose-induced increases in blood pressure, suggesting that both ET- 1 and TXA 2 play important roles {{in the development of}} hyperinsulinemia/ insulin resistance-associated hypertension. In this study, we investigated the potential interrelationship between ET- 1 and TXA 2 in the development of fructose-induced hypertension in vivo. Male Wistar rats were fed on a high fructose diet for 9 weeks. Either bosentan or <b>dazmegrel</b> treatment (daily by oral gavage) was initiated 3 weeks after the start of fructose feeding for a total duration of 6 weeks. At the end of drug treatment, blood and aorta were collected from each animal. Plasma thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2), a stable TXA 2 metabolite, increased significantly in FHR and was reduced to control level by both chronic bosentan and <b>dazmegrel</b> treatment. Protein expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) was elevated significantly in FHR aortas and treatment with bosentan and <b>dazmegrel</b> corrected these changes. These results indicate that the actions of ET- 1 in the aorta of FHR may be mediated through COX 2 -derived TXA 2. Bosentan may prevent the development of hypertension in fructose-fed rats through inhibition of COX 2 induction and subsequently the reduction in plasma TXA 2.

40|$|The leukotactic {{responsiveness}} {{of human}} peripheral blood monocytes is {{regulated by the}} cell-directed inhibitor of monocyte leukotaxis, CDI-MLx. The actions of CDI-MLx on normal monocytes in vitro were abrogated by co-incubation with inhibitors of cyclooxy-genase and thromboxane synthetase with indomethacin and <b>dazmegrel</b> (UK- 38, 485) being most active. The actions of CDI-MLx were mimicked by the thromboxane A 2 analogue, U- 46619, and by 12 -HHT with half-maximal inhibition observed at 1010 M; PGE 2 was 1000 -fold less active. SQ 29, 548, a thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist, blocked the effects of CDI-MLx, U- 46619, and 12 -HHT. Production of PGE 2 and thrombox-ane B 2 by purified monocytes was stimulated by CDI-MLx and this effect was also blocked by indomethacin, <b>dazmegrel,</b> and dazoxiben. These data suggest a major regu-latory role for thromboxane synthetase products in human monocyte leukotaxis. Key words: phagocytes, locomotion, regulatio...|$|E
40|$|Mice transplanted with NC {{carcinoma}} {{were treated}} with the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor <b>dazmegrel</b> (UK 38485) or with nafazatrom (BAY G 6575), a compound that is reported to increase prostacyclin formation. Some experiments included the cytotoxic drugs methotrexate and melphalan. The tumours were excised under anaesthesia on day 14 or day 21 after transplantation, and weighed; some were extracted for prostanoids which were measured by radioimmunoassay. Mouse survival time was determined up to day 121, and cancer spread was determined by postmortem examination. The survival was increased by methotrexate and melphalan but not by the other drugs. Nafazatrom-treated mice tended to have lighter tumours. Although <b>dazmegrel</b> reduced the formation of thromboxane B 2 during clotting of blood from normal mice, it {{did not affect the}} tumour yields of prostanoids. Nafazatrom had no effect on serum or tumour prostanoids. There were no obvious effects of the treatments on the recurrence of tumour in the excision scar, lung metastasis or spread to lymph nodes...|$|E
40|$|Acute necrotising {{pancreatitis}} in rats was {{induced by}} injecting 5 % sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Prostaglandin E 2 (100 micrograms/kg subcutaneously twice) decreased {{the mortality rate}} from 100 % to 60 % (NS). When treatment with prostaglandin E 2 was combined with simultaneous administration of either <b>dazmegrel</b> (UK 38, 485, 50 mg/kg bodyweight) or Sibelium (Flunarizine R 14, 950, 0. 2 mg/kg body weight) {{a significant decrease in}} the mortality rate (p less than 0. 05) was recorded. <b>Dazmegrel</b> is a selective thromboxane A 2 synthetase inhibitor and prevents the formation of thromboxane A 2. Flunarizine (a calcium entry blocker) decreases thromboxane A 2 formation and also inhibits the effects of raised thromboxane A 2 concentrations. As plasma thromboxane B 2 (the stable metabolite of thromboxane A 2) concentrations increase and the plasma prostaglandin E 2 concentrations decrease in acute necrotising pancreatitis in rats, {{the results of the present}} study indicate that these prostaglandins play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. It is suggested that restoration of the balance in prostanoid concentrations will have a beneficial effect on the course of acute necrotising pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|Because {{endogenous}} prostaglandins may {{protect the}} gastric mucosa a {{study was conducted}} to determine factors influencing the synthesis of immunoreactive prostaglandin (iPG) E 2 and thromboxane (iTx) B 2 as measured by radioimmunoassay and prostaglandin catabolism measured radiometrically, in human gastric mucosa. Gastric mucosa was obtained at endoscopy. Synthesis of iPE 2 and iTxB 2 was inhibited in vitro by indomethacin; iTxB 2 synthesis was also selectively inhibited by the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor <b>dazmegrel.</b> Prostaglandin catabolism was inhibited by carbenoxolone. Multivariate analysis showed that synthesis of iPGE 2 from endogenous precursor during homogenisation was decreased in patients on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Mucosal inflammation was associated with significantly increased synthesis of iPGE 2 and decreased prostaglandin catabolism. There were no differences between the mucosa of patients with or without gastric ulcers, nor between the ulcer rim and mucosa 5 cm away. Age, sex, smoking history and ingestion of antisecretory drugs appeared to exert no influence. In this study gastritis was the major influence on prostaglandin synthesis. It seems unlikely that prostaglandin deficiency is a strong predisposing factor for gastric ulceration...|$|E
40|$|Human platelets, in {{the absence}} of antibody, are {{cytotoxic}} to tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii as determined by vital staining, transmission electron microscopy, and the failure of Toxoplasma to survive and replicate in mice after in vitro interaction of the organisms with platelets. Platelet to T. gondii ratios as low as 1 : 3 were toxic to the organisms with direct cell-cell contact essential for platelet-mediated cytotoxicity. Adherence of platelets to T. gondii and disruption of surface membranes and cytoplasmic contents of the organisms were observed ultrastructurally. Reactive oxygen species were not implicated in the platelet-mediated toxicity. The interaction of T. gondii with platelets resulted in a marked increase in thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) production compared with that by unstimulated platelets. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin inhibited platelet-mediated cytolytic activity as did the selective TXA 2 synthetase inhibitor <b>dazmegrel,</b> indicating a role for thromboxane in the platelet-induced cytotoxicity. Further, toxoplasmacidal activity was retained in the TXA 2 synthetase-containing microsomal fractions of platelets disrupted by freezing and thawing; cytolytic activity was absent in microsome-depleted platelet supernatant fractions. Both the TXA 2 -generating platelet microsome system and a stable TXA 2 analogue induced damage to the cellular membranes of the Toxoplasma as noted b...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{epithelium}} and cyclooxygenase products {{was investigated}} in the responses of isolated airways to sudden stretch. Strips of guinea pig trachea, in some of which the epithelium had been removed mechanically, were suspended in organ chambers; isometric tension was recorded. After rapid stretching to their optimal tension, the preparations (with and without epithelium) relaxed initially and then contracted to a level close to the imposed tension. Afterward, tissues with epithelium maintained this level of tension, but those without epithelium relaxed. After treatment with papaverine or isoproterenol (at concentrations causing maximal relaxation), stretch was followed only by a decrease in tension; a similar response to stretch was also obtained in tissues treated with indomethacin or acetylsalicylic acid (inhibitors of cyclooxygenase). <b>Dazmegrel</b> (an inhibitor of thromboxane synthase) and SQ- 29548 (an antagonist of prostaglandin H 2 or thromboxane A 2 receptors) {{did not affect the}} response of tissues with epithelium but abolished the stretch-induced contraction in those without epithelium. Tranylcypromine, which inhibits prostacyclin synthase, and tetrodotoxin, which blocks local reflexes, did not significantly affect the responses of the tissues to stretch. These observations suggest that thromboxane may mediate the epithelium-independent contraction and that another product of cyclooxygenase contributes to the maintenance of tension on stretching observed in tissues with epithelium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of glial tumor cells to migrate and diffusely infiltrate normal brain compromises surgical eradication of the disease. Identification of genes associated with invasion may offer novel strategies for anti-invasive therapies. The gene for TXsyn, an enzyme of the arachidonic acid pathway, {{has been identified}} by differential mRNA display as being overexpressed in a glioma cell line selected for migration. In this study TXsyn mRNA expression {{was found in a}} large panel of glioma cell lines but not in a strain of human astrocytes. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated TXsyn in the parenchyma of glial tumors and in reactive astrocytes, whereas it could not be detected in quiescent astrocytes and oligodendroglia of normal brain. Glioma cell lines showed a wide range of thromboxane B 2 formation, the relative expression of which correlated with migration rates of these cells. Migration was effectively blocked by specific inhibitors of TXsyn, such as furegrelate and <b>dazmegrel.</b> Other TXsyn inhibitors and cyclooxygenase inhibitors were less effective. Treatment with specific inhibitors also resulted in a decrease of intercellular adhesion in glioma cells. These data indicate that TXsyn plays {{a crucial role in the}} signal transduction of migration in glial tumors and may offer a novel strategy for anti-invasive therapies...|$|E
