40|$|Historically, {{the study}} of tight <b>immersions</b> of {{manifolds}} had its origins in {{the study of}} <b>immersions</b> with minimal total absolute curvature. The most significant result {{in the study of}} minimal total absolute curvature <b>immersions</b> is the theorem of Chern and Lashof, which completely characterizes minimal total absolute curvature <b>immersions</b> (and tight <b>immersions)</b> of spheres into a Euclidean space. An essential ingredient in this characterization was a reformulation of the problem in terms of the Morse theory of linear height functions and the topological characteristics of the manifold being immersed. In this sense, the theorem of Chern and Lashof characterizes tight <b>immersions</b> of the topologically simplest compact manifold. It is very natural to try and characterize tight <b>immersions</b> of other manifolds with topological restrictions.
