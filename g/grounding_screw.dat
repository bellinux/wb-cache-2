50|$|Sometimes the {{fittings}} {{are considered}} sufficiently conductive to bond (electrically unite) the metal conduit to a metal junction box (thus sharing the box's ground connection); other times, grounding bushings are used which have bonding jumpers from the bushing to a <b>grounding</b> <b>screw</b> on the box.|$|E
5000|$|Special {{feedthrough}} twist-on {{wire connectors}} differ from standard wire connectors {{in that they}} have an additional opening {{at the top of the}} insulated cap. This allows a single-conductor bare wire to be pushed through the hole, forming a [...] "pigtail" [...] section which can be attached to a <b>grounding</b> <b>screw.</b> These feedthrough connectors are typically green, and are also called [...] "screw-on grounding connectors".|$|E

5000|$|Replacing the {{receptacle}} {{with the}} three-prong type {{and leaving the}} <b>ground</b> <b>screw</b> unconnected is just as unsafe as using a cheater plug, but has the additional disadvantage that subsequent users of the outlet {{may not be aware}} that it is not properly grounded. However, if the <b>ground</b> <b>screw</b> of the receptacle is connected to the neutral side, electric shock is possible even if the appliance is properly functioning. This is called a [...] "false" [...] or [...] "bootleg" [...] ground and is a serious safety hazard often undetected by common receptacle testers.|$|R
40|$|Subject of the bachelor’s {{thesis is}} a newly built house. It is the {{construction}} of diffusion-open timber, based mainly on the <b>ground</b> <b>screws.</b> Floor plan of the first storey consists of two connected rectangles. The building consists of two floors and an adjoining garage. Roofing is done with a shed roof over the main living area and another shed roof over the garage. The advantages of the building are relatively small thickness of external walls with good thermal properties and fast process of construction. The house is situated in the village Miroslavské Knínice...|$|R

5000|$|A screw picket is a metal device {{which is}} used to secure objects to the <b>ground.</b> Today, <b>screw</b> pickets are used widely to {{temporarily}} [...] "picket" [...] dogs.

5000|$|Three-prong plugs do not {{fit into}} the older, two-prong {{receptacle}}s. [...] When used as intended, the ground pin of the 3-wire receptacle is {{to be connected to}} the <b>grounded</b> cover <b>screw,</b> or to an external ground. In 1969 Underwriters Laboratories mandated three-prong plugs on major appliances for safety. At that time, only half of the receptacles in US homes were three-prong. Wiring in most homes did not include a <b>grounding</b> wire. The <b>screws</b> and outlet boxes were either connected to the neutral, or connected to nothing. Only in rare jurisdictions where non-metallic cable was prohibited and armored cable required (and still in good condition), do cheater plugs work as intended. In 1971, the US National Electrical Code (NEC) required grounded receptacles in all locations of the home (effective January 1, 1974).|$|R
5000|$|Semko 17 were 3/4-pin 3-phase connectors, with (4-pin) {{or without}} (3-pin) a neutral connector. Earth were {{provided}} via the shield. The connectors {{were available in}} different sizes, 16 A with rounded corners; 25 A and 63 A were rectangular. These connectors were used mainly in industrial and agricultural installations. Manufacturing and selling of Semko-17 connectors with metal shells was prohibited in 1989. A few years later manufacturing and selling of all Semko-17 connectors were prohibited. Existing connectors may be used but not by any employee (prohibited by [...] "Arbetsmiljöverket"). The reason for the prohibition is that Semko-17 had several safety issues. The ground connection can become oxidized and when the shells are made of metal any ground fault goes right through {{the hands of a}} person connecting/disconnecting a male and a female cable connector (unless the person wears insulating gloves). Incorrect use of the ground connector as a neutral was not uncommon. Perhaps the worst issue is that in some connectors the <b>ground</b> <b>screw</b> could rust so severely that the ground wire comes loose and in the worst case make contact with a line (phase) wire nearby.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{project is}} an {{assembly}} of two Polyester/PVC-pneumatic structures {{located at the}} east coast of Lake Ontario in Toronto/Canada. High wind loads due to the exposed location were expected. The larger of the two structures is 15 m high and 60 m long. The pneumatic nature of the design was key for winning the public competition, because it allowed erection of a spatial enclosure of this size only within the given timeframe of one week prior {{to the beginning of the}} Pan American Games. The build-up of the pneumatic system in an alteration of 1. 4 m diameter (in average) arch shaped tubes and patches of repetitive pneumatic cushions. A form finding exercise for gravity loads (catenary shape) and wind loads (pneumatic form finding) was combined to optimize the structure's performance towards wind and gravity loads. Physical tube tests were performed by the manufacturer (Tectoniks) and compared by TT with pneumatic EASYTM models. Following that, calculations were performed to normalize the stiffness of FEM-Elements in SOFISTIKTM with the measured tubes and afterwards globally analyze the geometry to determine deflections (important for the operation of the pavilion), stresses and global reactions. ∼ 60 <b>ground</b> <b>screws</b> were used to anchor both structures to the ground...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Limited {{restoration}} of function {{is known to}} occur spontaneously after an ischemic injury to the primary motor cortex. Evidence suggests that Pre-Motor Areas (PMAs) may "take over" control of the disrupted functions. However, {{little is known about}} functional reorganizations in PMAs. Forelimb movements in mice can be driven by two cortical regions, Caudal and Rostral Forelimb Areas (CFA and RFA), generally accepted as primary motor and premotor cortex, respectively. Here, we examined longitudinal changes in functional coupling between the two RFAs following unilateral photothrombotic stroke in CFA (mm from Bregma: + 0. 5 anterior, + 1. 25 lateral). Methods: Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the RFAs of both hemispheres in freely moving injured and naïve mice. Neural signals were acquired at 9, 16 and 23 days after surgery (sub-acute period in stroke animals) through one bipolar electrode per hemisphere placed in the center of RFA, with a <b>ground</b> <b>screw</b> over the occipital bone. LFPs were preprocessed through an efficient method of artifact removal and analysed through: spectral, cross-correlation, mutual information and Granger causality analysis. Results: Spectral analysis demonstrated an early decrease (day 9) in the alpha band power in both the RFAs. In the late sub-acute period (days 16 and 23), inter-hemispheric functional coupling was reduced in ischemic animals, as shown by a decrease in the cross-correlation and mutual information measures. Within the gamma and delta bands, correlation measures were already reduced at day 9. Granger analysis, used as a measure of the symmetry of the inter-hemispheric causal connectivity, showed a less balanced activity in the two RFAs after stroke, with more frequent oscillations of hemispheric dominance. Conclusions: These results indicate robust electrophysiological changes in PMAs after stroke. Specifically, we found alterations in transcallosal connectivity, with reduced inter-hemispheric functional coupling and a fluctuating dominance pattern. These reorganizations may underlie vicariation of lost functions following stroke...|$|R

5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a bootleg {{ground is}} an electrical ground that is wired from the neutral {{side of a}} receptacle or light fixture in an older 2-wire home. This essentially connects the neutral side of the receptacle to the casing of an appliance or lamp. It can be a hazard because the neutral wire is a current-carrying conductor, which means the casing can become energized. In addition, a fault condition to a bootleg ground will not trip a GFCI breaker or a receptacle that is wired from the load side of a GFCI receptacle. Bootleg grounding is illegal and against code in many places. A safer alternative Sec. 406.4(D)(2)(b) if a grounding connection is not practicable (where a local electrical code allows it) is to install a GFCI and leave the <b>grounding</b> terminal <b>screw</b> unconnected, then place a label that says [...] "No Equipment Ground" [...] on the GFCI and a marking that states “GFCI Protected” and “No Equipment Ground” on all downstream receptacles.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{resistivity}} {{and volume}} resistivity data show all the tested non-metallic materials of the Ares I FTS antenna assembly to be insulative. The external materials (White foam, phenolic) {{should be able}} to develop a large surface charge density upon tribocharging with ice crystal impingement. Dielectric breakdown tests on the FTS antenna housing materials show that each of the insulative materials are very resistive to electrical breakdown. The thicknesses of these materials in a nominal housing should protect the antenna from direct breakdown from external triboelectric charging potentials. Per data from the Air Force study, a maximum external electric potential in the range of 100 kV can be developed on surfaces tribocharged by ice crystal impingement. Testing showed that under operational pressure ranges, this level of exterior voltage can result in a potential of about 6 kV induced on the electrically floating interior antenna vanes. Testing the vanes up to this voltage level showed that electrostatic discharges can occur between the electrically floating vanes and the center, <b>grounded</b> <b>screw</b> heads. Repeated tests with multiple invisible and visible discharges caused only superficial physical damage to the vanes. Fourier analysis of the discharge signals showed that the frequency range of credible discharges would not interfere with the nominal operation of the FTS antenna. However, due to the limited scope, short timetable, and limited funding of this study, a direct measurement of the triboelectric charge that could be generated on the Ares I antenna housing when the rocket traverses an ice cloud at supersonic speeds was not performed. Instead, data for the limited Air Force study [3] was used as input for our experiments. The Air Force data used was not collected with a sensor located to provide us with the best approximation at the geometry of the Ares I rocket, namely that of the windshield electrometer, because brush discharges to the metal frame of the windshield periodically depleted any charge accumulated. The configuration of the Ares I antenna assembly does not include any exposed metals in the vicinity and the windshield data could not be used. Since the windshield sensor data was unusable, we decided that the Patch 2 location would provide us with a rough approximation to the Ares I antenna configuration and would give us an indication of the possible charging levels that would develop. This was the data that we used in this study. Whether these charging levels would be of the same order of magnitude as the actual charges developed by the Ares I traversing a cloud with ice particles is at this point unknown. An actual experimental test, requiring the acquisition of additional instrumentation, is strongly advised before a final recommendation can be formulated regarding the safe levels of electrostatic charging on the antenna housing. Thus {{the results of this study}} should be considered to be preliminary...|$|R
