2500|$|<b>Double</b> <b>acting</b> ships {{carrying}} {{liquid cargo}} are generally referred as <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> tankers. In the early 1990s Kværner Masa-Yards Arctic Technology Centre (MARC) developed the concept for oil transportation between the Russian Arctic and Europe {{and the first}} <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> tanker, Finnish crude oil tanker Tempera, was delivered in 2002. The <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> ship concept was patented by MARC and today the abbreviation [...] "DAS" [...] is a registered trademark of Aker Arctic Technology Inc.|$|R

2500|$|A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> {{engine is}} an engine where steam {{is applied to}} {{both sides of the}} piston. Earlier steam engines applied steam in only one direction, {{allowing}} momentum or gravity to return the piston to its starting place, but a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> engine uses steam to force the piston in both directions, thus increasing rotational speed and power. Like the term [...] "simple engine", the term [...] "double acting" [...] is less frequently encountered in the literature since almost all marine engines were of the <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> type.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of the steam engine, a {{crosshead}} is essential if the engine is to be <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> - steam is applied to both sides of the piston, which requires a seal around the piston rod. An exception is the oscillating cylinder steam engine which can be <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> and yet has no crosshead.|$|R

50|$|Typical {{applications}} for <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinders include the packer-ejector cylinders in garbage trucks and transfer trailers, horizontal compactors, telescopic excavator shovels, and roll-on/roll-off trucks. In {{all of these}} applications, the cylinder operates near horizontally and thus gravity is not available to retract the actuator. A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> design is therefore required to both push and pull the telescoping mechanism.|$|R

50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> {{cylinder}} {{is extended}} and retracted using {{hydraulic or pneumatic}} pressure in both directions. <b>Double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinders are thus much more complex in design than the single acting type. This additional complexity {{is due to the}} requirement of adding retracting piston faces to all of the cylinder stages and the difficulty in supplying pressurized fluid to the retraction pistons of the intermediate stages.|$|R
50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke. The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> or single acting. In single acting cylinder work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the cylinder. In <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes. Directional control valves required for the easy operation of <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Another major type {{of smart}} fluid are electrorheological or ER fluids, whose {{resistance}} to flow can be quickly and dramatically altered by an applied electric field (note, the yield stress point is altered rather than the viscosity). Besides fast <b>acting</b> <b>clutches,</b> brakes, shock absorbers and hydraulic valves, other, more esoteric, applications such as bulletproof vests have been proposed for these fluids.|$|R
50|$|This {{additional}} complexity makes <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinders very expensive. They {{are usually}} custom designed for each application.|$|R
2500|$|The Franchot {{engine is}} a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> engine invented by [...] {{in the nineteenth}} century. A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> engine {{is one in which}} both sides of the piston are acted upon by the {{pressure}} of the working fluid. One of the simplest forms of a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> machine, the Franchot engine consists of two pistons and two cylinders and acts like two separate alpha machines. In the Franchot engine, each piston acts in two gas phases, which makes more efficient use of the mechanical components than a single acting alpha machine. However, a disadvantage of this machine is that one connecting rod must have a sliding seal at the hot side of the engine, which is difficult when dealing with high pressures and temperatures.|$|R

However, since the announcement, the design has progressed from an Azipod-equipped <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> ship to a more traditional shaft-driven version.|$|R

25|$|After {{almost a}} decade of {{successful}} operation without icebreaker assistance Tempera and Mastera remain the only <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> tankers operating in the Baltic Sea. While other <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> ships have {{been built in the}} recent years, the tankers operated by Neste Shipping are also the only ones equipped with a bulbous bow designed primarily with open water performance in mind — the tankers and container ships built for the Russian Arctic have a more traditional icebreaking bow due to the more severe ice conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{merits of}} the mechanical configurations tried out so far in Stirling prime movers is examined based on isothermal analysis taking into account dead volume. Single and <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> cases are considered. It is concluded that the modified Rhombic configuration proposed in the first part, is superior to the conventional Rhombic and Slider crank configurations, in single and <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> modes. Further investigations on frictional losses and transient effects are necessary in making a final choice of the drive configuration for implementing the Stirling cycle...|$|R
40|$|The study {{described}} in this paper was performed to analyze the pumping characteristics of a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> valve-less pump. This valve-less pump uses the fluidic diode instead of usual mechanical movable valve to rectify the flow. The author designed and produced a test machine of the <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> valve-less pump driven by servo motor. As {{the results of the}} transport examination, the maximal flow rate of the test valve-less pump was 90 ml/min and the lift head was 450 mm in drive cycle number 109 cycle/min. The influence of driving cycle number on pump performance was also clarified, and it was appeared that the optimum cycle number was in existent. In addition, the author developed the performance design method of the <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> valve-less pump. The experimental performance values agreed with the design values. So, the validity of the performance design method was able to be confirmed...|$|R

50|$|In 1900 Ernst Körting filed patents for a novel {{design of}} gas engine. This engine {{had a single}} water cooled piston that was <b>double</b> <b>acting,</b> i.e. the {{cylinder}} had combustion chambers at either end. As the engine was a 2-stroke this gave it continuous power strokes, much as a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> steam engine. The lack of continuous power strokes in internal combustion engines was perceived by those used to steam as having the potential for mechanical problems due to the intermittent power strokes. The Körting design was quite successful {{in a range of}} applications particularly large installations powered by blast furnace gas.|$|R

5000|$|Although Körting {{were known}} for their unusual <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> two-stroke, they made a range of more {{conventional}} engines over a long period. The 1909 Gross-Basenach experimental M III airship was equipped with two Körting V8 engines.|$|R
50|$|Telescopic {{cylinders}} {{can usually}} be classified into two basic designs: single <b>acting</b> and <b>double</b> <b>acting.</b> A number of other special designs also exist including a hybrid single/double acting design, and a constant speed, constant thrust design.|$|R
50|$|To {{accomplish}} the <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> feature, additional hydraulic seals {{are added to}} internally seal off the individual stages. In addition, internal air or oil passageways are machined so that as each stage completes retracting, a passage is open to supply the next stage with pressurized fluid to retract. Thus a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic actuator usually retracts starting from the smallest diameter stage to finish with the largest stage retracting lastly. Because the seals used to accomplish this must pass over these internally machined fluid transfer holes, the seals are usually made from hard materials to resist wear and abrasion. They are often iron rings or glass reinforced nylon seals.|$|R
