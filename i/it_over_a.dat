5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually stay there for six months; occasionally, they may even stay longer or return to the water in autumn. Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. When they have gained the female's interest, they guide <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} house that had been set up in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of the lamps, strung <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all they had done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when Voltaire wrote Candide, but {{scholars}} estimate {{that it was}} primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire {{is believed to have}} written a portion of it while at his house in Ferney and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate at Schwetzingen, for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote Candide in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work La Vie intime de Voltaire aux Délices et à Ferney by Lucien Perey (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras. The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise Candide, but worked on <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> significant period of time, possibly even a whole year. Candide is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth might suggest.|$|E
5|$|Rita {{takes her}} {{children}} Astor (Christina Robinson) and Cody (Preston Bailey) to see Paul (Mark Pellegrino) in prison. He {{insists that he}} was framed by Dexter—that Dexter dragged him out of Rita's house before drugging him and tipping off the police—and that if she could find his missing shoe it would prove his innocence. Rita tells him {{that there is no}} shoe, despite having found <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> month ago. She later admits that she found the shoe, but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved. That night, she receives a call from Paul's prison and learns that he was killed in an inmate altercation.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler radar station in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall {{over the course of}} a day led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the study included the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable.|$|E

5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E

25|$|Prevention is {{by early}} {{diagnosis}} of the disease followed by keeping the person from putting the wound in drinking water to decrease spread of the parasite. Other efforts include improving access to clean water and otherwise filtering water {{if it is not}} clean. Filtering through a cloth is often enough.

The worm may be slowly removed over a few weeks by rolling <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> stick. The ulcers formed by the emerging worm may get infected by bacteria.
