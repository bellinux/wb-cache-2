25|$|The {{building}} was designed {{with a clean}} modern profile, and features covered walkways which border the central court and give access to {{all parts of the}} Institute. This circulation feature connects the blocks of the sprawling single-storey building. The buildings are all made of brick and reinforced concrete with an exterior finishing of plaster and brick. The roof over the vestibule and the library is made of a special <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> called thermoflux. Protruding shades or eyebrows shade the glass block windows.|$|E
25|$|However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming {{at the bottom of the}} sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.|$|E

25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential is too great. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} exterior {{glass facade}} system, all metal panels for the adjacent buildings and all accessory metal cladding was custom designed, detailed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong to Architectural Wall Systems, the Des Moines, Iowa based glazing contractor who installed the building envelope. In total {{there are approximately}} 13,000 m² (139,932 square feet) of double <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> and 5,000 m² (53,820 square feet) painted aluminum curtain wall panels. In addition there are roughly 200 tons of system profiles and accessories. All of the 2,404 individual glass units on the main building were produced sequentially and completely assembled prior to shipping. The 5,000,000lbs of rebar used in construction was detailed, farbricated and supplied by The Carter-Waters Corporation of Kansas City.

Properly designed triple-glazed IGUs with low emissivity coatings on surfaces #2 and #4 and filled with argon gas in the cavities result in IG units with R-values as high as R-5.

50|$|By far {{the most}} common glazing type, glass can be of an almost {{infinite}} combination of color, thickness, and opacity.For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4 inch (6 mm) monolithic and 1 inch (25 mm) <b>insulating</b> <b>glass.</b> Presently, 1/4 inch glass is typically used only in spandrel areas, while <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> {{is used for the}} rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> as well). The 1 inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2 inch (12 mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some inert gases, such as argon or krypton may be used to offer better thermal transmittance values. In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8 inch (3 mm) monolithic and 5/8 inch (16 mm) <b>insulating</b> <b>glass.</b> Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, relative humidity, or sound transmission requirements, such as laboratory areas or recording studios.|$|R

40|$|The façade {{significantly}} {{influences the}} energy {{efficiency of the}} building. However, in addition to high insulating properties, modern architecture demands a high transparency for natural illumination and the compliance with inner comfort criteria in the building.

The highest transparency can be achieved with point-fitted glass units. Though, insufficient knowledge is present to use point fittings for insulation glass units, which are required to comply with the demand for energy-efficiency.
