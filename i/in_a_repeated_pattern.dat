40|$|Abstractα-Helical coiled coils (CCs) are {{ubiquitous}} tertiary structural domains {{that are}} often found in mechanoproteins. CCs have mechanical rigidity and are often involved in force transmission between protein domains. Although crystal structures of CCs are available, information about their conformational flexibility is limited. The role of hydrophobic interactions in determining the CC conformation is not clear. In this work we examined the mechanical responses of typical CCs and constructed a coarse-grained mechanical model to describe the conformation of the protein. The model treats α-helices as elastic rods. Hydrophobic bonds arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>pattern</b> determine the CC structure. The model is compared with molecular-dynamics simulations of CCs under force. We also estimate the effective bending and twisting persistence length of the CC. The model allows us to examine unconventional responses of the CC, including significant conformational amplification upon binding of a small molecule. We find that the CC does not behave as a simple elastic rod and shows complex nonlinear responses. These results are significant for understanding the role of CC structures in chemoreceptors, motor proteins, and mechanotransduction in general...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} fermions in one-dimensional superlattices (SL's), modeled by site-dependent Hubbard-U couplings arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>pattern</b> of repulsive (i. e., U> 0) {{and free}} (U= 0) sites. Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) diagonalization of finite systems {{is used to}} calculate the local moment and the magnetic structure factor in the ground state. We have found four regimes for magnetic behavior: uniform local moments forming a spin-density wave (SDW), `floppy' local moments with short-ranged correlations, local moments on repulsive sites forming long-period SDW's superimposed with short-ranged correlations, and local moments on repulsive sites solely with long-period SDW's; the boundaries between these regimes depend on the range of electronic densities, rho, and on the SL aspect ratio. Above a critical electronic density, rho_{uparrow downarrow}, the SDW period oscillates both with rho and with the spacer thickness. The former oscillation allows one to reproduce all SDW wave vectors within a small range of electronic densities, unlike the homogeneous system. The latter oscillation is related to the exchange oscillation observed in magnetic multilayers. A crossover between regimes of `thin' to `thick' layers has also been observed.

A total of 4969 calls were localized over four continuous weeks during late fall of 2007. The average estimated source level for the localized calls was 190. 9 ± 7. 4 dB peak-to-peak re 1 µPa 2 at 1 m. The majority of the calls in these data were {{in the form of}} a doublet song pattern, with average inter-pulse intervals (IPI) 13 s and 18 s. The tracks were the first to be recorded for singing fin whales transiting alone using passive acoustic monitoring. Acoustic tracking of fin whales provides insight into the ecology and behavior of the species. Estimating call source levels help future predictions of how these whales are impacted by anthropogenic noise. Call source level, along with calling behavior, provide important parameters required for population density estimation. Furthermore, studying fin whale song patterns may aid in distinguishing different subpopulations...|$|E
40|$|In state {{assessment}} {{programs in}} which performance {{has no real}} immediate consequence for the individual examinee, the issue of examinee motivation arises. Some examinees may respond to questions in ways that do not reflect their real knowledge of the test domain. In this-study, a new approach was developed to identify students who have responded to questions {{in a way that}} does not reflect their knowledge adequately. The new method was designed to detect examinees that responded according to some repeating pattern. The new method was then compared to two indices previously developed by Drasgow, Levine, and Williams (1985) using data from New Hampshire's statewide mathematics assessment for 16, 630, 16, 387, and 14, 445 students from grades 3, 6, and 10 respectively. These indices were found to be distributed in a manner that was more or less expected, something that suggests that the indices may be useful in detecting examinees that are responding in a way not in accord with the underlying test model. However, results suggest that these indices will only occasionally detect responding according to a repeating pattern.

40|$|Access to {{consumer}} credit {{is influenced by}} many factors, such as amount and security of the consumer’s income, and credit card company and financial institution practices. Access is also driven by social, cultural and cognitive factors, including consumer understanding {{of the cost of}} credit; perceptions regarding ability to repay; cognitive influences regarding immediate consumption and delayed payment; understanding of the benefits and risks of debt to economic security; and the conflicts of interest inherent in the business of lending. Overall, bank and credit union credit has tightened since the global financial crisis. However, the study found that for many Canadians, the issue is less whether there is access to credit, but rather, “access to credit at what high cost and on what terms and conditions”. Much of the reported need for credit {{in the past two years}} has been the need to bridge income loss from job loss, reduced hours of employment and small business failures. Many individuals that could not access personal loans from their bank or credit union turned to alternate, more expensive, forms of credit, such as merchandise finance company loans, increasing credit card debt, skipping monthly payments on loans, and payday loans. Consolidation loans have been increasingly viewed as a debt management strategy, yet there are problems associated with consolidation. One issue identified was the growth in home equity lines of credit, originally intended to bridge financing for emergencies or a significant purchase, but now being used more akin to account withdrawing, portending future issues in respect to debt load and longer term economic security. Consumers face the direct costs of high interest rate charges and loan and broker fees. There is evidence to suggest that costs increase when consumer borrowers do not understand how interest rates and terms work, and thus consumer debtors may be paying considerably more for their credit than they need to. The lack of financial literacy is a major concern in that many consumer debtors do not fully appreciate the costs of carrying expensive credit, identified as particularly an issue among younger adults and recent immigrants to Canada. Yet to date, financial literacy training does not align with consumer debtors’ particular needs for financing based on income and a range of other factors. There are also significant indirect costs to the consumer of access only to expensive credit, such as foregone basic necessities because of excessive debt load, health outcomes and costs associated with the stress of over-indebtedness, and the costs to society, borne by creditors or the general tax base, when consumers default on loans or file for insolvency or bankruptcy. Analysis of the causes of insolvency for a cohort of 4, 000 consumer insolvency cases from 2008 to 2010 indicates that “access to credit” forms an extremely small percentage of declared reasons for filing bankruptcy or proposals under the BIA. Related causes are much higher. For bankruptcies, insufficient income accounted for 30. 5 % of insolvency, unemployment for 18. 8 %, and over-indebtedness for 12. 4 %. For proposals, insufficient income accounted for 40. 7 % of insolvency, unemployment for 15. 8 %, and over-indebtedness for 13. 8 %. Seeking relief under Canadian insolvency law is reported by bankrupts as less associated with access to credit and more an outcome of consumer debtors’ inability to meet the payment demands of expensive credit they previously accessed. Credit card debt is a significant issue for consumer debtors. The average credit card debt was $ 21, 620 and the median debt was $ 13, 979. The data show that 90 % of all debtors filing for insolvency relief had credit card debt. Equally, however, mortgage debt, personal loans and finance company debt are significant factors in filing, evidence of credit behaviour that catches consumer debtors <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>pattern</b> of refinancing expensive debt and re-incurring it, which can expedite financial distress. Considerably more research and policy development is required to make consumer access to credit more understandable, affordable and accessible on a fair and reasonable basis. While financial literacy is an important goal, there is also an urgent need for the federal government to complement its current work in financial literacy with a much more comprehensive program regarding consumer credit...|$|E
