Colonel Carrington's ideal of an exclusive semi-feudal Utopia is very pretty, but I fear it will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>Now</b> I'm coming to the point. You and Jasper have shown us the way to {{make something out of}} buying young Western stock; but we're going one better. Breeding beef is only one item. What about the dairy? We couldn't well drink up all the milk, even if we liked it; and we have definitely decided on a Carrington creamery, with a Winnipeg agency for our cheese and butter." ...|$|E

[...] "I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now....</b> But I've shown my hand to you. Your {{happiness}} is more to me than anythin' else in this world. You love that boy. He loves you. An' I never met a finer lad! Wal, here's the point. He need be no slacker to stay home. He can do more good here. Then outside of bein' a wheat man for his army an' his country he can be one for me. I'm growin' old, my lass!... Here's the biggest ranch in Washington to look after, an' I want Kurt Dorn to look after it.... Now, Lenore, do we understand each other?" ...|$|E

"I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> and {{see about}} putting away the milk, and I dare say you're not {{sorry to be}} rid of me," [...] she said, with a demureness I had not {{credited}} her with, [...] "but if you come to the verandah in half an hour I'll bring you out a glass of new milk and some pound cake I made today by a recipe that's been in the family for one hundred years, and I hope it will choke you for all the snubs you've been giving me." [...] She walked away after this amiable wish, and I stood by the pond till the salmon tints faded from its waters and stars began to mirror themselves brokenly in its ripples. The mellow air was full of sweet, mingled eventide sounds as I walked back to the house. Aunt Lucy was knitting on the verandah. Gussie brought out cake and milk and chatted to us while we ate, in an inconsequent girlish way, or fed bits of cake to a green-eyed goblin in the likeness of a black cat.|$|E

60|$|Those {{men began}} {{to light the}} cigars. Rev. Dr. Parker was {{the first man to}} light. He took three or four heroic whiffs--then gave it up. He got up with the remark that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bedside of a sick parishioner. He started out. Rev. Dr. Burton was the next man. He took only one whiff, and {{followed}} Parker. He furnished a pretext, and you could see by {{the sound of his voice}} that he didn't think much of the pretext, and was vexed with Parker for getting in ahead with a fictitious ailing client. Rev. Mr. Twichell followed, and said he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> because he must take the midnight train for Boston. Boston was the first place that occurred to him, I suppose.|$|R

2500|$|Sigismund sent Oswald back to Tyrol {{to prepare}} the county for an {{expected}} Hussite invasion of the Empire and invited the Hussites to the Council of Basel to negotiate. Sigismund himself fled to Milan and later to Piacenza under the pretext that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> Rome to be crowned emperor. During this time Oswald commissioned the cloister Neustift to create a second manuscript collection of his songs. Sigismund called him {{to join him in}} Piacenza and Oswald obliged. The unpleasantness of his visit inspired him to write the complaint-song [...] "Wer die ougen vil verschüren", which he set to a French melody. In May of the same year, Oswald was sent by Sigismund to Basel. After over a year of negotiations, Sigismund was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 31 May 1433 by Pope Eugenius IV, with Oswald probably in attendance.|$|R

And, at this point, permit me to warn you that, where the ground, where Dryasdust and the Destinies, yield anything humanly illustrative of Friedrich and his Work, one will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> linger, and carefully gather it, even as here. Large tracts occur, bestrewn with mere pedantisms, diplomatic cobwebberies, learned marine-stores, and inhuman matter, over which we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> skip empty-handed: this also was among the sad conditions of our Enterprise, that it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> too slow and again too fast; not in proportion to natural importance of objects, but to several inferior considerations withal.
