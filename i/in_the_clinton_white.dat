[...] The magazine The American Spectator, {{which had}} a well-established animus towards the First Couple, focused on the Travelgate story as one of many [...] Clinton-related matters it thought scandalous, describing it as [...] "a story about influence-peddling and sleazy deal-making... <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> House".

Sessions pointed out that Kagan [...] "has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago".|$|E
