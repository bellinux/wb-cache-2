[...] A tour lasted from 10:10 am – 10:10 pm for {{those who wanted to}} see it to grab a ticket at the box office. The tour {{consisted}} of the College Basketball Experience, two open concession stands: [...] "Taco Taco" [...] and [...] "Oak Street Pizza"; a free drink from UMB Bank and other free items: a UMB Bank cup, a UMB Bank frisbee, and a UMB Bank <b>ice</b> <b>scraper.</b> UMB Bank is the only ATM in the new arena because it is a Sprint Center Founding Partner along with Farmland, The University of Kansas Hospital, QuikTrip, and Olevia. There are other Sprint Center Founding Partners: H Block, Toyota, American Century Investments, YRC Worldwide, and Time Warner Cable of Kansas City.|$|E
5000|$|Selected editions also {{included}} a second CD, a DVD, a calendar or gimmicks like an <b>ice</b> <b>scraper.</b> The following sections appear in Zillo Music: ...|$|E
50|$|The Rapid {{introduced}} {{some new}} ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. double sided mat in the boot (rubber/textile), warning vest holder under driver's seat, removable waste bin in door panelling and <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> on {{the fuel tank}} flap.|$|E
40|$|Harvesting quality ice {{depended}} on selecting the perfect field. Great care {{was taken to}} locate areas of smooth, solid ice containing little snow or slush. Men used wooden <b>ice</b> <b>scrapers</b> pulled by teams to remove snow before marking the ice. Winter storms often forced ice harvesters to scrape the ice field {{as many as six}} to eight times...|$|R
50|$|TeamsOver the years, {{there have}} been many top teams that have {{travelled}} {{from all over the world}} to participate. These teams include:Skylands Kings (two-time champions), Los Angeles Junior Kings,Detroit Belle Tire,South Florida Golden Wolves,Moscow Dynamo,Jokerit Helsinki,German Eagles,Beijing Imperial Guard,Korea Eagles,HC Vitkovice, Budapest Stars, Torino, Italy and Nice, France, and in 2013, the Hong Kong <b>Ice</b> <b>Scrapers</b> participated for the first time.Hundreds of the teams that participate come from local associations, such as:Canterbury Minor Hockey,Cumberland Minor Hockey,Gloucester Centre Minor Hockey,Kanata Minor Hockey,Metcalfe District Minor Hockey,Nepean Minor Hockey, South End Minor Hockey,As well as many others.|$|R
50|$|Ice {{can also}} be an obstacle. For harbors near the poles, being {{ice-free}} is an important advantage. Ideally, all year long. Examples are Murmansk (Russia), Petsamo (Russia, formerly Finland) and Vardø (Norway). Harbors which are not ice-free are opened up using icebreakers.Ice forming on roads is a dangerous winter hazard. Black ice {{is very difficult to}} see, because it lacks the expected frosty surface. Whenever there is freezing rain or snow which occurs at a temperature near the melting point, it is common for ice to build up on the windows of vehicles. Driving safely requires the removal of the <b>ice</b> build-up. <b>Ice</b> <b>scrapers</b> are tools designed to break the ice free and clear the windows, though removing the ice can be a long and laborious process.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{specialized}} hammers {{have other}} names, such as sledgehammer, mallet, and gavel. The term [...] "hammer" [...] {{also applies to}} devices that deliver blows, such as the hammer of a firearm, or the hammer of a piano, or the hammer <b>ice</b> <b>scraper.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bachi {{used for}} {{stringed}} instruments are actually picks. They are very distinct {{in form and}} use from Western-style picks, which are usually smaller {{in order to be}} held between or mounted to fingers. In shape, bachi are similar to an <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> or a putty knife.|$|E
50|$|The Rapid Spaceback {{comes with}} a {{lockable}} fuel cap included in the central locking system. This means {{there is no need}} to unlock the fuel cap with car keys, the <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> is protected from theft, and can be removed only after the car has been unlocked. This change was announced to arrive to the Rapid liftback, too.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The main {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to show the advanced technology for production of the electrode for EDM that has a relatively complex geometry. Five axes CNC machining centre is used for production of an example <b>ice</b> <b>scrapers</b> since application of other type of machine requires a lot of auxiliary time and resources. Design/methodology/approach: Advanced manufacturing technology involves the application of various software tools and technologies, among them the tools and technology to automate the design, analysis, testing and manufacturing occupy a key position. Findings: The main outcomes are decrease of production time, better quality of surface and product geometry. Decrease of cutting time refers to decrease of number of used tools, preparation time is lower in comparison with conventional machines. Research limitations/implications: The practical part included the design of electrode in the CAD system, SolidWorks 2010, production of NC program for the operating unit Haidenhain iTNC 530 in CAM system ESPRIT 2010, and finally making the electrode on five axis machine center DMG DMU 40 Monoblock. Originality/value: Presented technology for a five-axis machining centre, ensures a great advantages in the process preparation while reduced set-up time, reduced number of required accessories and devices, reduced number of special tools is needed. This knowledge can support the development and design of technological processes...|$|R
50|$|Hans R. Wuthrich {{is a top}} curling ice {{technician}} from Canada. He {{has been}} making ice for the last 15 years for major events around the world such as the Brier and World Curling Championships. Wuthrich was {{the recipient of the}} 2003 Canadian Curling Association's 'Award of Achievement' for his significant contributions in the development of new pebble heads and <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> technology. He lives in Gimli, Manitoba.|$|E
50|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> is a {{handheld}} tool for removing frost, ice, and snow from windows, usually on automobiles. Basic scrapers have a plastic blade and handle, though some have blades {{made out of}} metal. More complex models often include brushes to help remove collected snow, or squeegees to remove water if the ambient temperature is near the melting point. Alternatively, the handle can be inside a glove-like enclosure {{to help keep the}} user's hands warm and dry when using the scraper.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a problem}} with ice {{sticking}} to the cables in the winter, which can fall onto cars. The bridge has to be closed a few times per year for this reason. The alternative road is 12.8 km longer.Civil engineers have tested PETD (a way to use a burst of electricity to remove ice caked on walls or windows. For surfaces coated with a special film, the jolt gets rid of ice in less than a second, far less time than it takes to hack at it with an <b>ice</b> <b>scraper).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Octavia {{features}} numerous so-called ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. an <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> {{inside the}} fuel filler flap, a rubbish bin {{inside the door}} panel, and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in boot. A tilting/sliding panoramic sunroof is available as an option - single-piece for the Octavia hatchback and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen and Columbus car radios are protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia system’s own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for the mobile phone with planar antenna {{in the bottom of}} the compartment, which permits a so-called inductive exterior antenna connection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{blade of}} an <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> is usually flat {{if it is}} made out of metal, though some {{varieties}} include ridges that can be helpful if it is necessary to break up a sheet of ice (such as what collects in freezing rain). Plastic blades tend to have a more complex shape with several thick [...] "fingers" [...] linked together. This form helps the blade to flex, since most modern car windows have a slight curvature. The [...] "fingers" [...] also often have ridges on top, so the scraper can be flipped over to break up thick ice. More complex designs exists to improve ice clearance on curved glass on automobiles.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the design}} and size of parking discs has been {{standardized}} there are often free giveaways with advertisements on the rear. Most parking discs are made of heavy paper, {{but there is a}} common variant made of plastic with sharp edges that can also be used as an <b>ice</b> <b>scraper.</b> An illegal variation involves motorized clock discs that move the clock face in a timely manner. In general, clock discs must be set with the arrow pointing to a mark and not any of the white space between, or else it would be invalid and could result in a traffic ticket. As disc parking is common in Europe, virtually all cars there have some kind of parking disc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Existing {{models for}} {{developing}} modular product families {{based on a}} common platform are either too engi-neering oriented or too marketing centric. In this paper, we propose an intermediate modeling ground that bridges this gap by simultaneously considering essential concepts from engineering and marketing to construct an alternative model for platform-based product families. In this model, each vari-ant (in the platform-based product family) contributes a per-centage to overall market coverage inside a target market segment. The {{extent to which a}} specific variant contributes to market coverage is linked to its degree of distinctiveness. On the other hand the cost of development of all variants (that constitute the product family) is also dependent on the degree of commonality between these variants. The objective of the model is to maximize market coverage subject to an available development budget. Based on a conceptual design of the product family, the proposed model suggests the opti-mal initial investment in the platform, the commonality level between variants, and the number of variants to be produced in order to maximize market coverage using both analytical and simulation techniques. An application example using an <b>ice</b> <b>scraper</b> product family is included to demonstrate the proposed model...|$|E
