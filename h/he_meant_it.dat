500|$|Joshua Alston of Newsweek {{criticized the}} episode and the {{introduction}} of the Charles character. Although Alston said Elba's acting was fine, he said the character [...] "sucked the funny out of every scene he was in" [...] and created an awkwardness inappropriate for the show. During the week following the episode's original broadcast, many fans theorized on the Internet that Michael said [...] "I acquit" [...] rather than [...] "I quit", and that Michael's supposed resignation was something of a prank. Jenna Fischer, who plays Pam on The Office, addressed this issue on her MySpace blog, saying, [...] "He said 'I quit'. [...] And <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b> [...] You will see how it all plays out this week on the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Early {{in series}} ten, Joseph's brother's {{condition}} deteriorates {{and he is}} admitted to Holby City Hospital in need of an operation. [...] Faye supports Joseph, and the two kiss. Joseph's hopes are raised when his brother opens his eyes, and he considers expensive neurology treatment in America to try and rouse Harry from his coma. Shortly thereafter, however, Harry's condition worsens again, and Joseph and his mother allow Harry to die. Following his brother's death, Joseph returns to work to find Jac on trial for Sam's old position. This reignites their feud, and Joseph is unable to block Jac from gaining the position. His relationship with Faye develops slowly, however Joseph's suspicions are raised when she lies to him about her whereabouts on several occasions, leading to the eventual discovery that the police suspect her {{of the murder of}} her second husband, Donald. An exhumation reveals that Donald did not die of cancer, as Faye insisted, but of arsenic poisoning. Joseph remains suspicious, but supports Faye as their relationship continues to develop. When Faye has a pregnancy scare, he proposes to her, and insists that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> even after the discovery she is not actually pregnant. Joseph is devastated when Faye appears to have stolen £5,000 from him and left the country, but discovers she is in fact in trouble in South Africa. After flying out with colleague Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow), Faye reveals she has a ten-year-old son, Archie, who lives in a care home because of a genetic disease. Joseph saves Archie's life in a risky operation, and he and Faye return from South Africa engaged once more, much to Jac's chagrin.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The comedy of the situation derives from Jenks' own attempts to manufacture some free time to enjoy himself, only to regret the action because of the resultant circumstances. Advertising for the film confirms this by stating, [...] "Jenk's day off was a day of woe instead of the day of joy <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> to be. It taught him to never, never leave his wife's side - not even for a day!" [...] Jenks' swimming in a secluded spot, inferring swimming in the nude through {{the lack of a}} swimming suit, sets the stage for the comedy when his clothes are swapped for those of the cross-dressed convict. With no other option, Jenks dons the clothes and responds to the call for help. The lady identifies Jenks as the convict, wearing her clothes, and the film concludes with a chase that leads to the arrest and humiliation of Jenks. This comedy predates the well-known cross-dressing antics of Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin by a few years. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast is uncredited because their identities are unknown. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. Known and more prominent members of the cast to appear in productions include the leading ladies, Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming, and the leading man was Frank H. Crane.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{interview}} Heidegger defended as double-speak his 1935 lecture describing the [...] "inner truth and greatness of this movement." [...] He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by [...] "movement" [...] he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the NSDAP. Rather, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> as he expressed {{it in the}} parenthetical clarification later added to Introduction to Metaphysics (1953), namely, [...] "the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Luke and Noah meet at WOAK, a local {{television}} station in Oakdale, {{where they are}} working as interns, but their relationship is complex from the beginning. Luke's first crush for Kevin Davis ended badly when he [...] "came out" [...] to Kevin and was fiercely rejected, and Noah is involved with co-worker Maddie Coleman. In fact, Noah thinks jealously that Luke is pursuing his girlfriend until Luke reveals first his sexual orientation and then his attraction to Noah. After this, Noah struggles with his own feelings for Luke. One day, when Luke is helping Noah with his tie, Noah impulsively kisses him; he tries to shrug this off as a joke before finally admitting to himself and Luke that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it.</b> He isn't, however, {{ready to deal with}} being gay. Although Luke urges him to be honest with Maddie and to acknowledge his own sexuality, Noah hesitates.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2006, {{while visiting}} Europe, Ma said that {{although}} he and the KMT favor eventual reunification, the KMT respects the opinions of Taiwanese people and independence is a choice {{for the people of}} Taiwan. This caused widespread criticism within the party and from the PRC. In a December 2005 Newsweek International interview, when asked about unification, Ma stated that [...] "for our party, the eventual goal is reunification, but we don't have a timetable", explaining that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> was a choice for Taiwan, but also a choice for the Chinese KMT. Perhaps to deflect heavy criticism from the Pan-Green Coalition, the KMT later made an advertisement in the Liberty Times recognizing that independence is an option for the Taiwanese people. Wang Jin-pyng praised Ma for the policy shift, since Wang himself made a similar statement during the 2004 election, but James Soong said he was [...] "shocked" [...] and Lien Chan said he was never consulted. This event actually won some welcome voices from Southern Taiwan, where voters customarily favor the Pan-Green Coalition. One top KMT official said [...] "we might as well let the measles out now so that we will be immune to it when election year comes close, because reunification or independence can be a hot topic by then." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, the big-bang {{theory has}} been the {{prevailing}} cosmological model for the universe. It was envisioned by a Roman Catholic priest, Monsignor Georges Lemaître in the 1930s. Lemaître suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that at some finite {{time in the past}} all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a [...] "primeval atom" [...] where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence. However, in the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist subscribed to a view that the universe is in an eternal steady state. After Lemaître proposed his theory, some scientists complained that its assumption that time had a beginning amounted to a reimportation of religious concepts into physics. When the expression [...] "Big Bang" [...] was coined by Fred Hoyle in 1949, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>it</b> to be slightly pejorative, but the term stuck and gained currency. Lemaître himself concluded that an initial [...] "creation-like" [...] event must have occurred. The Big-Bang is contrary to young-Earth creationism, sensu stricto. But it has been welcomed by other Christian creeds, and it is in line with the Roman Catholic concept of creation. Under the Anthropic principle, by which the properties of the universe is seemingly fine-tuned for our own existence, some Christians see evidence that a divine creator has purposefully designed the universe.|$|E
