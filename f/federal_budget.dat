5|$|Early in his career, Ford {{supported}} {{a constitutional amendment}} against desegregation busing. He also floated a proposal to put the <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling.

During the Ninety-fifth Congress (1977–1979), {{he was chairman of}} the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss <b>Federal</b> <b>budget</b> had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted {{as part of the}} <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).|$|E

5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} <b>federal</b> <b>budget.</b> After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E

Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E

5|$|On {{the right}} wing of the Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, an emphasis on total victory in war and opposition to high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics of some of his more moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the <b>federal</b> <b>budget.</b> After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F.

To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
