2500|$|Numerous other spiders {{have been}} {{associated}} with necrotic bites in medical literature. Other recluse species, such as the <b>desert</b> <b>recluse</b> (found in the deserts of southwestern United States), are reported to have caused necrotic bite wounds, though only rarely. The hobo spider and the yellow sac spider have also been reported to cause necrotic bites. However, the bites from these spiders are not known to produce the severe symptoms that can follow from a recluse spider bite, and the level of danger posed by these has been called into question. So far, no known necrotoxins have been isolated from the venom of any of these spiders, and some arachnologists have disputed the accuracy of spider identifications carried out by bite victims, family members, medical responders, and other non-experts in arachnology. There have been several studies questioning the danger posed by some of these spiders. In these studies, scientists examined case studies of bites in which the spider in question was identified by an expert, and found that the incidence of necrotic injury diminished significantly when [...] "questionable" [...] identifications were excluded from the sample set.

5000|$|Loxosceles live {{in areas}} of South America and the {{southern}} United States. There are populations of <b>desert</b> and Arizona <b>recluse</b> in the Western deserts of the United States, but bites are rarely reported from these species. In established areas many spiders may populate the home. Even still the [...] "reclusive" [...] nature of the spider limits true bites. Of note, more bites had been reprted in Florida than recluses ever found in the area.|$|R
