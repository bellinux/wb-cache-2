This route facilitates, for example, more advanced electricity generation and production of biomass based transportation fuels or chemical feedstock. Each unit operation in such a process affects overall efficiency as well as possibilities for process integration. In this paper, the impact of different dryer types in a biomass gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) has been evaluated in terms of efficiency and economic performance. The BIGCC was sized so that the excess heat would replace the current steam production from bark and oil. The {{results show that the}} <b>dryer</b> <b>type</b> can {{have a significant impact on}} economic performance and efficiencies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pros and}} cons of various types of biomass dryers have been {{documented}} in this paper. Using dry biomass significantly reduces the cost of handling, transportation and pyrolysis. The main choices for drying biomass are rotary dryers, flash dryers, stationery bed dryers and fluidised bed dryers. The drying medium can be hot air, hot air mixed with steam, and/or superheated steam. A typical example for wood chip drying using a financial model is described, including the environmental performance. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions have been estimated for drying biomass. From this study, it is evident that increasing temperature will decrease drying time and increase throughput but not necessarily decrease the drying cost. This is due to higher energy use and higher cost of capital inputs such as loading/unloading and heat plant. Thus, low drying temperature can be used if throughput is not a key issue for an operation. The global warming potential of the biomass drying process 9. 2 kg CO 2 -e/t of oven-dry biomass. This assumes that wood waste is used as fuel and drying is on a moving belt dryer. If this dry biomass is used in a power station as fuel for steam boiler, there is a significant reduction potential of CO 2 emission from a typical black coal-fired power plant due to fuel switching. This assumes that trees are planted to produce this biomass sustainably. Environmental impacts of any <b>dryer</b> <b>type</b> should be considered for selection in addition to its traditional techno-economic performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate improvement of drying method of peppermint and pumpkin kernels (hull-less pumpkin seed) with the aim to get as best microbiological quality of products as possible. Small and medium scale producers of medicinal plants in most cases perform it in batch dryers, which offer optimal output rate. Disadvantages of this <b>dryer</b> <b>type</b> are slower through-heating of upper layers, with the resulting increase of microbial count. In this paper, results of investigation of drying characteristics in batch dryer expressed through the changes of count of bacteria and microfungi are presented. The drying regime was applied in three different phases, and different material batch heights. Obtained results show that microbial count has increased in the upper layer during process of peppermint drying, while the temperature was less than 45 °C for a long period. However, during the final drying phase in this layer, the temperature was also over 45 °C, and the final microbial count was almost the same for upper and lower levels. During the treatment of pumpkin kernels in all of cases number of microorganisms indicated that the treated pumpkin grains belonged to the 3 B qualitative group or to the 4 B for phase drying respectively, and to the 4 A for control group according to the Europaean Pharmacopoeia. The results obtained suggest that the treatment of hull-less pumpkin seed with even higher temperatures of drying agents, for example 70 °C or 80 °C, in the first phase should be investigated.

The overall aim of this thesis has been to demonstrate how the {{pulp and paper industry}} can help cut global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase revenues by efficient use of biomass via gasification. In this thesis, the impact of different end products and biomass pretreatment measures connected to integrated gasification processes were evaluated regarding efficiency, GHG emissions and economic performance. The selection of end product from a gasification-based process (methanol, Fischer-Tropsch crude, synthetic natural gas or electricity, in this thesis) was demonstrated to significantly influence the required biomass input, if the sizing constraint was to replace heat production in the bark boiler. The size varied between approximately 200 MWbiomass and 600 MWbiomass. The selection of <b>dryer</b> <b>type</b> was shown to significantly impact the economic performance of a process despite its relatively low capital cost in relation to the total capital cost of 100 to 140 million Euros. With the preconditions in this study, thermal pretreatment (torrefaction or pyrolysis) of biomass may be beneficial with biomass-to-biofuel efficiencies reaching 68 %. Assumptions regarding the electricity production sector influence whether an integrated gasification process is better than a stand-alone unit and whether onsite co-generation of electricity should be prioritised in favour of increased yield of biofuels. Sequestration of separated CO 2 has been shown to improve the climatic performance of a system and increase its competitiveness against, e. g., co-firing biomass in a coal power plant, by increasing the potential from approximately 300 kgCO 2,eq. /MWhbiomass to 700 kgCO 2,eq. /MWhbiomass.

40|$|The {{effect of}} drying corn, rice and wheat seed in two stages was studied, using germinability {{as a measure}} of quality. For the first stage, {{fluidised}} bed dryer (FBD) and spouted bed dryer (SBD) were used to dry seed from 20 - 25 %wb to 18 %wb while in-store dryer (ISO) was used in the second stage for drying from 18 %wb to below 14 %wb. The drying air temperature range of 40 - 80 °C was studied for the first stage while 18 - 30 °C and relative humidity 60 - 70 % were for the second stage. It was found that <b>dryer</b> <b>type,</b> drying temperature, initial moisture content of seeds and drying time had significant effects on the seed germination. From the result, the drying air temperature of 40 °C was safe for corn and rice in FBD while 60 °C was acceptable for wheat. In SBD, the 40 °C was the maximum drying temperature for rice and wheat without quality deterioration. Meanwhile the second stage drying in an ISD under all specified conditions was safe. In this work, the thin-layer drying models were developed. The results showed that the modified Page's model and modified two-compartment model were the best-fitted models with the root mean square (RMS) {{of the differences between the}} predicted moisture ratio and the measured values below 0. 03. Besides, the existing ISD simulation program provided the RMS of 0. 3, 1. 1, and 0. 9 %wb for corn, rice and wheat respectively. The germination models for FBD and SBD were also developed. As a result, the modified Giner's models 1 & 2 were the best-fitted models for FBD with the RMS of the differences between predicted and measured germination percentages of 7. 9, 4. 2 and 3. 4 % for corn, rice and wheat while the modified Giner's models 2 & 3 were for SBD with the RMS of 5. 5 and 6. 1 % for rice and wheat respectively. The comparison between FBD and SBD revealed that FBD had faster drying rate while SBD consumed less energy. Ultimately, the energy cost analysis showed that single-stage drying in a fixed bed dryer using ambient condition consumed less energy than two-stage drying using a FBD and ISD but lower energy cost must be weighed against the faster drying rate, flexibility, portable design, and product uniformity of FBD...|$|E

Peeled shrimps were dried separately using an air-oven dryer and a tunnel solar dryer. The drying profile of shrimp meat was determined in the two drying systems by monitoring moisture loss over the drying period. Changes in color, proximate composition, and rehydration capacity were assessed. The rate of moisture removal during solar drying was faster than the air-oven drying. The development of red color during drying was comparable among the two methods, but solar-dried shrimps appeared darker (L⁎= 47. 4) than the air-oven-dried (L⁎= 49. 0).

40|$|Dairy powders {{are common}} {{ingredients}} used by food manufactures and consumers, with high-protein dairy powders becoming more in demand, {{due to their}} nutritional and functional benefits. The functionality of these powders can be greatly influenced by their surface composition, as alterations at the surface can impede the rehydration of the powders after long-term storage. Therefore, this research investigated the surface characteristics of dairy powders {{and how it is}} influenced by composition, <b>dryer</b> <b>type,</b> degree of agglomeration and the stability of the surface components during storage of the powder, focusing mainly on the protein fraction. This research provides an {{understanding of the nature of}} the particle surface of selected dairy powders (milk protein concentrate, skim milk, whole milk) and what happens at the surface, which may provide a basis for the development of new or improved powders. Surface composition of dairy powders was determined by the main analysis tool used in this investigation, XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Other major experimental techniques used during this research include: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), tensiometers (for surface tension work) and the Malvern Mastersizer (for particle sizing). The optimisation of XPS analysis for the study of dairy powders was evaluated. A change in the relative atomic percentage of the elements (C, O, N) was used (via a matrix formula) to determine the relative amount of protein, fat and lactose on the surface of the powders. The surface composition of dairy powders was partially influenced by the surface active components within the feed concentrate prior to spray drying, as noted in the protein/lactose powder experiments. The casein proteins were generally more surface active than the whey proteins. In another work, the application of cold stage XPS for the analysis of a milk droplets surface was developed and tested. It was thought this method would capture the surface composition of a droplet within seconds of its formation, similar to that of a droplet formed during spray drying. This work indicated that the part of the surface coverage is instantaneous, possibly due to rapid orientation and spreading of the hydrophobic moieties of the protein molecules present at the proximity of the interface. The surface morphology of dairy powders were also examined, where the morphology of the particles can be greatly influenced by the amount of fat, protein and lactose in the feed concentration consequently on the particle surface; particles high in protein had a more collapsed structure than those high in lactose, and particles high in fat were more spherical. The effect of size of the dryer on the surface composition of the powder was also studied. Commercially spray-dried powders were found to be different to those produced on a research scale (i. e. laboratory and pilot plant). The main differences can be attributed to differences in the feed concentration, size of the atomizer, spray dryer settings and complexity (size, number of chambers etc). The viscosity was also found to be one of the limiting factors on surface coverage by protein. Effect of storage condition on the changes to the surface composition was studied using MPC as a model powder. The main analytical methods that were used to analyse the powders include; AFM, XPS, SEM. The AFM scanning probe microscopy indicated that the surface became more hydrophobic, with the formation of a thin crust, however the overall surface coverage of the components remained relatively similar. The solubility of the particles also decreased (by 20 – 65 %) during storage, depending on the storage temperature and relative humidity...|$|E

The innovative tea dryer was designed and fabricated targeting the group of farmers who cultivate bio tea /organic tea in few acres amidst of lot of constraints. Main challenge {{for the production of}} tea at small scale is consistent drying. Since drying is a key factor affecting the quality of the ultimate product of tea, the simulation results of the mathematical model explain the drying performance and how the physical model or the prototype could be scaled. The tea sector has always been a vital component of Sri Lanka’s economy. Sri Lanka as the third biggest tea producing country globally, has a production share of 9 % in the international sphere, and one of the world's leading exporters with a share of around 19 % of the global demand. The total extent of land under tea cultivation has been assessed at approximately 187, 309 hectares. Much of the growth boost in low grown tea production is attributed to the rise of the tea smallholders who are concentrated in the low-country. It is estimated that the smallholders occupy about 65 to 70 % of the tea extent in the country and their contribution to overall production has also now risen to around 65 to 70 %. Since the organic tea has an increasing demand and a good overseas market the tea cultivators of small holders are encouraged to produce organic tea. In the traditional or 'orthodox' procedure, the process used to make loose tea, the leaves must go through a process of Withering, Rolling, Oxidation /fermentation and Drying. Among these processes, withering and fermentation are taken place as a result of environmental conditions except rolling and drying. Rolling could be done manually on a serrated timber plank as the quantity is small. Dholes followed by the above three processes are fed into the innovative dryer for the making of tea. This dryer was completed as two stages with two cylinders having concentric perforated cylinders inside. Two hot air generators are being used to supply the hot air where saw dust is burnt for the supply of thermal energy for the first stage drying and the electricity is used in second stage drying, The cylinders are rotating at the same speed of about 12 rpm, and screw feeder is used for the feeding of material into rotating inner cylinder at a constant rate without the material being clogged at the entrance. Analyzing the direction of material and hot air flow inside the cylinder the dryer {{is said to be the}} type of cross-flow co-current. The two drums and the material feeder are powered by a single motor of ½ hp with a gearing ratio of 1 : 30. As the heat transfer is direct from the heat transfer medium to product the dryer is also called direct or adiabatic dryer. The adiabatic dryer is more closely related to the humidification process than is the indirect one. As per the raw material and other drying parameters, the <b>dryer</b> <b>type</b> for the innovative dryer has been selected as cross flow, co current rotary type considering physical properties of the drying materials. Testing of this innovative dryer under real conditions and its results are further illustrated in the report. Based on the physical and thermodynamic parameters of the design and experimental data, a mathematical model has been developed studying various drying models and simulation methods using experimental figures in the report in details. The mathematical model and simulated results using Matlab show how far the model relate with the actual performance. The accuracy of simulation results of the mathematical model is highly depend upon the accuracy of the experiments carried out at various situations for finding out the dryer constant and the characteristic constants using physical models.

Much of the growth boost in low grown tea production is attributed to the rise of the tea smallholders who are concentrated in the low-country. It is estimated that the smallholders occupy about 65 to 70 % of the tea extent in the country and their contribution to overall production has also now risen to around 65 to 70 %. Since the organic tea has an increasing demand and a good overseas market the tea cultivators of small holders are encouraged to produce organic tea. In the traditional or 'orthodox' procedure, the process used to make loose tea, the leaves must go through a process of Withering, Rolling, Oxidation /fermentation and Drying. Among these processes, withering and fermentation are taken place as a result of environmental conditions except rolling and drying. Rolling could be done manually on a serrated timber plank as the quantity is small. Dholes followed by the above three processes are fed into the innovative dryer for the making of tea. This dryer was completed as two stages with two cylinders having concentric perforated cylinders inside. Two hot air generators are being used to supply the hot air where saw dust is burnt for the supply of thermal energy for the first stage drying and the electricity is used in second stage drying, The cylinders are rotating at the same speed of about 12 rpm, and screw feeder is used for the feeding of material into rotating inner cylinder at a constant rate without the material being clogged at the entrance. Analyzing the direction of material and hot air flow inside the cylinder the dryer is said to be the type of cross-flow co-current. The two drums and the material feeder are powered by a single motor of ½ hp with a gearing ratio of 1 : 30. As the heat transfer is direct from the heat transfer medium to product the dryer is also called direct or adiabatic dryer. The adiabatic dryer is more closely related to the humidification process than is the indirect one. As per the raw material and other drying parameters, the <b>dryer</b> <b>type</b> for the innovative dryer has been selected as cross flow, co current rotary type considering physical properties of the drying materials. Testing of this innovative dryer under real conditions and its results are further illustrated in the report. Based on the physical and thermodynamic parameters of the design and experimental data, a mathematical model has been developed studying various drying models and simulation methods using experimental figures in the report in details. The mathematical model and simulated results using Matlab show how far the model relate with the actual performance. The accuracy of simulation results of the mathematical model is highly depend upon the accuracy of the experiments carried out at various situations for finding out the dryer constant and the characteristic constants using physical models...|$|E

Thermal dehydration processes are highly energy-intensive and are found in almost all industrial sectors, accounting for 10 to 20 percent on national industrial energy consumption in developed countries. With escalating energy costs and need to mitigate environmental pollution due to emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, it is increasingly important to develop innovative drying technologies. Furthermore, drying also affects quality of the dried product due to physical and/or chemical transformations that may occur during the heat and mass transfer operation. With {{tens of thousands of}} products that are dried in hundreds of <b>dryer</b> <b>types,</b> it is a formidable task indeed to develop design and scale-up procedures of wide applicability. Attempts have been made {{over the past three decades}} to make fundamental and applied contributions to transport phenomena and material science aspects in drying of various forms of wet solids, pastes and liquids. This presentation will attempt to summarize the state-of-the-art as far as theoretical understanding of drying processes and provide examples of some new technologies being developed. Opportunities for challenging fundamental and modeling studies to enhance drying technologies will be identified. Illustrative results will be presented to show how mathematical modeling of spray, spouted bed and heat pump dryers can be utilized to develop new conceptual designs and to optimize operating conditions as a cost-effective route to intensify innovation in thermal dryer design. cs 201...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Marigold petals can be {{detached}} from flowers by tumbling while being dried in a rotary heated–air dryer. This {{study examined the}} effect of dryer diameter, RPM, airflow, and flower compaction on threshing petals from marigold flowers using two <b>types</b> of rotary <b>dryers.</b> A sectored rotary dryer was tested at three rotational speeds (2, 4, and 8 rpm) and two diameters (1. 2 and 1. 8 m). An open–chamber rotary dryer was tested with three levels of flower compaction (1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 X) and three airflows (4. 3, 4. 5, and 5. 3 changes/min). Both the sectored and open chamber dryers performed well in drying and threshing petals from flowers. In most tests, more than 80 % of the petals were threshed when their moisture dropped to less than 10 %, i. e., within 20 to 24 h of drying. Threshing performance was different between the sectored and open dryer. The sectored dryer had a relatively large increase in the threshing rate after 10 to 15 h of drying while the open dryer’s threshing rates remained fairly constant. The open dryer produced more threshed, high moisture petals. Threshed material from both dryers contained an insignificant amount of trash. The threshing characteristics for both <b>dryer</b> <b>types</b> were unaffected by changes in operating speed, amount of compaction, and airflow. However, by using higher compaction, the open dryer can thresh 50 to 100 % more flowers...|$|R

A forced convection mixed and indirect mode cabinet solar dryer (total collector surface area of 4 m 2 and total tray surface area of 0. 7 m 2) was employed. Each experiment started from 9 : 00 to 18 : 00 on sunny days in summer. The experiments were conducted at three air flow temperatures of 40, 50 and 60 ºC with three air flow rates of 8. 7, 6. 3 and 3. 8 m/s respectively for each indirect and mixed mode <b>dryer</b> <b>types.</b> The solar intensity was measured and recorded from 420 to 1000 W/m 2 {{during the course of}} experiments. In order to select the most appropriate drying model equation in each mode of drying, 10 different models were examined using the thin layer drying experimental data. The results of curve fitting were validated by comparing the proper statistical coefficients namely: r, χ 2, RMSE using non-linear regression analysis. According to the results, two-term drying model could satisfactorily describes the solar thin layer drying behavior of apricots with correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 999 for both types of solar drying with χ 2 = 3. 374 * 10 - 3, RMSE= 4. 33 * 10 - 2 for the mixed-mode and χ 2 = 1. 243 * 10 - 4, RMSE= 8. 64 * 10 - 3 for the indirect mode respectively. The effect of drying operating conditions (air temperature and velocity) on the model constants and coefficients were also investigated using multiple regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|The rough-rice-drying {{process in}} a mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> was {{analysed}} by the theory of thin layer drying. The drying period of rough rice in the dryer {{is assumed to be}} a pre-heating period, and a heat balance equation is introduced as one of the basic equations. The Becker 2 ̆ 7 s equation of moisture content, the Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s equation of equilibrium moisture content, and the equations of air and vapour characteristics are used for the analysis with a slight modification. The drying process in mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> is assumed to be as folloes; 1 ） Drying air increase its humidity and reduces its temperature by absorbing the moisture of the products through the mixing layer from the inlet to the outlet. This means that the state of air changes with drying time and grain position as in deep stationary bed. 2) The state of grains is independent of their position, but dependent on drying time. This is due to constant mixing. 3) The drying rate of grains, averaged by constant mixing, is independent of their position although the local drying rate varies with their position. 4 ） The heating rate of grains is also independent of their position. This is the same situation as in the drying rate. The equations on the misture content, the temperature of grains, the absolute humidity, and the enthalpy of drying air are being derived. The numerical method of solving these equations is given together with its computer program. Results computed with this theory agree well with the measured values with the practical apparatus, L. S.
