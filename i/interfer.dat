40|$|Interference {{alignment}} (IA) {{was shown}} effective for interference management to improve transmission rate {{in terms of}} the degree of freedom (DoF) gain. On the other hand, orthogonal space-time block codes (STBCs) were widely used in point-to-point multi-antenna channels to enhance transmission reliability {{in terms of the}} diversity gain. In this paper, we connect these two ideas, i. e., IA and space-time block coding, to improve the designs of alignment precoders for multi-user networks. Specifically, we consider the use of Alamouti codes for IA because of its rate-one transmission and achievability of full diversity in point-to-point systems. The Alamouti codes protect the desired link by introducing orthogonality between the two symbols in one Alamouti codeword, and create alignment at the interfering receiver. We show that the proposed alignment methods can maintain the maximum DoF gain and improve the ergodic mutual information in the long-term regime, while increasing the diversity gain to 2 in the short-term regime. The presented examples of interference networks have two antennas at each node and include the two-user X channel, the <b>interferring</b> multi-access channel (IMAC), and the <b>interferring</b> broadcast channel (IBC).
