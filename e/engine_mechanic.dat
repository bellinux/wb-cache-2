500|$|No.5 OTU had thirty crews under {{training}} in January 1945, {{compared to a}} dozen in November 1942. By this time its complement of aircraft had increased to seventy-five, including twenty-eight Mosquitos. Staffing reached its highest level of 1,700 personnel in May. Ace Charles Crombie was the unit's chief flying instructor {{when he was killed}} in a Beaufighter crash at Williamtown on 26August 1945. One of his fellow instructors at the time was Flight Lieutenant Charles [...] "Bud" [...] Tingwell. Leading Aircraftman Jack Brabham, then an <b>engine</b> <b>mechanic</b> at No.5 OTU, witnessed Crombie's accident. The end of hostilities in the Pacific saw the dissolution of all the RAAF's OTUs. On 1February 1946, No.5 OTU was reorganised as a crew conversion unit, CCU (Fighter), operating North American P-51 Mustangs and CACWirraways. Trainees were schooled in bombing and gunnery for eventual service with No.81 Wing, comprising three RAAF Mustang squadrons, as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Wing Commander Dick Cresswell served initially as chief instructor and later as commanding officer. By February 1947 the CCU had a complement of twenty-eight aircraft and just under a hundred personnel. Activity began winding down in May, and the unit was disbanded on 7July 1947.|$|E
