40|$|With {{the growing}} number of new <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> fuels and fuel {{additives}} for internal combustion engines, efficient and reliable methods for detecting exhaust genotoxicity and mutagenicity are needed to avoid the widespread application of technologies with undesirable effects toward public health. In a commonly used approach, organic extracts of particulates rather than complete exhaust is used for genotoxicity/mutagenicity assessment, which may reduce the reliability of the results. In the present study, we assessed the mutagenicity and the genotoxicity of complete diesel exhaust compared to an organic exhaust particle extract from the same diesel exhaust in a bacterial and a eukaryotic system, that is, a complex human lung cell model. Both, complete exhaust and organic extract were found to act mutagenic/genotoxic, but the amplitudes of the effects differed considerably. Furthermore, our data indicate that the nature of the mutagenicity may not be identical for complete exhaust and particle extracts. Because in addition, differences between the responses of the different biological systems were found, we suggest that a comprehensive assessment of exhaust toxicity is preferably performed with complete exhaust and with biological systems representative for the organisms and organs of interest (i. e., human lungs) and not only with the Ames test...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Emission {{regulations}} {{for diesel engines}} are being strengthened and {{it is impossible to}} meet the standards without <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> Lack of the space in many diesel vehicles, however, make it difficult to design and install stand-alone catalytic converters such as DOC, DPF, and SCR in the vehicle exhaust systems. Accordingly, those have been installed inside the muffler to save the space, and referred to the catalytic muffler. However, that has complex internal structure with perforated plate and pipe for noise and monolithic catalyst for emission reduction. For this reason, flow uniformity and pressure drop, which affect efficiency of catalyst and engine performance, respectively, should be examined when the catalytic muffler is designed. In this work, therefore, the flow uniformity and pressure drop to improve the performance of the catalytic converter and the engine have been numerically investigated by changing various design parameters such as inlet shape, porosity, and outlet shape of the muffler using the three-dimensional turbulent flow of the incompressible, non-reacting, and steady state inside the catalytic muffler. Finally, it can be found that the shape, in which the muffler has perforated pipe inside the inlet part, has higher uniformity index and lower pressure drop than others considered in this work...|$|E

This paper presents the results of an experimental analysis of pressure drop {{as a function of the}} geometric and operating parameters of cordierite and SiC diesel filters. Single-cell filters from cordierite and silicon carbide were prepared to single out any effects from the complex flow processes that take place in a full-sized filter. The product of soot layer permeability and density was experimentally determined by employing a specially designed experimental apparatus. The calculation was supported by a simple computer calculation that is also presented in this paper. The distribution of soot loading inside the channels of a full-sized filter, in various loaded and partially regenerated conditions, was assessed by connecting the apparatus to discharge through selected channels of the filter. The results are shown to improve understanding of the effects of partial regeneration and fuel additive residuals on filter back pressure and flow and soot loading distribution...|$|E

The genetic-algorithm-based optimization procedure utilizes a purpose-designed performance measure that allows an objective assessment of model prediction accuracy against a set of experimental data that represent the behaviour of the specific washcoat formulation over a typical legislated test procedure. The identification methodology is tested on a demanding case Study, and the best-fit parameters demonstrate high accuracy in matching the measured test data.

Moreover, the set of parameters identified by the genetic algorithm methodology is proven to describe in a valid way the chemical kinetic behaviour of the specific catalyst, and this is tested by the successful prediction {{of the performance of}} a smaller-size converter.

40|$|Simple mean-value air-path {{models for}} modern diesel engines are in common use {{and have been}} {{reported}} in the literature. This thesis addresses several shortcomings in the models to improve the description of the cylinder charge properties during transient operation. During sudden increases in the demanded engine load, spikes are typically seen in both NO x and smoke emissions. The predicted cylinder charge properties during the transient are examined and compared with measurements of NO x and smoke. Together, the emissions data and charge properties paint a consistent picture of the phenomena occurring during the transient. Based on this analysis, alternative strategies for reducing emissions during load transients are developed. Experimental results show that spikes in both NO x and smoke can be avoided at the expense of some loss in torque response. Even if the torque response must be maintained, it is demonstrated that NO x spikes can still be eliminated. The air-path model is subsequently extended to include a throttle in the engine intake system. Based on this model, a feed-forward controller is designed to deliver the fastest possible reduction in the in-cylinder air-charge. This type of fast transient may be required to allow regeneration of Lean NO x Trap <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> The performance of the model based controller is assessed experimentally using a completely novel sampling valve system to measure the in-cylinder gas properties on a cycle-by-cycle basis.

40|$|The {{application}} of liquid aqueous Urea Solution (AUS) as reductant in SCR <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems</b> {{is now a}} commonly accepted industry standard. Unfortunately, less acceptable are the associated difficulties caused by incomplete decomposition of the liquid, resulting in solid deposits which accumulate in the exhaust pipe downstream of the dosing components. The correct prediction of the spray pattern and, therefore, the spray impact on the walls is a key feature for the system optimization. A mechanical patternator, designed {{on the basis of}} CFD performance assessment, involving a Lagrangian representation of the dispersed liquid fully coupled with a 3 D Eulerian description of the carrier phase, has been built and used to measure the spray mass distribution. The effect of the droplets generated from the interaction among spray, probes and contingent liquid film is taken into account in the geometrical definition of the shape and the position of the patternator, as well as the flow field modification.

40|$|Several {{principal}} aspects {{and components}} of an advanced catalytic <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>system</b> for NO, reduction on a heavy-duty diesel truck engine have been systematically examined and evaluated. The <b>after-treatment</b> <b>system</b> consists of de-NO, catalysts, injection of a reducing agent (diesel fuel), and computer programs {{to model the}} engine and catalysts in real time. These models are combined with a third program, a strategy, to control the injection of reducing agent during transient operation. Evaluation of the system was performed using the standard European transient cycle (ETC). The benefits and disadvantages of an oxidation catalyst upstream the reductant injection are clarified. Whereas an increased NO 2 /NO ratio is beneficial at larger reductant dosages, the effects of temperature levelling and delay are detrimental for system performance. The dynamic effect of introducing a strategy for distributing the reducing agent in time is elucidated. The strategy itself is presented {{and the process of}} its systematic optimisation is closely followed. Implications of the optimisation are that catalyst temperature is the most important variable in the strategy. Also, a considerable part of the reducing agent should be distributed at low and intermediate temperatures, for utilising an increased NO 2 /NO ratio. Furthermore, results suggest that a smooth, rather than instantaneous, adjustment of reductant dosage to driving conditions is necessary. Finally, a set-up with two injectors is examined for its potential in the application. It is shown to be of disadvantage for the ETC as a whole, but may not be so at lower exhaust gas flows...|$|R

The main focus of this paper is the formation and evolution of nanoparticles in exhaust plume under ultra-low sulfur condition. Such study is necessary to project future nanoparticle emissions as fuel compositions and after-treatment systems change. We have carried out a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the effects of enhanced sulfur conversion efficiency, sulfur storage/release, and presence of non-volatile cores on nanoparticle formation using a detailed composition resolved aerosol microphysical model with a recently improved H 2 SO 4 -H 2 O homogeneous nucleation (BHN) module.

We found that the employment of CRDPFs may lead to the higher number concentration of nanoparticles (but smaller size) in the exhaust of vehicles running on ultra-low sulfur fuel compared to those emitted from vehicles running on high sulfur fuel. We have also shown that the sulfate storage and release effect can lead to significant enhancement in nanoparticle production under favorable conditions.

40|$|Almost {{all modern}} engine {{lubricants}} use the additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) to provide antiwear and extreme pressure protection. However existing and proposed emissions regulations include constraints in {{the concentration of}} ZDDP or other sulphated ash-, phosphorus- and sulphur- (SAPS) containing additives in engine oils, as well as limits to the permissible phosphorus loss from the oil in running engines. The deleterious effects of SAPS on exhaust aftertreatment systems from ZDDP decomposition has lead to {{a great interest in}} identifying alternative low and zero SAPS antiwear additives that can partially of fully replace ZDDP in the next generation of engine oils to extend the life of <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> The aim of the work described in this thesis is to explore under the same test conditions, the film-forming, friction and wear-reducing properties of a very wide range of low and zero SAPS antiwear additives as possible replacements for ZDDP in engine oils, and, where additive types are effective, to investigate their mechanism of action. Some of the alternative low and zero SAPS antiwear additives investigated show wear-reducing performance comparable to the ZDDP used as a benchmark in this research. The most promising alternatives to be used as supplements/replacements for ZDDP are suggested and discussed. One characteristic of ZDDP is that it can form quite thick films on surfaces during rubbing. It is found that many different types of additive can also form thick films, though not generally as thick as ZDDP. However it has been found that there is no significant correlation between the ability of an additive to form a thick boundary film and its ability to control wear. Thick boundary film formation does, however, correlate positively with an increase in friction in contacts operating at intermediate entrainment speeds, so thick film formation should not be taken as a necessary or desirable feature of antiwear additives. It is also found that antiwear additives can give a very wide range of boundary friction coefficient values, depending on the molecular structure of the additive. There thus appears to be scope for optimising the structure of antiwear additives to provide reduced boundary friction. Imperial Users Onl...|$|E
40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{progressive}} tightening of the emission regulations, gasoline and diesel engines will continuously require highly improved <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> In the case of diesel engines, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) appears {{as one of the}} widely adopted technologies to reduce NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions. Thereby, with the help of available heat from exhaust gas, the injected urea–water solution (UWS) turns inside the exhaust port immediately into gaseous ammonia (NH 3) by evaporation of mixture and thermal decomposition of urea. The reaction and conversion efficiency mostly depend upon the evaporation and subsequent mixing of the NH 3 into the exhaust gas, which in turn depends upon the engine loading conditions. Up to now, the aggregation of urea after evaporation of water and during the thermal decomposition of urea is not clearly understood. Hence, various scenarios for the urea depletion in the gaseous phase that can be envisaged have to be appraised under SCR operating conditions relying on an appropriate evaporation description. The objective of the present paper is therefore fourfold. First, a reliable multi-component evaporation model that includes a proper binary diffusion coefficient is developed {{for the first time in}} the Euler–Lagrangian CFD (computational fluid dynamics) framework to account properly for the distinct evaporation regimes of adBlue droplets under various operating conditions. Second, this model is extended for thermal decomposition of urea in the gaseous phase, where, depending on how the heat of thermal decomposition of urea is provided, different scenarios are considered. Third, since the evaporation model at and around the droplet surface is based on a gas film approach, how the material properties are evaluated in the film influences the process results is reported, also for the first time. Finally, the impact of various ambient temperatures on the adBlue droplet depletion characteristics as well as the effect of gravity is pointed out. The prediction capability of the model variants is assessed by comparing the achieved results to each other and with experimental data. It turns out that satisfactory agreement between experiment and numerical predictions is achieved for a wide range of operating temperatures by using correlations by “Wilke and Lee” for urea and by “Fuller et al. ” for water. The results are essentially sensitive to gravity. From subsequent comparisons of different ways to account for the thermal decomposition in the gaseous urea, a significant difference is observed. Finally, the 1 / 3 film rule widely used for evaluating the material properties in the film shows accurate prediction of both evaporation and thermal decomposition regimes of urea...|$|E
40|$|The {{demands on}} {{lowering}} the emissions from fossil fuel keep increasing. Together with higher demands of longer component lifetime and lighter vehicles for lower fuel consumption {{this has led}} to an increasing use of stainless steels in <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> In diesel exhaust systems one method used for removing the NOx from the exhaust gases is selective catalytic reduction. On heavy-duty trucks the reducing agent ammonia is commonly added in the form of urea water solution. In large scale use this method is fairly young and there is much yet to learn about the corrosivity of such systems. This thesis {{is a step in the}} direction of increasing this knowledge. To that effect laboratory experiments simulating a part of the muffler just before the catalyst have been performed as well as analysis of both laboratory and bench tested materials. For the laboratory experiments four stainless steels were used, three ferritic alloys and the austenitic 304 L. From bench tests 304 L and the high alloyed austenitic steel 904 L were investigated. The laboratory experiments exposed the samples to artificial diesel exhaust gases and evaporated urea solution under isothermal and cyclic conditions, including a cold zone with condensate formation. These revealed that isothermal exposure at 30 °C did not give any corrosion and that cyclic exposure caused more severe corrosion than isothermal exposure at 450 °C. AES and XPS analyses of the corrosion products showed that while the austenitic alloy performed best, the ferritic alloys all displayed the same oxide composition and amount of oxide formation. Experiments replacing the urea solution with water showed that urea additions rather decrease the corrosion under these conditions. Sulphidation, on the other hand, appears to be influencing the corrosion as sulphur enrichment was found in the inner Cr-rich oxides on all cyclically exposed samples. Analyses of the bench tested materials from near the urea injection did not indicate any influence of sulphur, but rather an influence of nitrogen uptake. Silicon oxide was observed in high amounts on both alloys, but is not believed to be active in the corrosion. Deposit formation and the possible presence of different complex formers may influence the process and influence of flow is clearly visible. The 304 L steel had suffered severe corrosion and mainly exhibited Fe-oxide and what might be nitride precipitates under the oxide. The 904 L steel showed an inner Cr-rich oxide and was only mildly corroded, but displayed a thick nitrided layer. This, however, appears to be nitrogen in solution. That may contribute to the difference in formation of Cr-rich oxides in the two alloys...|$|E

40|$|A dosing {{strategy}} for the transient control of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>system</b> using the NOX storage and reduction approach was developed on a heavy-duty diesel engine rig equipped with an 11 l diesel engine. The catalysts were oxidation catalysts of 8. 4 l and NOX storage and reduction catalysts of 16. 8 l total volume. The dosing strategy has been tested in a European Transient Cycle (ETC) resulting in a NOX reduction of 60 % (by 4. 5 g/kWh) with a fuel penalty of 6. 6 % when the catalysts were preconditioned to 450 °C. The reducing agent was diesel fuel. To keep the fuel penalty low, a bypass system was used which bypassed approximately 90 % of the exhaust flow under the regeneration periods. The parameters for the dosing strategy were obtained from steady-state optimization experiments (constant speed and torque) using Design of Experiments (DoE) to obtain much information from few experiments. The system was optimized for {{a high degree of}} NOX reduction with a low fuel penalty. The period when the flow through the catalyst is reduced (bypass time), the cycle time, the injection time and rate are important parameters to achieve an improved NOX reduction. The optimal values of these parameters varied with the load points used. The steady-state NOX conversion was approximately 60 % (3. 3 – 4. 1 g/kWh) at catalyst temperatures between 330 and 530 °C. The most promising parameters for a large NOX reduction and a low fuel penalty have been applied in the dosing strategy and tested in an ETC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: European {{regulations}} regarding {{exhaust gas}} emissions have constantly become more restricted in the last decades. Components of the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>after-treatment</b> <b>system</b> and ECU strategies have become correspondingly more complicated in order to fulfil the prescribed limits. Development and calibration of the system thus requires more accurate tuning within the imposed constraints of costs and time to market. This paper describes a simplified dynamic model of the exhaust line (TWC and lambda sensors) {{to be included in}} real time engine simulators in order to design and/or verify engine control strategies in lesser time than with conventional experimental developing programs. The model includes significant dependencies on the incoming gas mass flow rate, the air/fuel ratio (AFR) and the temperature of the converter itself. The low complexity of the proposed model will also allow its inclusion into Engine Control Units, thus providing model based behaviours to be used for EOBD...|$|R
40|$|Objectives are: (1) Develop an inexpensive, rapid-response, high-sensitivity and {{selective}} electrochemical sensor for {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NO{sub x}) for compression-ignition, direct-injection (CIDI) OBD II systems; (2) Explore and characterize novel, effective sensing methodologies based on impedance measurements and designs and manufacturing methods that are compatible with mass fabrication; and (3) Collaborate with industry in order to (ultimately) transfer the technology to a supplier for commercialization. Approach used is: (1) Use an ionic (O{sup 2 -}) conducting ceramic as a solid electrolyte and metal or metal-oxide electrodes; (2) Correlate NO{sub x} concentration with changes in cell impedance; (3) Evaluate sensing mechanisms and aging effects on long-term performance using electrochemical techniques; and (4) Collaborate with Ford Research Center to optimize sensor performance and perform dynamometer and on-vehicle testing. Work in FY 2011 focused on using an algorithm developed in FY 2010 in a simplified strategy to demonstrate how data from controlled laboratory evaluation {{could be applied to}} data from real-world engine testing. The performance of a Au wire prototype sensor was evaluated in the laboratory with controlled gas compositions and in dynamometer testing with diesel exhaust. The laboratory evaluation indicated a nonlinear dependence of the NO{sub x} and O{sub 2 } sensitivity with concentration. For both NO{sub x} and O{sub 2 }, the prototype sensor had higher sensitivity at concentrations less than {approx} 20 ppm and {approx} 7 %, respectively, compared to lower NO{sub x} and O{sub 2 } sensitivity at concentrations greater than {approx} 50 ppm and {approx} 10. 5 %, respectively. Results in dynamometer diesel exhaust generally agreed with the laboratory results. Diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems</b> will likely require detection levels less than {approx} 20 ppm in order to meet emission regulations. The relevant mathematical expressions for sensitivity in different concentration regimes obtained from bench-level laboratory evaluation were used to adjust the sensor signal in dynamometer testing. Both NO{sub x} and O{sub 2 } exhibited non-linear responses over the concentration regimes examined (0 - 100 ppm for NO{sub x} and 4 - 7 % for O{sub 2 }). Adjusted sensor signals had better agreement with both a commercial NO{sub x} sensor and FTIR measurements. However, the lack of complete agreement indicated that {{it was not possible to}} completely account for the nonlinear sensor behavior in certain concentration regimes. The agreement at lower NO{sub x} levels (less than 20 ppm) was better than at higher levels (50 - 100 ppm). Other progress in FY 2011 included dynamometer testing of sensors with imbedded heaters and protective housings that were mounted directly into the exhaust manifold. Advanced testing protocols were used to evaluate the sensors. These experiments confirmed the potential for sensor robustness and durability. Advanced material processing methods appropriate for mass manufacturing, such as sputtering, are also being evaluated. A major milestone for this past year was the licensing of the LLNL NO{sub x} sensor technology to EmiSense Technologies, LLC. EmiSense has extensive experience and resources for the development of emission control sensors. A CRADA is in development that will allow LLNL to work in partnership with EmiSense to bring the LLNL NO{sub x} sensor technology to commercialization. Ford Motor Company is also a partner in this effort...|$|E
40|$|The new {{emission}} control regulations for the diesel engines impose less soot particulate emissions. The particulates are dangerous and very harmful for the enviroment. Today, the CO and HC emissions of the diesel engines are already very low but the NOx and particulates emissions are still high. These are {{the goal of}} the modern {{emission control}} technologies. The reduction of the NOx and particulates emitted can be reduced with improvements in the engine design, fuel, oil and additive technologies and with exhaust after treatment. The soot filters collect the particulates from the diesel engine exhaust gas. The filter efficiency can be over 90 % and the durability is satisfactory. When the trap's soot load is high the regeneration is necessary to retain the efficiency and to avoid the filter failure. The regeneration methods must be further developed in order to avoid problems cause from the heat released during the combustion of the soot. These problems must be completely solved, for the soot traps to become a common used emission control device in passenger cars. Today, soot filters in passenger cars are used only from PSA, but the emission control regulations in the future will impose every vehicle with a diesel engine to have reduced particulates emissions. That will lead in the wide use of soot filters. The design and improvement of soot traps can be much more easier, more efficiently and with less cost with the use of soot filter simulation software. Many tests and modifications can be made, avoiding the experimental cost. Besides, many parameters of the filter function can be computed and analysed faster and reliably. The diploma thesis with title 'Modeling of ceramic soot filters' was conducted within the purposes of the research project 'Development of computational tools for <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems</b> design optimization' for PSA Peugeot Citroen, at the Laboratory of Thermodynamics and Thermal Engines, of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. The goal of the diploma thesis is the presentation of the basics of soot traps and the calculations conducted with the soot filter simulation software Catwall. The validation of the model as well as to find the points that need to be improved {{are a part of the}} thesis. The properties of the materials, soot and insulation were defined and there was an effort to choose the most suitable kinetics scheme for the soot combustion and the additive reaction. The first chapter describes the emissions of the diesel engines, the emissions regulations, the soot particulates, the soot filters basics, regeneration, materials and the fuel additive. The second chapter deals with the modeling of the experiments of the small filters, conducted by PSA. The experiments are described and the results from the calculations are compared with the measurements with SiC and Cordierite filters. In the next chapter the experiments conducted with insulated filters by the IFP are described and then the temperature and ΔΡ calculations are presented. The effort to choose the most suitable kinetics parameters follows as well as the comparison of 4 kinetics schemes for the soot combustion without additive. The forth chapter describes the experiments conducted at the Laboratory of Thermodynamics and Thermal Engines. The results from the calculations are compared with the measurements with SiC and Cordierite filters and there is also an effort to choose the most suitable kinetics scheme, with a comparison of 4 kinetics schemes for the soot combustion with additive. The model is described in appendix I and the preprocessing and postprocessing of the experimental data are presented in appendix II. The conclusions from the calculations are presented in order to improve the source code and to suggest the conduction of new experiments, which will help in achieving this goal. Finally many remarks are made on the results, which confirm the literature data or describe the effect of the regeneration parameters on the calculations, which need to be further searched through...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{diesel exhaust}} (DE) was {{measured}} in real time using a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) {{to determine the effect}} of an after-treatment catalyst on gas phase volatile organic compounds (VOCs). DE after-treatment catalysts are being designed to reduce the pollutants in exhaust, which contains both particulate matter and gas phase constituents. The PTR-MS can make in-situ real time measurements of hydrocarbons in the air, from concentrations in the parts per million by volume (ppmV) down to the low part per trillion by volume (pptV) range. Spectrum scans were performed at varied engine loads from mass range m/z (mass to charge ratio) = 20 to 200. This showed the relative abundance of gas phase VOCs produced as the engine ran between idle mode and 80 % of its maximum load. The mass spectrum was complex and appeared to be composed of aromatic species ionized by PTR (M+ 1) through the anticipated proton transfer reactions as well as unexpected alkane fragments, evidenced by a strong 14 n+ 1 ion pattern showing intense peaks at m/z = 43, 57, and 71. A number of protonated M+ 1 masses could be identified. These compounds displayed M+ 2 peaks consistent with known 13 C isotopic abundance. As the engine load increased, the concentrations of over 90 % of the species decreased. An attached smoke meter showed that soot concentrations increased over the same conditions. In addition, the decrease in the concentration of compounds with a larger molecular weight (m/z> 100) was greater than the rate that the smaller compounds experienced. This appears to be due to the affinity of VOCs, larger masses in particular, to adhere to soot particles. Further PTR-MS measurements of VOCs on soot confirmed this by producing a mass spectrum comprised of masses predominantly over 100 amu. On-line analysis of diesel exhaust by PTR-MS is a practical tool for quantifying selected organic species in diesel exhaust and should prove useful for developing better diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|Diesel engine {{technology}} {{has been driven by}} increasingly stringent environmental legislation. To comply with these laws, emissions-control systems are being rapidly improved. Within this context, development of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>after-treatment</b> <b>systems</b> undertakes a significant role. Among the techniques used is selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which converts nitrogen oxides (NOx) into diatomic nitrogen (N- 2) and water (H 2 O). A reducing agent containing ammonia (NH 3) is added to the flow and absorbed by a catalyst. Different reducing agents are currently used, principally anhydrous NH 3, aqueous NH 3, and urea. This study analyzed behavior of different urea-and formamide-based agents to SCR. Results are compared to those obtained with Adblue. In relation to the SCR system as well as to NOx reduction, we concluded that urea-based mixtures are the most efficient, although they present higher values of NH 3 slip. Formamide-based mixtures are significantly less efficient than urea-based mixtures, but the NH 3 slip levels produced by these mixtures are virtually none. A challenge is to find new reducing agent for SCR applications, considering that the deposits of urea formed during certain work conditions are a significant problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of nitrogen monoxide {{in the atmosphere}} {{is one of the}} main causes of air pollution. In this regards, the truck industry introduced the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>system</b> of heavy-duty trucks. Through the use of urea water solution injected into the gas flow, NOx can be reduced to N 2 and H 2 O. The high temperatures in the exhaust system, together with the products of the reduction reactions, produce a particularly corrosive environment, strongly detrimental for the corrosion resistance of the stainless steels used. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of nitridation on the oxidation resistance of AISI 444 ferritic stainless steel. The oxidation of both as-received and nitrided 444 coupons in the presence of 10 % H 2 O was investigated in the temperature range of 450 and 600 °C. The exposure time was between 24 and 168 hours. The samples were characterized by using several techniques including LOM, SEM, EDS, XPS, XRD. An expanded ferrite phase supersaturated with nitrogen was formed on the surface of 444 ferritic stainless steel after plasma nitriding at about 400 °C. The layer thicknesses were about 10 - 20 μm with a nitrogen atomic content of about 15 - 13 %. The detrimental effect of nitridation was very strong on the oxidation resistance of ferritic 444. The oxide scales formed on nitrided samples were 50 - 100 times thicker than on as-received samples. The lower chromium activity in nitrided 444 due to formation of short-range ordering with nitrogen decreases the chromium diffusion toward the surface and hinders formation of protective oxides. The oxidation on 444 ferritic stainless steel definitely decreased with increasing temperatures, although the larger formation of Cr-nitrides at higher temperatures. The increase of chromium diffusion due both to higher temperatures and larger leak of nitrogen from the expanded ferritic phase improves the oxidation resistance of the ferritic 444. The oxidation resistance in presence of 10 % H 2 O at 450 - 600 °C seems better for nitrided 444 ferritic stainless steel than for nitrided 304 L austenitic stainless steel investigated in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern in the}} world with regard to {{pollution}} and climate change. The relation between air pollution and climate change in particular is strong and complex. There is thus a shift towards greener technologies and a large amount of resources have been allocated for the research and development of such technologies. As emission regulations are becoming stricter, there is a concerted effort from all fronts in the EU to design and develop an optimal <b>exhaust</b> <b>after-treatment</b> <b>system</b> which would concur with current emission regulations imposed by Euro V and Euro VI (0. 005 g/km of particulate matter (PM) and particulate number (PN) 6. 0 × 1011) for both gasoline and diesel powered drives). Open channel substrates (described in this work) are used for the removal of particulate matter from exhaust. Such substrates are made of channels (arranged in a honeycomb structure) which permit the flow of exhaust through them. The PM is ultimately trapped on the wall of these channels. Over the past decade there has been a substantial increase in the computational power available to researchers. This increase of available computational resources has shifted the prime focus of research from time-consuming and expensive construction of pilot-scale prototypes towards simulation-driven development of new after treatment solutions. The current work aims to describe such a feedback between experiments and simulations in order to describe the capture of an inert particle (sodium chloride - NaCl) in an open substrate (monolith channel). The experiments and simulations are done in conjunction and such a systematic approach improves the quality of the experimental evaluation. This congruence is evident throughout this work, with the simulations generally, corresponding to the experimental results (simulations results are within the error limit of the experimental results). Both temperature and residence time {{have a significant impact on}} the capture efficiency due to Brownian deposition along an open channel. In addition the general trends with variation in residence time (flow conditions) and temperature are noticeably similar in both experiments and simulations. This indicates that the theory behind the description of capture efficiency in open channels (Brownian deposition in open substrates) is able to explain the capture phenomena of inert particulates accurately...|$|R
