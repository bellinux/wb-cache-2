25|$|The Hiduminium alloys or R.R. alloys are {{a series}} of high-strength, <b>high-temperature</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloys, {{developed}} for aircraft use by Rolls-Royce ("RR") before World War II. They were manufactured and later developed by High Duty Alloys Ltd.. The name Hi-Du-Minium is derived from that of High Duty Aluminium Alloys.|$|E

It {{includes the}} following structure: a saphire base layer; a <b>high-temperature</b> <b>aluminium</b> nitride buffer layer grown on said saphire base layer; a medium-temperature gallium nitride buffer layer grown on the <b>high-temperature</b> <b>aluminium</b> nitride buffer layer; a gallium nitride epitaxial layer deposited on said medium-temperature gallium nitride buffer layer; a Schottky junction layer formed on said gallium nitride epitaxial layer; and several resistance contacts also formed on said gallium nitride epitaxial layer. Said <b>high-temperature</b> <b>aluminium</b> nitride buffer layer and said medium-temperature gallium nitride buffer layer are formed into double buffer layer structure, so that the stability and radiation resistance of said UV ray detection device are greatly raised. 一种紫外线检测装置，包括如下的结构：一蓝宝石基底层；一高温氮化铝缓冲层，生长在该蓝宝石基底层之上；一中温氮化镓缓冲层，生长在该高温氮化铝缓冲层之上；一氮化镓外延层，沉积在该中温氮化镓缓冲层之上；一肖特基结层，形成在该氮化镓外延层之上；多个电阻触点，也形成在该氮化镓外延层上；该高温氮化铝缓冲层和该中温氮化镓缓冲层形成了双重缓冲层结构，从而提高了该紫外线检测装置的稳定性和耐辐射性。其中该高温氮化铝缓冲层和该中温氮化镓缓冲层由射频等离子体增强分子束磊晶成长技术形成。Department of Electronic and Information EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: Xu XingquanInventor name used in this publication: 方伟强Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種紫外綫檢測裝置Chin...|$|E
40|$|Higher-grade reactor lining {{materials}} {{are needed to}} withstand the higher working temperatures and gas pressures used in gasification reactors to improve their efficiency. Both conventional oxide materials and nonoxide materials such as SiC and AlN are suitable refractory materials for the reducing atmospheres prevailing in gasifiers. Interactions between the reactor lining and the slag constitute the main corrosion mechanism. In previous investigations on the <b>high-temperature</b> corrosion of <b>aluminium</b> nitride by coal ash [1] AlN materials were tested in basic and acidic coal ashes at temperatures of 900 - 1300. °C. In the present work the <b>high-temperature</b> corrosion of <b>aluminium</b> nitride by different coal ashes is {{compared with that of}} alumina, magnesia and zirconia...|$|R

5000|$|Inconel alloys are oxidation- and {{corrosion-resistant}} materials {{well suited}} for service in extreme environments subjected to high pressure and kinetic energy. When heated, Inconel forms a thick and stable passivating oxide layer protecting the surface from further attack. Inconel retains strength over a wide temperature range, attractive for <b>high-temperature</b> applications where <b>aluminium</b> and steel would succumb to creep {{as a result of}} thermally induced crystal vacancies (see Arrhenius equation). Inconel's high temperature strength is developed by solid solution strengthening or precipitation strengthening, depending on the alloy. In age-hardening or precipitation-strengthening varieties, small amounts of niobium combine with nickel to form the intermetallic compound Ni3Nb or gamma prime (γ'). Gamma prime forms small cubic crystals that inhibit slip and creep effectively at elevated temperatures. [...] The formation of gamma-prime crystals increases over time, especially after three hours of a heat exposure of 850 °C, and continues to grow after 72 hours of exposure.|$|R
