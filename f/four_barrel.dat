5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} great majority were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a <b>four</b> <b>barrel</b> battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on <b>four</b> <b>barrel</b> arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

It produced 250 HP with the high rise intake but was not equipped with Shelby headers {{in order to make}} room for power steering.

500|$|The cathedral {{is defined}} as a domed and centrally-planned basilica. According to Richard Krautheimer it derives its plan from that of the 7th century cathedral of Talin, with only minor differences. The dome was {{supported}} on pendentives and stood atop the [...] "intersection of <b>four</b> <b>barrel</b> vaults elevated to a cruciform design and topped with gabled roofs." [...] In the interior, [...] "freestanding piers divide the space into three aisles, the nave of which terminates in an eastern apse flanked by two story side chapels." [...] Sirarpie Der Nersessian noted that its interior is imposing [...] "through the harmony of the proportions." [...] She added, [...] "The blind arcade with slender columns and ornate arches, the delicate interlaces carved around the door and windows add to the beauty of the exterior." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} 383 engines {{available for the}} 1969 model year: 2-barrel and 4-barrel. [...] The 2-barrel was rated at 290 hp. The <b>four</b> <b>barrel</b> engine was rated at 330 hp and was identified by the [...] "pie tin" [...] on the air cleaner as [...] "383 / FOUR BARREL". The 330-hp engine was unique to the Charger model in 1969. While this engine was available with an un-silenced air cleaner option, it differed internally from the 335-hp 383 [...] "Magnum". In 1969 the B-series engines were all painted Chrysler Engine Turquoise {{with the exception of}} the 383 four speed, 440 Magnum, These engines were painted Chrysler High-Performance Orange. Differing from the 426 Hemi which was painted Street Hemi Orange. The 335-hp 383 Magnum engines were also painted Chrysler High-Performance Orange. The 383 Magnum motor was used in Road Runners and Super Bees, but did not appear in a Charger body until 1971. Differences between the 330-hp 383 4-barrel and 335-hp 383 magnum were mostly internal. Both versions used the Carter AVS carb and the larger exhaust manifolds from the 440 Magnum engines, but the Magnum had a windage tray in the oil pan, a different camshaft profile, and different valve springs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 and 1969 Buick {{offered the}} GS 400 in a {{convertible}} and hardtop model. [...] Standard {{issue of the}} GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350hp stage 1 [...] ) and 440ft. lbs. torque, a <b>four</b> <b>barrel</b> Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( [...] limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C [...] ), and the available three speed turbo Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo Hydramatic 400), U-shape Hurst (automatic transmission) shifter and linkage, located on a center console. [...] A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually [...] "low" [...] 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard 3 spd or optional 4 spd manual gearbox was also available. [...] Compression ratio on this engine was a very sensible 10.25:1, which allowed {{for the use of}} any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. [...] The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a wing nut. [...] The small air scoop behind the hood hinge-line on the 1968 model was fake, although it could perhaps technically be called functional, as it could have bettered the air flow available to the climate control system.|$|E
