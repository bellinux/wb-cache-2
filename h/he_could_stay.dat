5|$|The episode also {{marks the}} upgrade of several {{returning}} characters {{to the main}} cast. John Bradley-West returns as Jon Snow's friend Sam Tarly, James Cosmo as the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch Jeor Mormont, Jerome Flynn as Tyrion's cunning servant Bronn, with Sibel Kekilli as Tyrion's concubine Shae, and lastly Conleth Hill as the gossiping eunuch Varys. Peter Dinklage {{takes the place of}} Sean Bean as the first credit during the intro sequence. Since Bean's character was killed {{at the end of last}} season, Dinklage jokingly wished that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> being the lead credit for some time.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{decided to}} move to the {{continent}} for a better chance at success, and contacted French brothers Robert and Yvon Murphy, whom he met while racing. They agreed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> with them in the Breton fishing port of Saint-Brieuc. His final event in Britain was at Herne Hill, riding motor-paced races. Simpson won the event and was invited to Germany to train for the 1959 motor-paced world championships, but declined the opportunity in favour of a career on the road. Bicycle manufacturer Elswick Hopper invited him to join their British-based team, but Benny Foster advised him to continue with his plans to move to France.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in Scotland continued {{as a civil}} war. Lord Moray was assassinated on 23 January 1570. The regent who succeeded him, the Earl of Lennox, was also a victim of violence. On 30 April 1571, the controller of Edinburgh Castle, Kirkcaldy of Grange, ordered all enemies of the Queen to leave the city. But for Knox, his former friend and fellow galley-slave, he made an exception. If Knox did not leave, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> in Edinburgh, but only if he remained captive in the castle. Knox chose to leave, and on 5 May he left for St Andrews. He continued to preach, spoke to students, and worked on his History. At the end of July 1572, after a truce was called, he returned to Edinburgh. Although by this time exceedingly feeble and his voice faint, he continued to preach at St Giles'.|$|E

5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay,</b> to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E
5|$|Originally, historians {{believed}} that Edward's decision to rebuild {{much of the}} castle {{was in response to}} the growing tensions with France; in this version of events, Hadleigh would have formed an importance coastal fortification along the Thames estuary, protecting it from French raids. Current historical opinion plays down this motivation, noting {{that at the time of}} the work on Hadleigh relations with France were unusually good. Instead, it is suspected that the increasing elderly Edward intended Hadleigh more as a personal retreat close to London, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> in privacy and considerable comfort. Whilst the entrance on the inland side remained relatively basic, the building work created a grander impression from the estuary – any visitors to London, English or French, would have passed by Queenborough Castle on the south bank and Hadleigh on the north, the combination communicating a strong sense of royal power.|$|E

25|$|When {{he was in}} his 60s, Eliot {{wrote that}} he was {{immature}} and timid at the time, and was probably in love with Emily Hale, a Bostonian he had had a relationship with in the United States. What he wanted from Haigh-Wood, he said, was a flirtation. But a meeting with the American poet Ezra Pound had persuaded him that the pursuit of poetry was possible, and marrying Haigh-Wood meant <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> in England and avoid Harvard. Eliot told a friend, Conrad Aiken, that he wanted to marry and lose his virginity.|$|E
25|$|During the suspension, Ajax were {{in contact}} with other European clubs {{interested}} in Suárez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a €26.5million (£22.8million) offer for Suárez from Premier League club Liverpool. Despite leaving while suspended, Suárez departed Ajax on good terms, and {{he was given a}} farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club wished <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed. Ajax ended the 2010–11 season as Eredivisie champions and Suárez was given a winner’s medal for his 7 goals in 13 appearances. While he was at Ajax, Suárez scored 111 goals in 159 appearances.|$|E
25|$|With the war {{continuing}} across Europe throughout 1918, Rachmaninoff planned his future; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> {{and continue}} performing and composing, or move once more. Late in the year, he once again received {{an offer to}} become conductor of the Boston and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, but declined. As composing would not pay enough to support himself, Rachmaninoff now saw performing in America as the best solution to his growing financial concerns. On 1 November 1918, the family boarded a boat in Oslo, Norway bound for New York City, arriving eleven days later. They settled in 505 West End Avenue and Rachmaninoff accepted a piano from Steinway as a gift, and acquired Charles Ellis as his agent, who secured him forty performances across the following four months. The family recreated the atmosphere of their Ivanovka estate at their new home, entertaining Russian guests, employing Russian servants, and observing Russian customs. In 1920, Rachmaninoff signed a recording contract with the Victor Talking Machine Company which earned him some much-needed income. He {{became a member of}} the board of directors for the Tolstoy Foundation Center in Valley Cottage, New York.|$|E

500|$|According to Canham, he {{met with}} Elliott in December 1968 and offered him the job of {{associate}} athletic director. [...] Canham told Elliott <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> on as coach if he wanted, but Canham could not promise him that the job of associate athletic director would still be open in another couple of years. [...] Canham said: [...] "Bump smiled at me and said, ‘I don’t {{have to think about}} it.’ [...] He was ready to get out. [...] I did not force him, and I mean that in all honesty.

500|$|On April 26, {{television}} channel NY1 reported that Giuliani {{had undergone a}} second round of tests for prostate cancer at Mount Sinai Medical Center; the same disease had led to the death of his father. [...] On April 28, Giuliani held a news conference to announce that he did in fact have prostate cancer, but it was in an early stage. [...] He was unsure of which of several types of treatment he might undergo, and that decision would impact whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> in the senate race or not. [...] Hanover was not present at the conference, but issued a note saying she would support him in his decision process.|$|E
500|$|Tessa's first {{encounter}} with MacLeod is shown in a flashback sequence in [...] "". She had recently left the Sorbonne and was working {{as an artist and}} conducting tours of the River Seine in Paris. On April 1, 1980, to escape Immortal Christoph Kuyler (Peter Howitt) who was trying to behead him, MacLeod jumped on a Bateau Mouche on which Tessa was working, and charmed her so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> on board. Another flashback scene in the episode [...] "" [...] shows how MacLeod revealed his immortality to Tessa. On April 1, 1983, MacLeod made Tessa shoot him in the chest with a pistol. After he revived, MacLeod revealed himself to be an Immortal who could not age or father children, but did not mention [...] the Game. MacLeod expected Tessa to show disgust or fear, but instead Tessa expressed compassion and sadness for his loneliness. As Tessa remains unaware of the Game, MacLeod occasionally fights other Immortals without her knowledge.|$|E

500|$|Schnaufer {{claimed his}} first aerial victory on their thirteenth combat mission flown {{one day after}} the attack on Cologne on the night 1/2 June 1942. Nominally this was the RAF's second 1,000 bomber raid against Germany, {{although}} the attacking force actually numbered 956 aircraft. Schnaufer shot down a Handley Page Halifax south of Louvain in Belgium. The aircraft probably was a Halifax from No. 76 Squadron piloted by Sergeant Thomas Robert Augustus West, which was shot down at 01:55 on 2 June 1942 and crashed at Grez-Doiceau, [...] south of Louvain. West and another member of the crew were killed. This victory was achieved by ground-controlled interception through the Kammhuber Line. Once near to the target, Rumpelhardt had visually found the bomber and directed Schnaufer into attack position from below and astern. The Halifax caught on fire after two firing passes. During this mission the Himmelbett flight officer vectored them to a second bomber, a Bristol Blenheim. The attack had to be aborted after Hauptmann (Captain) Walter Ehle shot down the bomber from a more favourable attack position. Shortly before 03:00, they were then flying in the vicinity of Ghent, they spotted another target. Schnaufer made two unsuccessful attacks. During their third attack, which closed the distance to , they were hit by the defensive gunfire. Schnaufer was hit in his left calf, the port engine was burning, the rudder control cables were severed, and an electrical short circuit caused the landing lights to be permanently on. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer considered bailing out but decided to make an attempt for their home airfield after they managed to put out the flames and restart the engine. While Rumpelhardt made radio contact with the Sint-Truiden airbase, Schnaufer landed the aircraft without rudder control and on ailerons and engine-power alone. This was the only time that their aircraft sustained damage in combat or any member of the crew was wounded. Both Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer were awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for their first aerial victory. Schnaufer had hoped that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> on active duty and that the bullet lodged in his calf would isolate itself. However, he had to be admitted to a hospital in Brussels from 8–25 June for surgery. Rumpelhardt was given home leave until 26 June while Schnaufer was in the hospital.|$|E

Mrs Fletcher said: [...] "I know he is ill and I think he should be returned to a prison in Libya so his family can visit him.

She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there. Nothing off the menu, ever." [...] Baldwin wrote that he spent over a million dollars, has had to put time aside from his career, has had to travel extensively, and needed to find a house in California (he lived in New York), so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stay</b> in his daughter's life.|$|E
