It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated <b>future</b> <b>price</b> negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

25|$|The {{time value}} of an option is {{the total value of}} the option, less the {{intrinsic}} value. It partly arises from the uncertainty of <b>future</b> <b>price</b> movements of the underlying. A component of the time value also arises from the unwinding of the discount rate between now and the expiry date. In the case of a European option, the option cannot be exercised before the expiry date, so it is possible for the time value to be negative; for an American option if the time value is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} spot and <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> for {{a broad range of}} commodities, including energy, precious and base metals, and agricultural commodities.

This difference appears to be driven in part by the depth of each market. We find that over the last five years, it is much harder to reject the null of <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> being unbiased predictors of <b>future</b> spot <b>prices</b> than in earlier periods for almost all commodities.

Hibernia did not produce oil until 1997 and Terra Nova until 2002. The government also expected Petro-Canada to force down what it considered the high price of gasoline to consumers, but Petro-Canada's oil production was more expensive and its oil refineries less efficient than those of the competing multi-national companies, and it found itself losing money on all aspects of the oil industry.|$|E

40|$|Commodity <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> are {{frequently}} criticized as being uninformative for forecasting purposes because (1) {{they seem to}} do no better than a random walk or an extrapolation of recent trends and (2) <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> for commodities often trace out a relatively flat trajectory even though global demand is steadily increasing. In this paper, we attempt {{to shed light on}} these concerns by discussing the theoretical relationship between spot and <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> for commodities and by evaluating the empirical forecasting performance of <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> relative to some alternative benchmarks. The key results of our analysis are that <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> have generally outperformed a random walk forecast, but not by a large margin, while both futures and a random walk noticeably outperform a simple extrapolation of recent trends (a random walk with drift).

40|$|Electricity is not storable. As a consequence, {{electricity}} demand and supply {{need to be}} in balance at any moment in time as a shortage in production volume cannot be compensated with supply from inventories. However, if the installed power supply capacity is very flexible, variation in demand can be counterbalanced with flexible adjustment of production volumes. Therefore, supply flexibility can replace the role of inventory. In this paper, we question whether power production flexibility is a substitute for storability. To do so, we examine power <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> from countries that differ in their power supply and test whether power <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> contain information about expected <b>future</b> spot <b>prices</b> and risk premiums and examine whether <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> from a market in which power supply is more flexible would lead to <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> that are more in line with the theory of storage. We find the opposite; <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> from markets with flexible power supply behave according to the expectations theory.

2500|$|When trading futures contracts, being 'short' means {{having the}} legal {{obligation}} to deliver {{something at the}} expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery. [...] Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the <b>future</b> <b>price</b> of goods {{they have not yet}} produced. [...] Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines.

If hedging is really just about reducing risk, then why should our expectations of future market direction have any bearing on our hedging decisions?

60|$|The credit {{given to}} any one by those with whom he deals {{does not depend on}} the {{quantity}} of bank-notes or coin in circulation at the time, but on their opinion of his solvency. If any consideration of a more general character enters into their calculation, it is only in a time of pressure on the loan market, when they are not certain of being themselves able to obtain the credit on which they have been accustomed to rely; and even then, what they look to is the general state of the loan market, and not (preconceived theory apart) the amount of bank-notes. So far, as to the willingness to give credit. And the willingness of a dealer to use his credit depends on his expectations of gain, that is, on his opinion of the probable <b>future</b> <b>price</b> of his commodity; an opinion grounded either on the rise or fall already going on, or on his prospective judgment respecting the supply and the rate of consumption. When a dealer extends his purchases beyond his immediate means of payment, engaging to pay at a specified time, he does so in the expectation either that the transaction will have terminated favorably before that time arrives, or that he shall then be in possession of sufficient funds from the proceeds of his other transactions. The fulfillment of these expectations depends upon prices, but not specially upon the amount of bank-notes. It is obvious, however, that prices do not depend on money, but on purchases. Money left with a banker, and not drawn against, or drawn against for other purposes than buying commodities, has no effect on prices, any more than credit which is not used. Credit which is used to purchase commodities affects prices {{in the same manner as}} money. Money and credit are thus exactly on a par in their effect on prices.|$|E

It is found that the government corn support price program plays a major role in corn and soybean production decisions. Also, the results indicate that <b>futures</b> <b>prices</b> are not good proxies for expected <b>future</b> cash <b>prices</b> in the presence of government programs.
