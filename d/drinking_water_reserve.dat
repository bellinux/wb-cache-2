50|$|Khuvsgul {{is one of}} {{seventeen}} ancient lakes in the world, being more than 2 million years old, and the most pristine (apart from Lake Vostok), {{as well as being}} the most significant <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> of Mongolia. Its water is potable without any treatment. Hovsgol is an ultraoligotrophic lake with low levels of nutrients, primary productivity and high water clarity (secchi depths > 18 m are common). Hovsgol's fish community is species-poor compared to that of Lake Baikal. Species of commercial and recreational interest include Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), burbot (Lota lota), lenok (Brachymystax lenok), and the endangered endemic Hovsgol grayling (Thymallus nigrescens). Though endangered by poaching during its spawning runs, the Hovsgol grayling is still abundant throughout much of the lake.|$|E

Despite {{a substantial amount of}} funding allocated toward improving <b>water</b> infrastructure on <b>reserve,</b> an alarming proportion of communities face boil and <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> advisories. To understand why this paradox and problem persists, this article will work through the issues and nuances that have created unsafe <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> on <b>reserve,</b> proposed remedies, and policy implications. To do so, the role of the Government of Canada is reviewed first because reserve land is under federal jurisdiction. Following this, the article will discuss the standpoints of the Assembly of First Nations and other Indigenous groups on the water crisis, and will draw upon focus groups within First Nations that we conducted. To contextualize the <b>water</b> issue on <b>reserve</b> in Canada, a comparison with the United States is then drawn. One of the main themes of this paper with regard to the issue of safe <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> on <b>reserve</b> is how the legacy of colonization has limited community capacity. This theme is then discussed in depth by comparing Indigenous to non-Indigenous communities, looking to the social determinants of water quality, and possibilities and limitations of building adaptive sustainability allowing for safe <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> on <b>reserve.</b> To understand what processes consistently intervene in the way of sustainability of safe water in Indigenouscommunities, regulatory frameworks are examined, funding mechanisms are reviewed, and Aboriginal governance is discussed along with the direction that policy should take...|$|R

The {{investigations}} {{aimed to}} establish the qualitative composition of summer algal communities of the ponds which are the strategic <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> {{for the city of}} Cluj-Napoca. They are located on the right bank of the Someşu Mic River, between the Floreşti village and the city Cluj-Napoca. There have been identified 201 algal taxa, 152 of them in the plankton and 143 in the benthos, with 105 taxa occurring in both plankton and benthos samples. The algal flora is characterized by a large number of ubiquitous, cosmopolitan elements, together with several algae having well defined ecological preferences (basiphilous), or indicators of the trophic status and saprobic level of the water. The estimation of water trophicity level was performed based on phytoplankton indices. The floristic affinity of the investigated communities was tested by Jaccard’s similarity index. Together with autochthonous algae there have been found some alien ones, washed into the ponds from the Someşu Mic River drainage basin...|$|R

Some examples of these techniques include fixed covers, floating covers, wind breaks along with chemical films and monolayers. The following practical exercise aims to give senior high school Physics and multi-strand science students an insight into how evaporation measurements can be made and compared with modelled data to verify their accuracy by employing local wind velocity, temperature (air and water) and water vapour (humidity) information. In addition to this, this exercise shows how publicly available chemical films based on substances such as silicon, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol can be utilised to reduce evaporation.

It now occurs in 18 out of 27 lakes in the archipelago. Only four of the 12 previously recorded native and endemic calanoids have been encountered in the lakes, which may indicate that most have been displaced by A. dorsalis, although a general deterioration of water quality by fish culture may also have contributed to a suppression of the local fauna. Undescribed species may have been affected as well. A. dorsalis was first reported in the Philippines from Laguna de Bay in 1991, where it was said to have been introduced via ship <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> <b>reserves,</b> but co-introduction with tilapia is more probable.

The countries of Central Caucasus can make a meaningful contribution to the construction of the "New Silk Road" with other untapped rich natural resources. Especially attractive for investors can be the Georgian underground artesian renewable, biologically clean <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> of international importance; an effective utilization of their small part can make a significant contribution to the resolving of high quality <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> supply problem for millions of people in Europe and Asia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, independent post-Soviet Georgia has passed through the toughest period of reforms, conflicts and development. A significant part of its territory is still occupied, the economy is weak; the country is oriented to the European Union. In this light the country should use foreign experience and capabilities in the real sector (agriculture, mining industry [...] .). In post-Soviet Georgia according to the current legislation, foreign investors enjoy the same rights as domestic ones. A large part of the world's population suffers from water shortages. In Georgia this resource is virtually untapped (only 0. 01 is used). This resource will further rise in price on the world market of raw materials. Through the participation of foreign investors Georgia can make its contribution to the solving of the above-noted global problem in different directions: By the exploitation of freshwater resources Georgia should become a larger producer and exporter of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> until the problems of products transportation arise; the second part of underground <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> should be provided to Europe and other countries through pipelines. Thus, there is proposed a model of bacteriological pure underground artesian water supply from Georgia to Europe in the conditions of maintaining ecological balance. This model takes into account the analysis of water pipeline alternatives, “Georgia-Europe” pipeline construction, as Europe's population is in need of high-quality <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> and Georgia is interested in its export. </p...|$|R

In particular, {{the long history}} of poor water quality plaguing First Nations communities has received substantial public attention. Despite several initiatives from the federal government and considerable financial support, the quality of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> on <b>reserves</b> has shown little improvement and continues to pose health risks. As a result, there is a growing interest in the ability of First Nations communities to effectively manage their <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> resources. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the capacity of Montreal Lake, SK to provide its residents with safe <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> both now and into the future. This research employed a mixed methods approach in the examination of the community’s water system and management practices. Data sources included individual interviews, a public workshop, documents and inspection reports, and water quality data. Water system capacity was considered in terms of financial, human resources, institutional, social/political, and technical dimensions. An analytical framework was developed through a literature review where each dimension of capacity was rated based on a series of indicators.

40|$|Pollution by nitrate and {{pesticides}} has impacts on <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> and aquatic systems. Nowadays, {{this problem is}} the key point of the European Policy {{with the implementation of}} the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000 / 60 /EC). According to these legislations, Member States are supposed to take measures to limit environmental and toxicological effects caused by nitrate {{and pesticides}} use. This paper presents three different approaches allowing assessment of diffuse (non-point sources) pollution risks of water resources by nitrate and pesticides. The first approach consists on the interpretation of the geomorphopedological information (geologic substratum type, presence of karst phenomena, soil texture, natural drainage, profile development, type and percent of stoniness, soil thickness, …) provided by the Digital Soil Map of Wallonia. Soil physical characteristics are assessed in terms of soil water percolation/infiltration, runoff, pollutants retention, mineralization, and erosion. Second approach consists on the use of spatially distributed mechanistic models. Nitrate lixiviation from agricultural land to groundwater has been simulated from the SWAT model. Pesticide lixiviation from soil to groundwater has been predicted from the one-dimensional, dynamic, multi-layered model named PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local scales). Model input parameters are mainly extracted from the existing soil physical and physico-chemical, crop and pesticides properties databases. Relevant soil parameters not directly available in existing databases, such as bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, potential evapotranspiration… have been derived from pedotransfers functions. Third approach consists on in situ lixiviation studies by the way of lysimeters. Concentrations measured at the bottom (2 m deep) of lysimeters represent a straight “index of risk” for groundwater and, on the other hand, allow the validation of simulation models used to predict nitrate and pesticides lixiviation risk under different scenarios. The Digital Soil Map of Wallonia, one of the core data source, allows the spatialisation of the predicted lixiviation risk at regional level, providing to the local authorities and the decision makers a tool for the identification of the areas at risk of pollution, where specific monitoring actions and prevention measures for the protection of waters can be implemented...|$|R

However, no timeline is specified in the action plan, and the implementation {{is the responsibility of}} the individual Federal States (e.g., by including support for the creation of waterside margins in agro-environmental programmes). Some Federal States have already initiated appropriate measures [60], but there is currently no systematic overview of the progress made in creating permanent green waterside margins for Germany as a whole. The German NAP has set an ambitious target for the creation of buffer zones by 2023 for all surface waters in protected areas for <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> nature <b>reserves,</b> and in sensitive areas identified by hot-spot analyses. There is general consensus that the greening requirement should be applicable which is valid since 2015 under the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for such landscape-based risk management. To receive the full CAP area-based payments, farmers are required to dedicate 5 % of arable land to ‘ecological focus areas’. The NAP Forum (December 2014) concluded: “The NAP Forum is of the opinion that the primary use of ‘ecological focus areas’ to create buffer strips, field margins and forest peripheries where the application of PPPs is banned under the Greening rules can provide an important contribution for the protection of surface waters and the preservation of biodiversity by increasing the proportion of habitats and sanctuaries in the agricultural landscape.” [61].

Under the influence of temperature, residence time and pipe materials the <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> quality can change while the water passes the domestic <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> system. According to the Dutch <b>Drinking</b> <b>Water</b> Act the <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> temperature may not exceed the 25 °C threshold at point-of-use level. This paper provides a mathematical approach to model the heating of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> within the domestic water supply system. It appears that residence time influences the <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> temperature more than the ambient temperature itself...|$|R
