5|$|C.maenas is fished on a {{small scale}} in the {{north-east}} Atlantic Ocean, with approximately 1200tonnes being caught annually, mostly in France and the United Kingdom.

5|$|In some localities {{significant}} bait fisheries {{exist to}} supply sport fishermen. One {{study of a}} bait <b>fishery</b> <b>in</b> Florida that targets Hemiramphus brasiliensis and Hemiramphus balao suggests that despite increases {{in the size of}} the fishery the population is stable and the annual catch is valued at around $500,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Nanticoke Creek is {{designated as a}} Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory <b>Fishery.</b> <b>In</b> the 1970s, the Operation Scarlift report for the creek noted that the creek was almost entirely devoid of aquatic life due to low water quality. However, the creek had potential for fish life.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream {{with some}} {{wetlands}} in its watershed. Its relatively narrow watershed occupies parts of Scott Township, Blakely, Archbald, and Dickson City.

5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska <b>fishery.</b> <b>In</b> April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul <b>fishery</b> <b>in</b> {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.|$|E

Before the tsunami, there was stiff resistance from the local villages citing impact to <b>fishery</b> <b>in</b> the region. Post tsunami, the resistance from the locals receded and the project was extended to accommodate additional areas of the shore.|$|E

40|$|During 1986 - 2006, <b>fisheries</b> <b>in</b> Tonkin Gulf {{had made}} rapid development. Total engine power {{increased}} 11. 6 times while total catch only increased 2. 9 times. Big increase {{in number of}} fishing boats has resulted to the overexploitation in near shore waters since 1995 and this situation has been spread {{out all over the}} Gulf now. This paper give detail description of the current status of <b>fisheries</b> <b>in</b> Tonkin Gulf, dynamic trend in number of boats, catches, resources; and discuss relating issues such as capital, economic efficiency of key <b>fisheries</b> <b>in</b> Tonkin Gulf like trawl, purse seine, line <b>fishery</b> and others. <b>In</b> addition to that, fishery management issues toward sustainable development are also analyzed in deep. Analysis, evaluations on marine capture <b>fisheries</b> <b>in</b> Tonkin Gulf have been done with bio-economy model have been made. The study figures out the fact of over-fishing on the resources and the excess of fishing capacity in Tonkin Gulf...|$|R
5|$|Females {{can carry}} up to 680,000 eggs, which hatch after 10 weeks into flat phyllosoma larvae. These feed on {{plankton}} before the metamorphosis into the juvenile state. Adults are nocturnal and migratory, living among rocks at depths {{of up to}} , and feeding on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. The spiny lobster is eaten by various fish, octopuses and sea otters, but can defend itself with a loud noise produced by its antennae. The California spiny lobster {{is the subject of}} both commercial and recreational <b>fishery</b> <b>in</b> both Mexico and the United States, with sport fishermen using hoop nets and commercial fishermen using lobster traps.|$|E
5|$|G-Dragon {{has shown}} support for {{numerous}} charity organizations over the years, notably {{at the final}} concert of his world tour in 2013, a booth was erected, where fans could donate to build a <b>fishery</b> <b>in</b> Haiti, as a collaboration with YG Entertainment's With Campaign which he previously worked with {{to help build a}} school in Nepal. At the same event he and his fans from 14 different countries around the world donated a 9.9 tons rice, which was sent to help malnourished children, elderly living on their own, and other people in need. He's reportedly donated ₩81.8 million ($80,000 USD) every year on his birthday. G-Dragon donated ₩50 million ($43,400 USD) in 2011 (when fans donated under his name) and in 2012 (privately by himself) to Seoul National University Hospital to help children with diseases get treatment, it was revealed accidentally in 2017 as his name was engraved on a plaque honoring those who had contributed ₩100 million or more.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish <b>fishery</b> <b>in</b> the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial <b>fishery</b> <b>in</b> southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
