5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward and seize the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and {{on the west bank}} of the canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to {{the west bank of the}} canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence <b>gathering.</b> <b>The</b> Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, {{priests of}} {{different}} religious orders {{set out to}} evangelize the Americas, bringing Christianity to indigenous communities. Two of these missionary orders were the Franciscans and the Jesuits, both of which eventually arrived in the frontier town of Santa Cruz de la Sierra {{and then in the}} Chiquitania. The missionaries employed the strategy of <b>gathering</b> <b>the</b> often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called reductions in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy sprang from the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, who had to be protected and guided by European missionaries so as not to succumb to sin. Reductions generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European lifestyles and values; {{this was not the case}} in the Jesuit reductions, however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|James de Connick {{established}} the first breed {{standard for the}} French Spaniel in 1891. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of <b>gathering</b> <b>the</b> remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier {{as the president of the}} association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by <b>gathering</b> <b>the</b> seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, {{as well as}} various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
