5|$|Faced {{with the}} Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites.

50|$|Not surprisingly, the <b>homelands</b> were {{extremely}} unpopular among the urban black population, {{many of whom}} lived in squalor in slum housing. Their working conditions were often equally poor, as they were denied any significant rights or protections in South Africa proper. The allocation of individuals to specific <b>homelands</b> was often quite arbitrary. Many individuals assigned to <b>homelands</b> did not live in or originate from the <b>homelands</b> {{to which they were}} assigned, and the division into designated ethnic groups often took place on an arbitrary basis, particularly in the case of people of mixed ethnic ancestry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{role of the}} <b>homelands</b> was {{expanded}} in 1959 {{with the passage of}} the Bantu Self-Government Act, which set out a plan called [...] "Separate Development". This enabled the <b>homelands</b> to establish themselves as self-governing, quasi-independent states. This plan was stepped up under Verwoerd's successor as prime minister, John Vorster, as part of his [...] "enlightened" [...] approach to apartheid. However, the true intention of this policy was to fulfill Verwoerd's original plan to make South Africa's blacks nationals of the <b>homelands</b> rather than of South Africa—thus removing the few rights they still had as citizens. The <b>homelands</b> were encouraged to opt for independence, as this would greatly reduce the number of black citizens of South Africa. The process was completed by the Black <b>Homelands</b> Citizenship Act of 1970, which formally designated all black South Africans as citizens of the <b>homelands,</b> even if they lived in [...] "white South Africa", and cancelled their South African citizenship.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether and how a study of {{the costs and benefits of}} the <b>homelands</b> might be conducted. It is concluded that cost benefit studies of different designs are possible. As others previously have established beyond reasonable doubt, there are positive health benefits from <b>homelands</b> living. Current policy statements by governments regarding centralization of services (and inevitably populations) are a threat to this improved health and, in the current parlance surrounding Aboriginal health, risk widening the health gap rather than closing it. Compiling this report has involved examining in some detail the evidence that exists on the benefits in particular but also the costs of <b>homelands</b> living. There is solid evidence on the health benefits of the <b>homelands.</b> The evidence on the costs of the <b>homelands</b> is not as solid but it does suggest that they are not large and may even involve cost savings to governments. Strangely too the extent to which equity figures as a consideration in debating the <b>homelands</b> is largely absent. The paper argues that it ought not to be. Research for this report has unearthed no evidence to support those current government policies which threaten the existence of the <b>homelands</b> movement. An interim moratorium on policy action on the <b>homelands</b> is proposed until findings are available from the sorts of studies suggested in this report. Only then, once good evidence in a cost benefit framework is available, ought policy decisions be made about the future of the <b>homelands</b> movement...|$|R

5000|$|In 1959, the Bantu Self-Government Act {{established}} so-called <b>Homelands</b> (sometime pejoratively called Bantustans) for ten different black tribes. The {{ultimate goal}} of the NP was to move all Black South Africans {{into one of these}} <b>homelands</b> (although they might continue to work in South Africa as [...] "guest workers"), leaving what was left of South Africa (about 87 percent of the land area) with what would then be a White majority, at least on paper. As the <b>homelands</b> were seen by the apartheid government as embryonic independent nations, all black South Africans were registered as citizens of the <b>homelands,</b> not of the nation as a whole, and were expected to exercise their political rights only in the <b>homelands.</b> Accordingly, the three token parliamentary seats that had been reserved for white representatives of black South Africans in Cape Province were scrapped. The other three provinces - Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and Natal - had never allowed any black representation.|$|R
