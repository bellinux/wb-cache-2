5|$|While Moffat was {{creating}} the clockwork automata he first decided {{to hide their}} <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> wigs, but when producer Phil Collinson told him this would severely limit camera angles, {{and that it could}} appear comical, the androids were given carnival masks to wear. Neill Gorton of Millennium Effects designed the androids and they were constructed by Richard Darwen and Gustav Hoegan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between school anxiety and academic achievement of students. This study analyzed the relationship between school anxiety and academic achievement in a sample of 520 Spanish students from 12 to 18 years (M = 15. 38, SD = 1. 95). Results revealed that students with high performance in Spanish language (language and literature) had significantly higher scores in anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment, anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> aggression, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. Similarly, students with high performance in mathematics had significantly higher scores in anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment, anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> aggression and behavioral anxiety. Furthermore, students with academic success scored significantly higher in anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. However, students with school failure had significantly higher scores on anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> social evaluation. Finally, anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment {{was a significant predictor of}} high achievement in Spanish language (language and literature) and mathematics, whereas anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment and anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> social evaluation were significant predictors of overall academic success. Thus, the results indicate a higher academic performance of students who have certain fears school. These results could be used by teachers, school psychologists and clinical psychologists as an empirical basis to develop preventive and effective intervention of underachievement...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} dimensional stability properties of oriented strandboard (OSB) panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> fire retardant treated (FRT) veneers. The beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) veneers {{were treated with}} monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), lime water (LW), and a borax/boric acid (BX/BA) (1 : 1) mixture. Dimensional stability tests were performed according to ASTM D- 1037. The results revealed that <b>facing</b> veneers impregnated <b>with</b> fire-retardant chemicals had significant effects on the linear expansion (LE) properties. The lowest LE value {{was obtained from the}} panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> MAP treated veneers, while the highest LE value was found in the panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> BX/BA treated veneers. The FRT treated veneer facing technique also affected the thickness swelling (TS) properties of the OSB panels. The panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> LW treated veneers had the highest TS, whereas the panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> MAP treated veneers had the lowest TS values...|$|R
5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more <b>faces,</b> <b>with</b> available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E
5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E
5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the regular dodecahedron with the shape of the heavens and its twelve <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> the constellations of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.|$|E

5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
5|$|The former stables, in {{red brick}} with a tiled roof, were {{completed}} around 1636 and are contemporary with the Jacobean mansion; they are listed at grade II*. They form a quadrangle {{immediately to the}} west of the hall, enclosing a rectangular courtyard. The main east face of the quadrangle stands at right angles to the front of the house; it has nine bays of two storeys and an attic. Its centrepiece, added by Edward Blore in around 1837, consists of an arched stone entrance flanked by pilasters, above which a clock tower rises from the first-floor level. The tower features twinned arrow-slit windows and clock <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> stone surrounds, and is topped by a bell chamber and ogee cupola with finials. In addition to the centrepiece, the east face has four bays which are set forward and have shaped gables topped with finials. The north and south ends of this east building also have shaped gables.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E

The eastern hall is nicknamed Garmoshka (Garmon), because of its pylons (<b>faced</b> <b>with</b> yellowish marble) which look like a stretched accordion parallel to the length of the hall. The walls are <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a greyish marble and the floor with bright granite. Heritage of the station's original name, Ploshchad Nogina, can still be found midway in the transfer passage, where a bust of Viktor Nogin (sculptor Shlykov) still stands.|$|R
