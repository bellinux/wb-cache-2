I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair,Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.I long for Jeanie with the daydawn smile,Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile;I hear her melodies, like joys gone by,Sighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die:—Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,—Wailing for the lost one that comes not again:Oh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low,Never more to find her where the bright waters <b>flow.I</b> sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayedFar from the fond hearts round her native glade;Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown,Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone.Now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shoreWhile her gentle fingers will cull them no more:Oh! I sigh for Jeanie with the light brown hair,Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.|$|E

Barbora Valková Title: Modern fitness {{systems in}} {{outpatient}} physiotherapy Objectives: The main {{goal of this}} work is to describe a fitness systems that {{can be part of}} the therapy patients and to determine what these systems are used in physiotherapy. Methods: The research was conducted per a survey. I sent e-mails physiotherapists along with a request to fill. Regardless of the type of facility in which they work, age and length of experience. Survey consisted of two parts, demographic and special. Total survey questionnaire was completed by 137 physiotherapists. Results: The most commonly used system was Bosu. In addition to the described systems are still using TRX system, trampolines, functional circuit training and jungle. Other systems in the results are initially therapeutic systems and their use in fitness centers is low. They were also given access systems such as zumba, piloxing, cross fit, spinning and others. Their use during therapy did not show. Keywords: yoga, pilates, kettlebell, bosu, <b>flowi...</b>|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Mathematics and physicsThis is a Master's thesis in Physics, {{elaborated}} at the University of Stavanger in the 2014 Fall and 2015 Spring semesters, as partial {{accomplishment of}} the duties due in the Master Course in Mathematics and Physics. The need {{to model the}} challenges that arises from a three phase flow of liquid, gas and cuttings during a drilling operation, has led to several research in this topic. The challenges one would come across while modeling the flow scenario include, {{but are not limited}} to, Counter current <b>flow(i.</b> e heavy mud, cuttings that potentially move downwards, gas migrating upwards), transition to single-phase region, sharp gradients(between gas and liquid), expansion of gas at the top due to low pressure there, high fluid-solid interfacial drag force, high pressure gradient due increased fluid injection rate. Therefore, an e cient model which will seek to address the mentioned challenges is necessary. In this thesis, the use of the numeric Matlab software to generate simulations {{for the study of the}} flow scenario shows similar results to other literatures in multiphase flow.

Furthermore, the application of the unsteady thin a stator or inlet guide vane and a rotor, results unsteady fluctuating lift function which contains. functions as special cases. - Minimisation of the aerofoil theory to inia new generalised Sears and Hor 1 ock's resultant fluctuating ' lift leads to a design criterion for inlet guide vanes in agreement with the above conceptwhich is obtained by a different approach. The thesis also discusses a number of possible mathematical models for Cascade shear flow investígating their advantages and disadvantages and'the possibilities°of obtaining solutions. gA linearised theory for-_ nonuniform cascade flow is presented. i This fs'main 1 y an extension of Schlichting's method,`ref;(27) for uniform <b>flow,i</b> ' The main contribution of this work is the development of a nonlinear theory for nonuniform~cascade shear flow. â The. theory-accepts large amplitudes of distortion of any smooth shape, that is, cusps and 'g sharp corners in the Velocity distribution should be rounded. It is also capable of treating cascades of thick and highly cambered blades. The solution of Poisson's equation is obtained in the form of Fredholm'sV integral equation of the second kind which reduces to Martensen's equations, ref. (29), when the vorticity is zero everywhere in the flow field (clean flow).. The vorticity transport equation is satisfied in the flow field and its simultaneous solution with the solution of Poisson equation is carried out through an iteration process. Good agreement is obtained between the theoretical predictions and experimental test resul...|$|E
