40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} laparoscopic partial nephrectomy assisted by a water-cooled, high-density, monopolar device (TissueLink <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball).</b> Methods. Transperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy was performed without vascular control for four renal tumors in 3 patients. A flexible ultrasound probe was used to confirm tumor location and depth. Gerota’s fascia was opened distant from the tumor site. Renal fat was dissected from the renal parenchyma except for the fat overlying the tumor. The tumor resection area was marked 1 cm outside {{the boundaries of the}} tumor. After application of the TissueLink <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> at the planned surgical margin, the tumor was resected with cold laparoscopic scissors. Bleeding from the vessels of the divided renal parenchyma was controlled with the <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> if necessary. The specimen was sent for frozen section to confirm margin status. Results. Mean estimated blood loss per tumor was 275 mL. The dissection extended to the collecting system in 2 of 4 cases. In 1 patient, a minor postoperative urine leak resolved spontaneously. Conclusions. Use of the TissueLink <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> facilitated resection of small renal tumors without renal vascular control.

60|$|The {{best and}} fattest time would {{come when the}} {{hardening}} plant was no longer fit to eat and the flowers began to shed their seed. Each flower, in size like a small coffee-cup, would open out in a white mass and shed its scores of silvery balls, and these when freed of heavy seed would float aloft in the wind, and the whole air as far as one could see would be filled with millions and myriads of <b>floating</b> <b>balls.</b> The fallen seed was so abundant as to cover the ground under the dead but still standing plants.

50|$|Because the {{electrolyte}} takes {{part in the}} charge-discharge reaction, this battery has {{one major}} advantage over other chemistries.

40|$|Objectives: Flow ball {{devices have}} been used as {{teaching}} tools to provide visual real-time feedback of airflow during singing. This study aims at exploring static back pressure and ball height as function of flow for two devices, marketed as flow <b>ball</b> and <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> game. Study Design: This is a comparative descriptive study. Methods: A flow-driven vocal tract simulator was used to investigate the aerodynamic properties of these two devices, testing them for four different ball sizes. The flow range investigated was between 0 and 0. 5 [*]L/s. Audio, flow, pressure, and ball height were recorded. Results: The flow pressure profiles for both tested devices were similar to those observed in previous studies on narrow tubes. For lifting the ball, both devices had a flow and a pressure threshold. The tested <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> game required considerably higher back pressure for a given flow as compared with the flow ball. Conclusions: Both tested devices have similar effects on back pressure as straws of 3. 7 and 3. 0 [*]mm in diameter for the flow <b>ball</b> and the <b>floating</b> <b>ball</b> game, respectively. One might argue that both devices could be used as tools for practicing semi-occluded vocal tract exercises, with the additional benefit of providing real-time visual feedback of airflow during phonation. The flow threshold, combined with the flow feedback, would increase awareness of flow, rather than of pressure, during exercises using a flow ball device...|$|R

5000|$|The ball valve's ease of operation, repair, and {{versatility}} lend it to extensive industrial use, supporting pressures up to 1000 bar {{and temperatures}} up to 752 °F (400 °C), depending on design and materials used. Sizes typically range from 0.2 to 48 inches (0.5 cm to 121 cm). Valve bodies {{are made of}} metal, plastic, or metal with a ceramic; <b>floating</b> <b>balls</b> are often chrome plated for durability. One disadvantage of a ball valve is that they trap water in the center cavity while in the closed position. In {{the event of a}} freeze, the sides can crack due to expansion of ice forming.

5000|$|Eosapien (イオサピエンス) - Eosapiens are the sentient {{natives of}} Darwin IV in both Expedition and Alien Planet. The Eosapiens {{appear to be}} highly mobile, airborne, and semi-sentient. They possess limbs with tentacle-like fingers as well as claws, {{navigate}} with organic rudders, and use large sacs of methane to provide lift. Eosapiens have rudimentary intelligence roughly equivalent to that of our own early ancestors like Homo erectus. They carry spears and spikes for hunting. In the book, they dropped these weapons to make a cage around prey and then lift them away. They also seem to harvest the <b>floating</b> <b>balls</b> of gel the Amoebic Sea produces. The Eosapiens seemed to have gathered stones and arranged them in a circular pattern around Leo, like prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge. Their name means [...] "dawn thinker" [...] in Latin {{because of the time}} when Barlowe first encountered them. In Alien Planet they were one of only two species able to prey on Skewers, but they most often feed on Gill-heads. Leo was assaulted by an Eosapien shortly after trying to communicate with a Bladderhorn. A group of Eosapiens apparently interpreted a camera disk launched by Ike as a threat; the last image from the camera disk showed the Eosapiens flying away, carrying a limp Ike. The floating balloon probe resembles the floating Eosapiens, and the launch of the video disc was probably interpreted as throwing a weapon. This species differs in appearance in the book compared to Alien Planet. In Alien Planet, the Eosapiens fingers were made more tentacle-like and longer, and they increased the size of its bladders, had spears instead of spikes, their skin color (reddish-pink instead of blue-green, both had yellow biolights) and hunting strategies also differ from what is found in the book.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{analyzed}} the smoke plume produced by various energy-based laparoscopic instruments and de-termined {{its effect on}} laparoscopic visibility. Materials and Methods: The Bipolar Macroforceps, Harmonic Scalpel, <b>Floating</b> <b>Ball,</b> and Monopolar Shears were applied in vitro to porcine psoas muscle. An Aerodynamic Particle Sizer and Electrostatic Classifier pro-vided a size distribution of the plume for particles 500 nm and 500 nm, and a geometric mean particle size was calculated. A Condensation Particle Counter provided the total particle-number concentration. Elec-tron microscopy was used to characterize particle size and shape further. Visibility was calculated using the measured-size distribution data and the Rayleigh and Mie light-scattering theories. Results: The real-time instruments were successful in measuring aerosolized particle size distributions in two size ranges. Electron microscopy revealed smaller, homogeneous, spherical particles and larger, irregu-lar particles consistent with cellular components. The aerosol produced by the Bipolar Macroforceps obscured visibility the least (relative visibility 0. 887) among the instruments tested. Particles from the Harmonic Scalpel resulted in a relative visibility of 0. 801. Monopolar-based instruments produced plumes responsible for the poorest relative visibility (<b>Floating</b> <b>Ball</b> 0. 252; Monopolar Shears 0. 026). Conclusions: Surgical smoke is composed of two distinct particle populations caused by the nucleation of vapors as they cool (the small particles) and the entrainment of tissue secondary to mechanical aspects (the large particles). High concentrations of small particles are most responsible for the deterioration in laparo-scopic vision. Bipolar and ultrasonic instruments generate a surgical plume that causes the least deteriora-tion of visibility among the instruments tested...|$|R
