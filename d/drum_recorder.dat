50|$|Binson (Milan - Italy) was {{an early}} {{manufacturer}} of echo machines. Unlike most other analog echo machines, they used an analog magnetic <b>drum</b> <b>recorder</b> instead of a tape loop. Their most famous product was the Binson Echorec.|$|E
40|$|Some {{classical}} old-fashioned instruments (such as the Wood-Anderson seismometers), {{as well as}} some modern instruments (like the all-quartz made Verbaandert-Melchior tiltmeters), conventionally {{require an}} impractical recording system obtained by a photographic <b>drum</b> <b>recorder</b> in a darkroom. Simple electronic equipment (made by readily available, low cost electronics) may help in using such kind of instruments allowing a useful digital recording. This will reduce the time-hour in data acquisition and storage (and the manual error), and will increase the accuracy. The theory of operations and some results obtained using the described equipment are shown...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{duration}} magnitude MD we calculated local magnitude ML values of 288 earthquakes occurring from October 2002 to April 2003 at Mt. Etna. The analysis was computed at three digital stations of the permanent seismic network of Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia of Catania, using the relationship ML = logA+alog?-b, where A is maximum half-amplitude of the horizontal component of the seismic recording measured in mm and the term «+alog?-b» {{takes the place of}} the term «-logA 0 » of Richter relationship. In particular, a = 0. 15 for ?< 200 km, b= 0. 16 for ?< 200 km. Duration magnitude MD values, moment magnitude MW values and other local magnitude values were compared. Differences between ML and MD were obtained for the strong seismic swarms occurring on October 27, during the onset of 2002 - 2003 Mt. Etna eruption, characterized by a high earthquake rate, with very strong events (seismogram results clipped in amplitude on <b>drum</b> <b>recorder</b> trace) and high level of volcanic tremor, which not permit us to estimate the duration of the earthquakes correctly. ML and MD relationships were related and therefore a new relationship for MD is proposed. Cumulative strain release calculated after the eruption using ML values is about 1. 75 E+ 06 J 1 / 2 higher than the one calculated using MD values...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} music rooms {{with lots of}} {{instruments}} like pianos, flutes, kettle <b>drums,</b> <b>recorders,</b> and xylophones. Pupils have to study music theory too. Songs have to be learned by heart and performed on stage. Every student that wants to learn an instrument like the piano, recorder or flute can do so with the Big Band. The arts department have their own building at school, the k-building. There are many options to display drawings and paintings.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{instruments}} within the approach include miniature xylophones, marimbas, glockenspiels, and metallophones; {{all of which have}} removable bars, resonating columns to project the sound, and are easily transported and stored. Orff teachers also use different sized <b>drums,</b> <b>recorders,</b> and non- pitched percussion instruments [...] "to round out the songs that are sung and played". The Orff approach also requires that children sing, chant, clap, dance, pat, and snap fingers along to melodies and rhythms.|$|R
