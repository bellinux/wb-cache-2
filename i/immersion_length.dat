5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical <b>immersion</b> <b>length</b> would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of study on two topics, the electrokinetic effect in artificially fabricated porous membranes and the dissipation dynamics at the fluid-solid interface. The first topic involves the theoretical and experimental study of electroosmotic pump (EOP) and its reverse effect, the generation of streaming potential through a pressure gradient across a porous sample. We designed and fabricated samples with various fluid channel diameters. In particular, we use the Onsager relation to check the consistency of the two effects and to obtain a value for the surface conductivity of our samples. The results show that the efficiency of the EOP decreases with the increasing channel diameter, from 2. 5 μm to 4. 5 μm. This is opposite to the trend observed for samples with much smaller channel diameters fabricated on anodized aluminum oxide films. Thus there is an optimal diameter for achieving maximum efficiency in EOP, in agreement with the theoretical prediction that the best efficiency is at a Debye length that is on the order of 1 / 5 the diameter of the microchannel. We have also developed a digital approach to flow rate control in EOP, using pulsed voltage with varying duty cycles. This approach has shown much more stability and tunability at both high and low flow rates, thus making EOP better suited for various applications in micro total analysis systems (μTAS). The second part of the thesis involves simulation support {{to the development of a}} new interfacial microrheology technique using atomic force microscope (AFM) as a force sensor. The probe used for microrheology contains a long vertical glass fiber with one end glued onto a rectangular shaped cantilever beam and the other end immersed through a water-air interface. The motion of the modified cantilever can be accurately described by the Langevin equation for a damped harmonic oscillator, from which we obtain the friction coefficient ξ of the glass fiber in contact with the water. It is found that ξ contains two contributions. One is generated by the bulk fluid, which increases with the <b>immersion</b> <b>length</b> of the glass fiber. The other contribution comes from the contact line between the water-air interface and the glass fiber, which is obtained by a linear extrapolation of the measured ξ at the limit of zero <b>immersion</b> <b>length.</b> The experiment thus demonstrates an application of AFM in the studies of interfacial microrheology and contact line dynamics. The numerical results are in excellent agreement with experimental data...|$|E

Changes in dimensions, settling velocity and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) leached from commercial feed pellets was investigated after soaking.

For feed pellets, water temperature significantly affected the speed of the process and the time at which the maximum TAN leached was reached, but did not influence the maximum TAN leached. Leaching was related to feed pellet size, so the smaller the pellet, the higher the leaching. TAN leaching from faecal pellets was greater per unit weight than in feed pellets.

Gourami (Osphronemus Gouramy) {{scales are}} one of the natural sources of {{collagen}}. This fish scale 2 ̆ 7 s collagen has functional properties, such as bio-degradable (easily decomposed), bio-compatible (compatible with surrounding tissue), and potential as bio-adsorbent. The absorbent properties of collagen are currently used as a transport material in local drug delivery for periodontal disease treatment, which is known as tetracycline chip. However, this chip is made of synthetic collagen so it is not absorbable by the body 2 ̆ 7 s system. The price is also expensive. This study 2 ̆ 7 s aim is to prove the potency of Gourami scales as a source of collagen in medical treatment, especially as a transport material of tetracycline for periodontal disease treatment. The gourami scale was obtained from seafood restaurant in Jember, Jawa Timur. About 500 mg of gourami scales was immersed into 20 ml tetracycline solution in beaker glass. About 200 μl solution from the beaker glass was taken with micropipette after 1 -hour, 2 -hour, 4 -hour, 12 -hour and 24 -hour after immersed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Sex {{differentiation}} in fish is a labile {{process that}} allows sex inversion in several species. The inherent capacity of fish germ cells to differentiate into oocytes or spermatocytes constitutes {{a key factor}} allowing for functional sex inversion. This thesis set out to determine the mechanism involved in steroid-induced sex differentiation of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, by searching for differential expression of unique genes during the process. In addition, the studies documented the persistence of methyltestosterone (MT) in the environment after oral administration, and investigated the capabilities of short-term immersions in steroids for masculinizing tilapia fry as an alternative method. A significant leakage of MT to the rearing water and its subsequent accumulation in the sediments was detected after oral administration of the steroid. In addition, evidence was found for a significant effect of environmental conditions on the masculinizing efficacy of oral administration of steroids. Low levels of masculinization were obtained when MT was allowed {{to remain in the}} system. Results from short-term immersions in steroids indicated that the labile period for masculinization by immersion of Nile tilapia fry reared at 28 °C occurs between 11 and 16 days post fertilization (dpf). Two three-hour immersions in trenbolone acetate at 11 and 13 dpf yielded the highest number of males. Time of <b>immersion,</b> <b>length</b> of the treatment, dosage, density, solvent vehicle, and number of immersions significantly affected the outcome of immersion trials. Heterogeneity of developmental stages, developmental rate, and sensitivity of progeny to steroids may play important roles in the efficacy of immersion treatments. The expression of unique mRNAs during the process of sex inversion was identified through the use of suppression subtractive hybridization. This technique allowed for the sequencing of 165 clones from which 61 proteins have been identified. A significant number of these genes seem related to the anabolic effects of trenbolone acetate. In addition, 12 genes were identified that are related to reproductive tissues; seven of which have unique or enriched expression in the testes. Some of the genes and protein products that have been identified are linked to gonadal development and testicular protein synthesis in other species...|$|E

25|$|Two {{types of}} A-scan {{ultrasound}} biometry {{are currently in}} use. The first is contact applanation biometry. This technique requires placing an ultrasound probe on the central cornea. While this is a convenient way to determine the axial length for most normal eyes, errors in measurement almost invariably result from the probe indenting the cornea and shallowing the anterior chamber. Since the compression error is variable, it cannot be compensated for by a constant. IOL power calculations using these measurements will lead to an overestimation of the IOL power. In shorter eyes, this effect is amplified. The second type is immersion A-scan biometry, which requires placing a saline filled scleral shell between the probe and the eye. Since the probe does not exert direct pressure on the cornea, compression of the anterior chamber is avoided. A mean shortening of 0.25–0.33mm has been reported between applanation and <b>immersion</b> axial <b>length</b> measurements, which can translate into an error of IOL power by approximately 1 D. In general, immersion biometry {{has been shown to}} be more accurate than contact applanation biometry in several studies. The main limitation with the A-scan ultrasound is the poor image resolution due to the use of a relatively long, low-resolution wavelength (10MHz) to measure a relatively short distance. In addition, variations in retinal thickness surrounding the fovea contribute to inconsistency in the final measurement.|$|R

30|$|Calculating the IOL {{power is}} always a {{challenge}} in pediatric eyes due to the changing axial lengths and anterior chamber depths of growing eyes, especially in children less than 2  years of age [34]. Children with uveitis, especially JIA–uveitis, usually require cataract surgery around 9.8  years of age (range 4 to 10  years, mean 6  years) [6]. By this age, healthy eyes are sufficiently grown for appropriate IOL measurement. However, in uveitic eyes, {{there are a number}} of factors that interfere with surgery planning such as band-shaped keratopathy affecting keratometry readings, posterior synechiae affecting anterior chamber depth, and hypotony and epiretinal membranes affecting axial length measurements.

60|$|Curare.--One part of {{this famous}} poison was added to 218 of water, and three leaves were {{immersed}} in ninety minims of the filtered solution. In 3 hrs. 30 m. some of the tentacles were a little inflected; as was the blade of one; after 4 hrs. After 7 hrs. the glands were wonderfully blackened, showing that matter of some kind had been absorbed. In 9 hrs. two of the leaves had most of their tentacles sub-inflected, but the inflection did not increase {{in the course of}} 24 hrs. One of these leaves, after being immersed for 9 hrs. in the solution, was placed in water, and by next morning had largely re-expanded; [page 205] the other two, after their immersion for 24 hrs., were likewise placed in water, and in 24 hrs. were considerably re-expanded, though their glands were as black as ever. Half-minims were placed on the discs of six leaves, and no inflection ensued; but after three days the glands on the discs appeared rather dry, yet to my surprise were not blackened. On another occasion drops were placed on the discs of six leaves, and a considerable amount of inflection was soon caused; but as I had not filtered the solution, floating particles may have acted on the glands. After 24 hrs. bits of meat were placed on the discs of three of these leaves, and next day they became strongly inflected. As I at first thought that the poison might not have been dissolved in pure water, one grain was added to 437 grains of a mixture of one part of alcohol to seven of water, and half-minims were placed on the discs of six leaves. These were not at all affected, and when after a day bits of meat were given them, they were slightly inflected in 5 hrs., and closely after 24 hrs. It follows from these several facts that a solution of curare induces a very moderate degree of inflection, and this may perhaps be due to the presence of a minute quantity of albumen. It certainly is not poisonous. The protoplasm in one of the leaves, which had been immersed for 24 hrs., and which had become slightly inflected, had undergone a very slight amount of aggregation--not more than often ensues from an <b>immersion</b> of this <b>length</b> of time in water.|$|R

MÉTODOS: Pacientes com catarata foram submetidos aos exames em 3 biômetros distintos (IOLMaster®, Axis II® e Humphrey Mod. 820 ®), antes da cirurgia para implantação da lente intra-ocular acomodativa de {{silicone}} (C&C Vision AT- 45). No biômetro Humphrey Mod. 820 utilizou-se a técnica de contato e o Axis II foi usado para as técnicas de contato e imersão. O método de interferometria óptica foi realizado pelo IOLMaster. O comprimento axial (AL), profundidade da câmara anterior (ACD) e a ceratometria corneana (K) foram os parâmetros oculares analisados. RESULTADOS: Foram submetidos aos exames 34 pacientes com média de idade de 70, 6 anos e idade variando entre 53 e 90 anos. A menor média do comprimento axial (23, 12 mm), foi obtida no Axis II (contato) e maior (23, 21 mm) no Humphrey Mod. 820 (contato). A maior média da profundidade da câmara anterior (3, 10 mm) no IOLMaster e a menor (2, 97 mm) no Humphrey Mod. 820 (contato). A reprodutibilidade para os dados de comprimento axial foi significativamente grande para todos os biômetros [3, 02 %, 3, 07 % e 3, 19 % respectivamente para Humphrey Mod. 820 e Axis II (imersão), Axis II (contato) e IOLMaster]. Os biômetros foram extremamente concordantes nas medidas dos parâmetros analisados (99, 01 % e 94, 77 % respectivamente para o comprimento axial e ceratometria corneana).

PURPOSE: To compare reproducibility, {{level of}} agreement and correlation of two ultrasonic biometers and one optical biometer for the calculation of accommodative intraocular lens. METHODS: Cataract patients were submitted to the examination with 3 different biometers (IOLMaster, Axis II and Humphrey Mod. 820) before the implant of the C&C Vision AT- 45 accommodative silicone intraocular lens. The Axis II biometer was used for both contact and <b>immersion</b> biometry. Axial <b>length,</b> anterior chamber depth and keratometry were the analyzed biometric parameters. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients from 53 to 90 years old (mean 70. 6 y) were submitted to the examination with the three different biometers. The lowest mean axial length (23. 12 mm) was obtained with the Axis II/contact and the highest (23. 21 mm) with the Humphrey biometer. The lowest mean anterior chamber depth (2. 97 mm) was obtained with the Humphrey and the highest (3. 10 mm) with the IOLMaster. Reproducibility for axial length was high for all the biometers tested (coefficient of variation: 3. 02 % for Humphrey and Axis II / immersion; 3. 07 % for Axis II/contact and 3. 19 % for IOLMaster). All biometers presented nearly equal results of the analyzed parameters (99. 01 % for axial length and 94. 77 % for anterior chamber depth).
