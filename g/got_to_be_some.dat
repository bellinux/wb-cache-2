The writers did not intentionally tone down their material as they knew that Lucasfilm would inform them of any items unsuitable for broadcast.

But, said I, suppose the victor should decline to accept his spoil? She said that that wouldn't answer--he must. He couldn't decline; it wouldn't be regular. I made a note of that.

5000|$|Initially, {{the song}} had six versions, as Mars called its {{original}} demo a [...] "poolside version", {{which had a}} [...] "pi√±a colada vibe" [...] and contained lyrics such as [...] "fly through a storm on a unicorn ...

5000|$|At {{the same}} press conference, Shakira {{explained}} the tour's name as symbolizing {{the strength of}} the mongoose, stating [...] "...I was really impressed by it because it is an animal that can defeat the snake with just a bite.

[...] "It's called the Tour of the Mongoose, and the mongoose is basically one of the few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite and that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because I think that if we all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle."

6000|$|Kuttenberg, Czaslau, Chotusitz and {{all these}} other places lie in what is called the Valley of the Elbe, but what to the eye has not the least {{appearance}} of a hollow, but of an extensive plain rather, dimpled here and there; and, if anything, rather sloping FROM the Elbe,--were it not that dull bushless brooks, one or two, sauntering to NORTHward, not southward, warn you of the contrary. Conceive a flat tract of this kind, some three or four miles square, with Czaslau on its southern border, Chotusitz on its northern; flanked, on the west, by a straggle of Lakelets, ponds and quagmires (which in our time are drained away, all but a tenth part or so of remainder); flanked, on the east, by a considerable puddle of a Stream called the Dobrowa; and cut in the middle by a nameless poor Brook ("BRTLINKA" [...] some write it, if anybody could pronounce), running parallel and independent,--which latter, of more concernment to us here, springs beyond Czaslau, and <b>is</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of <b>some</b> size, and more intricate than usual, with [...] "islands" [...] and the like, as it passes Chotusitz (a little to east of Chotusitz);--this is our Field of Battle.

6000|$|The captain gave {{a kind of}} sobbing laugh, {{and went}} on in a lower tone. [...] "Well, I know you ain't going back.

But when I went around here and saw how everything was, and remembered how it was at home, I just said, 'She'll stay on the ship.' Now, that's all I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say, though I thought I had a lot more. I guess it'll be enough for these folks, and they can judge between us."

He plainly expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lynched, and his wife screamed out, [...] "Oh, don't hurt him! He isn't a bad man!" [...] But it was only the Altrurian way with a guilty person: they wanted to let him know how sorry they were for him, and since his sin had found him out how hopeful they were for his redemption. I had to explain it to the sailors as well as to the captain and his wife, but I don't believe any of them quite accepted the fact.|$|R
