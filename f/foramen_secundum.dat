50|$|The septum primum is on {{the left}} side of the heart in the left atrium while the septum secundum is much thicker and is located on the right side, in the right atrium. During development, blood shunts from the floor of the right atrium through the foramen ovale in the septum secundum then up through the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> in the septum primum. The <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> is {{positioned}} so that blood exits in the ceiling of the left atrium and then out through the left ventricle and the aorta. The position of the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> and the size of the septum primum are crucial to ensuring that blood not flow backwards from the left atrium to the right atrium. The septum primum, being much thinner, is easily pressed against the septum secundum if blood attempts to flow in the reverse direction, effectively sealing off both the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> and the foramen ovale.|$|E
50|$|An ostium secundum that {{persists}} {{at large}} size {{can be a}} source of atrial septal defects. <b>Foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> atrial septal defects are the most common atrial septal defects. This defect can arise as a result of defects of the septum primium and the septum secundum. For the septum primum, the problem can arise as a result of excess resorption of the septum during the process of apoptosis in order to form the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum.</b> For the septum secundum, its inadequate growth can cause atrial septal defect since it is supposed to grow and eventually overlap the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> so as to form the oval foramen.|$|E
50|$|The <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum,</b> or ostium secundum, is a foramen (opening) in the septum primum, a {{precursor}} to the interatrial septum of the embryological heart.|$|E
50|$|This opening {{is closed}} by {{the union of}} the septum primum with the septum intermedium, and the {{communication}} between the atria is re-established through an opening which is developed in {{the upper part of}} the septum primum; this opening is known as the <b>foramen</b> ovale (ostium <b>secundum</b> of Born) and persists until birth.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fetal}} heart, the foramen ovale (...) , also <b>foramen</b> Botalli, ostium <b>secundum</b> of Born or falx septi, allows blood {{to enter the}} left atrium from the right atrium. It {{is one of two}} fetal cardiac shunts, the other being the ductus arteriosus (which allows blood that still escapes to the right {{ventricle}} to bypass the pulmonary circulation). Another similar adaptation in the fetus is the ductus venosus. In most individuals, the foramen ovale closes at birth. It later forms the fossa ovalis.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} congenital heart defects (CHDs) in patients with mild or severe congenital anorectal malformations (CARMs), and whether all patients with CARM need pediatric cardiology screening. Study design We included 129 patients with CARM born between 2004 and 2013, and referred to University Medical Center Groningen. Recto-perineal and recto-vestibular fistulas were classified as mild CARMs, all others as severe. Significant patent <b>foramen</b> ovale, <b>secundum</b> atrial septal defect, and small ventricular septum defect were classified as minor CHDs, all others as major. Results Of 129 patients with CARM, 67 % had mild CARM, 33 % severe CARM, and 17 % were additionally diagnosed with CHD. CHDs were distributed equally in patients with mild or severe CARMs. Patients with multiple congenital abnormalities were more frequently diagnosed with CHD (n = 16, 36 %) than patients without multiple congenital malformations (n = 5, 9 %, P =. 001). Patients with CARM diagnosed with CHD using pediatric cardiac echo screening were younger than 3 months of age at diagnosis. Earlier general pediatric examinations missed 7 (50 %) children with mild and 4 (50 %) with severe CHDs. Conclusions The severity of CARM could predict neither prevalence nor severity of CHD. More than one-half of CHDs were missed during the first physical examination. No new CHDs were found in patients older than 3 months of age at the time CARMs were diagnosed. We recommend screening all patients with CARM younger than 3 months of age for CHD at the time CARM is diagnosed. Preoperative echocardiography should be the rule in children younger than 3 months of age and with multiple congenital anomalies...|$|R
50|$|If {{surgery is}} required, it is {{performed}} using minimally invasive techniques via robotic surgery that often requires {{only a few days}} of hospital stay. Surgical intervention should result in full closure of the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum,</b> and mortality rates are similar to those for general anesthesia. The repair can be made by suturing the atrial septum or, if the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> is large in size, a patch can be made from the patient's pericardium to fully separate each atrium. The synthetic material Dacron may also be used to create a repair patch.|$|E

50|$|There is {{at present}} no drug therapy for <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> atrial septal defects, {{although}} infective endocarditis is a postoperative concern. To prevent this condition, a prophylactic {{is used for}} {{six months after the}} operation.|$|E
50|$|Inserting a {{catheter}} {{has proven to}} be a safe and successful method for closing the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> in children. This method avoids the symptoms that accompany most ostium secundum atrial septal defects. The catheter is inserted into the femoral vein in the leg and moved into place in the atrial septum. Transesophageal echocardiography is accepted as the method to monitor this procedure which, when performed correctly, has shorter recovery times than surgical intervention. Complications of catheter insertion often include nausea and vomiting, blood vessel obstruction, pain, and hemorrhage. The most common problem with this preventive measure is the incomplete closing of the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum.</b>|$|E
50|$|Newborns {{with small}} <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> atrial septal defects {{have been shown}} to spontaneously correct by the third or fourth year of life. Therefore, medical {{supervision}} is generally accepted as a preventive measure for those diagnosed in infancy, rather than surgical intervention or use of other medical devices.|$|E
50|$|To provide proper {{blood flow}} as a newborn, the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> and foramen ovale must close at birth. Since the lungs now require a {{significant}} amount of blood flow, the vessels going to and from the lungs undergo dilation. While the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins are dilating, the umbilical artery and umbilical vein are severed at the cutting of the umbilical cord, or the funiculus umbilicalis. This combination results in a reversal of pressure differences between the atria, and the septum primum is permanently forced against the septum secundum. This holds true even during atrial diastole, when the pressure is significantly less than atrial systole.|$|E
50|$|During development, the atria {{initially}} share {{a common}} chamber. As the two begin to separate, the septum is not fully formed to allow blood shunting from the right to left atrium in order for blood to bypass the lungs. The septum primum and spina vestibuli grow together to divide {{the right and left}} atria during the fifth week of development. This results {{in the formation of the}} foramen primum. The septum primum continues to grow until the sixth week when the dorsal and ventral cushions fuse to form the atrioventricular septum. The fusion process closes the foramen primum via controlled cell death (apoptosis), and several smaller perforations come together to form the <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum.</b> The perforations form before the foramen primum closes completely, ensuring the shunting process continues at all stages.|$|E
50|$|The {{primitive}} atrium {{is divided}} in two by joining of several structures. From {{the roof of}} the primitive atrium descends the septum primum, which grows towards the endocardial cushions within the atrial canal. Right before the septum primum fuses with the endocardial cushions there's a temporary space called the foramen primum. Once they fuse a new opening forms {{in the middle of the}} septum primum called the ostium secundum or <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum.</b> To the right of the septum primum and also coming down from {{the roof of the}} primitive atrium, descends a semilunar-shaped partition called the septum secundum. The free edges of the septum secundum produce an orifice called foramen ovale, which closes after birth when the septum primum and secundum fuse to each other completing the formation of the atrial septum.|$|E
50|$|Many {{patients}} with a <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum</b> that persists into adulthood will remain asymptomatic throughout their lives. A mortality rate of less than one tenth of one percent is expected if the operation is performed correctly. Some argue that if the operation is performed before eight years of age, few cardiac abnormalities such as cardiac dysrhythmia are expected later in life. Others argue that the operation can take place as late as age 24, to limit cardiac complications in middle age or later. Some sources have argued that mitral regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse are common after age 40, if the ostium secundum is not repaired by age 24. Operative closure of atrial septal defects after age 40, {{and the ability to}} diminish symptoms at all remains controversial. Some data does suggest that even after that age, symptoms can be alleviated via surgical intervention, including prevention of Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and other associated cardiac abnormalities.|$|E

40|$|Previously {{the author}} {{undertook}} the investigation {{on the early}} stages of development of the heart of the birds and published the results. On the later stages of development of the heart, the mode of formation of the interatrial septum is very complicated so that many investigators failed to reach the same conclusion hither-to-fore. Consequently Prof. Shikinami gave me the problem on the first appearance and the further developmental stages of the interatrial septum, especially its fenestration using the pig embryos. First an attempt was made to ascertain if the reports published in the literature on the formation of the interatrial septum is correct or not. As the material, the pig embryos were used. A large majority of them were fixed in Zenker's fluid, and stained with borax carmine. After the subsequent treatment in the usual manner, these specimen were embedded in paraffin, trimmed and cut in transverse serial sections with a thickness of ten microns. A number of models were prepared according to Born-Peter's method of wax-plate reconstruction. From the results of my experiments, the following summary and conclusions may be made: 1) The interatrial septum is first formed in an embryo 45 mm. in greatest length with 23 - 24 somites on the vault of the atrium in the median line, and it is a little more eminent on the ventral than on the dorsal side. 2) The interatrial septum is first formed by the cessation of the development of the heart wall along the median line, and then it grows up to the atrial canal by the actual protrusion of the part formed by the endothelial proliferation. 3) The interventricular septum is first formed in an embryo 4, 0 mm. in greatest length with 24 - 25 somites. 4) The interatrial septum is first perforated with several small openings (interatrial <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum)</b> in an embryo 6. 0 mm. in length with 45 somites. 5) These openings increase in both their numbers and sizes, and are confluent in a single opening at first in an embryo 7. 0 mm. in length. 6) The closure of the interatrial foramen primum is completed in an embryo 6. 5 mm. in length. It is a little later than the first appearance of the interatrial <b>foramen</b> <b>secundum.</b> 7) The partition of the chambers of the heart except the interatrial septum is accomplished in an embryo 17. 0 mm. in length...|$|E
