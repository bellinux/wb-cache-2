40|$|Abstract — Many {{problems}} involve joint <b>decision</b> <b>and</b> estima-tion, where {{qualities of}} <b>decision</b> <b>and</b> estimation affect each other. This paper proposes an integrated approach {{based on a}} new Bayes risk, which is a generalization of those for <b>decision</b> <b>and</b> estimation separately. Theoretical results of the optimal joint <b>decision</b> <b>and</b> estimation that minimizes the new Bayes risk are presented. The power of the new approach is illustrated by applications in target tracking and classification...|$|R

25|$|A {{basic problem}} with this {{explanation}} is that the Serrano <b>decision</b> <b>and</b> school finance equalization were actually quite popular among California voters. It is true that Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance, but Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the Serrano <b>decision,</b> <b>and</b> on average they were typically supportive of both the Serrano <b>decision</b> <b>and</b> of school finance equalization.|$|R

5|$|The amended Constitution of Singapore also {{provided}} for a Council of Ministers {{appointed by the}} Governor upon {{the recommendation of the}} Chief Minister, consisting of three unelected Official Members and six Elected Members.

5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's <b>decisions</b> <b>and</b> orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the <b>decisions</b> <b>and</b> orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E

5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring <b>decisions</b> <b>and</b> for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E

The third part, published in the same year, was also chronological, while the fourth, published in 1604, was arranged by subject. The fifth part, published in 1605, is arranged similarly, as is the sixth, published in 1607. Five more volumes were published until 1615, but Coke died before he could publish a single bound copy. No trace has been found of the draft manuscript.|$|E
