5|$|With {{the arrival}} of Historicism in the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> special {{importance}} was attached to high standards of craftsmanship and proper use of materials. This {{can be seen in}} Copenhagen's University Library (1861) designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt and inspired by St Fermo's Church in Verona.|$|E
5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies {{and so a}} rival Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These would make capital available for business and the improvement of roads and trade, which would help create the conditions for the Industrial Revolution that accelerated in the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

5|$|During most of {{the medieval}} period, Iberia was divided between Christian and Islamic kingdoms, neither of which {{traditionally}} built keeps, instead building watchtowers or mural towers. By the 12th century, however, the influence of France and the various military orders was encouraging the development of square keeps in Christian castles across the region, and by the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> this practice was spread across into the Islamic kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during {{the first decades of}} the 20th century. In the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns over its radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|From a {{population}} of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971. Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock. Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s. As air travel grew in the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> aircraft manufacturers built factories. The unsuccessful Bristol International Exhibition was held on Ashton Meadows in the Bower Ashton area in 1914. After the premature closure of the exhibition the site was used, until 1919, as barracks for the Gloucestershire Regiment during World War I.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone and convert {{existing}} timber designs. This was initially a slow process, picking up speed towards the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> Traditionally this transition was {{believed to have been}} driven by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's {{successor}} in 1842 was Richard Harrington, who {{inherited a}} college in good shape: income was around £15,000; only Christ Church was significantly bigger in size. Academic reforms, {{particularly with regard}} to examinations– which were to be administered by the university, rather than the college– were instituted across Oxford in the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> Brasenose's proportion of first-class degrees fell sharply from its previous peak. By 1850, no matriculation exam was instituted at Brasenose, as at other colleges, although the other examinations were altered: responsions moved forward and moderations instituted. Brasenose, like the University, was yet to truly reform the range of subjects studied, however. It was only in 1849 that modern sciences were only given a separate School (and thus examination) in 1849; law and modern history a year later.|$|E
5|$|In 1232 {{the castle}} was {{inherited}} by John's son, William de Braose, {{and in turn}} his son, also called William. In the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> Wales saw a renewal of fighting, and the castle was attacked again in 1251. The decision was taken to improve the castle's defences and, as part of this, a square, stone tower {{was added to the}} castle to provide living accommodation, with three chambers, the first floor containing a garderobe and a fireplace. A gateway was constructed through the curtain wall just to the south of the tower. Two further stone buildings were constructed within the castle walls.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} rebuilt between <b>the</b> second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12th <b>century</b> and <b>the</b> first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th <b>century,</b> being linked to <b>the</b> first phase <b>of</b> Toledan Mudéjar.|$|R

5|$|In {{disputes}} {{prior to}} the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 {{by the forces of}} Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malmö and Lübeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development. The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> {{the ideas of}} {{population}} genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, sociobiology, and, especially in humans, evolutionary psychology. In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an evolutionary perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of adaptationism and contingency in evolutionary theory.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century revived {{interest}} in Cofresí's piracy {{as a tourist}} attraction, with municipalities in Puerto Rico highlighting their historical connection to the pirates. By the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a resort town was named after the pirate. Cofresí's name has been commercialized, {{with a number of}} products and businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico's first flag carrier seaplane was named for him. Several {{attempts have been made to}} portray Cofresí's life on film, based on legend.|$|E

5|$|The Kirk had {{considerable}} {{control over the}} lives of the people, with {{a major role in the}} Poor Law and schools and over the morals of the population. Strict Sabbatarianism was vital to Presbyterianism. The sermon was seen as central and the only participation by the congregation the singing of the psalms. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals as part of a communion season. In the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> there were a series of reforms of church music connected to a choir movement. Episcopalians installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches. Catholic worship was deliberately low key, with musical accompaniment prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{portrait}} {{painter of}} the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> was Henry Raeburn (1756–1823). He was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers, adding elements of Romanticism to the Grand Manner tradition of Joshua Reynolds. The most famous painting attributed to him is The Reverend Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, known as The Skating Minister. He became a knight in 1822 and the King's painter and limner in 1823, marking {{a return to the}} post being associated with the production of art.|$|E
5|$|The {{urban growth}} of Southampton, {{as in many}} English walled towns and cities, put {{considerable}} pressure on the older fortifications. In 1898 to 1899, for example, parts of the wall west of Biddles Gate, including a square tower, were demolished to create the Western Esplanade road. By the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the Bargate and the surrounding walls were creating serious traffic congestion; various options were considered to relieve this including demolition, {{but it was not}} until the 1930s that the decision was made to retain the gatehouse, but to destroy the walls on either side.|$|E

5|$|Without Mikan, the Lakers {{made the}} playoffs, but {{were unable to}} reach the 1955 NBA Finals. In {{the middle of the}} 1955–56 NBA season, Mikan {{returned}} to the Lakers lineup. He played in 37 games, but his long absence had affected his play. He averaged only 10.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists, and the Lakers lost {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. At the end of the season, Mikan retired for good. His 10,156 points were a record at the time; he was the first NBA player to score 10,000 points in a career.

5|$|Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman {{were the}} leading {{portrait}} {{artists of the}} first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720. His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of George Drummond the Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1756), who had {{been responsible for the}} creation of the New Town in Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary, which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of John Campbell of the Bank (1749), who was chief cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Whig, but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland Dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} century, St. Aidan (died 651) went from Iona {{to found a}} church at Lindisfarne off {{the east coast of}} Northumbria. The {{influence}} of Lindisfarne would spread through the kingdom of Northumbria into what is now south-east Scotland. However, in the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the Northumbrian church was increasingly influenced by the Roman form of Christianity. The careers of St. Wilfred (active from the 660s until his death in 709), abbot of the monastery at Ripon and Bishop of Northumbria, and Benedict Biscop (c. 628–690), founder of the monasteries of Jarrow and Wearmouth, intensified ties with Rome. A bishopric established at Abercorn in the region of West Lothian, is presumed to have adopted Roman forms of Christianity after the Synod of Whitby in 664, at which King Oswiu of Northumbria accepted the arguments for Roman authority and practices. However, the Pictish victory at the Battle of Dunnichen in 685 ended the Northumbrian dominance of the region and the bishop and his followers were ejected.|$|E
