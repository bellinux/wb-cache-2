5|$|The Comilla Model (1959) was Khan's {{initiative}} {{in response to}} the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development. Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation. Initially, the aim was to provide a <b>development</b> <b>model</b> of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the Ford Foundation, and USAID. Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringAs {{industries}} grow in {{size and}} complexity, the demand for software increases. The success of a software product is determined by its quality, which can be improved by introducing new and more efficient <b>development</b> <b>models.</b> The three major aspects of concern in software quality are cost, time, and ability to meet requirements. Conventional and contemporary software <b>development</b> <b>models</b> allow for a tradeoff among these aspects. In this research, a new model that integrates two traditional software <b>development</b> <b>models</b> to achieve desired levels of quality is proposed. This integrated quality software <b>development</b> (IQSD) <b>model</b> builds on the advantages of both the prototyping and waterfall models and eliminates their cited limitations.

In the case of successful socio-economic and socio-political <b>development,</b> <b>models</b> adopted have conformed to the paradigms held by the majority of the citizenry, to their cultural values and the informal institutions that underpin their sense making. This paper develops a theoretical framework to better identify potential trajectories of economic development in emerging countries. It draws on Trivers' theory of Reciprocal Altruism from Evolutionary Biology, Berry's Ecocultural Framework from Cross-cultural Psychology and North‟s framework for analysing economic and institutional change from New Institutional Economics. The framework is used to guide an exploratory empirical examination into how <b>development</b> <b>models</b> adopted in eight Asian polities influence the use of guanxi (relationships) to manage opportunism and reduce search and transaction costs. The findings indicate the nature and practice of guanxi varies from polity to polity, dependent on the <b>development</b> <b>models</b> adopted...|$|R

The sustainable <b>development</b> <b>model</b> for the mining and energy sectors began in 1993 with regulations and procedures for the gradual reduction of pollution, which include economic development policies and environmental protection. The mining industry must comply by adjusting its ongoing operations to permissible effluent levels and its new operations by using cleaner technologies. The DGAA evaluates and proposes the environmental regulations for the mining and energy sectors, which include the maximum emission levels that are compatible with the internationally accepted limits set by the United Nations and the World Bank, approves environmental impact assessments for new operations and environmental adjustment and management programs for ongoing ones, and administers the national environmental information system. The MEM is authorized to manage environmental affairs in the minerals sector, such as establishing the environmental protection policy and maximum allowable levels for effluents, signing environmental administrative stability agreements, overseeing the impact of operations determining responsibilities, and imposing administrative sanctions.

This article reports the findings of a project aimed at investigating the range of eLearning staff <b>development</b> <b>models</b> and their effectiveness in New Zealand tertiary education. The foci for the research were: the range of staff <b>development</b> <b>models</b> offered by a sample of New Zealand tertiary providers; how staff <b>development</b> <b>models</b> prepared academic staff for eLearning and the relationship to self-efficacy and why some models were more effective than others. A range of methodologies were used- focus groups, one-to-one interviews, questionnaires and case studies.

Further discussions among community residents, community-serving organizations, governments, and businesses should be conducted to further explore and validate the notions presented. Although a number of regional <b>development</b> <b>models</b> have been utilized throughout rural communities in Canada and internationally, gathering evaluative information on these models can be challenging.
