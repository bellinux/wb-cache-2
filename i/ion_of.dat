The Ga3+ <b>ion</b> <b>of</b> soluble gallium salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected in large doses; precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in renal toxicity in animals. In lower doses, soluble gallium is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison, instead being excreted mostly through urine.

25|$|Ionisation isomerismnbsp&– the isomers give {{different}} ions in solution {{although they}} have the same composition. This type of isomerism occurs when the counter <b>ion</b> <b>of</b> the complex is also a potential ligand.
