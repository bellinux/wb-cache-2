50|$|Crash cymbals {{are often}} the first ones in a drum set to warp and {{ultimately}} crack, due to repeated striking of the edge. Cymbal cracking is generally {{in the form of}} a fracture along the edge, or across the bow, often originating from the edge. Cracks in cymbals are caused by poor technique or <b>excessive</b> <b>play,</b> or more rarely as a result of a defect originating from manufacture, or damage to the cymbal not caused by playing, for example dropping. If a crack is left untreated, it will begin to follow the lathe grooves around the cymbal, and could potentially spread all the way around the cymbal and back to the point where the crack started, causing the outer portion of a cymbal to simply drop off.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the recoil system problems, hydro-pneumatic recoil {{cylinders}} (using compressed air instead of springs) were designed by a French officer who had previously done this for Schneider-Creusot.

Field trials in France showed that there was <b>excessive</b> <b>play</b> in the elevation and traverse mechanisms, making the gun very inaccurate, along with poor durability in cross-country movement. However, production continued postwar; eventually 810 barrels and 362 field carriages were delivered. The surplus of barrels led to the weapon's use for other purposes.|$|E

Henceforth double heading broad gauge trains became a rarity in South Australia. The massive locomotives were unloaded at Port Adelaide and taken off the pier by horses (the locomotives weight alone exceeding the docks maximum loading capacity). Apart from some initial teething problems (mainly to do with overheating bearings and rough riding due to <b>excessive</b> <b>play</b> allowed on driving axles) the new locomotives settled in nicely to their assigned positions. After the success of the original locomotives, ten more 700 class locomotives, with larger tenders, were locally built using the facilities of the new Islington Workshops.

5000|$|The {{city was}} in {{constant}} danger {{of natural and}} man-made disasters and worse, attacks from foreign invaders. In 1574, a fleet of Chinese pirates led by Limahong attacked the city and destroyed it before the Spaniards drove them away. The colony had to be rebuilt again by the survivors. These attacks prompted {{the construction of the}} wall. The city of stone began during the rule of Governor-General Santiago de Vera. The city was planned and executed by Jesuit Priest, Antonio Sedeno and was approved by King Philip II's Royal Ordinance that was issued in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain. The succeeding governor-general, Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas brought with him from Spain the royal instructions to carry into effect the said decree stating that [...] "to enclose the city with stone and erect a suitable fort at the junction of the sea and river". Leonardo Iturriano, a Spanish military engineer specializing in fortifications, headed the project. Chinese and Filipino workers built the walls. Fort Santiago was rebuilt and a circular fort, known as Nuestra Senora de Guia, was erected to defend the land and sea on the southwestern side of the city. Funds came from a monopoly on playing cards and fines imposed on its <b>excessive</b> <b>play.</b> Chinese goods were taxed for two years. Construction of the walls began on 1590 and continued under many governor-generals until 1872. By the middle of 1592, Dasmarinas wrote the King about the satisfactory development of the new walls and fortification. Since the construction was carried on during different periods and often far apart, the walls were not built according to any uniform plan.|$|E

40|$|The {{playing of}} massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing games (MMORPGs) {{is now a}} highly popular leisure activity. The present study set out to explore the attitudes, experiences, and feelings of online gamers. The study entailed 71 interviews with online gamers (52 males, 19 females) from 11 different countries. Six main themes emerged from the analyses of the interview transcripts: (a) online gaming and integration into day-to-day lives; (b) online gaming, <b>excessive</b> <b>play,</b> and problems; (c) addiction; (d) psychosocial impact of online gaming; (e) online gaming, dissociation, and time loss; and (f) online gaming and the alleviation of negative feelings and mood states. These findings specifically showed how gamers used MMORPGs to alleviate negative feelings and provided detailed descriptions of personal problems that had arisen due to playing MMORPGs.

In consideration of the bias in reporting negative consequences of video gaming, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate {{the evidence of the}} effects of MMOGs on those who play them. In the sixteen studies that met the inclusion criteria, analysis revealed that only those players who were classified as “addicted” or engaged in “problematic game play” experienced significant negative consequences, with many gamers finding positive aspects to video gaming such as enjoyment, feelings of achievement, friendship, and a sense of community. However, significant limitations in the studies point to the need for further research so that appropriate treatments and interventions can be developed for problematic game play...|$|E

40|$|We use ethnographic, interview, {{and survey}} data to examine {{problematic}} play within the popular online game, World of Warcraft, or ‘WoW’ for short. Research shows that players {{drawn to the}} interpersonal dimensions of online games {{are more prone to}} experience negative outcomes associated with their computer use. Our study suggests that it is not only whether online gamers seek meaningful social interactions that determine if WoW play becomes problematic, but exactly how players interact with others in online game-worlds. Specifically, levels of problematic WoW play depend on the extent gamers play with offline or ‘real-life’ friends and relations. Our survey data reveals both a direct relationship between playing WoW with offline friends and problematic online gaming and also an indirect one mediated by ‘immersion’ (defined as the extent that players feel like they are in a virtual world and in some cases actually their character). Interpreting these results through ethnographic and interview data, we suggest that playing WoW with real-life friends allows gamers to transfer in-game accomplishments and experiences into offline social networks. Rather than competing and conflicting with the world outside of the game, WoW played in this way tends to enhance gamers’ offline lives. Further, by keeping gamers in touch with perspectives outside of WoW, playing with real-life friends instills critical distance and greater awareness of how <b>excessive</b> <b>play</b> can damage offline commitments and relationships, allowing gamers to better monitor, evaluate, and ultimately regulate excessive game-play...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVideo-game users {{represent}} 40 % of the French {{population and}} adolescents {{are the primary}} users. Yet <b>excessive</b> <b>playing</b> of video games has become a problem in modern society and is manifesting itself in treatment centers for adolescents. Before attempting to gain insight into this problematic use, we must understand video gaming itself {{and its implications for}} the gamer. The aim of this research is to propose an understanding of video-game playing based on some dimensions of emotional functioning such as emotion regulation, emotion intensity, emotion expression, and alexithymia. A total of 159 adolescents took part in the study. Regular gamers regulated their emotions more than irregular gamers did. They also felt their emotions more intensely. But regular gamers expressed their emotions less than irregular gamers did. Finally, the regular gamers' alexithymia level was higher than the irregular gamers' level. Especially, they had more difficulty being emotionally reactive. The avatar's evolution in the virtual environment may help mediate adolescents' problematic emotional experiences to give them meaning and enable their appropriation. As such, video games may act as a medium for projecting and experiencing one's emotional life by staging the emotional self, thereby explaining the engagement of adolescents in video gaming...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{breaking}} the flow of gaming to prevent <b>excessive</b> game <b>play.</b> Earlier research on immersive experiences suggests that flow, notably the distorted feeling of time and focused attention, {{is at the heart of}} the problem. We explore the topic of <b>excessive</b> game <b>play</b> and its effects with a group of game players. This group consisted of 10 children working together to elaborate on the issues mentioned. Group activities included free-word association, interaction re-labelling exercises and group discussions on player-actor relationships and ideal solutions. Children want control of intervention settings; parental interaction is considered mostly inappropriate. Any intervention strategy should ’understand’ the game and anticipate natural moments. Also, children expect interventions to happen gradually. We present a detailed account of the focus group, formulate its outcome in terms of user requirements and discuss the strategies we designed, implemented and evaluated in a user trial. The main focus of the paper is on the process followed during the focus group and the way in which the children¿s view and needs provided input to the development of flow breaking strategies. The work confirms that the informant design approach provides effective means to guarantee children¿s contribution to the design of interactive systems for children...|$|R
