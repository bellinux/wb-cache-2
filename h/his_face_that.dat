5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that he knew who Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2004, he {{successfully}} {{defended his}} title, beating former world champion Randall Bailey by knockout {{in the sixth}} round, {{as part of the}} Vitali Klitschko-Danny Williams undercard in Las Vegas. Cotto's performance was described as a result of hand speed and accuracy. During the fight Bailey received punches in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> opened cuts over and under both of his eyes. As a result of the cuts Bailey was examined by the ringside physician. Following this Bailey expressed that he didn't want to continue and the referee stopped the fight at 1:39 of the sixth round. Eleven days later, on December 22, 2004 the Puerto Rican boxing commission named Cotto as Puerto Rico's fighter of the year for 2004.|$|E

25|$|On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol {{was driving}} a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he {{collided}} with the rear of a braking truck 10km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half {{of his face and}} incurred cuts on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as “the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas”. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the main}} protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII. He is a young student at Balamb Garden who was {{identifiable}} by the scar on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> a fellow student, Seifer, inflicted. He rarely speaks and has {{the reputation of being}} a lone wolf. As Squall's story unfolds, he becomes fascinated with and falls in love with Rinoa, despite never outwardly expressing such until the ending. Squall is characterized by forlorn memories of standing out in the rain at the orphanage where he grew up, wondering where [...] "Sis" [...] went. Squall's weapon is a gunblade, a sword that uses components of a revolver to send vibrations through the blade when triggered. His Limit Break is a series of sword strikes called Renzokuken.|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific smile on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was {{very happy with the}} change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the fight, Harold Lederman had Castillo winning 115–111. ESPN's Max Kellerman disputed Lederman's scoring, {{writing in}} his boxing column: [...] "Harold Lederman, the (HBO) {{unofficial}} ringside television judge, gave the third round to Castillo, which I think demonstrates that Mayweather suffers from the same scoring syndrome that afflicted Pernell Whitaker. Mayweather is so seldom hit cleanly in <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> when a clean shot is landed against him it registers all out of proportion in the observer's mind. Meanwhile, the three clean shots Mayweather just landed against his opponent do not make the same kind of impression".|$|E

Keeble had thus far suffered two rifle gunshot wounds to his left arm, grenade shrapnel to <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> almost removed his nose, and a badly twisted knee; on the 19th, doctors reportedly removed 83 pieces of festering shrapnel Keeble had sustained from a concussion grenade the previous day.

2500|$|An oft-repeated {{story about}} Grace is that, in 1896, the Australian pace bowler Ernie Jones bowled a short-pitched {{delivery}} {{so close to}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> it appeared to go through his beard. Grace reportedly reacted by demanding of Australian captain Harry Trott: [...] "Here, what's all this?" [...] Trott said to Jones: [...] "Steady, Jonah". Jones replied: [...] "Sorry, doctor, she slipped". There are multiple variations of the story and, although some sources have recorded that the incident happened in a Test match, {{there is little doubt}} that the game in question was the tour opener at Sheffield Park. This is separately confirmed by C.B. Fry and Stanley Jackson who were both playing in the match, Jackson batting with Grace at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Steele as Mr. Wink: A giant cave troll who was {{originally}} conceived by Guillermo del Toro. Wink was sculpted by Mario Torres, and the costume was worn by Brian Steele. In the film, Wink's right arm has a giant metal fist. The fist {{was designed by}} filmmakers {{to be made of}} heavy plastic to stay light enough for motors to operate the mechanical fingers. The fist could also be physically detached and used as a projectile without any computer-generated imagery used. Several of Mike Mignola's comics characters wield similar mechanical fists on chains, including the Kriegaffes used by Herman von Klempt. Likewise, Mr. Wink has an old wound {{on the left side of}} <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> has closed one of his eyes. Del Toro said that he named Mr. Wink after Selma Blair's one-eyed dog (which Blair confirms in a commentary track for the DVD release). Steele also portrays: ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 29, 1936, the Spanish Republican Army {{launched}} {{an attack against}} the Nationalist-held town of Seseña. The Republicans attacked with a force of 15 T-26 tanks, armed with a 45mm cannon, led by a Lithuanian tank specialist, Captain Paul Arman, and driven by Russians with Spanish gunners, and the 1st Mixed Brigade, a newly established mixed brigade led by Enrique Líster. Opposing them, the Nationalists had a force of cavalry led by colonel Monasterio, Moroccan regulares and some Italian tankettes. The Russian tanks were mased together for a shock attack and entered in Seseña. Arman claimed that the Soviet tanks destroyed two infantry battalions, two cavalry squadrons, ten 75mm guns, two tankettes and 20-30 trucks. The tanks crossed Seseña and reached Esquivias, nevertheless, the Mixed Brigade of Lister never entered into {{the town and the}} tank force had to retreat. Mikhail Koltsov, a Russian journalist at Seseña said: [...] "Lister...explained, a grimace upon <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> his units, had been moving well at first, but after 1,500 metres, they had felt tired and sat down...". Furthermore, the Nationalists managed to knock out three Russian tanks with Molotov cocktails.
