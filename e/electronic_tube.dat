One {{reason for this is}} that in the last twenty years the development of the <b>electronic</b> <b>tube</b> rectifier has facilitated the economical conversion of A-C power to D-C power. The recent improvement of dry disk rectifiers, particularly selenium rectifiers, suggests that they may soon seriously compete with tube rectifiers in many applications. The writer has attempted in this thesis to do two things. Firstly: to outline the theory of rectification, dwelling particularly upon the advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used rectifier circuits. This material has been augmented with numerous oscillograms which are so often lacking in texts and technical literature. Secondly: to point out the advantages and disadvantages of dry disk rectifiers as applied to rectifier-motor drives. This work is not original, but rather a compilation of information found scattered throughout the literature. The use of a multi-rectifier-motor drive is suggested; this type of drive has not, to the writers knowledge, been discussed elsewhere in the literature.

40|$|AUTHORS ' SYNOPSIS An {{ultrasonic}} {{transit time}} device was modified to permit close {{placement of the}} crystals and to broaden the effective spatial angle of the beam of ultrasound. The device is ideal for chronic animal experiments since its output is linear for displacement and calibration may be performed at any time. Displacement, and its derivatives with respect to time, are fundamental variables of the cardio-vascular system. For animal experimentation, several methods are satisfactory for acute studies, but few are suited to chronic implantation studies which require linear systems with instant cali-bration. Ultrasonic methods were introduced in-to physiological research by Rushmer, Franklin, and Ellis (1956) with barium titanate crystals sutured to the external wall of the left ventricle. The instrument was an <b>electronic</b> <b>tube</b> design. In {{the search for a}} transducer system capable of recording dimensions of blood vessels, we developed a transistorized version of the 3 megahertz ultrasound device, which permitted stable recordings of small dimensions. Further changes have been introduced to overcome the problem of extreme directionality of the beam of ultrasound. The modifications consist of replacement of the transmitter output trans-former to decrease the excitation pulse duration, and the use of transistors in the transit time converter for measurement of dimensions as small as 3 mm...|$|E
40|$|USA) [1] and Recent Japanese Models (NASDA[2]; METI[3]; Japan) {{are among}} them. Some {{of them are}} {{designed}} based on a microwave power transmitter with microwave tubes. The electronic tubes such as Klystron or magnetron have high efficiency (> 70 %) and high power output (over kW). However, the microwave power density at a transmitting antenna element of the SPS is too high ranging from several tens watts/element to a few hundred watts/element. Therefore, we must use a system providing the power from one <b>electronic</b> <b>tube</b> to a single sub-array unit or to insert a power divider with phase shifters between the power device and each antenna element. We refer to this system as a PD-PS system. The sub-array system suffers from little power loss but generates grating lobes when power beam is electronically swung. As the microwave power from the SPS is huge, we must lower the grating lobe level to satisfy the requirement for the compatibility with the existing communication system. On the other hand, the PD-PS system generates very little grating lobes, but its power loss is not negligible. The other design of the microwave power transmitter is to use semi-conductor amplifiers. In this case, we could achieve a system with very small or no grating lobes. However, {{the efficiency of the}} semi-conductor amplifier is still below 40 % [4]and still much more expensive compared with the microwave tubes. Either system, therefore, does not attain sufficiently high DC-RF conversion efficiency. The higher the efficiency, the less launching weight and size can be attained.

40|$|Guglielmo Marconi's trans-Atlantic {{wireless}} {{experiment in}} 1900 {{marked the beginning}} of a communication revolution that transformed the open space above the earth into channels of information flow. This dissertation grapples with the historical conditions that gave rise to such a transformation: the studies of radio-wave propagation and the treatments of radio interferences in early twentieth-century America and Western Europe. The part on propagation examines the debate between the surface diffraction theory and the atmospheric reflection theory for long waves, the development of the ionic refraction theory for short waves, the evidential quests for the existence of the ionosphere, and the studies of the geomagnetic effects on propagation. The part on interferences focuses on the engineering efforts toward the characterization of atmospheric noise and signal-intensity fluctuations, the policies of radio-channel allocation for fighting man-made interference, and the scientific research into <b>electronic</b> <b>tube</b> noise. By the mid- 30 s, the results from these endeavors had considerably improved the quality of radio communication. Characterizing Radio Channels builds a bridge between the history of science and the history of technology by inspecting an immaterial engineering entity [...] radio channels [...] whose control required significant scientific research. In the history of science, it contributes to an integrated study of electrical physics and geophysics. In the history of technology, it enriches radio history, epistemology of engineering knowledge, consumer studies, and the studies of technological policies.

40|$|The {{telephone}} system was not sufficiently developed in prewar Japan. This study examines the technological development of automatic telephone switchboard (ATS) {{to clarify the}} problems of {{telephone system}} in prewar Japan. Ministry of Communication(MOC) introduced automatic telephone system in 1923. From {{the standpoint of the}} telephone exchange service, it was a very opportune decision; however, it was technologically premature. Although they had conducted research on the system before WW 1, their only choice was the primitive S ~ S system. Further, the dependence on import technology caused different A-type and H-type ATS to coexist. Each local telephone exchange district independently introduced a different type. The MOC had to prepare the specifications and parts for repair for two different systems. These factors hampered the improvement of the telecommunication quality. Standardizing the system by using independent technology became the biggest issue for the MOC in the 1930 s. In the 1930 s, some joint researches were organized with private enterprises. They tried to develop a gT-typeh or gElectronic Tube-typeh ATS. However, the T-type ATS was merely an improvement over the outdated S ~ S system with respect to the circuit design. On the other hand, Matsumae aimed at a novel technology, an electronic common control system. However, a suitable <b>electronic</b> <b>tube</b> was not invented. As a result, the telecommunication industry was unable to resolve the coexistence problem in the prewar period. However, the engineers of MOC and ATS suppliers recognized their technological backwardness and shared an awareness of the importance of standardization by independent technology. This was the starting point for the research and development system of the telecommunication industry in gPostwar Japan. hTelephone system, Automatic Telephone Switchboard, Ministry of Communication, Research & Development, Joint Research...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the fatigue strength of {{a new type of}} all metal sandwich panel structure, designed and furnished by Western Engineering Associates of Los Angeles. This structure consisted basically of a new type of embossed core attached by spot welding to one or more smooth sheets of the same metal. Specimens tested were all of the single core, single skin type. Metal used was 24 ST aluminum alloy of 0. 032 inch thickness. This construction affords high structural rigidity for its weight. Two patterns of the embossed core were tested. One of the specimens had its core embossed with a triangular pattern, the other with a square pattern. The specimens were tested by utilizing them as simply supported beams, loaded in the center by a sinusoidally varying load of constant maximum magnitude. This load was applied by means of loading bars one {{on the top of the}} specimen, the other on the bottom. These bars had flat, one inch wide surfaces, contacting the specimen. To prevent the sharp edges of the bars from causing local failures of the specimens, a layer of one-eighth inch thick koroseal was used between the bars and the specimen. Specimens tested had a length between end supports of 16. 7 inches. Their width was 9 inches. The loading obtained was a combination of bending and shear. The shear stress was of such a low magnitude, however, that it could be neglected. Failure of the specimens was deemed as occurring at the time the first crack appeared. A method was devised for crack detection that consisted of laying down a conducting strip over a thin insulating layer in a network fashion, covering all saddle points of the core in the central area, since previous testing had disclosed the fact that failure occurred at these points first. Any crack in one of these saddles caused a break in the conducting strip which changed the bias on the controlling <b>electronic</b> <b>tube</b> to a cut off value. This tube was part of an Eccles-Jordan Trigger circuit which with associated tubes allowed current flow through a thyratron relay circuit opening the starting circuit of the testing machine, causing it to stop. The data shows that for the specimens oriented in a normal fashion, that is, with one of the sides of the square or triangle of the core parallel to the loading bar, which was the situation for most of the tests, the square pattern is vastly superior to the triangular one, as regards fatigue strength. For specimens oriented in this way the square pattern withstood a bending moment of 13. 45 inch pounds per inch of width; whereas the triangular pattern withstood only 9. 28. Two tests conducted with the square core having the sides of the squares at an angle of forty-five degrees to the loading bars gave results about midway between. However, the effective EI for this configuration was considerably reduced, and consequently actual failure stress was probably about equal to that for the ease where the sides were parallel to the loading bar. The triangular pattern was actually much worse than the curve shows. At the higher loads cracks occurred with very few cycles of loading. Automatic cut-off feature was not in use for these tests. In service it is highly possible that overloads of short duration might cause small cracks which would become focal points of fatigue failure, thus reducing the fatigue strength well below the design point. This weakness of the triangular pattern arises from the fact that smooth fillets or saddles, joining depressed and elevated portions of the core, are harder to obtain in this pattern than in the square one. Wrinkles and tool marks were present in almost every one of the triangular specimens tested...|$|E
