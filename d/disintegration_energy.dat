5000|$|One curiosity is why alpha particles, helium nuclei, {{should be}} {{preferentially}} emitted {{as opposed to}} other particles like a single proton or neutron or other atomic nuclei. Part of the answer comes from conservation of wave function symmetry, which prevents a particle from spontaneously changing from exhibiting Bose-Einstein statistics (if it had an even number of nucleons) to Fermi-Dirac statistics (if it had an odd number of nucleons) or vice versa. Single proton emission, or the emission of any particle with an odd number of nucleons would violate this conservation law. The rest of the answer comes from the very high binding energy of the alpha particle. Computing the total <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy</b> given by the equation:Where [...] is the initial mass of the nucleus, [...] is {{the mass of the}} nucleus after particle emission, and [...] is the mass of the emitted particle, shows that alpha particle emission will usually be possible just with energy from the nucleus itself, while other decay modes will require additional energy. For example, performing the calculation for uranium-232 shows that alpha particle emission would need only 5.4 MeV, while a single proton emission would require 6.1 MeV. Most of this <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy</b> becomes the kinetic energy of the alpha particle itself, although to preserve conservation of momentum part of this energy becomes the recoil of the nucleus itself. However, since the mass numbers of most alpha emitting radioisotopes exceed 210, far greater than the mass number of the alpha particle (4) this difference is generally quite small.|$|E
50|$|Radioactive decay {{results in}} a {{reduction}} of summed rest mass, once the released energy (the <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy)</b> has escaped in some way. Although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with {{the difference between the}} mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products, this is true only of rest mass measurements, where some energy has been removed from the product system. This is true because the decay energy must always carry mass with it, wherever it appears (see mass in special relativity) according to the formula E = mc2. The decay energy is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles (that is, particles that have rest mass). If these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and photons are absorbed, then the decay energy is transformed to thermal energy, which retains its mass.|$|E

40|$|For the {{determination}} of an effective rock disintegration for a given tool and rock type it is needed to define an optimal disintegration regime. Optimisation of the disintegration process by drilling denotes the finding out an appropriate couple of input parameters of disintegration, i. e. the thrust and revolutions for a quasi-equal rock environment. The disintegration process can be optimised to reach the maximum immediate drilling rate, to reach the minimum specific <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy</b> or to reach the maximum ratio of immediate drilling rate and specific <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy.</b> For {{the determination}} of the optimal thrust and revolutions it is needed to monitor the disintegration process. Monitoring of the disintegration process in real conditions is complicated by unfavourable factors, such as the presence of water, dust, vibrations etc. Following our present experience in the monitoring of drilling or full-profile driving, we try to replace the monitoring of input values by monitoring of the scanned acoustic signal. This method of monitoring can extend the optimisation of disintegration process in the technical practice. Its advantage consists in the registration of one acoustic signal by an appropriate microphone. Monitoring of acoustic signal is used also in monitoring of metal machining by milling and turning jobs.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} rock abrasiveness {{that causes}} attrition (wearing down) of the disintegration indentors. In {{the case of}} drilling machines equipped with disc chipper tools it is the attrition of the discs. The attrition of the discs results in {{the reduction of the}} drilling rate and the increase in the specific <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy,</b> thus directly affecting the total economic outcome of the mining site (tunnel). Abrasiveness of the rock is the rocks ability to wear down the working tool during the mutual interaction between the working indentor and the rock in the mechanic rock disintegration process. The disintegration indentor wears down during the interaction, that changes its geometric dimensions, causing the increase in the contact area between the tool and the surface of the rock. The changes in these dimensions consequently alter the rate of advance of the drilling machine and the specific <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy.</b> Abrasiveness is therefore an overall result of physical and mechanical characteristics of the rock during the interaction between the disintegration indentor and the rock. In the present time there is no method that would formulate the rocks abrasiveness at the hands of physical-mechanical characteristics of the rock. Because the interaction between the tool and the rock depends on the characteristics of the tool, abrasiveness is at present a relative quantity, dependent also {{on the quality of the}} disintegration indentors. With the progress in the quality of disintegration tools, the abrasiveness and the attrition of the tool during mechanic rock disintegration changes. From this standpoint it is, in the course of determining the rocks abrasiveness in the laboratory procedures, needed to eliminate the impact of the disintegration indentor characteristics. By choosing one disintegration indentor type with predetermined physical-mechanical characteristics for the laboratory measurements, we can obtain abrasiveness that characterizes the examined rock. The process of interaction between the indentor and the rock is also influenced by the environment where the interaction takes place. The effect of the environment is not negligible and therefore it is, in the laboratory conditions of determining the abrasiveness, always necessary to provide for the same environment and thus eliminate its influence on the overall measurement, especially in the case of comparing the abrasiveness of different rocks. We have determined the abrasiveness according to the ON 44 1121 (1982) on three types of rocks...|$|E

It appears quite probable that this subject will undergo a development parallel to that of atomic structures a considerable amount of information must be gathered before the theories which arise from time to time may be properly evaluated. As in the atomic oases one of the phenomena which a satisfactory theory must quantitatively explain is the existence of excited energy states in the nucleus, the presence of which are deduced from observation of quanta and particles emitted from such nuclei. In addition a satisfactory theory must certainly take into account the binding energies and, nuclear masses inferred from the energy release an the disintegration of nuclei. Of the many techniques currently employed to obtain the basic data mentioned above, one which yields great precision is that of charged particle energy measurement by magnetic analysis. In the past few years this method has been used to determine the <b>disintegration</b> <b>energies,</b> or "Q-values", and the energy levels of the light nuclei. It was for this purpose that the Rice Institute annular magnet was constructed: in 1949.

The Rice Institute magnet has to date been used only to check some of the determinations made by these two laboratories, which have been responsible for most such determinations made in this country. The rice data have been in reasonable agreement with the results of these laboratories, and this fact indicates that the calibration standards are, at most, not very much in error.

40|$|Background: Targeted {{radiotherapy}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} methods of radiotherapy that involves the use of beta-emitting radionuclides to deliver a dose of radiation to tumor cells. An important feature of this method is the tumor size and the finite range of beta particles emitted as a result of radionuclide disintegration those have significant effects for the curability of tumors. Material and Methods: Monte Carlo simulations and mathematical models have been used to investigate the relationship of curability to tumors size for tumors treated with targeted 131 I and 90 Y. The model assumed that radionuclides are distributed uniformly throughout tumors. Results: The results show that there is an optimal tumor size for cure. For any given cumulated activity, cure probability is greatest for tumors whose diameter is close to the optimum value. There is a maximum value of curability that occurs at a diameter of approximately 3. 5 mm for 131 I. For 90 Y maximum curability occurs at a tumor diameter of approximately 3. 5 cm. Tumors smaller than the optimal size are less vulnerable to irradiation from radionuclides because a significant proportion of the <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy</b> escapes and is deposited outside the tumor volume. Tumors larger than the optimal size are less curable because of greater clonogenic cell number. Conclusion: With single radionuclide targeted radiotherapy, there is an optimal tumor size for tumor cure. It is suggested that single agent targeted radiotherapy should not be used for treatment of disseminated disease when multiple tumors of differing size may be present. The use of several radionuclides concurrently would be more effective than reliance on single radionuclide. This approach of using combination of radionuclides with complementary properties could hopefully prepare new measures and improve the efficiency of tumor therapy...|$|E

The acoustic vibrations accompanying the drilling process are recorded by a microphone placed in a defined position in the acoustic space. The drilling device (drilling stand), the drilling tool and the rock are the source of sound. Two basic sound states exist in the drilling stand research : the noise at no-load running and the noise at the rotary drilling of rock. Suitable quantities for optimizing the rock disintegration process are searched by the study of the acoustic signal. The dominant frequencies that characterize the disintegration process for the given rock and tool are searched by the analysis of the acoustic signal. The analysis of dominant frequencies indicates the possibility of determining an optimal regime for the maximal drilling rate. Extreme of the specific <b>disintegration</b> <b>energy</b> is determinated by the dispersion of the dominant frequency. The scanned acoustic signal is processed by the Fourier transformation. The Fourier transformation facilitates the distribution of the general non-harmonic periodic process into harmonic components. The harmonic components can be used for the characterization of the rock disintegration process. The components of the acoustic signal by the classical monitoring and scanning of the acoustic signal can be found and specified, characterizing satisfactorily the disintegration process. The specification of the new quantities in the dependence on the thrust F and revolution n, derived from the acoustic signal by the Fourier transformation (as they enable the control of the rock disintegration process at drilling without the classical monitoring, i. e. without the scanning of thrust F and revolution n) is the aim of the research in the presence. The samples of andesite, granite, limestone and sandstone were drilled by the impregnated diamond bit with the diameter of 46 mm. The results from the drilling process in the Ruskov andesite by impregnated diamond bit in an interval of the thrust F from 5 082 to 10 286 N and the revolution from 0 to 17, 8 s- 1 on the drilling stand at the Institute of Geotechnics are presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|A thermo-alkaline {{treatment}} with air stripping was applied before anaerobic sludge digestion for both siloxane removal and sludge disintegration. The treatment {{was expected to}} increase the amount of biogas produced and to reduce the amount of siloxane in the gas. Adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to the sludge improved the removal of siloxane from the sludge, with approximately 90 % of the siloxane removed to the gas phase using a thermo-alkaline treatment. Over 80 % of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) could be removed under the following conditions: 55 °C treatment temperature, 135 g-NaOH kg 1 volatile total solids (VTS), and 0. 5 L min 1 air-stripping rate. The disintegration ratio of volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the sludge was correlated with the D 5 removal ratio. Because most of the siloxane was adsorbed to, or was contained in the VSS, the siloxane removal ratio increased with VSS <b>disintegration.</b> Finally, the <b>energy</b> consumption and operational costs of this system were evaluated for several scenar- ios. Thermo-alkaline treatment at the indicated operational conditions had the lowest operating costs for a 400 m 3 day 1 anaerobic sludge digestion system. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Preparation and {{deposition}} of ionic carbon- and hydrocarbon clusters {{as well as}} the characterisation of these processes was the subject of this work. Various sources for carbon- and hydrocarbon clusters have been built up. Laser- and massspectroscopic investigations have shown, that the atomic composition and size of the clusters depends critically on the type of the source. The investigation of the interaction of fullerenes with surfaces under UHV-conditions has revealed, that these carbon clusters are deformed and strongly heated up to a kinetic energy of 500 eV/cluster. However, they leave the surface without substantial <b>disintegration.</b> Higher kinetic <b>energies</b> are mandatory to its complete disintegration. Deposition of hydrocarbonclusters has lead to amorphous a-C:H films. Fullerene-deposition has revealed crystalline fullerit-films in case of thermal kinetic energy, and amorphous a-C films in case of high kinetic energies. It has been shown, that the structure of polycrystalline diamond films can be influenced when using pulsed supersonic beams for gas inlet. These beams contain most probably hydrocarbon clusters.

40|$|Mannitol is an {{essential}} excipient employed in orally disintegrating tablets due to its high palatability. However its fundamental disadvantage is its fragmentation during direct compression, producing mechanically weak tablets. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to assess the fracture behaviour of crystalline mannitol in relation to the energy input during direct compression, utilising ball milling as the method of energy input, whilst assessing tablet characteristics of post-milled powders. Results indicated that crystalline mannitol fractured at the hydrophilic (011) plane, as observed through SEM, alongside a reduction in dispersive surface <b>energy.</b> <b>Disintegration</b> times of post-milled tablets were reduced due to the exposure of the hydrophilic plane, whilst more robust tablets were produced. This was shown through higher tablet hardness and increased plastic deformation profiles of the post-milled powders, as observed with a lower yield pressure through an out-of-die Heckel analysis. Evaluation of crystal state using x-ray diffraction/differential scanning calorimetry showed that mannitol predominantly retained the β-polymorph; however x-ray diffraction provided a novel method to calculate energy input into the powders during ball milling. It can be concluded that particle size reduction is a pragmatic strategy to overcome the current limitation of mannitol fragmentation and provide improvements in tablet properties...|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s many European {{countries}} started comprehensive restructuring {{of their energy}} industries, the typical ingredients of the reforms are full or partial privatization, vertical disintegration, liberalization. In this paper {{we focus on the}} way in which energy sector reforms affect social affordability. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the effects of energy reforms on the household probability of experiencing utilities deprivation (that is, to be unable to pay scheduled utility bills) in seven European Countries: Denmark, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Spain. The period of analysis is 1994 - 2001. We also explore the dynamics of utilities deprivations focusing on the causes behind deprivation persistence. We differentiate between household heterogeneity and true state dependence. Then, controlling for observed and unobserved heterogeneity, we use the magnitude of average partial effects to investigate the relevance of any state dependence and the impact of energy sector reforms on the probability of experiencing utilities deprivations and on state dependence. We find evidence that vertical <b>disintegration</b> in the <b>energy</b> sector and privatization increase the household probability of experiencing utilities deprivation. Moreover, vertical disintegration also increases the household persistence in the status of deprivation. deprivation, utilities, privatization, liberalization, vertical disintegration, true state persistence. ...|$|R
