50|$|Holding {{companies}} are a central tool in many tax planning strategies of companies. The location decision for holdings depends on multiple general tax factors (such as participation exemption for dividends and capital gains, a wide treaty network, low withholding taxes, a group taxation regime) {{as well as}} on specific holding regimes. Certain countries thus try to enhance their tax attractiveness by offering special regimes for holding companies. Special rules for holdings include the exemption from local corporate income tax (e.g. Switzerland), exemption from current taxation (e.g. Luxembourg until 2010), the exemption from tax on all <b>disposals</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in subsidiaries (e.g. Singapore) or a refund of taxes paid to non-resident shareholders if profits are distributed (e.g. Malta).|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{research}} paper analyses {{the income tax}} impact for international (non-resident) companies that dispose of their shares in mining or oil and gas companies situated in South Africa. Typically, a <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> by a non-resident in a property-rich company in South Africa would attract CGT. In {{the case of the}} minerals sector, it is automatically assumed that a mining or oil and gas company is a so-called “land-rich” or “property-rich” company {{due to the nature of}} its operations. This paper seeks to test that assumption, ie do shares in a mining or oil gas company whose only asset is a mining or prospecting right or exploration or production right respectively qualify as an ‘interest in immovable property’ as that term is defined in the ITA for CGT purposes? To make this determination, the term ‘immovable property’ as it is used for common –law purposes and the potential misalignment of this definition when compared to the term as it is used in the ITA must be analysed...|$|E
40|$|A {{non-resident}} who disposes of {{a direct}} interest in immovable property or an indirect interest in immovable property through the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> {{may be subject to}} capital gains tax in the country in which the immovable property is situated. Certain African countries were selected and the capital gains tax consequences on disposal of such property were determined by analysing the domestic tax legislation of the country in which the property is situated. In addition, the effect of any applicable double tax agreement ('DTA') to such disposals was considered. In certain countries - such as Angola and Nigeria - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident will not be subject to capital gains tax in the respective country where the property is situated regardless {{of the value of the}} shares that is attributable to immovable property. In certain countries - such as Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in immovable property in the respective country in which the immovable property is held regardless of the value of the shares that is attributable to immovable property, unless a DTA provides otherwise. In certain other countries - such as Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho and South Africa - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in immovable property in the respective country in which the immovable property is held, however this will depend in general on the percentage of the value of shares that is attributable to immovable property, unless a DTA provides otherwise. Certain countries domestic tax legislation have specific provisions regulating how this percentage is determined. A DTA may provide relief to taxpayers who are subject to capital gains tax in both their resident country and the source country, on the disposal of an interest in immovable property held in the source country. In terms of domestic tax legislation, where the non-resident is liable to pay capital gains tax in the source country, the non-resident will in general have to comply with the withholding tax and filing obligations of that country where applicable...|$|E

5000|$|The UK {{operates}} a participation exemption called the [...] "substantial shareholding exemption". Assuming {{all the relevant}} entities or groups are trading companies and groups, if a company together with its fellow group companies has a shareholding of over 10% in another company, and has held those shares for more than twelve months, <b>disposals</b> <b>of</b> those <b>shares</b> are exempt from chargeable gains.

40|$|The Insider Trading Act of 1999 and Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) {{regulations}} require {{transparency in}} director dealings. Directors {{are required to}} report all share trading in companies {{of which they are}} principals, and this information has been regarded as a signal to the market. We examine the value of this information, using 13 840 director trades and a portfolio time series approach from 2002 to 2013. Whereas most studies have used an event study methodology, we treat the problem primarily as an investment style, and using a trading rule approach we optimise the look-back and holding periods to show statistically and economically significant returns for investors who mimic director trades. When directors of companies report net acquisitions <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> over the preceding three months, investors who then purchase an equal weighted portfolio <b>of</b> the same <b>shares,</b> and hold these for four months, would have achieved an annualised return of 24. 3 % after transaction costs. When directors of companies report net <b>disposals</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> over the preceding three months, investors who purchase a portfolio <b>of</b> the same <b>shares,</b> and hold these for three months, would have achieved an annualised return of 21. 0 % after transaction costs. Both of these strategies out-performed the comparable equal weighted benchmark return of 19. 1 % pa over the same period. We triangulate these results using an event-study methodology, and whilst we find similar results for investors following a directors' purchasing strategy, the event study methodology shows that investors who purchase shares following a directors' selling strategy would underperform. In both instances, the style analysis reveals that imitating directors' trading lacked persistence after the global financial crisis of 2008, and we would not recommend either strategy.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{provisions}} {{scattered throughout the}} income tax legislation seek {{to deal with the}} evil of dividend stripping (primarily s 177 E of ITAA 1936, s 207 - 145 and 207 - 150 of ITAA 1997). However nowhere in the legislation is there a definition of dividend stripping. This has been of concern to tax advisers because (in the absence of the availability of the CGT small business concessions) plain vanilla tax planning has traditionally favoured a shareholder who controls a private company with undistributed profits first stripping the profits out of the company by way of a dividend issue before selling the <b>shares.</b> <b>Of</b> course, it all depends on the tax profile of the company and the shareholder bur a scenario can be envisaged whereby the dividend would be tax free to the shareholder and any capital gain on the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shares</b> minimised (or a loss generated).

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{assess the}} use, {{handling}} and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> insulin injection equipment by diabetic patients in Pakistan. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study at diabetic clinics in five tertiary centers in Pakistan. All diabetic patients (type 1 /type 2) {{who were on}} insulin for more than 1 month, were included. An Urdu (local language) -translated questionnaire was used to collect information on insulin administration equipment, the site and frequency of needle use, insulin syringe/pen/lancet <b>disposal,</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> needles and knowledge about diseases that are spread by sharing contaminated needles. ResultsOf 375 patients, 58 % were female. The mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 12. 3 (7. 3) years, and the duration of insulin use was 4. 4 (4. 3) years. The majority of the patients used syringes (88. 3 %) for insulin administration. Additionally, {{the majority of the}} patients disposed of used devices (syringes, 92 %; pens, 75 %; and lancets, 91 %) in the household garbage collection bin. About half of the patients (n= 185) reported being educated by their physicians about the <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sharps. Those who were educated by a physician (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) : 0. 36; 95 %CI: 0. 16 – 0. 81) or could read/write English (adjOR: 0. 32; 95 %CI: 0. 11 – 0. 92) were less likely to dispose of syringes and needles in the household garbage. ConclusionThe common <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> sharps in the household garbage has implications for disease transmission.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Taxation)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. South Africa has {{the status}} of being the richest country based on mineral reserves. This status incentivised many {{offshore}} investors to invest in shares in South African mining companies which, in turn, hold mining rights and/or prospecting rights. This research evaluates, with specific reference to offshore investors, whether any South African capital gains tax implications would arise upon the <b>disposal</b> by non-residents <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in a South African company holding prospecting rights or mining rights. The report focuses on paragraph 2 of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (‘the Act’) {{as well as the}} legal nature of mining rights, prospecting rights and prospecting information to determine whether such rights and information would fall within the ambit of paragraph 2 of the Eighth Schedule to the Act.
