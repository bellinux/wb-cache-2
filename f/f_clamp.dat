40|$|Protective antigen (PA) from anthrax toxin assembles into a homoheptamer on cell {{surfaces}} and forms complexes with the enzymatic components: lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF). Endocytic vesicles containing these complexes are acidified, causing the heptamer to transform into a transmembrane pore that chaperones {{the passage of}} unfolded LF and EF into the cytosol. We show in planar lipid bilayers that a physiologically relevant proton gradient (DpH, where the endosome is acidified relative to the cytosol) is a potent driving force for translocation of LF, EF and the LF amino-terminal domain (LFN) through the PA 63 pore. DpH-driven translocation occurs even under a negligible membrane potential. We found that acidic endosomal conditions known to destabilize LFN correlate with an increased translocation rate. The hydrophobic heptad of lumen-facing Phe 427 residues in PA (or <b>f</b> <b>clamp)</b> drives translocation synergistically under a DpH. We propose that a Brownian ratchet mechanism proposed earlier for the <b>f</b> <b>clamp</b> is cooperatively linked to a protonation-state, DpH-driven ratchet acting trans to the f-clamp site. In a sense, the channel functions as a proton/protein symporter...|$|E
30|$|According to Ref. [13], {{subsystems}} {{with relatively}} low linear correlation coefficient {{are seen as}} failure dependent. From Table  1, correlation coefficients of feeding system (<b>F)</b> and <b>clamping</b> system (C) are 0.956 and 0.949 respectively, which are the lowest of all. Therefore, reliability model of the lathe is discussed in the following part considering failure correlation between feeding system (<b>F)</b> and <b>clamping</b> system (C).|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} focused on DNA {{isolation}} from cheeses for the use in polymerase chain reaction. First, there was optimised the procedure of homogenisation {{of different types of}} cheeses from commercial sources, cell lysis and DNA isolation. DNA was isolated using magnetic microspheres and phenol extraction. It was shown that the DNA was amplified in PCR for domain Bacteria after dilution. Next, there was optimised the procedure of DNA isolation from fresh cheeses and from contaminated fresh cheeses and their pickles. DNA from all samples was amplified in PCR. The presence of DNA of domain Bacteria and yeast DNA was demonstrated. In {{the last part of the}} work, there were optimised the preparation of PCR mixtures and bacterial DNA amplification in PCR with primers with <b>clamp</b> (<b>F</b> 357 -GC and R 518). Synthetized PCR products were analysed using DGGE. It was shown that amplicons of DNA isolated from cheeses and pickles differ in positions and numbers. Larger number of bands of different intensities was detected after amplification of DNA isolated from contaminated pickles...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I (Top 1) is a monomeric protein clamp that {{functions}} in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Opposable "lip" domains form a salt bridge to complete Top 1 protein clamping of duplex DNA. Changes in DNA topology are catalyzed by {{the formation of}} a transient phosphotyrosyl linkage between the active-site Tyr- 723 and a single DNA strand. Substantial protein domain movements are required for DNA binding, whereas the tight packing of DNA within the covalent Top 1 -DNA complex necessitates some DNA distortion to allow rotation. To investigate the effects of Top 1 -clamp closure on enzyme catalysis, molecular modeling was used to design a disulfide bond between residues Gly- 365 and Ser- 534, to crosslink protein loops more proximal to the active-site tyrosine than the protein loops held by the Lys- 369 -Glu- 497 salt bridge. In reducing environments, Top 1 -Clamp was catalytically active. However, contrary to crosslinking the salt-bridge loops [Carey, J. F., Schultz, S. J., Sission, L., Fazzio, T. G. & Champoux, J. J. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 5640 - 5645], crosslinking the active-site proximal loops inhibited DNA rotation. Apparently, subtle alterations in Top 1 clamp flexibility impact enzyme catalysis in vitro. Yet, the catalytically active Top 1 -Clamp was cytotoxic, even in the reducing environment of yeast cells. Remarkably, a shift in redox potential in glr 1 Delta cells converted the catalytically inactive Top 1 Y 723 <b>F</b> mutant <b>clamp</b> into a cellular toxin, which failed to induce an S-phase terminal phenotype. This cytotoxic mechanism is distinct from that of camptothecin chemotherapeutics, which stabilize covalent Top 1 -DNA complexes, and it suggests that the development of novel therapeutics that promote Top 1 -clamp closure is possible...|$|R
