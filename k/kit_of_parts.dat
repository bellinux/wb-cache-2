25|$|FIRST {{operates}} as a non-profit public charity corporation. It licenses qualified teams, usually affiliated with schools or other youth organizations, to participate in its competitions. The teams in turn pay a fee to FIRST; these fees, the majority of which are redistributed to pay for teams' <b>kit</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> and other services, consist {{of the majority of}} FIRSTs revenue.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} challenge changes each year, and {{the teams}} can only reuse certain components from previous years. The robots weigh at most , without batteries and bumpers. The kit issued to each team contains a base set of parts. Registration and the <b>kit</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> together cost about US$6,000. In addition to that, teams {{are allowed to}} spend another $3,500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. Details of the game have been released on the first Saturday in January (except when that Saturday falls on January 1 or 2), and the teams have been given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kits</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> for {{building}} the machine were available from CompShop Ltd of 14 Station Road, New Barnet (North London). It {{is thought that}} around 5000 kits were produced.|$|R

2500|$|The hangar was {{supplied}} as a <b>kit</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> {{that could}} be easily erected, dismantled, transported and re-erected at another location. [...] The principal material of the framework was wood, joined by wooden plates, steel brackets, and steel bolts. [...] Vertical stanchions supported roof trusses, with extensively triangulated ties and beams. [...] Bays (units) of stanchions and trusses were built up and connected to each other, with each hangar assembled with six, nine, or twelve bays to achieve different hangar lengths. [...] Wooden flying buttresses were applied to the sides and rear, to ensure rigidity, and ropes were used to tie down the whole structure onto steel pickets driven into the ground. [...] Snow poles were attached to the underside of selected trusses, and hinged {{to allow them to}} be lowered for extra roof support in the event of heavy snow or high winds. [...] The tailored canvas covering was tied to the framework with ropes.|$|E
2500|$|The Dove G-AETU first flew on 3 March 1937 from Maylands Aerodrome, Romford, with C. Oscroft at the controls. It {{was rapidly}} advertised {{for sale at}} £225, a price that {{included}} a flying course to pilot's licence standard at the Romford Flying Club (RFC), an organisation in which Chadwick and Gordon had financial interests. [...] Alternatively, a <b>kit</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> was offered at £165, though no kits were sold. [...] The first aircraft was sold to RFC and a production line of seven aircraft was planned, though only two were built. Premier Aircraft Constructions went into Receivership in August 1938. [...] The Dove's failure to sell was at least {{partly due to the}} lack of interest in England in single seat sports aircraft, particularly underpowered ones, an attitude that also led to the rapid abandonment of the production under licence of the Tipsy S. which had inspired the Dove. [...] The second Dove was scrapped in May 1939 after being offered for sale complete at £90 and the first was destroyed in a fire in February 1940. [...] The third aircraft was damaged in a forced landing in September 1937, after just two weeks of flight and was kept in store awaiting repair whilst efforts were made to sell it as found.|$|E

50|$|After {{a period}} of 15 years in both primary and {{secondary}} passenger duties, Richard Maunsell, who became Chief Mechanical Engineer of the newly formed Southern Railway in 1923, decided that the class needed to be rebuilt to conform with the general standardization of Southern locomotive classes.
