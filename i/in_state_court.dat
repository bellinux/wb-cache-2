5|$|Scranton {{ultimately}} did appoint Green as a {{judge on}} the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia in 1964. He was elected to a full term in the next general election. Green served primarily as a juvenile court judge while <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Boldt's decision, the Washington Department of Fisheries issued new {{regulations}} {{in compliance with}} the decision. The Puget Sound Gillnetters Association and the Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association both filed lawsuits <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> to block the {{new regulations}}. These private concerns won at both the trial court and at the Washington Supreme Court. Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton, representing the state of Washington, supported the position of the private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the decision of the Washington Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP {{then brought}} suit {{challenging}} all five laws <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court.</b> A state circuit court held {{three of the}} laws unconstitutional, but upheld the barratry law and the law prohibiting advocacy of lawsuits against the state. On appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court struck down the anti-advocacy law as well, but upheld the barratry law. In a 6-to-3 ruling in 1963 that gave broad protection to public interest legal organizations, the U.S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Button, held that all five of the barratry, champerty, and maintenance laws violated the 1st and 14th Amendments to the constitution.|$|E

5|$|In the November general {{election}} Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes. In {{the final days}} of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17. This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments, as did Holmes and other Democrats. Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election. That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878. Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education. After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, who would have to resign to become governor. Hatfield appointed Howell Appling, Jr. to the office, and O'Hara challenged the appointment <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court.</b> The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue, with the appointment of Appling confirmed. He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the civil-rights}} claim {{included}} {{a violation of}} Section 1983, the city successfully petitioned for removal to federal court. After the Rasmussens stipulated to dropping the federal claim with prejudice, {{they were allowed to}} refile an amended claim <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court,</b> which they did at the beginning of 2011. <b>In</b> <b>state</b> <b>court,</b> the city was found to be immune from liability for all of the claims except the civil rights violation. When the Rasmussens filed an amended complaint restricting it to only the civil rights claim, the judge dismissed it in August because he believed that their stipulation in federal court earlier barred them from doing so.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of non-criminal cases <b>in</b> the United <b>States</b> are handled <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>courts,</b> rather than federal courts. For example, in Colorado, roughly 97% of all civil cases were filed <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> and 89% of the civil cases filed in federal court were bankruptcies in 2002, a typical year. Just 0.3% of the non-bankruptcy civil cases <b>in</b> the <b>state</b> were filed <b>in</b> federal court.|$|R

25|$|House filed {{a second}} post-conviction {{petition}} <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> reasserting his ineffective-assistance claim.

50|$|There {{is not a}} United States {{constitutional}} right under the Seventh Amendment to a jury trial <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>courts,</b> but <b>in</b> practice, almost every state except Louisiana, which has a civil law legal tradition, permits jury trials in civil cases <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> on substantially the same basis that they are allowed under the Seventh Amendment in federal court. The right to a jury trial in civil cases does not extend to the states, except when a <b>state</b> <b>court</b> is enforcing a federally created right, of which the right to trial by jury is a substantial part.|$|R
25|$|Washington then sought {{collateral}} relief <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> on the ground, inter alia, that counsel had rendered ineffective assistance at {{the sentencing}} proceeding in several respects, including {{his failure to}} request a psychiatric report, to investigate and present character witnesses, and to seek a presentence report.

25|$|Davis v. South Carolina (1883) {{concerned}} {{an attempt}} by a state court to continue criminal proceedings in spite of an effected federal officer removal.

Further, the Court held that bail could not be forfeited for failing to appear <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> after the removal.|$|E
25|$|Previously, in 1998, {{the state}} had enacted a Defense of Marriage Act that {{restricted}} marriage to different-sex couples, reinforcing its statutes that had been interpreted by a state court in 1974 as imposing the same restriction.

25|$|In Kring v. Missouri (1883), the Court {{held that}} it {{violated}} double jeopardy for a statute {{to attempt to}} abrogate the rule that a guilty plea to second degree murder is an implied acquittal for first-degree murder. In Bohanan v. Nebraska (1886), without reaching the merits (but only deciding a motion to dismiss), the Court held that it {{had the authority to}} consider whether a second murder conviction <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>court</b> constituted double jeopardy.|$|E

25|$|The {{grand jury}} {{indictment}} {{clause of the}} Fifth Amendment has not been incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Walker issued a stay (injunction) against enforcing Proposition 8 and a stay to determine suspension of his ruling pending appeal. The State of California did not appeal the ruling (with which it had agreed anyway) leaving the initiative proponents and one county to seek an appeal.|$|E
