On October 22, The National Park Service announced [...] that it would help state and county officials create an emergency route along 8 miles of the buried Chain of Craters Road in order to help Puna residents who will lose access to the rest of Hawai‘i if the current lava flow covers Highway 130. Construction of the Chain of Craters alternate route began by making a path over a wall of lava rock covering the road in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The $12 million to $15.5 million route, to be re-established between the park and Kalapana as a gravel road, would have been the only road in and out of lower Puna, if the June 27 lava flow had made its way to the sea. The park closed the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chain</b> of Craters Road as construction began. Nearly 8 miles of the roadway, officially known as Chain of Craters Road inside the park and Highway 130 outside of it, is covered by past flows from the ongoing Pu'u O'o eruption that threatened Pahoa. Chain of Craters Road, which opened in 1965, had portions blocked or covered by lava for 37 years of its 49-year existence, according to the park. The road is about 19 miles long inside the park. However the 2014 lava flow did not continue further.|$|E

Excitable systems play a fundamental role in neural information processing and many other biological systems. For a simple excitable element, a small but finite perturbation to a rest state leads to a large excursion (an excitation). And the inclusion of repetitive stimuli shows variety of response patterns. 1) – 3) It is know...|$|E

HepG 2 cells strongly expressed green fluorescence at the cell membrane and cytosol. However, internalization of polymeric micelles were significantly decreased when free HA was pretreated to block the CD 44 receptor. Furthermore, the CD 44 -specific anticancer activity of HAgLG polymeric micelles was confirmed using CD 44 -negative CT 26 cells and CD 44 -positive HepG 2 cells. These results indicated that polymeric micelles of HaLG polymeric micelles have targetability against CD 44 receptor of tumor cells.
