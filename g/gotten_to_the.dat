500|$|Soon after {{completing}} [...] "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final {{song on the}} set list, [...] "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson. After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming {{to the tune of}} [...] "Can't Let Go", leading Carey to present [...] "another final" [...] song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist.

500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{recording}} for Off the Deep End officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with [...] "Airline Amy". These recording sessions {{marked the first}} time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. [...] The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: [...] "We [...] had a great run with Rick, he’s a terrific guybut I had become more and more of a control freak over the years, and I’d finally <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point in my recording career where I felt that I could capably hold the reins all by myself." [...] By late 1990 five originals—"Airline Amy," [...] "Trigger Happy", [...] "When I Was Your Age", [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore," [...] and [...] "Waffle King"—were recorded.|$|E
500|$|While Augusta National Golf Club has {{consistently}} chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, {{it has done}} so in successive one-year contracts. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson stated that their relationship had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where they [...] "could do our deal in hours". Due {{to the lack of}} long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least performs some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast. Despite this, announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and Gary McCord, and there also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests.|$|E

500|$|The tour {{became the}} most {{successful}} debut concert tour in history, with an attendance of over two million. It also set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan's Tokyo Dome, selling out within seven minutes. Jackson became the only female artist other than Madonna to fill arenas at the time. It was ranked the fifth most successful tour of 1990, making her the only female artist to place within the top ten. It also solidified her reputation as a fashion icon, as fans imitated her [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] outfit and regalia. Ebony magazine reported [...] "hoards of teen girls were imitating her distinctive look—black quasi-military long jackets, black tight-tight pants, and big white shirts." [...] Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote [...] "the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country."

Contributing musicians on Walk the Way the Wind Blows included Béla Fleck, Don Williams (who sang background vocals on [...] "Love at the Five and Dime"), Wendy Waldman, and Vince Gill. Billboard praised Walk the Way the Wind Blows as [...] "Mattea's most country effort to date". An uncredited review in Stereo Review (now Sound & Vision) stated that [...] "if every country album were as tasteful and well executed as Walk the Way the Wind Blows...the reviewer's life would be a happy one indeed", while rating the performance and recording as [...] "perfection".

He stated, [...] "Murphy seems intent on running this character into the ground, but Morris isn't {{going to have}} her stop being funny without a fight." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online observed, [...] "When Ryan Murphy said this episode was a celebration of Heather, he wasn't kidding", and commended her musical performances. Robert Canning of IGN was initially concerned that the episode would diminish Morris' appeal by elevating her from a background role, but was ultimately pleased that it managed to retain her [...] "fan favorite" [...] secondary character status.

Christie Keith, in writing for the lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com, suggested that [...] "Duets" [...] was the [...] "queerest episode of any series that's ever been on television", and stated that she was moved to tears by the final scene of Brittany forlorn without Santana.

The massive success experienced by Jackson placed her in league with Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Tina Turner for her achievements and influence. Ebony magazine remarked: [...] "No individual or group has impacted the world of entertainment as have Michael and Janet Jackson," [...] arguing that despite many imitators, few could surpass Jackson's [...] "stunning style and dexterity." [...] With her recording contract under A Records fulfilled in 1991, she signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Virgin Records—estimated between thirty-two to fifty million dollars—making her the highest paid recording artist at the time.

2500|$|However, Williams’ {{films have}} also {{been the subject of}} criticism.

The rural comedy of Juke Joint is logy, as if the heat had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movie; even the musical scenes, {{featuring}} North Texas jazzman Red Calhoun, move at the turtle tempo of Hollywood's favorite black of the period, Stepin Fetchit. And there were technical gaffes galore: in a late-night scene in Dirty Gertie, actress Francine Everett clicks on a bedside lamp and the screen actually darkens for a moment before full lights finally come up. Yet at least one Williams film, his debut Blood of Jesus (1941), has a naive grandeur to match its subject." [...] It should also be realized that Williams often worked on a very meager budget. [...] The Blood of Jesus was filmed for a cost of $5,000; most black films of that era had budgets of double and triple that amount.|$|E

For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to know where we are headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it has <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E

General Emilio de Bono put on record that preparations for the invasion of Ethiopia (Abyssinia) had been going on since 1932 as roads were being built from Italian Somaliland into Ethiopian territory, though Mussolini constantly claimed that he was not a [...] "collector of deserts" [...] and would never think of invading. Ethiopians protested this build-up to war which eventually led up to a border clash at Walwal. Mussolini called this clash [...] "unprovoked aggression" [...] by Ethiopia and Italian forces invaded on 3 October 1935, led by de Bono. In only three days the Italians had captured Adwa where the former disgraceful defeat had happened. In December Pietro Badoglio replaced de Bono as commander of the invasion because of de Bono's cautious advance. On 31 March 1936, a desperate final counter-attack by Haile Selassie, king of Ethiopia, was carried out, though word of the attack had already <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italians, giving them victory in the Battle of Maychew.

2500|$|In {{a sketch}} called [...] "Conan O'Brien Hates My Homeland", Conan mocked every {{nation in the}} world to see which ones he gets letters from. An {{announcer}} on the Finnish entertainment channel SubTV, which airs the show {{a couple of days after}} it is aired in the USA, asked people to defend Finland before Conan got to insult it, and the viewers in Finland began sending mail before the bit had even <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter F. Conan responded by assuming the Finnish [...] "just couldn't wait" [...] to be insulted and officially insulted Finland in the segment. An overwhelming number of postcards were supposedly received, which apparently [...] "forced" [...] Conan to give Finland a formal apology. Conan then went as far as to have the flag of Finland shown in the background during a speech and slandered the Finns' [...] "hated" [...] neighbor Sweden with a sign saying [...] "Sweden Sucks!" [...] printed over the flag of Sweden. It would seem that this chain of events led to elevated ratings in Finland and subsequently also sparked a special relationship with the viewers in Finland. Later when Conan was talking to audience members before the show, a group of fans visiting from Finland commented that he resembled their female president Tarja Halonen. [...] Conan mentioned the resemblance on his show, even showing pictures of Halonen next to himself. [...] When he discovered that Halonen was up for reelection he began making satirical commercials in support of Halonen and vowed to travel to Finland to meet her if she won re-election. When she did indeed win re-election in January 2006, Conan traveled to Finland and met with her. One episode, broadcast on March 10, 2006, was compiled mainly of footage from O'Brien's trip to Finland. [...] In the episode, Conan greeted fans at the airport, participated in a Sami cultural ceremony, appeared on a Finnish talk show, and attempted to visit a fan who had written to him. The episode was not strictly taped as a live episode there, however, but was prefaced by an introduction by O'Brien taped in New York. The Finland episode came as the culmination of a long-running joke on the show.|$|E
