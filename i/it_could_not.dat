5|$|After {{the devastating}} bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe, the Germans {{threatened}} to bomb other Dutch cities if the Dutch forces refused to surrender. The General Staff knew <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> stop the bombers {{and ordered the}} Dutch army to cease hostilities. The last occupied parts of the Netherlands were liberated in 1945.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be installed incorrectly.|$|E

5|$|His ruse revealed, Redheffer {{immediately}} {{departed for}} New York City {{where he was}} still unknown. He changed his machine somewhat so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be detected as easily, and he exhibited it {{as he had done}} in Philadelphia.|$|E

The Foreign Ministry stated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> confirm Bukovsky's citizenship. The response was met with surprise from Kremlin's Human Rights Council and the Human Rights ombudsman of the Russian Federation.|$|E
5|$|Many logical flaws {{were found}} in COBOL 60, leading GE's Charles Katz to warn that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be {{interpreted}} unambiguously. A reluctant short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, {{it was reported that}} COBOL's syntax was as definable as ALGOL's, although semantic ambiguities remained.|$|E

5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E

5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be {{considered}} a large air arm in the wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge {{at one time or}} another some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|As the {{situation}} around Bihać deteriorated for the ARBiH, {{the government of}} the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina realized that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hold the area on its own and asked Croatia for military intervention. ARBiH Chief of Staff Rasim Delić appealed to the HV and the HVO to assist the ARBiH 5th Corps on 20 July, proposing HV attacks towards Bosansko Grahovo, Knin and Vojnić. His plea was supported by President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel when he met Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in the Brijuni Islands the next day.|$|E
5|$|Frederick of Prussia's {{invasion}} of Saxony in August 1756 began a Third Silesian War and sparked the wider Seven Years' War. Empress Maria Theresa and Kaunitz wished {{to exit the}} war with possession of Silesia. Austria was aligned with France and Russia, Great Britain with Prussia and Portugal. Giving Austria huge subsidies came back to haunt France. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bolster defences in New France; the British easily captured Louisbourg in 1758, {{and went on to}} conquer all of New France.|$|E

5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood Springs to Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be expanded any further.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, US Congress {{appropriated}} $23,000 {{to rebuild}} the Cape Florida lighthouse and work was completed in 1847. In 1861, Confederate militants sabotaged the lighthouse so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> guide Union sailors during the blockade of Confederate Florida. The lighthouse was repaired and re-lit again in 1866. In 1878 the Cape Florida Light {{was replaced by the}} Fowey Rocks Light, seven miles (11km) southeast of Cape Florida.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion star {{at a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
