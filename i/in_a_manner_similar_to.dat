5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> LSD.|$|E

This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila MIND/MIS 12 and NDC 80 {{complexes}} and the Spc 105 protein, {{like their}} counterparts from other eukaryotic species, {{are essential for}} chromosome congression and segregation, but are highly diverged in sequence. Hierarchical dependence relationships of individual proteins regulate the assembly of Drosophila kinetochore complexes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar,</b> but not identical, to other organisms...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "matter" [...] {{should be}} taken broadly to mean that which {{underlies}} the sacrament <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> that {{the way in which}} matter underlies substance.

5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood {{with the entire}} foot {{in contact with the}} ground (plantigrade), <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a team {{continued}} {{the study of}} the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with O2 in a H2O environment. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues as well as the pseudohomologue uranium.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to explore}} more {{alternative}} realities, Stewie takes Brian to a universe resembling the 1960 animated sitcom The Flintstones. Peter {{and his wife}} Lois are shown dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Fred Flintstone and Wilma Flintstone respectively. Becoming tired of this universe, the two then transport themselves to a universe where the atomic bombing of Japan never occurred, allowing Japan to conquer the United States in World War II.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the command}} {{interpreter}} had a [...] "COMPILE" [...] command, {{it was not}} a true native machine language compiler. The language was <b>a</b> semi-compiled language, <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> source program was [...] "compiled" [...] into byte code called [...] "PPCODE" [...] (Push-Pop Code), for a virtual stack machine, and the tokens interpretively executed, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> today to the execution of programs using the Java language.|$|R
50|$|This concept {{explains}} how within the federal framework, {{there exists a}} system of state autonomy where {{state and local governments}} act as social “laboratories,” where laws and policies are created and tested at the state level of the democratic system, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> (<b>in</b> theory, at least) to the scientific method. An example today would be the legalization of Marijuana even though it is illegal federally.|$|R

5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume controllable.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Council is the {{governing}} {{body of the}} Order and is composed of elected representatives from each jurisdiction. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> shareholders at an annual meeting, the Supreme Council elects seven members each year to the Supreme Board of Directors for three-year terms. The twenty-one member board then chooses from its own membership the senior operating officials of the Order, including the Supreme Knight.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{with a mild}} {{taste and}} a slight odor of maple syrup. American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies may be used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant. Chefs in the San Francisco Bay Area {{have been known to}} use it for desserts such as ice creams, cakes and caramels.|$|E

5|$|The {{spacecraft}} verified {{the existence}} of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre and tilted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{texts and}} artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, {{although}} not identical but generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly {{in their respective}} mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests {{that there may be}} a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} been {{recorded}} foraging for insects flushed by grazing cattle and buffalo, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> cattle egrets, and has been observed fishing off the backs of hippopotamuses. It has also been recorded feeding in association with banded mongooses; when a band of mongooses began hunting frogs in dried mud {{at the side of}} a pool of water a pair of hamerkops attended the feeding group, catching frogs that escaped the mongooses.|$|R
5000|$|With an MCLOS missile, the {{operator}} must track the missile and the target simultaneously and guide the missile to the target. Typically the missile is steered with a joystick, and its path is observed through a periscope-type telescopic sight.
