5|$|Ninian Edwards (March 17, 1775July 20, 1833) was a {{founding}} political {{figure of the}} state of Illinois.

5|$|An {{additional}} three-mile {{section of}} Illinois 22 <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> 83 to Milwaukee Avenue, primarily located in Buffalo Grove, was another closely related project {{that was once}} again met with similar delays and concerns. Long Grove got on board in May 2005 and approved any widening between its eastern city limits and Illinois 83. Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also made, this time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's re-nomination for president. When Pierce's hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner {{a majority of the}} delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman <b>from</b> <b>Illinois,</b> then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{publisher}} Alexander {{was born}} about 1830 {{and came to}} Oregon <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> as a pioneer in 1852. Alexander initially worked as a farmer, supplementing his income as a surveyor and local {{justice of the peace}} before learning the printing trade working for the town's earlier pro-Southern newspapers. Although his own venture as a publisher was short and unprofitable, Alexander unwittingly was the scion of a local newspaper dynasty in Oregon, with two of his sons later themselves publishing The Guard (following the tenure of several intermediate owners), while a grandson, George L. Alexander, would one day edit another Oregon paper, the Lebanon Express.|$|E

5|$|On May 14, 1832, a {{detachment}} of 275 militia {{under the command}} of Majors Isaiah Stillman and David Bailey, under orders <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> Governor Reynolds, were encamped near Old Man's Creek, not far from its confluence with the Rock River. The militia camp was located about three miles (5km) east of the Rock River near present-day Stillman Valley, Illinois, and seven miles (11km) south of the Sauk encampment. It is believed that the militia and its commanders were unaware of their proximity to Black Hawk's British Band.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events and}} their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources {{disagree}} {{on whether he}} brought his family to California <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return to California in August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a trip back to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two children, and a herd of cattle. Thus, {{in the course of}} the six years 1849-1854, he is believed to have crossed the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot.|$|E

5|$|The academy was {{primarily}} a boarding school. Students came <b>from</b> <b>Illinois,</b> the surrounding states, Texas, and Mexico. A few day students came from the Lisle area. In 1947 enrollment averaged 75students. Enrollment grew from 120 in 1953 to 300 in 1958, and remained at that level until 1966. Day student enrollment also grew and in 1962 the academy stopped accepting boarding school students. By 1964, the last year in which boarding school students were enrolled, alumni had hailed from all US states, South America, France, Mexico, and Guam. Day students from 1964 to 1968 came from Lisle and the neighboring communities. Unlike St. Procopius Academy, Sacred Heart Academy offered a business curriculum from 1953 to 1966. Courses included shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping.|$|E
5|$|World War II caused {{enrollment}} {{to decline}} {{and the student}} body consisted mainly {{of high school students}} and seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has {{little resemblance to the}} standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln {{grew up on}} {{the western}} {{frontier}} in Kentucky and Indiana. Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in Illinois, a Whig Party leader, and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, in which he served for eight years. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy and opposed the Mexican–American War. After a single term, he returned to Illinois and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new Republican Party, which had a statewide majority in Illinois. As part of the 1858 campaign for US Senator <b>from</b> <b>Illinois,</b> Lincoln took part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas; Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the race to Douglas. In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state, though most delegates originally favored other candidates. Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was elected president in 1860.|$|E
5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E
5|$|The first Secretary of Transportation was Alan Stephenson Boyd, {{nominated}} {{to the post}} by Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson. Ronald Reagan's second Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole, was the first female holder, and Mary Peters was the second. Gerald Ford's nominee William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr. was the first African American to serve as Transportation Secretary, and Federico Peña, serving under Bill Clinton, was the first Hispanic to hold the position, subsequently becoming Secretary of Energy. Japanese-American Norman Mineta, who had previously been Secretary of Commerce, is the longest-serving Secretary, holding the post for over {{five and a half}} years, and Andrew Card is the shortest-serving Secretary, serving only eleven months. Neil Goldschmidt was the youngest secretary, taking office at age thirty nine, while Norman Mineta was the oldest, retiring at age seventy four. On January 23, 2009, the sixteenth secretary Ray LaHood took office, serving under the administration of Democrat Barack Obama; he had previously been a Republican Congressman <b>from</b> <b>Illinois</b> for fourteen years.
