5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to {{only one of the}} parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{political}} {{figures in the}} ancient Near East liked {{to take credit for}} public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler are likely to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.|$|E

This is also called gustatolacrimal reflex or Bogorad's Syndrome and involves the sufferer shedding tears while eating. This {{is thought to}} be due to faulty regeneration of the facial nerve, a branch of which controls the lacrimal and salivary glands. Gustatorial sweating can also occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} of these markets has also declined. In Mexico City, about 65% of permits that merchants {{have to operate}} in these public markets <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> irregularity. None of these markets have adequate sanitary measures for meat. Meat and dairy products sold in tianguis and fixed markets are not regulated or inspected according to the Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías (CUCEI). Contaminants such as Salmonella and E. coli have been detected in products tested by this organization. Since 1997, Mexico City authorities have not carried out inspection in businesses selling groceries of any type in the city. Federal authorities only have jurisdiction in the states.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic {{polyneuropathy}} (A.K.A alcohol leg) is {{a neurological}} disorder in which multiple peripheral nerves {{throughout the body}} malfunction simultaneously. It is defined by axonal degeneration in neurons of both the sensory and motor systems and initially occurs at the distal ends of the longest axons in the body. This nerve damage causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness, first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally. Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by chronic alcoholism; however, vitamin deficiencies are also known to contribute to its development. This disease typically occurs in chronic alcoholics who <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> nutritional deficiency. Treatment may involve nutritional supplementation, pain management, abstaining from alcohol.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Poland's Jewish {{population}} {{was estimated to}} be approximately 20,000; most living in Warsaw, Wrocław, Kraków, and Bielsko-Biała, though there are no census figures that would give an exact number. According to the Polish Moses Schorr Centre and other Polish sources, however, this may represent an undercount of the actual number of Jews living in Poland, since many are not religious. The Centre estimates that there are approximately 100,000 Jews in Poland, of which 30,000 to 40,000 <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> direct connection to the Jewish community, either religiously or culturally. There are also people with Jewish roots who do not possess adequate documentation to confirm it, due to various historical and family complications. A special program of introduction to Judaism is offered to them by a progressive Jewish Community Beit Kraków.|$|E
25|$|In Fleming's novels, many Bond girls <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{independent}} job or even career, often {{one that}} was considered inappropriate {{for women in the}} 1950s. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Tiffany Case and Pussy Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they approach their work—the latter even running her own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent outlook on life. While the Bond girls are clearly intended as sex objects, they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films, especially from 1981 onward.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, more {{commonly}} referred to as the New Cathedral, was designed by architect Ricardo Legorreta and inaugurated in 1993. The New Cathedral was built to replace the Old Cathedral downtown that had been damaged during the 1972 earthquake. Upon the completion of its construction, the New Cathedral generated controversy among tourists and locals because of its bland and dull appearance. Critics pointed to the fact that buildings of particular importance, especially those of colonial heritage, were painted in bright colors. Such a building whose intention was to serve as a place of worship was expected to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> vibrant color. Eventually, the church's original concrete and gray surface became accepted and Catholic pilgrims began to embrace the church as it was.|$|E

Women having their period are considered to be unclean and have to leave their family house to live during five days in this house. They use kitchen equipment only to be used here. They bring with them their youngest children. This house is a gathering place for women during the evening. This hut is also thought to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> reproductive symbolism due to the fact that the hut can be easily seen by the men who are working the fields who know that only women who are on their period, and thus not pregnant, can be there.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not. Historians mostly agree that {{the framers of the}} Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> judicial review; Marshall made their goals operational. Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution. Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or act of a president unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Berkeley, California banned CFC food containers. The {{following}} year, Suffolk County, New York {{became the}} first U.S. locality to ban polystyrene. However, legal challenges by the Society of the Plastics Industry kept it from going into effect until at last it was delayed when the Republican and Conservative parties became {{a majority of the}} county legislature. In the meantime, Berkeley {{became the first}} city to ban all foam food containers. As of 2006, about one hundred localities in the United States including Portland, Oregon and San Francisco currently <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> ban on polystyrene foam in restaurants. For instance, in 2007 Oakland, California required restaurants to switch to disposable food containers that will biodegrade if added to food compost. In 2013, San Jose became reportedly the largest city in the country to ban polystyrene foam food containers. Some communities have implemented wide polystyrene bans, such as Freeport, Maine, which did so in 1990.|$|E

25|$|Mandible {{fracture}} causes vary by {{the time}} period and the region studied. In North America, blunt force trauma (a punch) {{is the leading cause}} of mandible fracture whereas in India, motor vehicle collisions are now a leading cause. On battle grounds, it is more likely to be high velocity injuries (bullets and shrapnel). Prior to the routine use of seat belts, airbags and modern safety measures, motor vehicle collisions where a leading cause of facial trauma. The relationship to blunt force trauma explains why 80% of all mandible fractures occur in males. Mandibular fracture is a rare complication of third molar removal, and may occur during the procedure or afterwards. With respect to trauma patients, roughly 10% <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> facial fracture, the majority of which come from motor vehicle collisions. When the person is unrestrained in a car, the risk of fracture rises 50% and when an unhelmeted motorcyclist the risk rises 4-fold.|$|E
