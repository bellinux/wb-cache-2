5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using <b>environmental</b> <b>scanning</b> electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with <b>environmental</b> <b>scanning</b> electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E
2500|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopes {{operating in}} conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore non-conductive materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.). The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible {{the observation of}} non-conductive specimens without coating. [...] Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or <b>environmental)</b> <b>scanning</b> electron microscope.|$|E

40|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>scan</b> is a {{tool that}} can be {{utilized}} to collect data to design health programs uniquely tailored {{to the needs of}} communities. However, it remains relatively undefined, unevaluated and underutilized in the field of public health. While individual studies indicate the utility of the <b>environmental</b> <b>scan</b> for public health, it is difficult to find a theoretical framework or guidelines on how to design, implement or evaluate the process within public health practice. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elicit lessons learned to maximize the utility of the <b>environmental</b> <b>scan</b> as a tool for public health. This process occurred through the development and implementation of an <b>environmental</b> <b>scan</b> as part of the needs-assessment phase of a project to increase cancer screening among African Americans in Baltimore, MD. Data collection methods for the <b>environmental</b> <b>scan</b> included a review of community stakeholders, cancer incidence and community assets and liabilities in target communities, focus-group sessions and key informant interviews with service providers. The <b>environmental</b> <b>scan</b> was conducted in 2003 and allowed for rapid acquisition and use of information about events, trends and relationships in the neighborhoods targeted for our project and enabled researchers to move forward with implementing the cancer-screening project. The researchers conclude that the <b>environmental</b> <b>scan</b> has considerable potential to be a creative, responsive, cost-effective and mobilizing tool for public health practice. However, further application and critical review are necessary to make it a more effective public health tool and an established research methodology...|$|R
