5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} more of <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and {{was dedicated to}} the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on {{the house for a}} supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had neutralized the detachment left to secure the Abbasid army's rear in Phrygia, were able to trap Harun's army between their own converging forces. The defection of the Armenian general Tatzates, however, allowed Harun to regain the upper hand. The Abbasid prince sent for a truce and detained the high-ranking Byzantine envoys, who included Empress Irene's chief minister, Staurakios. This forced Irene {{to agree to a}} three-year truce and pay a heavy annual tribute. Irene then focused <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, but warfare with the Arabs resumed in 786, until mounting Arab pressure led to another truce in 798, on terms similar to those of 782.|$|E
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck {{to get a better view}} of the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E
6000|$|But <b>the</b> Virgin {{directed}} <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engineer. [...] "Don't mind 'im, sir," [...] she advised. [...] "'E's more'n arf-gorn a'ready, a-'itting the jug every blessed stop." ...|$|R
5000|$|Annie, {{apparently}} a barmaid at Mrs. Hitchcock's inn, {{may also be}} the house prostitute. It is never clear if <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soldiers are motivated by romance or other considerations.|$|R
50|$|Rosemary Holmstrom is {{struggling}} to bring up her son {{following the death of}} her husband. When she is diagnosed with AIDS, at first she refuses to believe it, but soon turns <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problem of what will happen to her son when she dies.|$|R
25|$|Crane {{continued}} to produce valuable scientific {{work with the}} department and turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study of copepods. In 1935, {{she was able to}} identify around 60 species of copepods, of which almost half had never before been recorded in Bermuda. New data was recorded on color during life, swimming methods, breeding habits, growth stages, relative numbers of different species and sexes, diurnal migrations, effects of storms and currents and general viability.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, the Romanian Gymnastics Federation changed Silivaș's birth {{year from}} 1972 to 1970 {{to make her}} age {{eligible}} for the World Championships in Montreal. The falsification was suspected by some, but was never proved until Silivaș herself revealed it in 2002. She stated that she was never consulted about the matter: officials simply gave her a new passport, called <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> birth date, and informed {{her that she was}} now 15.|$|E
25|$|Following the French Open Watson moved <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grass season, {{where she}} entered the Aegon Classic in Edgbaston. Seeded 14th, she {{defeated}} Melinda Czink {{in the first round}}, her first victory since returning from her illness. However, Watson's success was short-lived after she lost to qualifier Alla Kudryavtseva. At the Aegon International Watson upset world No. 27, Varvara Lepchenko, in the first round in two sets. At Wimbledon she lost in the first round to Madison Keys.|$|E
50|$|She {{has also}} used <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> promote <b>the</b> work of Masaru Emoto.|$|R
50|$|Louis was in despair, but Richelieu {{sent his}} nephew to Languedoc, where a {{beautiful}} young lady had been instructed to seduce him. This she did most effectively; letters of a very passionate nature were exchanged; the lady despatched those which she received to Richelieu, and in due course they were brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notice of Madame de La Tournelle, who, furious at her young duke's deceitfullness, turned <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king.|$|R
60|$|Oblooria obeyed with alacrity, bolting her {{strip of}} half-cooked blubber as she ran; her mother {{meanwhile}} gave <b>her</b> undivided <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{duties of the}} lamp.|$|R
25|$|Hornet, {{based at}} Eniwetok in the Marshalls, raided Japanese {{installations}} ranging from Guam to the Bonins, then turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Palaus, throughout the Philippine Sea, and to Japanese bases on Okinawa and Formosa. Her aircraft gave direct {{support to the}} troops invading Leyte on 20 October 1944. During the Battle for Leyte Gulf she launched damaging raids on the Japanese center force in the Battle off Samar, and hastened the retreat of the Japanese fleet through the Sibuyan Sea towards Borneo.|$|E
25|$|Sowada then shifted <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate, {{and gained}} second {{place on the}} New South Wales Senate ticket for the 1990 election, behind Vicki Bourne. In 1991, Paul McLean {{resigned}} from the Senate after leader Janet Powell was replaced by John Coulter. Sowada was nominated by the party to fill the casual vacancy and {{was sworn in as}} a Senator in September 1991. She was, at the time, the youngest female senator in Australian history (a distinction which later passed to Natasha Stott Despoja).|$|E
25|$|Identifying {{himself as}} a new neighbor, Chris makes {{numerous}} unsuccessful attempts to help her realize the true situation. He describes details of his life so {{that she will be}} reminded of her husband. He calls <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> improbably negative conditions of the house. He drops clues, gradually leading her to the truth, but she seems to block out anything that will cause recognition. He finally tells the truth straight out. She gets angry and calls him a liar. Because she does not believe in an afterlife, she finds it impossible that he could be her dead husband.|$|E
50|$|Louis was in despair, but Richelieu, {{who was a}} {{resourceful}} man, {{was not one to}} lightly accept defeat. He {{sent his}} nephew to Languedoc, where a beautiful young lady had been instructed to seduce him. This she did most effectively; letters of a very passionate nature were exchanged; the lady despatched those which she received to Richelieu, and in due course they were brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notice of Madame de La Tournelle, who, furious at her young duke's deceitfullness, turned <b>her</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king.|$|R
60|$|It {{could not}} have been very easy to be bright and {{careless}} with that sudden secret in her heart, nor <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> things that needed doing to get her children comfortably packed off. Mrs. Strickland's voice broke again.|$|R
6000|$|And as {{they went}} through the street, he called <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church tower in a voice that seemed to her to be inexplicably charged with significance. [...] "I want you to go up there," [...] he said.|$|R
25|$|In May 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled to England, {{and flung}} herself on Elizabeth's protection. She had found refuge in Carlisle Castle, and the {{delicate}} duty of {{taking charge of}} the fugitive was entrusted jointly to Knollys and to Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. On 28 May Knollys arrived at the castle, and was admitted to Mary's presence. At his first interview he was conscious of Mary's powerful fascination. But to her {{requests for an interview}} with Elizabeth, and for help to regain her throne, he returned the evasive answers which Elizabeth's advisers had suggested to him, and he frankly drew <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> suspicions in which Darnley's murder involved her.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, {{when women}} gained {{the right to}} stand as {{parliamentary}} candidates, she turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> campaign to elect women as members of parliament. She spoke in Cardiff {{on behalf of the}} Joint Committee for Getting Women into Parliament. She did not contest the 1918 General Election. She took {{an active role in the}} affairs of a number of organisations; She was a member of the Executive Committee, of the NUWSS successor organisation the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, she was a member of the Common Interests Committee of the English-Speaking Union, she was involved in the Reunion of British War Missions in USA, she was a member of the Council for the Representation of Women in the League of Nations and she was a Member of the British Institute of International Affairs.|$|E
25|$|She {{opened the}} 2010 season by {{returning}} to the half marathon in Ras Al Khaimah. She was sixth in the race while distance-débutante Elvan Abeylegesse took the honours. She turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> London Marathon in April, but was beaten into twelfth place and finished almost ten minutes behind race winner Liliya Shobukhova. Her next marathon appearance came at the Eindhoven Marathon in October and she led from the start and seemed likely to break her personal best. Helped by her own pacemaker, she reached the 30km mark a minute faster than her Berlin run. She slowed in the final few kilometres but her time of 2:25:35 brought her her first marathon win and a new course record – bettering Nadja Wijenberg's mark which had stood for over a decade. She set a new personal best of 2:24:26 at the Dubai Marathon in January 2011, where she came fourth.|$|E
60|$|Happily at {{this moment}} Lady Assher called <b>her</b> daughter's <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{embroidered}} cushions, and Miss Assher, walking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite sofa, was soon in conversation with Lady Cheverel about tapestry and embroidery in general, while her mother, feeling herself superseded there, came and placed herself beside Caterina.|$|R
60|$|It may be {{that the}} {{faithful}} Eden was somewhat wanting in tact, by <b>her</b> determined <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> routine that chafed her hosts; but she had been forced to come away without directions, and could only hold fast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discipline of her well-ordered nursery under all obstacles.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Dorcas gave <b>her</b> {{undivided}} <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dishes once more, and Joe {{was looking}} straight before him, but without seeing anything, for his thoughts {{were of the}} advertisements which had made him a wanderer, when {{he became aware of}} the singular gestures in which Master Plummer was indulging.|$|R
25|$|An avid gardener, {{she turned}} <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grounds. Chester Holmes Aldrich first {{designed}} {{a swimming pool}} for the property, a raised structure enclosed on three sides by a pergola of stone piers and wooden trellises. After that came the Bait Box, a playhouse for the couple's son, Gifford Bryce Pinchot. Elliptical openings in the stone walls around the courtyard provide views over the surrounding landscape. Next, in the late 1920s, when her husband was serving his first term as governor, came the Letter Box, a small cottage intended both as an archive for his papers and an office for his political staff {{when he was in}} residence. In their last collaboration, Aldrich and Cornelia Pinchot added a moat, which finally gave the house the raised effect Hunt had originally intended. In building it became necessary to lengthen the east lawn and build a new stone wall to support the moat.|$|E
25|$|Jean was {{a refugee}} from Haiti—coming to Canada in 1968—and {{was raised in}} the town of Thetford Mines, Quebec. After {{receiving}} a number of university degrees, Jean worked as a journalist and broadcaster for Radio-Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), as well as undertaking charity work, mostly in the field of assisting victims of domestic violence. In 2005, she was appointed governor general by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Paul Martin, to replace Adrienne Clarkson as vicereine and she occupied the post until succeeded by David Johnston in 2010. Early in her tenure, comments of hers recorded in some of the film works by her husband, Jean-Daniel Lafond, were construed as supporting Quebec sovereignty and her holding of dual citizenship caused doubt about her loyalties. But Jean denied separatist leanings, renounced her citizenship of France, and eventually became a respected vicereine noted for <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Forces, Aboriginal Canadians, and the arts, especially youth involvement in them. Jean is also currently the Special Envoy for Haiti for the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and Chancellor of the University of Ottawa.|$|E
25|$|After {{shakedown}} training out of New London, Greenling departed 7 March 1942 for the Pacific. She arrived Pearl Harbor 3 April {{and sailed}} 20 April {{for her first}} war patrol, in the Marshall Islands and Caroline Islands. The submarine attacked the cargo ship Seia Maru four times 30 April – 1 May off Eniwetok, but due to faulty torpedoes {{was not able to}} sink her. The tenacious submarine even closed for a night gunfire attack in an attempt to cripple her adversary. Finally forced by Japanese aircraft to break off the attack, Greenling turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> huge Japanese base at Truk. As the Japanese converged on the Solomon Islands, Truk became a busy shipping point and a fertile ground for submarine operations. The submarine recorded her first kill 4 May when she hit cargo ship Kinjosan Maru amidships, breaking her in two. As the Japanese were turned back in the important Battle of the Coral Sea (history's first carrier air battle), Greenling attempted to intercept the retiring enemy units, but her speed was no match for the fast Japanese heavy units. The submarine departed the Truk area 4 June, the day of Japan's first great naval defeat at the Battle of Midway, and arrived at Pearl Harbor 16 June.|$|E
60|$|Joe was of {{the same}} opinion, when the old lady ushered them into a cleanly but scantily {{furnished}} room, so darkened as {{to make it seem}} cool by comparison with the scorching rays of the sun on the pavements, and then gave <b>her</b> undivided <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> baby.|$|R
5000|$|After their return, the king, {{the queen}} and the dauphin (and thereby his governess Tourzel) was placed under {{surveillance}}, but no guards were tasked with the surveillance of the king's daughter or sister, and Elisabeth was in fact to leave if she wished, but she chose to stay, according to Tourzel, as [...] "their consolation during their captivity. <b>Her</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King and Queen and their children always redoubled in proportion to their misfortunes." [...] She was urged by one of her correspondents, the Abbe de Lubersac, to join her aunts in Rome, but refused: [...] "There are certain positions in which one cannot dispose of oneself, and such is mine. The line I should follow is traced so clearly by Providence that I must remain faithful to it." ...|$|R
50|$|Also in 1938, she {{received}} her Ph.D. degree, but was promoted from instructor to lecturer eventually in 1952. She devoted <b>her</b> full <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study {{of local and}} Middle Eastern species, mostly grown in her experimental plots and investigated cytotaxonomically (a branch of taxonomy in which chromosome characteristics are used to classify organisms).|$|R
25|$|Starting 2000, Radcliffe won the Stormont Cross Country {{race for}} a third time. Radcliffe then {{finished}} fourth in Durham. Radcliffe then sustained a knee injury in a bizarre way, as she was sidelined after kneeling on the floor writing thank you letters for wedding presents. For the European Cup, Radcliffe joined {{a host of other}} British athletes by pulled out injured. However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the full}} report had been published, Olga turned <b>her</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study of scarabs, working with William Ayres Ward. Although many {{scholars}} dismissed {{the field of}} scarabs and seals as [...] "unreliable of chronology", Olga meticulously recorded the dimensions and styles of the artefacts. She was an early adopter {{of the use of}} computers for measurement of the scarabs and she was due to present a paper on that use of computers just days after her death in April 1985. In 1983, 50 years after the initial excavations, Olga was invited back to the site of Lachish, to see the more modern excavations by University of Tel Aviv. There she was greeted by 200 local archaeologists, who welcomed her enthusiastically.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Ermolaeva turned from children’s books to books for adults. <b>Her</b> <b>attention</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> epic and philosophical.
