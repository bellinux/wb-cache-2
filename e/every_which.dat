5|$|Ueland was {{unanimously}} fired as CEO by NSB's {{board on}} 29 June. Immediately afterwards his deputy Randi Flesland resigned, {{after she had}} rejected the board's proposal for her to become acting CEO. The same day, Adtranz assumed full responsibility for the defects, and guaranteed that they would cover NSB's costs. In a report, Adtranz stated that the axles should be examined <b>every</b> , <b>which</b> would mean weekly inspections. They stated that they hoped further inquiries {{would find a way}} to have less frequent inspections. This was rejected by NSB, who would not have sufficient trains to run the schedules with such a tight inspection scheme. Instead, Adtranz and NSB agreed to a new programme which would involve inspection every three weeks.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} in the Western film Unforgiven (1992) and the sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, as well as {{receiving}} nominations for Best Actor. Eastwood's greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> Way But Loose (1978) and its sequel, the action comedy Any Which Way You Can (1980), after adjustment for inflation.

25|$|McEachin played Mr. Turner, a tax {{collector}} for the I.R.S., {{and later a}} character called Solomon Jackson, a co-worker that Archie Bunker tries to recruit for his social club, on the television show All in the Family. He played the deejay Sweet Al Monte in Play Misty for Me (1971) with Clint Eastwood. In 1973, he starred as Harry Tenafly, the title character in Tenafly, a short-lived detective series about a police officer turned private detective who relied on his wits and hard work rather than guns and fistfights. He also appeared occasionally as Lieutenant Ron Crockett on Emergency!. In 1978, he played {{a police officer in}} <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> Way But Loose. In 1979, he played the role of a jaded ex-marine high school baseball coach in an episode ("Out at Home") of The White Shadow.|$|E

25|$|Early in Sonic Adventure 2, Knuckles and Rouge {{argue over}} the Emerald; {{she wants the}} pieces for her {{personal}} collection. Eggman tries to steal it, so Knuckles shatters it aboard Eggman's hovercraft, sending the pieces <b>every</b> <b>which</b> way. He spends the game recollecting the pieces similarly to in Adventure. He later helps Sonic, Tails, and Amy find Eggman's base inside a giant pyramid, {{as well as a}} key to an inner chamber housing a giant space shuttle. He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides the shards are worthless and dismissively lets him keep them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off. The game's antagonist Gerald Robotnik, Eggman's grandfather, initiates a program to send the ARK {{on a collision course with}} Earth as revenge for an attack on the ARK decades earlier, so Knuckles teams up with the other playable characters to reroute it.|$|E
500|$|An early draft had Hess {{surrounded}} by others sitting squarely around him. Hess felt the depiction {{had a more}} natural look, Rockwell objected, [...] "It was too diverse, it went <b>every</b> <b>which</b> way and didn't settle anywhere or say anything." [...] He felt the upward view from the bench level was more dramatic. Rockwell explained to Yates at The Post {{that he had to}} start Freedom of Speech from scratch after an early attempt because he had overworked it. Twice he almost completed the work only to feel it was lacking. Eventually, he was able to produce the final version with the speaker as the subject rather than the assembly. For the accompanying essay, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose novelist and dramatist Tarkington who was a Pulitzer Prize winner. People who purchased war bonds during the Second War Bond Drive received a full-color set of reproductions of the Four Freedoms that had a commemorative cover with Freedom of Speech on it.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, he {{directed}} {{and starred in}} The Gauntlet opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, William Prince, Bill McKinney, and Mara Corday. Eastwood portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mob. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it [...] "...classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny." [...] The following year, he starred in <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> Way But Loose in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. He played Philo Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his brother (played by Geoffrey Lewis) and an orangutan called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.|$|E

500|$|In 1980, Eastwood {{directed}} {{and played the}} title role in Bronco Billy alongside Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Sam Bottoms. Eastwood has cited Bronco Billy as {{being one of the}} most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character. The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood's career, but was liked by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that film was [...] "...the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. Later that year, Eastwood starred in Any Which Way You Can, the sequel to <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> Way But Loose. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as [...] "funnier and even better than its predecessor". Released over the Christmas season of 1980, Any Which Way You Can was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo <b>every</b> <b>which</b> way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} universal acclaim from critics. [...] Alex Denney NME {{called the}} song the [...] "heart-rending highlight" [...] of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and cited the vocal performance by Vernon as a [...] "quite brilliant effect." [...] Denney commented [...] "it frames Kanye’s inner demons in a universal way, recasting Vernon’s semi-mythical woodland retreat {{as his own}} cipher for spiritual replenishment". Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers called the song an important piece of the album, saying that the sampling of Bon Iver was both surprising and inspired, and noted the differences from [...] "Woods" [...] and [...] "Lost in the World". David Amidon of PopMatters viewed that the track contained [...] "glass-shattering bass", and viewed that the track [...] "storms out of all this dreariness with a thunderous, plodding house bass and Kanye taking Bon Iver in <b>every</b> <b>which</b> direction as the song exudes nothing but triumph." [...] Chris Martins of Spin stated that West managed to transform Iver's [...] "melancholic 'Woods' into a perversely bright experimental dance track." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that the song was difficult to classify as purely a rap song, noting that [...] "West’s music is born of hip-hop, but it now includes so many varieties that it feels most accurate to call it simply Kanye." [...] Jones noted than in less than the six minutes of the song's running time, West [...] "moves from a loner in the woods to his own isolation {{and on to the}} entire African-American experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Eastwood and Locke {{went on to}} star in The Gauntlet, <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> Way But Loose, Bronco Billy, Any Which Way You Can and Sudden Impact. According {{to former}} {{longtime}} associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several [...] "maintenance relationships" [...] (such as with Tunis) during that period. McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his [...] "habitual womanizing" [...] in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose, actress Jamie Rose (who played a bit part in Tightrope), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s) and Jacelyn Reeves, a stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves: a son Scott Eastwood (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988), whose birth certificates both said [...] "Father declined." [...] The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article {{was published in the}} Star tabloid in 1990. It quoted Reeves as saying [...] "Some family members tell me to file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to." [...] The children continued to be unacknowledged by mainstream news sources {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. Eastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time unaware of his infidelities) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for years. Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, Impulse. In court, Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a [...] "roommate" [...] before quickly redescribing her as a [...] "part-time roommate." [...] Locke's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her [...] "addiction" [...] to husband Gordon Anderson. Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to. [...] "In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation." [...] During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. [...] "I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room, and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them," [...] Locke quotes the informant. [...] "My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years of our relationship, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and having children with her. Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine." [...] As the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. She dropped her suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package which included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros., but sued him again for fraud in 1995 when she became convinced the deal with Warner was a sham, finally settling out of court in September 1996. Since then, Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood.|$|E
