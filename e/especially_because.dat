5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{critical}} or commercial success in its original release, The Wiz became a cult classic, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> it features Michael Jackson's only starring theatrical film role. With Lena Horne's death in 2010, Diana Ross is the only living cast member of the film.|$|E
5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Báthory {{lost his}} throne {{and his life}} {{fighting}} against Michael the Brave and his Székely allies in autumn. Michael the Brave administered Transylvania as RudolphII's governor, but his rule was unpopular among the noblemen, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of the pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers. As early as 9February 1600 Sigismund {{announced that he was}} ready to return to Transylvania. Moses Székely, a commander-in-chief during Michael the Brave's campaign against Moldavia in May, deserted Michael and came to Poland to meet Sigismund.|$|E

5|$|For ten centuries {{after the}} fall of the Roman Empire, {{lesbianism}} disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind; original sin among women was a particular concern, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> women were perceived as creating life. During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{anticipation}} {{when the}} first media for Unleashed was revealed was high, as the demonstration videos hinted at a possible return of Sonic to his traditional platforming roots, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of the series' declining quality in recent years, {{and a number of}} poorly received titles in the franchise that preceded it, such as the 2006 game, Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|E
5|$|Memling's style {{does not}} lend itself well to {{assigning}} dates, making a determination difficult. According to Stirling, an earlier date is easily accepted, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of stylistic similarities to Memling's 1479 St John Altarpiece, whereas Ainsworth leans toward the later date as more {{in keeping with the}} mature style of the late 1480s.|$|E

5|$|Several of the {{officers}} and petty officers {{in charge of the}} main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of the age of the guns and the turrets, in addition to their numerous maintenance problems. Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger, Iowas chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans {{raised a}} cry of grief and, {{mourning}} loudly, bewailed the fact that Troilus had met so grievous a death, for they remembered how young he was, who being {{in the early years}} of his manhood, was the people's favourite, their darling, not only because of his modesty and honesty, but more <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of his handsome appearance.|$|E
5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E

5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri {{always thought that}} Nintendo would reject his game, as the company did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games {{turned out to be}} a complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E
5|$|When {{projects}} are agreed upon with an island community, local rituals often {{coincide with the}} start of the project, particularly in the Pacific Islands, where a common custom involves drinking kava, a mildly narcotic drink made from the ground-up root of a pepper plant. The ritual is hundreds of years old, and has been described by the Seacology staff as being relaxing, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> of the friendly environment. Seacology staff often dress in local attire. The villagers perform dances, and the staff are invited to join in, often to the amusement of the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Yaginuma's work {{prior to}} {{serialization}} introduces readers to Asumi Kamogawa and her mentor, {{the ghost of}} a Lion astronaut whom she calls Mr. Lion. Their friendship develops in several short stories in which, throughout her childhood, he nurtures Asumi's interest in space. As her interest and dreams grow, Asumi is often ridiculed by classmates, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> she immerses herself in books about space and rarely engages in classroom activities. When she decides to apply for admission to the Tokyo Space Academy, her teachers urge her to reconsider because she is below average height. Her friendship with Mr. Lion continues to grow after Asumi successfully enters the academy, and she often consults him during periods of self-doubt.|$|E

5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, IUPAC {{published}} a recommendation on naming the disputed elements following the previous reports. For element 105, they proposed the name joliotium (Jl), after the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a significant {{contributor to the}} development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called nobelium. (The name nielsbohrium for element 107 was transformed to bohrium to conform with the practice set by all then-named elements.) This recommendation paper was generally met with criticism from the American scientists: their recommendations were scrambled (the names rutherfordium and hahnium, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were used for elements 106 and 108, respectively); both elements 104 and 105 were given names suggested by the Russian team despite earlier recognition of the Berkeley team as of an equal co-discoverer; and <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> the name seaborgium for element 106 was rejected for honoring a living person, a rule that had only just been approved. These names were to be accepted on a Council meeting in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} {{configurations of}} Lr+ and Lr2+ {{are expected to}} be 7s2 and 7s1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides which tend to be 5d1 as Ln2+. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr3+ cation, lawrencium is expected to behave like a typical actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, <b>especially</b> <b>because</b> the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH3 than LrH, and LrCO is expected to be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ2π1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is expected to be observed in LrCl3 just as it is for LuCl3 and more generally all the LnCl3, and the complex anion − is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital.|$|E
