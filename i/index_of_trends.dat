40|$|The use of line-transect methodology, on foot {{or from a}} helicopter, {{is likely}} to return the most repeatable, least biased {{estimates}} of kangaroo density. However, the associated costs make both methods impractical for broad-scale surveys. For these, a fixed-wing aircraft remains the most cost-effective platform. Limitations of the standard fixed-wing method (200 -m strip transacts) are well known, but {{it continues to be}} used because it provides an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>trends,</b> because there are now long runs of data (almost 20 years in some cases) collected in this standard form and an alternative method is lacking. In this study, four variations of fixed wing surveys of kangaroos were investigated: two line-transect methods (involving different scanning techniques), the standard 200 -m strip transect and a 100 -m strip transect. Surveys using these methods were compared with helicopter line-transect surveys along the same flight lines in three areas (5000 - 7500 km 2) in western Queensland. Both fixed-wing line-transect methods failed to produce consistently accurate estimates of density for all three species surveyed: red kangaroos (Macropus rufus), eastern grey kangaroos (M. giganteus) and common wallaroos (M. robustus). While generally more accurate than the uncorrected strip-transect counts, they were no less variable. However, the strip-transect counts still need to be corrected for bias for which this study offers revised estimates of correction factors for eastern grey kangaroos (3. 7 - 10. 2) and common wallaroos (3. 8 - 4. 1), and estimates for red kangaroos (1. 7 - 2. 7) that support currently used values. An attractive alternative is to survey in 100 -m strip transacts, which offer improved visibility (correction factors of 1. 0 - 1. 8 for red kangaroos, 2. 1 - 3. 6 for eastern grey kangaroos and 1. 7 - 2. 1 for common wallaroos) and are therefore likely to be more accurate and repeatable. However, these advantages need to be assessed in relation to continuing long runs of data using the standard 200 -m strip transect. Correction factors for wallaroos are conservative as helicopter-based density estimates are known to be underestimates. Further work is needed to assess the generality of correction factors, both spatially and temporally...|$|E

Unmodeled year-to-year variation in detectability may introduce bias, reduce precision <b>of</b> <b>trend</b> estimates, and reduce power to detect trends. We conducted dependent double-observer surveys at the annual fall raptor migration count at Lucky Peak, Idaho, in 2009 and 2010 and applied Huggins closed-capture removal models and information-theoretic model selection to determine {{the relative importance of}} factors affecting detectability. The most parsimonious model included effects of observer team identity, distance, species, and day of the season. We then simulated 30 years of counts with heterogeneous individual detectability, a population decline (λ = 0. 964), and unexplained random variation in the number of available birds. Imperfect detectability did not bias trend estimation, and increased the time required to achieve 80 % power by less than 11 %. Results suggested that availability is a greater source of variance in annual counts than detectability; thus, efforts to account for availability would improve the monitoring value of migration counts. According to our models, long-term trends in observer efficiency or migratory flight distance may introduce substantial bias to trend estimates. Estimating detectability with a novel count protocol like our double-observer method is just one potential means of controlling such effects. The traditional approach of modeling the effects of covariates and adjusting the index may also be effective if ancillary data is collected consistently...|$|R

As sociocultural emergents, dispositions function as natural cognitive categories with acts as members. Category boundaries are fuzzy, and acts within each category differ in their prototypicality of membership. A series of studies focusing on <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> act <b>trends</b> and on a comparative analysis of the internal structure of dispositions illustrates this basic formulation. The act frequency approach is then placed within a taxonomic framework of the relations among act categories (horizontal dimension) and hierarchic classification (vertical dimension).

Dispositional consistency is distinguished from behavioral consistency and several act frequency indices (e. g., dispositional versatility, situational scope) are defined. Situational analysis and personality coherence are then viewed from the act frequency perspective.

40|$|International audienceVarious {{combinations}} {{of data and}} expert opinion {{have been used to}} select species for <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> bird <b>trends.</b> Commonly these indices break species into groups based on their habitat preference such as woodland specialist, farmland specialist and generalist birds. It is unclear what influence differences in how species are allocated to these groups might have on trends in these indices. There is uncertainty surrounding reported trends in these bird groups with studies variously showing declines or increases in prevalence. This is usually attributed to ecological factors but if studies classify bird groups differently this variation may be due to inconsistency in classification. Disagreement about whether these bird groups are stable, increasing or declining has the potential to obscure important changes in bird prevalence and impede appropriate, timely conservation. We examined how consistently European and Australian researchers classified woodland, farmland and generalist birds, and whether this affected the <b>trends</b> in <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> these groups. Researchers from both regions classified species differently, and the population trends seen in these groups were strongly affected by differences in classification. While all classifications we studied suggest that populations are consistently declining for Australian woodland and European farmland birds and increasing for European woodland birds. European generalist and Australian farmland and generalist birds may be seen as increasing or decreasing in prevalence depending on classification. Our results question the current practice of idiosyncratically classifying indicators in scientific research and conservation. Current practice is making it more difficult to infer whether, when and how to preserve bird groups in Europe and Australia, potentially leading to sub-optimal biodiversity outcomes. We offer suggestions for building consensus on how to classify these bird groups in order to provide more reliable evidence to support conservation decisions...|$|R

A canonical correlation analysis between each <b>of</b> the <b>indices</b> and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) revealed two large-scale patterns that have contributed to the observed trends in the rainfall indices.

40|$|Plastic debris has {{significant}} {{environmental and economic}} impacts in marine systems. Monitoring is crucial to assess the efficacy of measures implemented to reduce the abundance of plastic debris, but it is complicated by large spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the amounts of plastic debris and by our limited understanding of the pathways followed by plastic debris and its long-term fate. To date, most monitoring has focused on beach surveys of stranded plastics and other litter. Infrequent surveys of the standing stock of litter on beaches provide crude estimates of debris types and abundance, but are biased by differential removal of litter items by beachcombing, cleanups and beach dynamics. Monitoring the accumulation of stranded debris provides an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> debris <b>trends</b> in adjacent waters, but is costly to undertake. At-sea sampling requires large sample sizes for statistical power to detect changes in abundance, given the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Another approach is to monitor the impacts of plastics. Seabirds and other marine organisms that accumulate plastics in their stomachs offer a cost-effective way to monitor the abundance and composition of small plastic litter. Changes in entanglement rates are harder to interpret, as they are sensitive to changes in population sizes of affected species.

Values obtained by density dependent yield table were compared with values of the yield table generated by Eraslan (1954) and Eraslan – Evcimen (1967) for the oak forests. The same comparison also was made with values of the yield table generated by Carus (1998) for beech forests with broad-leaved species...|$|R

40|$|Most of the tweets {{that users}} {{exchange}} on Twitter make implicit mentions of named-entities, {{which in turn}} can be mapped to corresponding Wikipedia articles using proper Entity Linking (EL) techniques. Some <b>of</b> those become <b>trending</b> entities on Twitter due to a long-lasting or a sudden effect on the volume of tweets where they are mentioned. We argue that the set <b>of</b> <b>trending</b> entities discovered from Twitter may help predict the volume of requests for relating Wikipedia articles. To validate this claim, we apply an EL technique to extract trending entities from a large dataset of public tweets. Then, we analyze the time series derived from the hourly trending score (i. e., an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> popularity) of each entity as measured by Twitter and Wikipedia, respectively. Our results reveals that Twitter actually leads Wikipedia {{by one or more}} hours...|$|R

Due to the relation between artificial insymmetrised patterns (AIP) and time series, stationary and temporary properties <b>of</b> stock market <b>indices</b> are identified. By filtering extreme events {{it is found that}} fluctuations are self-similar. Snap-shots in time lead to estimates for a temporary state of a market with respect to its history. It appears that close to a crash the AIP representation of a system becomes frozen. ...|$|R
