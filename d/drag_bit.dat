Tool-to-rock and rock-to-rock: friction coefficients are measured with the planing apparatus, for W- 31 tungsten carbide and Leuders limestone.

40|$|Improving {{drilling}} efficiency and mitigating risk are major objectives of Vibration Assisted Rotary Drilling (VARD). Understanding {{the behavior of}} vibration energy applied to enhance drilling Rate of Penetration (ROP) and reducing bit wear is extensively looked at in this research. [...] A series of tests and analysis was carried out to provide data {{for the evaluation of}} the effects of varying vibration frequency and amplitude in rotary drilling. Two separate drill bits: impregnated diamond <b>drag</b> <b>bit</b> and the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) were used. Vibration frequencies were varied at different levels of amplitudes. With water used as the drilling fluid and drilling at atmospheric condition, rock samples with known Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) were drilled with a fully instrumented laboratory drill rig, and all operating parameters were closely monitored. The interpretation of results shows that vibration rotary drilling using impregnated diamond <b>drag</b> <b>bit</b> and PDC bit at controlled vibration frequencies has significant performance increase in ROP compared with conventional rotary drilling. The contribution of vibration to this performance increase was found to be very significant. Drilling runs were short, of necessity, in this study and bit wear was not significant...|$|E

This paper proposes an {{analytical}} model to describe rock drilling processes using <b>drag</b> <b>bits</b> and rotary drills, and to induce relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke).

Laboratory tests verified the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively. Especially, the influence of friction on the flank face and the idle running was confirmed.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamical}} response of a rotary drilling {{system with a}} <b>drag</b> <b>bit,</b> using a lumped parameter model that takes into consideration the axial and torsional vibration modes of the bit. These vibrations are coupled through a bit-rock interaction law. At the bit-rock interface, the cutting process introduces a state-dependent delay, while the frictional process is responsible for discontinuous right-hand sides in the equations governing {{the motion of the}} bit. This complex system is characterized by a fast axial dynamics compared to the slow torsional dynamics. A dimensionless formulation exhibits a large parameter in the axial equation, enabling a two-time-scales analysis that uses a combination of averaging methods and a singular perturbation approach. An approximate model of the decoupled axial dynamics permits us to derive a pseudoanalytical expression of the solution of the axial equation. Its averaged behavior influences the slow torsional dynamics by generating an apparent velocity weakening friction law that has been proposed empirically in earlier work. The analytical expression of the solution of the axial dynamics is used to derive an approximate analytical expression of the velocity weakening friction law related to the physical parameters of the system. This expression can be used to provide recommendations on the operating parameters and the drillstring or the bit design {{in order to reduce the}} amplitude of the torsional vibrations. Moreover, it is an appropriate candidate model to replace empirical friction laws encountered in torsional models used for control...|$|E
40|$|Each brittle rock has a {{characteristic}} critical impact energy at which fractures develop extensively. This threshold energy level {{depends on the}} size distribution of flaws within the rock. The impact energy required for fracture development has been estimated and verified experimentally {{for a variety of}} rocks. A single impact below the critical energy level deforms the rock elastically and causes minor crushing. Crushing results from stress concentration at the bit tip. At critical energy, cracks propagate through the rock. Above the critical energy, crushing and cracking are the dominant failure modes. Rebound measured with a special fracture hammer on a variety of rocks correlated with ultrasonic pulse velocities as regards the indication of fracture development at critical impact energy. The impact energy required to cause fracture was marked by a sharp decrease in the hammer rebound. Point load tests showed up to 70 percent decrease in rock strength about the fracture energy level. The radius of the fractured zone delineated with ultrasonic tests ranged from 4 to 7 cm;The effectiveness of percussive impacts as a means of reducing rock strength is proven in this investigation. Results have significance in mechanical excavation of hard and abrasive rocks. Hard rock trenching requires higher cutting forces than available rotary trenchers can exert. Based on obtained results, a rational design is proposed for a percussion trencher. This trencher would prefracture and hence, weaken hard rocks by percussive impacts before <b>drag</b> <b>bit</b> action. Recommendations have also been made on the field use of the special impact hammer which was developed for this research.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{deals with}} the prediction of the theoretical net drilling time for a conductor pipe (CP) of offshore platforms when it plugs. The CP is driven to prevent the looser surface layer from caving in and obstructing the wellbore, because the shallow section of most wells on- and offshore is drilled in unconsolidated sediment. Due to the small CP diameter, the CP plugs very often. Normally the material is drilled out by using jetting, normal drill rigs and sometimes jack-up rigs. As offshore operations time is very important, this paper tries to assess the theoretical net time needed to excavate within the CP as a relief drilling operation, by means of Nishimatsu and Evans cutting theories. The results are compared with publicly available TBM excavation rates and then theoretical drilling rates for different unconfined compressive strength values for CP diameters of 700, 900 and 1000 mm are suggested.

40|$|In a novel {{approach}} to model stick-slip vibrations oc-curring when drilling with <b>drag</b> <b>bits,</b> the axial and tor-sional dynamics are coupled through the boundary con-ditions via a state-dependent delay. Moreover, friction is modelled by a rate-independent discontinuous term. A regime characterized by a low amplitude of the tor-sional vibrations and a high drilling efficiency is nu-merically observed for some sets of parameters. In this regime, the axial fast vibrations have a stabilizing effect on the torsional equilibrium. To understand this stabilizing mechanism, we are studying the decoupled axial equation obtained by freezing the delay. This approximation reflects the small variations of the delay when the bit experiences small torsional vibrations. Axial periodic solutions may be analysed independently. Particularities of this equation lie {{in the presence of}} a delayed term and a non-smooth non linearity. In this paper, we apply different well-known meth-ods to study the periodic orbits of the axial dynamics. The results and limitations of semi-analytical (Describ-ing Functions Method) and numerical procedures (Fi-nite Difference Method, Shooting Method) are exposed here.

40|$|Compared {{with other}} materials, most rocks {{generally}} fail in a brittle fashion rather than exhibiting yielding or purely plastic deformation. However, the initiation and coalescence of micro-cracks in the nonlinear region, {{known as the}} ‘fracture process zone’ (FPZ), are {{the primary reason for}} fracture propagation in rocks. Different elasticity-related models proposed for determining the features of the FPZ have not achieved an adequate understanding of its various fracture patterns. Based on previous experiments and numerical models, micro-crack density {{has been shown to be}} a function of loading history and to vary depending on whether the loading is monotonic or cyclic. The aim of the study reported here was to examine the different patterns of the FPZ under various types of cyclic loading and to quantitatively define damage and fracture patterns through the grains or rock matrix. Considerable laboratory testing was conducted, and fractured samples were investigated by computerised tomography scanning, supported by thin-section analysis. In the study, two different types of cyclic loading were tested: stepped and continuous. A diametral compressive loading was applied at predetermined amplitude and frequency with the continuous cyclic loading. The applied cyclic diametral compressive load was returned to the original level after each step, and at the next step, the amplitude started from zero, with stepped cyclic loading (SCL). An average 30 % strength reduction was found due to the SCL and emergence of high micro-fracture density in the FPZ.

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) of rocks from drilling data is a promising in-situ method and has been studied by many researchers. In most studies, experimental methods {{have been used to}} determine the relationship between UCS and drilling data. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to describe rock drilling processes using <b>drag</b> <b>bits</b> and rotary drills, and to deduce the relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process is divided into cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. There is a linear relation between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). The cutting forces and friction forces of both the rake surface and the flank surface are examined. Also, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank surface of the bit and the rock. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts respectively generated from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running. Torque caused by friction and idle running is ineffective for drilling, whereas that caused by cutting and indentation is effective. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts respectively from cutting, friction, feeding, and idle running. For the purposes of this study, effective specific energy is defined as the sum of specific energy consumed by cutting and feeding. Effective specific energy is independent of the penetration rate. Since it is proportional to the UCS of the rocks, it is not influenced by the penetration rate, and is more useful in the evaluation of UCS than other parameters. Some laboratory and field tests were conducted, and the results verified the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|The envisioned {{benefits}} of Diagnostics-While-Drilling (DWD) {{are based on}} the principle that high-speed, real-time information from the downhole environment will promote better control of the drilling process. Although in practice a DWD system could provide information related to any aspect of exploration and production of subsurface resources, the current DWD system provides data on drilling dynamics. This particular set of new tools provided by DWD will allow quicker detection of problems, reduce drilling flat-time and facilitate more efficient drilling (drilling optimization) with the overarching result of decreased drilling costs. In addition to providing the driller with an improved, real-time picture of the drilling conditions downhole, data generated from DWD systems provides researchers with valuable, high fidelity data sets necessary for developing and validating enhanced understanding of the drilling process. Toward this end, the availability of DWD creates a synergy with other Sandia Geothermal programs, such as the hard-rock bit program, where the introduction of alternative rock-reduction technologies are contingent on the reduction or elimination of damaging dynamic effects. More detailed descriptions of the rationale for the program and early development efforts are described in more detail by others [SAND 2003 - 2069 and SAND 2000 - 0239]. A first-generation low-temperature (LT) DWD system was fielded in a series of proof-of-concept tests (POC) to validate functionality. Using the LT system, DWD was subsequently used to support a single-laboratory/multiple-partner CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) entitled Advanced <b>Drag</b> <b>Bits</b> for Hard-Rock Drilling. The drag-bit CRADA was established between Sandia and four bit companies, and involved testing of a PDC bit from each company [Wise, et al., 2003, 2004] in the same lithologic interval at the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) test facility near Catoosa, OK. In addition, the LT DWD system has been fielded in cost-sharing efforts with an industrial partner to support the development of new generation hard-rock <b>drag</b> <b>bits.</b> Following the demonstrated success of the POC DWD system, efforts were initiated in FY 05 to design, fabricate and test a high-temperature (HT) capable version of the DWD system. The design temperature for the HT DWD system was 225 C. Programmatic requirements dictated that a HT DWD tool be developed during FY 05 and that a working system be demonstrated before the end of FY 05. During initial design discussions regarding a high-temperature system it was decided that, to the extent possible, the HT DWD system would maintain functionality similar to the low temperature system, that is, the HT DWD system would also be designed to provide the driller with real-time information on bit and bottom-hole-assembly (BHA) dynamics while drilling. Additionally, because of time and fiscal constraints associated with the HT system development, the design of the HT DWD tool would follow that of the LT tool. The downhole electronics package would be contained in a concentrically located pressure barrel and the use of externally applied strain gages with thru-tool connectors would also be used in the new design. Also, in order to maximize the potential wells available for the HT DWD system and to allow better comparison with the low-temperature design, the diameter of the tool was maintained at 7 -inches. This report discusses the efforts associated with the development of a DWD system capable of sustained operation at 225 C. This report documents work performed in {{the second phase of the}} Diagnostics-While-Drilling (DWD) project in which a high-temperature (HT) version of the phase 1 low-temperature (LT) proof-of-concept (POC) DWD tool was built and tested.
