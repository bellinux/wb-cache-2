40|$|To I. M. Gelfand on the {{occasion}} of his 90 th birthday Abstract. The paper completes the construction of a multidimensional topological version of differential Galois theory. We construct a rich class of germs of functions of several variables which is closed under superpositions and other natural operations. The main theorem describes the behavior of the monodromy groups of such germs under the natural operations. As a result, we obtain topological obstructions to the representability of functions <b>in</b> <b>quadratures,</b> which give the strongest known statements about unsolvability of equations in closed form. Key words: multivalued function, monodromy group, differential Galois theory, representability <b>in</b> <b>quadratures.</b> The present paper is the last in the series of papers [4 – 6] dealing with topological obstructions to the representability of a function of several variables <b>in</b> <b>quadratures.</b> Similar results for functions of one variable were obtained in my PhD thesis [1 – 3] written under Arnold’s supervision and defended in 1973.

2500|$|A second, {{and perhaps}} more correct, {{definition}} of [...] "compatible single sideband" [...] (CSSB) refers {{to a form of}} amplitude and phase modulation in which the carrier is transmitted along with a series of sidebands that are predominantly above or below the carrier term. [...] Since phase modulation is present in the generation of the signal, energy is removed from the carrier term and redistributed into the sideband structure similar to that which occurs in analog frequency modulation. [...] The signals feeding the phase modulator and the envelope modulator are further phase-shifted by 90° with respect to each other. [...] This places the information terms <b>in</b> <b>quadrature</b> with each other; the Hilbert transform of information to be transmitted is utilized to cause constructive addition of one sideband and cancellation of the opposite primary sideband. [...] Since phase modulation is employed, higher-order terms are also generated. [...] Several methods have been employed to reduce the impact (amplitude) of most of these higher-order terms. [...] In one system, the phase-modulated term is actually the log {{of the value of the}} carrier level plus the phase-shifted audio/information term. [...] This produces an ideal CSSB signal, where at low modulation levels only a first-order term on one side of the carrier is predominant. [...] As the modulation level is increased, the carrier level is reduced while a second-order term increases substantially in amplitude. [...] At the point of 100% envelope modulation, 6dB of power is removed from the carrier term, and the second-order term is identical in amplitude to carrier term. [...] The first-order sideband has increased in level until it is now at the same level as the formerly unmodulated carrier. [...] At the point of 100% modulation, the spectrum appears identical to a normal double-sideband AM transmission, with the center term (now the primary audio term) at a 0dB reference level, and both terms on either side of the primary sideband at −6dB. [...] The difference is that what appears to be the carrier has shifted by the audio-frequency term towards the [...] "sideband in use". [...] At levels below 100% modulation, the sideband structure appears quite asymmetric. [...] When voice is conveyed by a CSSB source of this type, low-frequency components are dominant, while higher-frequency terms are lower by as much as 20dB at 3kHz. [...] The result is that the signal occupies approximately 1/2 the normal bandwidth of a full-carrier, DSB signal. [...] There is one catch: the audio term utilized to phase-modulate the carrier is generated based on a log function that is biased by the carrier level. [...] At negative 100% modulation, the term is driven to zero (0), and the modulator becomes undefined. [...] Strict modulation control must be employed to maintain stability of the system and avoid splatter. [...] This system is of Russian origin and was described in the late 1950s. [...] It is uncertain whether it was ever deployed.|$|E
