40|$|Among all fossil fuels, {{natural gas}} is {{probably}} the most attractive one because of its higher heating value, and approximately 97 % methane content, which creates less hazardous emissions during power generation. Considering these important facts and the demand for natural gas in the world market, it would be unlikely to think of converting natural gas. However, if we want to utilize our planet’s limited natural gas resources better, then we need to explore alternative ways. A way to achieve that goal is direct cracking of natural gas via solar thermal processing. This paper describes advantages of solar cracking of natural gas from energy, environment and economic point of view. Results show that products of natural <b>gas</b> <b>decomposition</b> contain 8 % more energy per mole compared to natural gas itself, while the decomposition process does not emit any hazardous emissions to the environment. As for the economics, once the decomposition products of natural gas, namely hydrogen and carbon black, are sold separately, it is possible to make up to three times more revenue than the selling of natural gas. The products of natural <b>gas</b> <b>decomposition</b> have a very wide use in chemical and petroleum industries. For example, hydrogen is a crucial commodity to refine crude oil, while carbon black is the fundamental component in car tire, battery, conveyer belt, and printer ink manufacturing industries. Currently, petroleum industry produces hydrogen via steam reforming of methane and the chemical industry produces carbon black from coal or natural gas combustion in furnace, which are both highly toxic and global warming emissive processes.

Either amorphous or crystalline chromium oxides are obtained by photolysis of chromyl chloride CrO 2 Cl 2 for different experimental conditions. The most interesting product is obtained for a photolysis of CrO 2 Cl 2 at low pressure, on a cooled TiO 2 single-crystal substrate and for a higher beam energy. The growth begins with the formation of epitaxial CrO 2 metastable phase which is partly transformed into Cr 2 O 3 under UV irradiation. Due to crystallographic orientational relationships between CrO 2 and Cr 2 O 3, the growth of a well organized 3 D photonic crystal of Cr 2 O 3 phase goes on according to the 3 D periodic modulations of electromagnetic energy of the interference field. In the present case, the Cr 2 O 3 phase exhibits four sets of equivalent crystallographic orientations with respect to the single-crystal substrate. From such a result, one can expect to produce in a further work photonic crystals constituted of single-crystalline Cr 2 O 3 phase in epitaxy onto a Cr 2 O 3 or sapphire Al 2 O 3 substrate.

30|$|Pulsed laser {{irradiation}} on the SiO 2 {{surface in}} an SF 6 atmosphere induces <b>gas</b> <b>decomposition</b> [2]. It produces reactive species {{to restructure the}} glass surface too. The irradiations on amorphous SiO 2 glass were performed at different wavelengths [1, 2, 3]. During Nd:YAG laser irradiation, the possibility for energy absorption by free electrons via the inverse Bremsstrahlung (IB) process leads to increase in the electron–molecule collision rate and the generation of weak plasma. It rarely creates molecular formation in accordance with a larger amount of fluorine trace in the solid [1]. Furthermore, fluorine penetration in the silicon content under plasma treatment and the diffusion of ion implanted-F in Si have been previously studied by various spectroscopic techniques [4]. Though theoretical studies emphasize that F diffusion involves normal interstitial motion in the perfect Si crystal, anomalous diffusion causes the depletion of F to only occur at temperatures above 550  °C, suggesting a thermally activated process which is strongly temperature dependent. Direct observation of volatile Si oxy-fluoride and Si fluoride moieties between F and SiO 2 (or Si) precede desorption of F from Si. The driving force for the observed anomalous F migration remains unknown [4].

As a remedy for those drawbacks and a way to enhance the cell conversion efficiency at the same time, the employment of crystalline silicon nanoparticles (Si-NPs) in the a-Si matrix is proposed to organize the quantum-dot (QD) structure as the light-absorbing layer. This structure of the light absorbing layer consists of single-crystal Si-NPs in an a-Si:H thin-film matrix. The single-crystal Si-NPs are synthesized by using SiH 4 <b>gas</b> <b>decomposition</b> with CO 2 laser pyrolysis, and the sizes of Si-NPs are calibrated to control their bandgaps.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses are employed to verify the sizes and the crystalline properties of the Si-NPs alone and of the Si-NPs in the a-Si:H matrix.

The calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) content and the high-resolution carbon and oxygen isotope composition of the benthic foraminifera from the core 08 CF 7, from the northeastern Shenhu gas hydrate drilling area in the Baiyun Sag of the northern South China Sea were analyzed, and the benthic foraminifera's evidence for methane release from <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>decomposition</b> are presented here for the first time. Two rapid obvious carbon isotope negative excursions were observed in the oxygen isotope stage boundaries 5 d/ 5 c and 6 / 5 e (penultimate deglaciation, about 130 ka) of the cold-to-warm climatic transition period. The largest negative value of delta C- 13 is about - 2. 95 aEuro degrees, and the whole change of carbon and oxygen isotope is strikingly similar and is in consonance with the atmospheric methane concentration recorded by the Vostok ice core and the carbon isotopic record from Lake Baikal.
