40|$|Implementing {{monolithic}} <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> for {{low power}} portable applications {{with a standard}} low voltage CMOS technology leads to lower production costs and higher reliability. Moreover, it allows miniaturization by the integration of two units in the same die: the power management unit that regulates the supply voltage for the second unit, a dedicated signal processor, that performs the functions required. This paper presents original techniques that limit spikes in the internal supply voltage on a monolithic <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter,</b> extending {{the use of the}} same technology for both units. These spikes are mainly caused by fast current variations in the path connecting the external power supply to the internal pads of the converter power block. This path includes two parasitic inductances inbuilt in bond wires and in package pins. Although these parasitic inductances present relative low values when compared with the typical <b>external</b> inductances of <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters,</b> their effects can not be neglected when switching high currents at high switching frequency. The associated overvoltage frequently causes destruction, reliability problems and/or control malfunction. Different spike reduction techniques are presented and compared.

Although the efficiency of <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters</b> is changed by the output voltage level and the load current, most existing power management techniques simply ignore the efficiency variation of <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters.</b> However, without a careful consideration of the efficiency variation of <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters,</b> finding a true optimal power management will be impossible. In this paper, we {{solve the problem of}} energy minimization with the consideration of the characteristics of power consumption of <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters.</b> Specifically, the contributions of our work are as follows: 1) We analyze the effects of the efficiency variation of <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters</b> on a single-task execution in dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) scheme and propose the DC_DVS technique for dc–dc converter-aware energy-minimal DVS. 2) DC_DVS is then extended to embed an awareness of the characteristics of <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters</b> in general DVS techniques for multiple tasks. 3) We go on to propose a technique called DC_CONF for generating a <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converter</b> that is most energy efficient for a particular application. 4) We also present an integrated framework, i. e., DC-lp, based on DC_DVS and DC_CONF, which addresses <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converter</b> configuration and DVS simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract: <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters,</b> {{common in}} battery-driven, portable, and other high-efficiency systems, can deliver {{efficiencies}} greater than 95 % while boosting, reducing, or inverting supply voltages. Resistance {{in the power}} source {{is one of the}} most important factors that can limit efficiency. This application note describes the effects of source resistance, how to calculate efficiency, real-world considerations, design considerations, and shows a real-world example. <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> are commonly used in battery-operated equipment and other power-conserving applications. Like a linear regulator, the <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> can regulate to a lower voltage.

As an added bonus, the <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> boasts efficiencies greater than 95 % under optimum conditions. However, this efficiency is limited by dissipative components. The main cause is resistance in the power source. Losses due to source resistance can lower the efficiency by 10 % or more, exclusive of loss in the <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter!</b> If the converter has adequate input voltage, its output will be normal and there may be no obvious indication that power is being wasted.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Energy Harvesting from Exercise Machines (EHFEM) project {{seeks to}} harness the energy {{generated}} by people using exercise machines and deliver this energy to the electric grid [1]. The implementation consists of a protection system, <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter,</b> and an inverter. This project involves redesigning the existing DC-DC input protection circuit and current limiter for the EHFEM project [2]. The <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> takes in the power from the exercise machines and converts it to a manageable voltage level for the inverter. Due to a problem where the inverter may overload the converter, a current limiter sets to limit the current between the two circuits [4].

The input protection circuit for the <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> presents another major component of the protection system.
