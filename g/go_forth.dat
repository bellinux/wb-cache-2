Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna {{as a witness}} to the murder of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross burning, and a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E

25|$|MCC {{decided to}} commemorate Grace's {{life and career}} with a Memorial Biography, {{published}} in 1919.

That such a volume should <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> {{under the auspices of the}} Committee of MCC is in itself unique in the history of the game, and that such an array of cricketers, critics and enthusiasts should pay tribute to its finest exponent has no parallel in any other branch of sport. In itself this presents a noble monument of what W. G. Grace was, a testimony to his prowess and to his personality.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} such a request came from a long-standing {{understanding}} between the CIA and the FBI {{that they would not}} reveal each other’s informants. This effort by the White House and the CIA succeeded in delaying the interviews of both Ogarrio and Dahlberg for a little more than one week, at which point Gray and his senior FBI staff, including Mark Felt, Charlie Bates, and Bob Kunkel, decided that, due the increasing importance of these individuals in the investigation, they needed a written request from the CIA not to interview them, which would have to state in greater detail the reasons for not interviewing these individuals. Once the decision was made, Gray called Vernon Walters and demanded that written request the next morning, or he would order the interviews to <b>go</b> <b>forth.</b>|$|E

25|$|Eventually {{a man was}} sighted who {{approached}} the settlement shouting. When near enough to be heard, he cried that Menéndez had taken the French fort and put all the French to the sword. A procession was formed to <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> and meet the victor. Soon after his triumphant reception in the fort, Menéndez heard of Ribault's party having been wrecked, and learned that a detachment had {{made its way to}} Matanzas Inlet. After an ineffective interview and an offer of 100,000 ducats ransom, the Huguenots surrendered to Menéndez, and met the same fate as their comrades at Fort Caroline. A second party, with Ribault himself, were also slain {{at the hands of the}} Spanish. A few, however, who belonged to the Catholic faith, were spared. The Indians, who had been particularly friendly with the French, resented the Spanish invasion and the cruelty of Menéndez, and led by their chief Saturiwa, made war upon the Spanish settlers. The latter were running short of provisions and mutinied during the absence of Menéndez, who had gone back to Cuba for relief, and who finally had to seek it from the King in person in 1567.|$|E

[...] In his commentary on the Torah (the Five Books of Moses), Nahmanides contends that Moses asked each Jew to come before him to be counted.

500|$|In January 1866 George was {{appointed}} headmaster of Liverpool College, {{and the family}} moved to premises in the Dingle area. Despite the new surroundings, Josephine continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.|$|E
500|$|In 1616, {{two years}} after Peacham's Case, the case of commendams arose. The in commendam writ was a method of {{transferring}} ecclesiastical property, which James used in this case to allow Richard Neile to hold his bishopric and associated revenues without actually performing the duties. On 25 April 1616 the courts, at Coke's bidding, held that this action was illegal, writing to the king that [...] "in case any letters come unto us contrary to law, we do nothing by such letters, but certify your Majesty thereof, and <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> to do the law notwithstanding the same". James called the judges before him and, furious, ripped up the letter, patronisingly telling them that [...] "I well know the true and ancient common law {{to be the most}} favourable to Kings of any law in the world, to which law I do advise you my Judges to apply your studies". While all the other judges [...] "succumbed to royal pressure and, throwing themselves on their knees, prayed for pardon", Coke defended the letter and stated that [...] "When the case happens I shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do".|$|E

500|$|In 1956 Sinatra {{featured}} alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, {{earning a}} reported $250,000 for the picture. The public {{rushed to the}} cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over $13 million at the box office, {{becoming one of the}} highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings [...] "The Lady Is a Tramp" [...] to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song [...] "All the Way" [...] won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings <b>Go</b> <b>Forth</b> with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. [...] "High Hopes", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks.|$|E
500|$|Josephine Butler (1828–1906) was an English {{feminist and}} social {{reformer}} in the Victorian era. She was especially {{concerned with the}} welfare of prostitutes although she campaigned on {{a broad range of}} women's rights. In 1864 her daughter Eva fell [...] from the top-floor bannister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. The death led Butler to begin a career of campaigning that ran until the end of her life; she later wrote that after the death she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] Her targets included obtaining the vote, the right to better education and the end of coverture in British law, although she achieved her greatest success in leading the movement to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. She was also opposed to the forced medical examination of prostitutes—a process she described as [...] "surgical" [...] or [...] "steel rape". Her campaigning led to the suspension of the practice in April 1883, and the Acts were formally repealed in three years later.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 38, High {{says that}} there are many men in Valhalla, and many more who will arrive, yet they will [...] "seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] In chapter 51, High foretells that as part of the events of Ragnarök, after Fenrir's son Sköll has {{swallowed}} the sun and [...] his other son Hati Hróðvitnisson has swallowed the moon, the stars will disappear from the sky. The earth will shake violently, trees will be uprooted, mountains will fall, and all binds will snap – Fenrisúlfr will be free. Fenrisúlfr will <b>go</b> <b>forth</b> with his mouth opened wide, his upper jaw touching the sky and his lower jaw the earth, and flames will burn from his eyes and nostrils. Later, Fenrisúlfr will arrive at the field Vígríðr with his sibling Jörmungandr. With the forces assembled there, an immense battle will take place. During this, Odin will ride to fight Fenrisúlfr. During the battle, Fenrisúlfr will eventually swallow Odin, killing him, and Odin's son Víðarr will move forward and kick one foot into the lower jaw of the wolf. This foot will bear a legendary shoe [...] "for which the material has been collected throughout all time." [...] With one hand, Víðarr will take hold of the wolf's upper jaw and tear apart his mouth, killing Fenrisúlfr. High follows this prose description by citing various quotes from Völuspá in support, some of which mention Fenrir.|$|E
