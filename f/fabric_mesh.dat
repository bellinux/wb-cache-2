2500|$|Peggy Moffitt modeled {{the suit}} for Gernreich. She {{said it was}} a logical {{evolution}} of Gernreich's avant-garde ideas in swimwear design as much as a scandalous symbol of the permissive society. In the 1960s, the monokini led the way into the sexual revolution by emphasizing a woman's personal freedom of dress, even when her attire was provocative and exposed more skin than had been the norm during the more conservative 1950s. Like all swimsuits, the monokini bottom portion of the swimsuit can vary in cut. Some have g-string style backs, while others provide full coverage of the rear. The bottom of the monokini may be high cut, reaching to the waist, with high cut legs, or may be a much lower cut, exposing the belly button. The modern monokini, which is less racy than Gernreich's original design, takes its design from the bikini, and is also described as [...] "more of a cut-out one-piece swimsuit," [...] with designers using <b>fabric,</b> <b>mesh,</b> chain, or other materials to link the top and bottom sections together, though the appearance may not be functional, but rather only aesthetic. In recent years, the term has come into use for topless bathing by women: where the bikini has two parts, the monokini is the lower part. Where monokinis are in use, the word bikini may jokingly refer to a two-piece outfit consisting of a monokini and a sun hat. The original monokini is still sold by Victoria's Secret as a half-kini.|$|E

Specifically, the collection effi-ciency (CE) was measured for fog drops passing through <b>mesh</b> <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Meshes</b> composed of cotton, nylon, and Teflon were inves-tigated, {{and the effect of}} the material as well as mesh porosity was determined. Collection efficiencies ranging from 5 % to 50 % were obtained. The ultimate goal of this work is to employ such meshes in a parachute configuration above power plant cooling towers, so that condensed fog may be collected and returned to the cooling loop. It is shown that the drop diameters and velocities investigated here are similar to those observed above cooling towers. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4031969]...|$|R

50|$|Many modern {{papermaking}} {{machines are}} based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a specially woven plastic <b>fabric</b> <b>mesh</b> conveyor belt (known as a wire as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. After the forming section the wet web passes through a press section to squeeze out excess water, then the pressed web passes through a heated drying section.|$|E
50|$|The warp {{is divided}} into two {{overlapping}} groups, or lines (most often adjacent threads belonging to the opposite group) that run in two planes, one above another, so the shuttle can be passed between them in a straight motion. Then, the upper group is lowered by the loom mechanism, and the lower group is raised (shedding), allowing to pass the shuttle in the opposite direction, also in a straight motion. Repeating these actions form a <b>fabric</b> <b>mesh</b> but without beating-up, the final distance between the adjacent wefts would be irregular and far too large.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis: Fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP) are {{investigated in}} this study in comparison with {{a new class of}} materials, textile reinforced mortars (TRM), for shear strengthening and/or seismic retrofitting of concrete structures. Textiles comprise <b>fabric</b> <b>meshes</b> made of long woven, knitted or even unwoven fiber rovings in at least two (typically orthogonal) directions. Mortars – serving as binders – contain polymeric additives in order to have improved strength properties. In this study, experimental investigations were carried out in order to provide a better understanding on the effectiveness of TRM versus FRP jackets as a means of increasing: (i) the axial capacity of concrete through confinement; and (ii) the load-carrying capacity of shear-critical reinforced concrete flexural members. From the results obtained it is strongly believed that the proposed TRM strengthening technique is a viable alternative to the already successful FRP strengthening technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{upgrading}} {{of existing}} reinforced concrete (RC) structures through jacketing of columns {{has become a}} very popular technique in a increasingly large number of rehabilitation projects, both seismic and non-seismic. The use of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) has gained considerable popularity among all jacketing techniques, due to the favorable properties offered by these materials, namely high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, ease and speed of application, and minimal change of geometry. Despite all these advantages, the FRP retrofitting technique has a few drawbacks, e. g. poor behavior at high temperatures; high costs; inapplicability on wet surfaces or at low temperatures; and difficulty to conduct post-earthquake assessment behind FRP jackets; these are mainly attributed to the organic epoxy resins used to bind the fibres. An interesting alternative to FRP materials are the so-called Textile-Reinforced Mortars (TRM). These new materials are made of textiles, that is <b>fabric</b> <b>meshes</b> made of long woven, knitted or even unwoven fiber rovings {{in at least two}} directions, impregnated with inorganic binders, such as cement-based mortars. In the present study the authors are investigating experimentally the use of TRM jackets as a means of confining poorly detailed old-type RC columns with deformed rebars, which suffer from limited deformation capacity under seismic loads due to either buckling of the longitudinal bars or bond failure at lap splice regions...|$|R

40|$|An improved, {{lightweight}} {{design has}} been proposed for super-pressure balloons used to carry scientific instruments at high altitudes in the atmosphere of Earth for times as long as 100 days. [A super-pressure balloon {{is one in which}} the pressure of the buoyant gas (typically, helium) is kept somewhat above ambient pressure in order to maintain approximately constant density and thereby regulate the altitude. ] The proposed design, called "meshed pumpkin," incorporates the basic concept of the pumpkin design, which is so named because of its appearance. The pumpkin design entails less weight than does a spherical design, and the meshed-pumpkin design would reduce weight further. The basic idea of the meshed-pumpkin design is to reinforce the membrane of a pumpkin balloon by attaching a strong, lightweight <b>fabric</b> <b>mesh</b> to its outer surface. The reinforcement would make it possible to reduce the membrane mass to one-third or less of that of the basic pumpkin design while retaining sufficient strength to enable the balloon to remain at approximately constant altitude for months...|$|E
