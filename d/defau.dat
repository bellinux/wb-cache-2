40|$|As an {{important}} variant of Reiter's default logic, Poole (1988) developed a nonmonotonic reasoning framework {{in the classical}} first-order language. Brewka and Nebel extended Poole's approach in order to enable a representation of priorities between defaults. In this paper we present a general framework for default reasoning, which {{can be viewed as}} a common generalization of the three approaches above. We prove that the syntax-independent default reasoning in this framework is identical to general belief revision operation introduced by Zhang et al. (1997). This result provides a solution to the problem whether there is a correspondence between belief revision and <b>defau</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In [Siegel and Forget, 1996] a new non {{monotonic}} logic namely Xlogics was defined. In this formalism, useful for proof procedure, the non-monotonic inference relation `X {{is defined by}} A `X B if every classical theorem of A [B which is in X is a theorem of A. We proved that every preferential logic is an X-logic, and we studied the particular case of circumscription without free predicate in the finite case. We found a set X smaller than the general one which simplifies {{the complexity of the}} proof procedure. In this paper, this result is extended to the case of circumscription with free predicates. KEYWORDS: non{{monotonic logic}}, preferential model approach, representation theorem, X-logic 1 INTRODUCTION Roughly, non-monotonic logics can be classified in two classes. First, the "preferential approach" (more semantical, like circumscription [McCarthy, 1980]), where the property of non-monotonicity comes from an order relation among models. The second approach (more syntactic, like <b>defau</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the use of}} <b>defau</b> t know edge in concept earning from positive and negative examp es. Two connectives are added to a description ogics, C-CLASSIC, previous y defined for concept earning. The new connectives (# and #) allow to express the idea that some properties of a given concept definition are default properties, and that some properties that should belong to the concept definition actually do not (these are excepted properties). When performing concept learning both hypotheses and examples are expressed in this new description logics but prior to learning, a saturation process using default and non default rules has {{to be applied to}} the examples in order to add default and excepted properties to their definition. As in the originalC-CLASSIC, disjunctive learning is performed using a standard greedy set covering algorithm whose generalization operator is the Least Common Subsumer operator of C-CLASSIC ##. We exemplify concept learning using default knowledge in this framework and show that explicitly expressing default knowledge may result in simpler concept definitions. ...|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} early editions of Marot's Œuvres were published at Lyon in 1538 and 1544. In {{the second of}} these the arrangement of his poems which has been accepted in later issues was first adopted; in 1596 an enlarged edition was edited by François Mizière. The Parisian printer Denis Janot, however, also printed several important editions of books by Marot. Others of later date are those of Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy (The Hague, 1731) and P. Jannet (1868-1872; new ed., 1873-1876), on the whole the best, {{but there is a}} very good selection with a still better introduction by Charles d'Héricault, the joint editor of the Jannet edition in the larger Collection Garnier (no date). From an elaborate edition by G. Guiffrey only Vol. II and III appeared during his lifetime. Robert Yve-Plessis and Jean Plattard completed the edition in 5 vols (Paris, 1874-1931).The first 'scientific' edition is by C. A. Mayer in 6 vols.(1958-1980), which follows the arrangement of the material in 'genres' (like the edition 1544).The last complete scientific edition is by Gérard <b>Defaux</b> in 2 vols. (1990-92). <b>Defaux</b> adopts the edition principles of Marot himself, as deductible from his own 1538 edition, mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|Assassin's Creed Volume 1: Desmond is a French-language graphic novel {{written by}} Eric Corbeyran and drawn by Djilalli <b>Defaux.</b> It has been {{released}} in France, Canada, Belgium, Poland and Italy. The comic book was published on November 13, 2009, {{a few days before}} Assassin's Creed II was released. The story is a retelling of events from Assassin's Creed and the beginning of Assassin's Creed II, mostly from Desmond's modern perspective; for example it is revealed that Lucy helped the Templars to kidnap Desmond. It also features Subject 16 (referred to as Michael) and a Roman assassin named Aquilus. However, events in the comic book are different from what happens in the game. It is said that Subject 16 is alive but trapped in the animus, a virtual reality simulator used to relive memories of ancient relatives, but there's no mention of Shaun or Rebecca.|$|R
