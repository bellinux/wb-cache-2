40|$|The fluid bubble {{eliminator}} (FBE) is {{a device}} that removes gas bubbles from a flowing liquid. The FBE contains no moving parts and does not require any power input beyond that needed to pump the liquid. In the FBE, the buoyant force for separating the gas from the liquid is provided by a radial pressure gradient associated with a centrifugal flow of the liquid and any entrained bubbles. A device based on a similar principle is described in Centrifugal Adsorption Cartridge System (MSC- 22863), which appears on page 48 of this issue. The FBE was originally intended for use in filtering bubbles out of a liquid flowing relatively slowly in a bioreactor system in microgravity. Versions that operate in normal Earth gravitation at greater flow speeds may also be feasible. The FBE (see figure) is constructed as a cartridge that includes two concentric cylinders with flanges at the ends. The outer cylinder is an impermeable housing; the inner cylinder comprises a gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane covering a perforated inner tube. Multiple spiral disks that collectively constitute a spiral ramp are mounted {{in the space between}} the inner and outer cylinders. The liquid enters the FBE through an <b>end</b> <b>flange,</b> flows in the annular space between the cylinders, and leaves through the opposite <b>end</b> <b>flange.</b> The spiral disks channel the liquid into a spiral flow, the circumferential component of which gives rise to the desired centrifugal effect. The resulting radial pressure gradient forces the bubbles radially inward; that is, toward the inner cylinder. At the inner cylinder, the gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane allows the bubbles to enter the perforated inner tube while keeping the liquid in the space between the inner and outer cylinders. The gas thus collected can be vented via an endflange connection to the inner tube. The centripetal acceleration (and thus the radial pressure gradient) is approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed and approximately inversely proportional to an effective radius of the annular space. For a given FBE geometry, one could increase the maximum rate at which gas could be removed by increasing the rate of flow to obtain more centripetal acceleration. In experiments and calculations oriented toward the original microgravitational application, centripetal accelerations between 0. 001 and 0. 012 g [where g normal Earth gravitation (. 9. 8 m/s 2) ] were considered. For operation in normal Earth gravitation, it would likely be necessary to choose the FBE geometry and the rate of flow to obtain centripetal acceleration comparable to or greater than g...|$|E

This work seeks to investigate the influence of non-central and multiple distributed vents on the explosion overpressure. A 10 L cylindrical vessel of 460 mm length and 162 mm diameter (L/D= 2. 8) was used for vented explosion with free venting (without a vent cover). Three different vent coefficient (Kv) were investigated, Kv, 3. 6, 5. 4 and 10. 9 for both non-central and 4 hole vents. 10 % methane-air and 7. 5 % ethylene-air mixtures were investigated to determine the influence of the mixture reactivity. The position of the spark ignition was in the centre of the <b>end</b> <b>flange</b> opposite the vent. It was shown for the non-central vent that the flame speed upstream of the vent was lower than for a central vent and this reduced the mass flow through the vent, which reduced the overpressure and reducing the external explosion due to the lower exit velocity of the unburnt gas and hence lower external turbulence. The external flame jets downstream of the vent was influenced by the increase in characteristic length scale of the vent, which was changed by increasing the number of vents...|$|E

40|$|A droplet {{detection}} method {{has been developed}} to measure the distribution of droplet sizes on a flat plate under dropwise condensation. Dropwise condensation heat transfer may be modeled by combining an expression for the single droplet heat transfer rate with the droplet size distribution. The ability to measure this distribution is integral to the validation of such models. An example study is undertaken in which heat flux is obtained for a given surface treatment by implementing such a model and measuring the droplet size distribution. These results are compared with the heat flux measured by internal coolant temperature monitoring for external condensation on a tube featuring the same surface treatment. The plate condensing heat exchanger is a modular design for condensate visualization. The core of the design is a four way pipe cross with open flanges on each <b>end.</b> <b>Flange</b> caps are designed to accomplish the goal of condensate visualization, and are easily exchangeable depending on design intent. The sample side flange features a conductive contact between an external cold plate and internally mounted sample. A viewing flange opposite the sample side flange allows for lighting and capture of video data of the condensation process. A third flange features an internal, concentric boiler for steam generation. A vacuum pump valve and ambient temperature and pressure sensors are fitted to the fourth flange cap. Dropwise condensation models are explored in this setup by detection of droplets in the captured video data. Droplet detection is performed by a Circle Hough Transform that has been modified to handle the order of magnitude differences in droplet radii within the same image. The Circle Hough Transform is applied to detect a radius range corresponding to the largest droplets, then the next largest droplets, and so on until the smallest detectable droplets have been marked. Detections in any given stage of the modified Circle Hough Transform are used to mask the detection region for the next stage. This reduces detection noise emanating from larger droplets that would otherwise overwhelm detections of smaller droplets. Another technique used in reducing detection noise involves illumination leveling, morphological erosion, and morphological reconstruction of the video data. The combination of these methods yield measurements of the droplet size distribution suitable for heat transfer analysis. The droplet size distribution is dependent upon a balance between droplet growth and sweeping of condensate, which is observable by analyzing the distribution in each frame of the video data. While the distribution is constant for very large condensing surfaces, the local droplet size distribution varies as droplets nucleate, grow, coalesce, and are swept away by departing droplets. This apparatus and {{detection method}} {{make it possible to}} observe time dependent growth and sweeping mechanisms as well as the droplet size distribution that emerges from these mechanisms. This study demonstrates the utility of the apparatus and detection method for the validation of dropwise condensation heat transfer models...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} flow to a pump must be undisturbed {{and free}} from unequal velocity distributions, unequal pressure distributions, entrained air or gas bubbles, vortices and excessive pre-swirl. A reducer fitting is typically used in pump station pipe {{work to reduce}} the size of the suction pipe to match the size of the pump suction <b>end</b> <b>flange.</b> Two types of reducer fittings are commonly manufactured, namely: Eccentric Reducers and Concentric Reducers. Inlet pipework design guidelines traditionally prescribe the use of eccentric reducers, with the flat side on top. This prescription is to allow the transport of air through the fitting. The flow through an eccentric reducer accelerates along the sloped side as the flow path narrows from below, thereby causing higher velocities towards this sloped side. These flow conditions are contradictory to the recommended pump inlet approach flow conditions and pump station failures have been recorded resulting from the incorrect application of eccentric reducers. Relationships exist to assess the hydraulic transportation of air through a pipe and these relationships can be applied to calculate the ability to transport air through a concentric reducer. It is therefore hypothesised that a correctly designed concentric reducer will not only provide a more uniform pressure/velocity distribution in comparison to an eccentric reducer, but will allow any free air to be hydraulically transported through the reducer to the pump. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was utilised to assess the resulting velocity distributions through various concentric and eccentric reducer geometries at various flow rates. Six concentric reducers and six eccentric reducers were simulated with four inlet velocities. The resulting velocity distributions were recorded with scalar scenes and velocity probes at four positions spaced at a distance of 1 x the downstream diameter starting at the downstream end of the reducer. These velocity distributions were then compared to the pump inlet requirements typically used in the industry. These requirements require the velocity variation along a line drawn through the centre of the pipe to be less than 10 % of the average velocity along that line and the velocity variation along a circle within the pipe is less than 5 % of the average velocity along the circle. It was found that the eccentric reducers with angles of 15 °, 20 ° and 30 ° and the concentric reducer with an angle of 20 ° do not pass the requirements used in the assessment at all four velocities. From these results it was highlighted that some of the standard eccentric reducer geometries (including those specified by AWWA C 208) do not pass the inlet requirements. It was then assessed if air can be hydraulically transported through the concentric reducers utilising available hydraulic air transport theory. Air can be hydraulically transported through all of the concentric reducers except for the 20 ° reducer (the same size that failed the velocity distribution assessment) at 1 m/s for the assessed diameters. It was therefore shown that a correctly designed concentric reducer (angle less or equal to 15 °) will not only provide a more uniform pressure/velocity distribution in comparison to an eccentric reducer, but will allow air to be hydraulically transported through the reducer to the pump.

The operating environment of this duct was defined and then an extensive mechanical and physical property test program was conducted using material made by processing techniques which were also established by this program. Based on these properties, design concepts to fabricate a composite version of the duct were established and two complete ducts fabricated. One of these ducts was proof pressure tested and then run successfully on a factory test engine for over 1900 hours.

Figure 1 is an illustration of such a welded joint, in which the dimensions are taken from a sample weldment made by Ferranti Sciaky. This note is to give an estimation of the longitudinal and transverse losses contributed by these weldments. For this purpose, the elliptical crosssection of the structure shown in Fig. 1 is approximated by a circular one. The 2 D code TBCI is then employed to calculate the losses for three different beam bunch lengths, which are, respectively, 0. 58, 1. 16, and 1. 76 cm. The separation between two neighboring weldments varies from 2. 5 inches to 15 inches. This distance is large compared to the dimensions of the welded" joint. Therefore, the composition rule discussed in Ref. 1 can be applied here. It says that one need only compute the losses of one weldment and that the losses of two neighboring weldments are just two times as large. This means a big saving of CPU time. To check the validity of this rule in our case, we also calculate the longitudinal loss of a two-weldment structure, which is shown in Fig. 2, for a bunch length of 0. 58 cm. The separation between the two weldments is chosen to be 2. 5 inches ~ The result agrees rather well with what is predicted by the composition rule.

To determine the bearing capacity of cold-formed channel sections, a unified design equation with different bearing coefficients is given in the current North American specification AISI S 100 and the Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 4600. However, coefficients are not available for unlipped channel sections that are normally fastened to supports through their flanges. Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 includes bearing capacity equations for different load cases, but does not distinguish between fastened and unfastened support conditions. Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to determine the bearing capacities of these sections as used in floor systems. Twenty-eight web bearing tests on unlipped channel sections with restrained flanges were conducted under <b>End</b> One <b>Flange</b> (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Using the results from this study, a new equation was proposed within the AISI S 100 and AS/NZS 4600 guidelines to determine the bearing capacities of cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges fastened to supports. A new design rule was also proposed based on the direct strength method...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to extend the “Direct strength method” for determining the web crippling strength of cold-formed steel C and Z sections subjected to <b>End</b> one <b>flange</b> loading and Interior one flange loading conditions. Direct strength method is applied for designing the columns and beams earlier. The existing specifications equation for calculating the web crippling strength of cold-formed steels designed by American Institute of Iron and Steel is very old method and {{it is based on the}} extensive experimental investigations conducted at different universities. Calculating the web crippling strength of cold-formed steels using direct strength method is a new technique. In the present research the web crippling strength of cold-formed steels were calculated using Direct Strength Method. The experimental data is collected from the tests that were conducted at different universities. The critical buckling strength of the members were calculated using Abaqus. Microsoft excel is used to generate the equations. The safety and resistance factors for the designed equations were calculated using “Load and resistance factor design” and “Allowable strength design” from North American Cold-Formed Steel Specification, 2012 edition book...|$|R
30|$|Firstly, {{complete}} {{the construction of}} the experimental equipment, which is shown in Fig.  2. Secondly, applying the same weight at both <b>ends</b> of the <b>flange</b> plate is equivalent to the torque applied to the shaft. In the experiment, the applied torque is 9.71  Nm, 19.02  Nm, 28.32  Nm, 37.59  Nm, 46.88  Nm, 56.13  Nm, 65.48  Nm, 74.76  Nm, 84.05  Nm, and 93.35  Nm. The torque can change the deflection angle of the magnetization vector of the shaft, and then, the non-contact signal extraction circuit can detect the deflection angle. The deflection angle of the magnetization vector under the corresponding torque action can be obtained from Formula (10). Finally, the relation between torque and the deflection angle of the magnetization vector can be obtained.|$|R
