5|$|Rowling <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to finish}} Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets {{because she was}} afraid it would {{not live up to}} the {{expectations}} raised by Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US). After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.|$|E
5|$|Sunny <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to express}} {{herself to the}} other female teens on her first day in Ramsay Street and instead she chose to talk to 'Lost Boy' from the radio station, Pirate Net about her past and her hurtful {{relationship}} with her sister.|$|E
5|$|Sylvester was {{considered}} to be a prima donna by members of the Hot Band and could be temperamental and difficult with those whom he worked with. He <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> saving the money that he earned, instead spending it as soon as he obtained it, both on himself and on his lovers, friends, and family.|$|E
60|$|They were alone, and Jacob <b>found</b> <b>it</b> {{exceedingly}} <b>difficult</b> {{to think}} of anything to say.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. Mr. Sabin had seldom <b>found</b> <b>it</b> more <b>difficult</b> to see the {{way before}} him.|$|R
6000|$|In nobody's {{difficult}}ies, {{he would}} have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very <b>difficult</b> to answer; very difficult indeed to smile, and say 'Who?' ...|$|R
5|$|The {{final scene}} {{took a long}} time to write. The writing staff <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to come up with a {{resolution}} that would end on positive terms for Bart and Homer, and was originally different when it was read at the writing table.|$|E
5|$|When word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to believe, and {{his wife}} fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's {{candidacy}} would not be successful, as he knew she {{would not like to}} live in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Yaron {{had never}} {{acted in a}} role with a romance before and at certain points <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to portray the {{emotions}} her character felt when interacting with Yochay. Cinematographer Asaf Sudry assisted in conveying to the audience that the marriage between the lead characters would eventually take place by frequently using sunlight for their scenes.|$|E
60|$|When Beatrice returned, Holiday {{insisted she}} should play again. She would have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> more <b>difficult</b> to refuse than to comply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Been {{having it}} out with Mrs. Ratcliffe?" [...] he said. [...] "I saw you on the veranda. <b>Found</b> <b>it</b> rather <b>difficult?</b> I couldn't stand that old woman." ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{the young}} man did not speak. He was clearly {{on the edge of}} an {{interview}} which he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> most <b>difficult</b> to open. His host grew impatient.|$|R
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|After his {{athletic}} career, Thorpe struggled {{to provide for}} his family. He <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to work a non-sports-related job and never held a job {{for an extended period}} of time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945. Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life.|$|E
5|$|At the {{testimonial}} dinner, Heikkinen’s six-year-old brother, Donald Heikkinen, {{was asked}} to name the greatest football {{player in the world}} and responded, “Ralph.” Donald offered that Ralph was best because he used “proper technique,” and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to choose his older brother’s greatest play because “there were so many of them.” Referring to the Ohio State game, Donald noted, “Ralph crushed through and smeared ‘em.” Heikkinen, or “Hike” as he was known to Yoopers, was presented with a purse of $36 representing the No. 36 he wore for Michigan.|$|E
50|$|Since many fewer government-run shops were opened, {{it marked}} the {{beginning}} of the shortage economy, as people <b>found</b> <b>it</b> increasingly <b>difficult</b> to find a shop with items of everyday use.|$|R
60|$|He {{lowered himself}} {{down the ladder}} circumspectly, and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> {{somewhat}} <b>difficult</b> to reach the room beneath the bridge; but five minutes after he got there he was sleeping heavily.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{watch my}} opportunity," [...] said Phineas, remembering {{a period of}} his life in which he had watched much and had <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very <b>difficult</b> to get an opportunity.|$|R
5|$|Begin Again premiered on September 7, 2013 at the Toronto International Film Festival, where The Weinstein Company {{acquired}} the U.S. distribution {{rights to the}} film for $7 million. It was later screened on April 26, 2014 on the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival. The film's title was changed from Can a Song Save Your Life? to Begin Again between its festival premiere and its theatrical release because viewers <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to remember and it was often misquoted.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less {{than half of the}} known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E
5|$|Howling Bells parted {{ways with}} Bella Union and, in 2008, {{signed a deal}} with record label Independiente. The band worked with {{producer}} and mixer Dan Grech-Marguerat (Radiohead, Paul McCartney) and recorded its follow-up album, Radio Wars, at several different recording studios. 8:35, b 9:41, c10:25, d 10:50}} At times, the members <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to work with their new producer. However, they have stated that in retrospect, they {{learned a great deal}} from him and felt fortunate for having the experience of collaborating with him.|$|E
50|$|Though, Motorcycle {{racing is}} {{recognized}} as legitimate sport in India, Chithra had <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very <b>difficult</b> to fund her interest. Instead, she continues to pursue her passion in long distance riding.|$|R
6000|$|... "And he was--ah--your--er--your--?" [...] He paused, for he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> rather <b>difficult</b> {{to go on}} {{with that}} line of {{questioning}} while the girl's clear, beautiful eyes were looking straight into his.|$|R
60|$|The dinner {{itself was}} more like a {{ceremony}} than a meal, and as <b>it</b> proceeded, Honora <b>found</b> <b>it</b> increasingly <b>difficult</b> to rid herself of a curious feeling of being on probation.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, in {{an effort}} to improve her in-ring skills, Stock {{relocated}} to Monterrey, Mexico to face the female wrestlers there. At the suggestion of a promoter, Stock began working while wearing a mask. She also took on the ring name Dark Angel, on the advice of Eddie Watts. She initially <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match. On October 17, she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship.|$|E
5|$|In June 1957, Plath and Hughes {{moved to}} the United States, and from September, Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to both teach and have enough {{time and energy to}} write {{and in the middle of}} 1958, the couple moved to Boston. Plath took a job as a {{receptionist}} in the psychiatric unit of Massachusetts General Hospital and in the evening sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet Robert Lowell (also attended by the writers Anne Sexton and George Starbuck).|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to find {{a record}} company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or {{because they did not}} see any {{commercial}} potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} uSell.com came in 2006 when Feirstein {{tried to sell}} items on eBay and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> {{extremely}} <b>difficult</b> with the peer-to-peer model marketplace. The Usell.com marketplace was launched in 2010.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her with a hint of astonishment and {{something}} that suggested a natural curiosity as to the cause for the visit, which she now <b>found</b> <b>it</b> insuperably <b>difficult</b> to explain.|$|R
60|$|She <b>found</b> <b>it</b> more <b>difficult</b> to tell Cuthbert, {{but it was}} not {{necessary}} for her to begin the subject, for he noticed at once that she had not the usual nursing-dress on.|$|R
5|$|Initially, Lasker {{wanted to}} play for $5,000 a side, and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed {{to a series of}} {{reductions}} when Lasker <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to raise the money, and the final figure was $2,000 each, which was less than for some of Steinitz's earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth about $114,000 at 2016 values). Although this was publicly praised as an act of sportsmanship on Steinitz's part, Steinitz may have desperately needed the money.|$|E
5|$|Keeler <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to escape}} the {{negative}} image attached to her by press, law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair. In various, sometimes contradictory accounts, she has challenged Denning's conclusions relating to security issues. Ward's conviction {{has been described by}} analysts as an act of Establishment revenge, rather than serving justice. In January 2014 his case was under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, with the possibility of a later reference to the Court of Appeal. Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{had always}} <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{intercept}} high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive. With a 240 horse power engine, it could reach 24,000 feet and was thus {{beyond the reach}} of any prospective adversary. The average S.E.5, at that point, could reach only 17,000 feet. While most pilots were prepared to accept this tactical-technological situation, McCudden was not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] the trader said; [...] "but I {{tell you}} I have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> {{precious}} <b>difficult</b> {{to keep my}} temper several times. The insolence and swagger of those fellows is amazing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... and {{afterward}} she had dined {{a la carte}} upon a cutlet, and had then set herself to write an answer to Mr. Manning's proposal of marriage. But she had <b>found</b> <b>it</b> very <b>difficult.</b>|$|R
