500|$|The episode {{features}} {{covers of}} numerous songs sung on-screen by the characters. Musical segments {{take the form}} of performances, as opposed to the characters singing spontaneously, as the intention is for the series to remain reality-based. Murphy has commented that his interest lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing on the format of Chicago. Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and strives to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, as: [...] "I want there to be something <b>for</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important – the balancing of that." ...|$|E

Hall, a youth pastor, said that [...] " [...] forgotten what the body of Christ looked like" [...] and commented that [...] "The world is well aware of what the church is against, but they aren’t always aware of what it’s <b>for.</b> <b>Everybody</b> <b>in</b> the body of Christ is given gifts to minister with; and when Christians aren’t using these gifts, the body suffers". Hall's inspiration for writing the song came from the second chapter of the book of James, where the writer [...] "admonishes" [...] readers to [...] "steer clear of giving preferential treatment to any one particular group over another, such as favoring the rich over the poor".|$|E
500|$|Glee is an American musical comedy-drama {{television}} series that airs on the Fox {{network in the}} United States. It focuses on the William McKinley High School glee club New Directions competing on the show choir competition circuit, while its members deal with relationships, sexuality and social issues. The show was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, and features many cover versions of songs performed on-screen by the characters. Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and strives to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, as he wants there to be [...] "something <b>for</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> every episode". Once Murphy selects a song, rights are cleared with its publishers by music supervisor P.J. Bloom, and music producer Adam Anders rearranges it for the Glee cast. Numbers are pre-recorded by the cast, while choreographer Zach Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed. Studio recordings of tracks are then made. The process begins {{six to eight weeks}} before each episode is filmed, and can end as late as the day before filming begins.|$|E

That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him {{a couple of things that}} have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E

It was announced on 11 May 2009 that Tubridy would indeed succeed Pat Kenny as host of The Late Late Show. He vowed to bring back Gay Byrne's [...] "one <b>for</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> the audience" [...] catchphrase, described by Will Hanafin in the Irish Independent as an attempt to [...] "dig up more old relics than archaeologists would on an excavation", in reference to Tubridy's passion for history. Tubridy said he was [...] "very taken aback" [...] to learn he had been selected, describing it as [...] "a humbling honour to be asked to present such an iconic programme". His role as host allowed him to fulfill a childhood ambition – presenting The Late Late Toy Show — [...] "I know {{this is the one that}} I always wanted. I love the fact that children are uncontaminated by the reality of adulthood". Tubridy Tonight concluded on 30 May 2009.|$|E
