5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E
5|$|While {{making a}} {{delivery}} in the Historic District, Cole is instructed {{to open the}} package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling several city blocks and nearly killing him. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after {{he is accused of}} triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, who persuades him to return and find John. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but she is abducted by the Sons before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. <b>Giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.|$|E

25|$|As {{an evening}} job, Charlotte starts {{working as a}} new carer for Ambrose's bed-ridden father, Arthur. Most of the {{previous}} minders have quit, and the reason soon becomes obvious: Arthur is ungrateful and rude, constantly shouting hurtful abuse at his minders, belittling their efforts to help him. Charlotte is no exception, and when she makes Arthur soup, she is rewarded by him throwing it in her face. In spite of this, Charlotte tries her best, drawing strength from her belief that to give in is <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the Devil.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Revolution {{concentrated}} labour into mills, {{factories and}} mines, thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance {{the interests of}} working people. The power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production. Employers had to decide between <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the union demands {{at a cost to}} themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production. Skilled workers were hard to replace, and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining.|$|E

25|$|Events soon overtook Necker's complex {{scheme of}} <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the Communes on some points while holding firm on others. No longer {{interested}} in Necker's advice, Louis XVI, {{under the influence}} of the courtiers of his privy council, resolved to go in state to the Assembly, annul its decrees, command the separation of the orders, and dictate the reforms to be effected by the restored Estates-General. On June 19, he ordered the Salle des États, the hall where the National Assembly met, closed, and remained at Marly for several days while he prepared his address.|$|E
25|$|With the Lords and Commons {{unable to}} come to {{agreement}} {{by the end of}} the Parliamentary year the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin, invoked the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, an infrequently used legislative device that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords where agreement can not be reached. The Hunting Act was only the seventh statute since 1911 enacted using these provisions. The House of Lords was criticised for undemocratically blocking the legislation; however other newspapers and broadcasters condemned Tony Blair's Labour administration for <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> what they perceived as the prejudicial views of anti-hunting Labour backbenchers.|$|E

25|$|Boromir's {{attempts}} {{to gain the}} Ring for himself {{have been described as}} well-intentioned but oblivious of the potential danger. His perception of Middle-earth is biased by a point of view that imagines that divine powers have chosen Gondor to lead the fight against evil. He is always eager to praise the great deeds of Gondor, including his own. When his hubris eventually leads him into attacking Frodo to seize the Ring, Boromir seals his own doom by <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the malign power of the Ring. He makes way thereby for Aragorn to become the future king of Gondor, {{in a manner similar to}} Virgil's character Turnus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1280, Magnus fell ill in Bergen and died 9 May. He had already planned to have his son Eirik crowned at midsummer as co-ruler, instead Eirik now took over as sole king {{at the age of}} 12. Real power fell to a circle of advisors, {{prominent}} among them Magnus' queen Ingeborg. Magnus was remembered as a good ruler, who ruled by law rather than by the sword. Some modern historians have considered him a weak king, for giving up the Hebrides and <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> demands of the church, but others consider these wise policies, sparing the kingdom unnecessary and unfruitful wars abroad, while preserving stability at home. Magnus was buried in the church of the Franciscan monastery in Bergen, which has since the 16th century been the Bergen Cathedral (Bergen Domkirke).|$|E
25|$|As Russia {{negotiated}} the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, he ordered Rumcherod troops to march towards Romania, which was by then <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the German advances and preparing to sign its own peace. Initially stalled by a much-criticized temporary armistice with Romanian Army leader Alexandru Averescu, Rakovsky ordered a fresh offensive in Moldavia, {{but had to}} retreat when the Central Powers, confronted with Trotsky's refusal to accept their version of a Russo-German peace, began their own military operation and occupied Odessa (setting free Romanians who had been imprisoned there). On March 9, 1918, Rakovsky signed a treaty with Romania regarding the evacuation of troops from Bessarabia, which Stelian Tănase claims allowed for the Moldavian Democratic Republic to join Romania. In May, Romania conceded {{to the demands of}} the Central Powers (see Treaty of Bucharest, 1918).|$|E

25|$|On 4 October 1946 Thomas {{was moved}} to be Under-Secretary for the Colonies, a shift which he later {{ascribed}} to an act of weakness by Attlee in <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> left-wing pressure after the dispute over the Civil Aviation Bill. With this appointment {{he was also a}} delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations. He negotiated at the United Nations over continued British administration of the colonies of Tanganyika, Togoland and the Cameroons, against attempts by the Soviet Union to limit the extent of control. Early the next year he intervened in a strike in Singapore, helping to persuade 7,000 municipal labourers to return to work. The Colonies Office also had responsibility for Palestine under the British mandate, in which he followed government policy of resisting illegal immigration (which was predominantly Jewish).|$|E
25|$|However, the {{reorganisation}} {{of states}} in India on linguistic basis removed Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam speaking regions from the Madras Presidency {{leaving behind a}} predominantly Tamil Madras State. <b>Giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> realities, Annadurai and his DMK changed the call of independent Dravida Nadu for Dravidians to independent Tamil Nadu for Tamils. Annadurai felt that remaining in the Indian Union meant accepting linguistic domination and economic backwardness. Nevertheless, the Sino-Indian war brought about changes in the Indian constitution. The Sixteenth Amendment (most popularly known as the Anti-Secessionist Amendment) banned any party with sectarian principles from participating in elections. When this amendment was presented in the Parliament of India, Annadurai was one of its members. He vehemently debated against the amendment, but eventually could not stop it from being passed. Faced with the new constitutional changes, Annadurai and his DMK left the call for an independent Tamil homeland on the back burner.|$|E

On 17 April 2009, Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundström were found guilty of assistance to copyright infringement and sentenced to one year in prison and payment of a fine of 30 million SEK (approximately 4.2m USD, 2.8m GBP, or 3.1m EUR), after a trial of nine days.

On 26 November 2010, a Swedish appeals court upheld the verdict, decreasing the original prison terms but increasing the fine to 46 million SEK.
