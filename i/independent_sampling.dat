40|$|Due to the {{complicated}} and time-varying boundary conditions, reverberation chamber (RC) measurements are usually studied using statistical analysis. Hence, {{it is of}} importance to know the number of <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> of the measurements. Different methods for estimating the number of <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> has been proposed in the literature. This paper uses the spatial degrees of freedom method to estimate the <b>independent</b> <b>sample</b> number. Comparing with the commonly used autocorrelation function method, the proposed method requires less computation time and provides a smaller estimation bias for correlated samples and a smaller estimation variance once above a certain sample number. The estimated <b>independent</b> <b>sample</b> number {{can be used to}} explain the dependences of the measurement uncertainty on frequency, mode stirrers, and RC loading. Finally, the estimated <b>independent</b> <b>sample</b> number is used to predict the standard deviation (STD) of the average power level for different loading configurations, where good agreements are observed...|$|R

Four methods for comparing groups while adjusting for missingness are explored by conducting simulations: <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> t-test with predicted mean stratification, <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> t-test with response propensity stratification, <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> t-test with response propensity weighting, and an analysis of covariance. Results show that <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> t-test with response propensity weighting and analysis of covariance can appropriately adjust for bias. ANCOVA is the stronger method when the ANCOVA assumptions are met. When the ANCOVA assumptions are not met, a t-test with inverse response propensity score weighting is the superior method...|$|R

5000|$|However, if a [...] "data {{generating}} mechanism" [...] {{does exist}} in reality, then according to Shannon's source coding theorem {{it provides the}} MDL description of the data, on average and asymptotically. In minimizing description length (or descriptive complexity), MDL estimation is similar to maximum likelihood estimation and maximum a posteriori estimation (using maximum-entropy Bayesian priors). However, MDL avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known; the MDL principle can also be applied without assumptions that e.g. the data arose from <b>independent</b> <b>sampling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|So far, {{only one}} Premiership player has ever tested {{positive}} for using performance-enhancing drugs in a league match. According to a statement of one of UK Sport's <b>Independent</b> <b>Sampling</b> Officers (ISO), [...] "If a club knows in advance we're coming, and the club suspects one of their players, they keep him off training and his name doesn't appear on the list I am given". In the 1999-2000 season, testers were present at just 32 of the 3,500-plus league games, taking samples from two players of each side. Compared to other sports in the UK, like cricket, cycling or athletics, footballers are {{far less likely to}} be tested. A case of high-profile was the one of Rio Ferdinand, who missed a drug test in September 2003 and found himself punished for it, being banned for eight months.|$|E

5000|$|Ranking {{is one of}} many {{procedures}} used to transform data that do not meet the assumptions of normality. Conover and Iman provided a review of the four main types of rank transformations (RT). One method replaces each original data value by its rank (from 1 for the smallest to N for the largest). This rank-based procedure has been recommended as being robust to non-normal errors, resistant to outliers, and highly efficient for many distributions. It may result in a known statistic (e.g., in the two <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> layout ranking results in the Wilcoxon rank-sum / Mann-Whitney U test), and provides the desired robustness and increased statistical power that is sought. For example, Monte Carlo {{studies have shown that the}} rank transformation in the two <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> t-test layout can be successfully extended to the one-way <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> ANOVA, as well as the two <b>independent</b> <b>samples</b> multivariate Hotelling's T2 layouts [...] Commercial statistical software packages (e.g., SAS) followed with recommendations to data analysts to run their data sets through a ranking procedure (e.g., PROC RANK) prior to conducting standard analyses using parametric procedures.|$|R
