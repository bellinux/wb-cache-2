6000|$|One evening, as I {{stood on}} the porch of the hotel, I saw a man riding a {{spirited}} <b>dapple-gray</b> horse up the street. As I watched the splendid fling of his fore-feet, the proud carriage of his head, the splendid nostrils, the deep intelligent eyes, I said: [...] "There is my horse! I wonder if he is for sale." ...|$|E

'What I [...] see,' answered Sancho, 'is {{nothing but a}} man on a gray ass [...] like my own, who carries something shiny on his head.' 'Just [...] so,' answered Don Quixote: 'and that resplendent object is [...] the helmet of Mambrino.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|He made me observe, “that {{among the}} Houyhnhnms, the white, the sorrel, and the iron-gray, {{were not so}} exactly shaped as the bay, the <b>dapple-gray,</b> and the black; nor born with equal talents of mind, or a {{capacity}} to improve them; and therefore continued always in the condition of servants, without ever aspiring to match {{out of their own}} race, which in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.” ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{then went}} to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when, giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which {{altogether}} made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored <b>dapple-gray.</b> Being {{at a loss for}} a coachman, ...|$|E
60|$|The Virginians {{have always}} been noted for their love of horses; a manly passion which, in those days of opulence, they indulged without regard to expense. The rich {{planters}} vied {{with each other in}} their studs, importing the best English stocks. Mention is made of one of the Randolphs of Tuckahoe, who built a stable for his favorite <b>dapple-gray</b> horse, Shakespeare, with a recess for the bed of the negro groom, who always slept beside him at night.|$|E
60|$|Beside the {{kneeling}} knight {{there stood}} a noble <b>dapple-gray</b> war-horse, and the spear of the knight {{leaned against the}} bole of a near-by oak tree, and the shield of the knight hung suspended to the spear. And the knight wore neither helm nor bascinet, wherefore Sir Percival could see his face and so could know who he was. And Sir Percival knew that the knight who kneeled there was Sir Ector de Maris, the brother of Sir Launcelot of the Lake.|$|E
60|$|Here {{we turned}} up a little glen with a small burn or brook whimpering and dashing along it, making an {{occasional}} waterfall, and overhung in some places with mountain ash and weeping birch. We are now, said Scott, treading classic, or rather fairy ground. This is the haunted glen of Thomas the Rhymer, where {{he met with the}} queen of fairy land, and this the bogle burn, or goblin brook, along which she rode on her <b>dapple-gray</b> palfrey, with silver bells ringing at the bridle.|$|E
60|$|Each moment {{increased}} my joy {{and pride}} in that <b>dapple-gray</b> gelding. Undoubtedly there was Arabian blood in his veins. He had a thoroughbred look. He listened to every word I spoke to him. He followed me as cheerfully and as readily as a dog. He let me feel his ears (which a locoed horse will not do) and at a touch of my hand made room for me in his stall. In all ways he seemed exactly the horse I had been looking for, and I {{began to think of}} my long ride over the mountains with confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so you shall, mon petit," [...] {{replied the}} archer. [...] "I {{have not heard}} a man speak better since old Dom Bertrand died, who was at one time {{chaplain}} to the White Company. He was a very valiant man, but {{at the battle of}} Brignais he was spitted through the body by a Hainault man-at-arms. For this we had an excommunication read against the man, when next we saw our holy father at Avignon; but as we had not his name, and knew nothing of him, save that he rode a <b>dapple-gray</b> roussin, I have feared sometimes that the blight may have settled upon the wrong man." ...|$|E
60|$|At last a great {{blast of}} bugles sounded, {{and into the}} meadow came riding six {{trumpeters}} with silver trumpets, from which hung velvet banners heavy with rich workings of silver and gold thread. Behind these came stout King Henry upon a <b>dapple-gray</b> stallion, with his Queen beside him upon a milk-white palfrey. On either side of them walked the yeomen of the guard, the bright sunlight flashing from the polished blades of the steel halberds they carried. Behind these came the Court in a great crowd, so that presently all the lawn was alive with bright colors, with silk and velvet, with waving plumes and gleaming gold, with flashing jewels and sword hilts; a gallant sight on that bright summer day.|$|E
6000|$|The {{shades of}} night had fallen, when the tramp of the <b>dapple-gray</b> steed sounded over the drawbridge, and {{immediately}} afterward the light clatter of hoofs along the road, bespoke the fleetness {{with which the}} youthful lover hastened to his bride. It was deep night when the Moor arrived at the castle of Coyn. He silently and cautiously walked his panting steed under its dark walls, and having nearly passed round them, came to the portal denoted by Xarisa. He paused and looked around {{to see that he}} was not observed, and then knocked three times with the butt of his lance. In a little while the portal was timidly unclosed by the duenna of Xarisa. [...] "Alas! senor," [...] said she, [...] "what has detained you thus long? Every night have I watched for you; and my lady is sick at heart with doubt and anxiety." ...|$|E
6000|$|Each moment {{increased}} my joy {{and pride}} in my <b>dapple-gray</b> gelding. I could scarcely convince myself of my good fortune, and concluded {{there must be something}} the matter with the horse. I was afraid of some trick, some meanness, for almost all mountain horses are [...] "streaky," [...] but I could discover nothing. He was quick on his feet as a cat, listened to every word that was spoken to him, and obeyed as instantly and as cheerfully as a dog. He took up his feet at request, he stood over in the stall at a touch, and took the bit readily (a severe test). In every way he seemed to be exactly the horse I had been waiting for. I became quite satisfied of his value the following morning, when his former owner said to me, in a voice of sadness, [...] "Now treat him well, won't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Christchurch townsfolk stood huddled {{about the}} Bridge of Avon, the women pulling tight their shawls {{and the men}} {{swathing}} themselves in their gaberdines, while down the winding path from the castle came the van of the little army, their feet clanging on the hard, frozen road. First came Black Simon with his banner, bestriding a lean and powerful <b>dapple-gray</b> charger, as hard and wiry and warwise as himself. After him, riding three abreast, were nine men-at-arms, all picked soldiers, who had followed the French wars before, and knew the marches of Picardy as they knew the downs of their native Hampshire. They were {{armed to the teeth}} with lance, sword, and mace, with square shields notched at the upper right-hand corner to serve as a spear-rest. For defence each man wore a coat of interlaced leathern thongs, strengthened at the shoulder, elbow, and upper arm with slips of steel. Greaves and knee-pieces were also of leather backed by steel, and their gauntlets and shoes were of iron plates, craftily jointed. So, with jingle of arms and clatter of hoofs, they rode across the Bridge of Avon, while the burghers shouted lustily for the flag of the five roses and its gallant guard.|$|E
60|$|It chanced on {{that very}} evening that Sir Nigel Loring, having supped before sunset, as was his custom, and having himself seen that Pommers and Cadsand, his two war-horses, with the {{thirteen}} hacks, the five jennets, my lady's three palfreys, and the great <b>dapple-gray</b> roussin, had all their needs supplied, had taken his dogs for an evening breather. Sixty or seventy of them, large and small, smooth and shaggy--deer-hound, boar-hound, blood-hound, wolf-hound, mastiff, alaun, talbot, lurcher, terrier, spaniel--snapping, yelling and whining, with score of lolling tongues and waving tails, came surging down the narrow lane which leads from the Twynham kennels to the bank of Avon. Two russet-clad varlets, with loud halloo and cracking whips, walked thigh-deep amid the swarm, guiding, controlling, and urging. Behind came Sir Nigel himself, with Lady Loring upon his arm, the pair walking slowly and sedately, as befitted both their age and their condition, while they watched with a smile in their eyes the scrambling crowd in front of them. They paused, however, at the bridge, and, leaning their elbows upon the stonework, they stood looking down at their own faces in the glassy stream, and at the swift flash of speckled trout against the tawny gravel.|$|E
60|$|The {{party of}} five had not {{proceeded}} far, when, in {{passing through a}} defile, overhung with trees, they heard {{the voice of a}} man, singing. They immediately concealed themselves in a grove, on the brow of a declivity, up which the stranger would have to ascend. The moonlight, which left the grove in deep shadow, lit up the whole person of the wayfarer, as he advanced, and enabled them to distinguish his dress and appearance with perfect accuracy. He was a Moorish cavalier, and his noble demeanor, graceful carriage, and splendid attire showed him to be of lofty rank. He was superbly mounted, on a <b>dapple-gray</b> steed, of powerful frame, and generous spirit, and magnificently caparisoned. His dress was a marlota, or tunic, and an Albernoz of crimson damask, fringed with gold. His Tunisian turban, of many folds, was of silk and cotton, striped, and bordered with golden fringe. At his girdle hung a scimitar of Damascus steel, with loops and tassels of silk and gold. On his left arm he bore an ample target, and his right hand grasped a long double-pointed lance. Thus equipped, he sat negligently on his steed, as one who dreamed of no danger, gazing on the moon, and singing, with a sweet and manly voice, a Moorish love ditty.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{man from}} America!" [...] {{repeated}} the soldier, {{in a tone}} of surprise, and they both craned their necks from the window. The horseman, a sturdy, broad-shouldered young man, clean-shaven and crop-haired, turned his long, swarthy face and his bold features in their direction as he ran his eyes over the front of the house. He had a soft-brimmed gray hat of a shape which was strange to Parisian eyes, but his sombre clothes and high boots were such as any citizen might have worn. Yet his general appearance was so unusual that a group of townsfolk had already assembled round him, staring with open mouth at his horse and himself. A battered gun with an extremely long barrel was fastened by the stock to his stirrup, while the muzzle stuck up into the air behind him. At each holster was a large dangling black bag, and a gaily coloured red-slashed blanket was rolled up {{at the back of his}} saddle. His horse, a strong-limbed <b>dapple-gray,</b> all shiny with sweat above, and all caked with mud beneath, bent its fore knees as it stood, as though it were overspent. The rider, however, having satisfied himself as to the house, sprang lightly out of his saddle, and disengaging his gun, his blanket, and his bags, pushed his way unconcernedly through the gaping crowd and knocked loudly at the door.|$|E
60|$|I ordered pease-porridge hot, {{and they}} brought it cold; but I didn't wait for any thing else, being {{in a hurry to}} see all there was to be seen on this strange island. Feeling refreshed, I strolled on, passing a jolly old gentleman smoking and drinking, while three fiddlers played before him. As I turned into a road that led toward a hill, a little boy, riding a <b>dapple-gray</b> pony, and an old lady on a white horse, with bells ringing somewhere, trotted by me, {{followed}} by a little girl, who wished to know where she could buy a penny bun. I told her the best were at Newmarch's, in Bedford Street, and she ran on, much pleased; but I'm afraid she never found that best of bake-shops. I was going quietly along, when the sound of another horse coming made me look round; and there I saw a dreadful sight,--a wild horse, tearing over the ground, with fiery eyes and streaming tail. On his back sat a crazy man, beating him with a broom; a crazy woman was behind him, with her bonnet on wrong side before, holding one crazy child in her lap, while another stood on the horse; a third was hanging on by one foot, and all were howling {{at the top of their}} voices as they rushed by. I scrambled over the wall to get out of the way, and there I saw more curious sights. Two blind men were sitting on the grass, trying to see two lame men who were hobbling along as hard as they could; and, near by, a bull was fighting a bee in the most violent manner. This rather alarmed me; and I scrambled back into the road again, just as a very fine lady jumped over a barberry-bush near by, and a gentleman went flying after, with a ring in one hand and a stick in the other.|$|E

5000|$|... center Up in the GalleryIf some frail {{tubercular}} lady circus rider were to {{be driven}} in circles around and around the arena {{for months and months}} without interruption in front of a tireless public on a swaying horse by a merciless whip-wielding master of ceremonies, spinning on the horse, throwing kisses and swaying at the waist, and if this performance, amid the incessant roar of the orchestra and the ventilators, were to continue into the ever-expanding, gray future, accompanied by applause, which died down and then swelled up again, from hands which were really steam hammers, perhaps then a young visitor to the gallery might rush down the long stair case through all the levels, burst into the ring, and cry “Stop!” through the fanfares of the constantly adjusting orchestra.But since things are not like that—since a beautiful woman, in white and red, flies in through curtains which proud men in livery open in front of her, since the director, devotedly seeking her eyes, breathes in her direction, behaving like an animal, and, as a precaution, lifts her up on the <b>dapple-gray</b> horse, as if she were his grand daughter, the one he loved more than anything else, as she starts a dangerous journey, but he cannot decide to give the signal with his whip and finally, controlling himself, gives it a crack, runs right beside the horse with his mouth open, follows the rider’s leaps with a sharp gaze, hardly capable of comprehending her skill, tries to warn her by calling out in English, furiously castigating the grooms holding hoops, telling them to pay the most scrupulous attention, and begs the orchestra, with upraised arms, to be quiet before the great jump, finally lifts the small woman down from the trembling horse, kisses her on both cheeks, considers no public tribute adequate, while she herself, leaning on him, high on the tips of her toes, with dust swirling around her, arms outstretched and head thrown back, wants to share her luck with the entire circus—since this is how things are, the visitor to the gallery puts his face on the railing and, sinking into the final march as if into a difficult dream, weeps, without realizing it.|$|E
