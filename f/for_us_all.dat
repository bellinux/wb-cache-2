500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near and Pentagon Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not {{go so far as to}} claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national security of the United States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>all.</b> In that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case.
