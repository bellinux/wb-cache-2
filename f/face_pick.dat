60|$|By {{the time}} the search was ended, Walter felt {{something}} like himself, and arose slowly and allowed the watchmen to conduct him to their shanty at {{one side of the}} wharf. Here he bathed his <b>face,</b> <b>picked</b> the splinter from his wrist, and brushed up generally. A cup of hot coffee from one of the watchmen's cans braced him up still further.|$|R
6000|$|She waited {{till she}} heard him close his door; then, {{with a look of}} disgust on her <b>face,</b> <b>picked</b> up his hat and coat, and hung them on the rack in the hall. [...] "I'm sorry for Mart," [...] she said to herself. [...] "He was company for him, but I can't stand the loafer a day longer. I hope I never see him again." ...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the more}} notable {{incidents}} in Doan's career came when he participated in an angle on the January 22, 1996 episode of Raw, where Vader made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television debut following his debut at the Royal Rumble the prior night. Vader punched Doan twice in the <b>face,</b> <b>picked</b> him up and power-bombed him to the mat. When on-screen WWF president Gorilla Monsoon intervened, Monsoon picked Doan up off the mat and placed him in the corner. While Monsoon tended to the wounded official, Vader avalanched both of them, kayfabe knocking Doan into unconsciousness. He was out of action for several weeks, selling the injuries he received {{at the hands of}} Vader, but, eventually reappeared at WrestleMania XII, in, coincidentally enough, a Vader match.|$|R

50|$|Wurrpan {{discovers that}} Gandji {{has kept the}} highest quality meat for his own family, and the two begin to argue. Gandji says that Wurrpan should catch his own stingray, and throws hot coals into his <b>face.</b> Gandji <b>picks</b> up a rock used for nut {{grinding}} and throws it, striking Wurrpan in the chest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh!--this ain't the United States," [...] Billy muttered. Down on {{the water}} front they found a fish cannery and an {{asparagus}} cannery in {{the height of the}} busy season, where they looked in vain among the toilers for familiar American <b>faces.</b> Billy <b>picked</b> out the bookkeepers and foremen for Americans. All the rest were Greeks, Italians, and Chinese.|$|R
25|$|Prior to laying {{their eggs}} on a {{vertical}} rock face, {{male and female}} whitetail major damselfish clean the site by sand-blasting it. The fish pick up sand in their mouths and spit it against the rock face. Then they fan the area with their fins. Finally they remove the sand grains that remain stuck to the rock <b>face</b> by <b>picking</b> them off with their mouths.|$|R
5000|$|... 5 ft Fahri {{challenged}} Jimmy to {{go outside}} the shop but Jimmy refused. Not wanting to lose <b>face</b> after <b>picking</b> a fight with Jimmy, Fahri went back in the shop and hit Jimmy with two plastic drinks. The Mizen brothers defended themselves and traded punches with Fahri. All three then crashed into a glass cake display, before Fahri was bundled out of the shop.|$|R

"Didn't I have {{a time of}} it, though, when I had to {{go round}} for a week with {{plantain}} leaves and cream stuck all over my <b>face!</b> Just <b>picked</b> some pretty red dogwood, Ben; and then I was a regular guy, with a face like a lobster, and my eyes swelled out of sight. Come along, and learn right away, and never get into scrapes like most fellows." ...|$|R
5000|$|Isabella Macdonald {{was born}} in Rochester, New York to well-educated parents Myra Spafford Macdonald and Isaac Alden. The father was a temperance man with {{pronounced}} convictions upon subjects regarding social reform, {{as well as an}} abolitionist because he believed slavery to be a sin. The mother was devoted to everything that was [...] "pure and of good report." [...] The sixth of seven children, she was initially home-schooled by her father, who also gave her the nickname Pansy, because of an incident that occurred in her childhood. Her mother had taken great pride in a bed of pansy blossoms. The child, seeing the flowers, and thinking there was no one more deserving of them than her mother, pulled them and threw them into her mother's lap exclaiming, [...] "I pulled every one for you." [...] She could not understand her mother's look of distress. The father, seeing the disappointed look on the little girl's <b>face,</b> <b>picked</b> her up, seated her on his shoulder and said, [...] "Never mind, baby, you shall always be my little pansy-blossom." ...|$|R
5000|$|Garbrandt {{announces the}} first fight and matches his first pick Baczynski against Dillashaw's last pick Smith. Since the tournament will start with {{back-to-back}} fights, Dillashaw picks his first choice Krause to <b>face</b> Garbrandt's fourth <b>pick</b> Urbina.|$|R

50|$|In {{his debut}} {{fight for the}} promotion, Guillard was {{given the chance to}} <b>face</b> a hand <b>picked</b> {{opponent}} and chose Brandon Girtz, who he fought at Bellator 141 on August 28, 2015. His decision to face Girtz ended up backfiring on him as he lost the fight via split decision.|$|R
30|$|According to {{pharmacy}} practice, {{a dedicated}} storage policy is used, {{which means that}} each product type is assigned to a fixed bin. However, we assumed a random retrieval policy, which means that any product within the <b>pick</b> <b>face</b> has the same probability to be retrieved. Thus, the storage and retrieval are independent operations.|$|R
50|$|The Tigers {{traveled}} to Houston to <b>face</b> Rice. LSU <b>picked</b> up their third consecutive shutout {{of the season}} in a 13-0 victory. It also marked the longest fumble recovery returned for a touchdown in LSU history when Ken Kavanaugh scooped up a Rice fumble and returned it 100 yards for the score.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2008 McKinnie {{was arrested}} and charged with aggravated battery, disorderly conduct and {{resisting}} arrest without violence after a street brawl outside a Miami nightclub. Miami police said McKinnie spit in the face of a bouncer when he was removed from the club, then, after heading across the street to another establishment, returned to Club Space and argued with the bouncer, Eric Otero. McKinnie then allegedly shoved his phone in Otero's <b>face</b> before <b>picking</b> up a heavy pole and hitting him. [...] A judge ordered McKinnie to complete 25 hours of community service and anger management classes.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the retrieval–travel time of all items: N stored in the rack become the retrieval–travel time of items N_PF stored only in the <b>pick</b> <b>face,</b> since we have assumed that a dedicated storage policy was used, and the items were automatically moved from the storage to the picking side of the rack by gravity.|$|R
50|$|In 2004-05 season, Warnock {{once again}} {{brought in a}} host of new <b>faces</b> with the <b>pick</b> being arguably the signings of former Sheffield Wednesday players Bromby, Quinn and Geary. The Blades again flirted around the play-offs places but some {{inconsistent}} performances, which included only winning 5 of their last 20 Championship games, saw the club again fall just short of the top six.|$|R
50|$|On April 9, Porcello {{made his}} Major League debut against Toronto, {{opposite}} Blue Jays rookie pitcher Ricky Romero.

He struck out four batters and allowed four runs on eight hits.|$|R
50|$|In true Jebediah style, {{it has a}} lot {{of energy}} and it's a lot poppier. I think it has more appeal than the original. When we listen to our version of it, it drags. It's muddy. And then you hear the Jebediah version and it {{automatically}} puts a smile on your <b>face.</b> It just <b>picks</b> you up. You could jump off stages to their version.|$|R
5000|$|A large hammer-like tool is a maul (sometimes {{called a}} [...] "beetle"), a wood- or rubber-headed hammer is a mallet, and a hammer-like tool with a cutting blade is usually called a hatchet. The {{essential}} part of a hammer is the head, a compact solid mass that is able to deliver {{a blow to the}} intended target without itself deforming. The impacting surface of the tool is usually flat or slightly rounded; {{the opposite end of the}} impacting mass may have a ball shape, as in the ball-peen hammer. Some upholstery hammers have a magnetized <b>face,</b> to <b>pick</b> up tacks. In the hatchet, the flat hammer head may be secondary to the cutting edge of the tool.|$|R
30|$|Our idea {{consists}} in dividing the retrieval–travel {{time of a}} location (i,j) in a two-travel time (vertical and horizontal) where the locations (i,j) are uniformly distributed. Therefore, the expected retrieval time {{is the sum of}} the mean values of each travel time. As stated in the assumption part, the <b>pick</b> <b>face</b> is supposed as a continuous rectangle. In this case, the discrete coordinates (i,j) become continuous coordinates noted (i,j).|$|R
50|$|Soon after, on December 9, 1935. Walter Liggett {{was murdered}} by a Thompson submachine gun in a drive by {{shooting}} outside his apartment. His wife and children were in a car only inches away and witnessed his death. Weeping and saying {{that she would never}} forget his grinning <b>face,</b> Mrs. Liggett <b>picked</b> Blumenfeld out of a police lineup as her husband's killer. Three other witnesses identified Blumenfeld as the shooter, too.|$|R
50|$|This U-shaped {{curve is}} {{different}} from the other types of skill development because this skill has an artistic rating with it, which means there could be differences in opinion, but in studies where children, adult artists, and non-artist adults were all given the same directions to draw a self portrait, the children’s and the artists' were the closest of the three to depicting the <b>face</b> when <b>picked</b> by an outside group. In theory, this result is because of an innate “creative skill” in children that is either lost to age with non-artist adults or practiced by adult artists. In artists the Y-axis would be the “creative skill”, and the X-axis would be time, but in non artists the “U” shaped curve would not apply.|$|R
60|$|My heart fairly bounded for joy. I had won my point. For {{a moment}} I {{looked at the}} {{materials}} in feigned surprise, but soon I permitted an expression of dawning comprehension to come into my <b>face,</b> and then, <b>picking</b> them up, I penned a brief order to Carthoris to deliver to Parthak a harness of his selection and the short-sword which I described. That was all. But it meant everything {{to me and to}} Carthoris.|$|R
50|$|One such {{recurring}} theme was early offered by Poseidonius (a Greek polymath, native to Apamea, Syria; ca 135-51 BCE), {{who argued that}} dissipation of the old Roman virtues had followed {{the removal of the}} Carthaginian challenge to Rome's supremacy in the Mediterranean world. The theme that civilizations flourish or fail according to their responses to the human and environmental challenges that they <b>face,</b> would be <b>picked</b> up two thousand years later by Toynbee.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the north}} end of the Palace rises the most famous of the towers, Elizabeth Tower, {{commonly}} known as Big Ben. At 96metres (316ft), it is only slightly shorter than Victoria Tower but much slimmer. Originally known simply as the Clock Tower (the name Elizabeth Tower was conferred on it in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II), it houses the Great Clock of Westminster, built by Edward John Dent on designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. Striking the hour to within a second of the time, the Great Clock achieved standards of accuracy considered impossible by 19th-century clockmakers, and it has remained consistently reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials [...] in diameter, which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night; the hour hand is [...] long and the minute hand [...] The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the Palace. In the 2012 BBC Four documentary, Richard Taylor gives a description of Pugin's Clock Tower: [...] "It rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm, higher and higher, before you reach the clock <b>face,</b> <b>picked</b> out as a giant rose, its petals fringed with gold. Medieval windows above that and then it hits the grey slate roof, its greyness relieved by those delicate little windows again picked out in gold leaf. And then rises up again in a great jet of gold to the higher roof that curves gracefully upwards to a spire with a crown and flowers and a cross. It's elegant and grand and has fairy tale qualities." ...|$|R
