40|$|AbstractThe {{thermal energy}} {{required}} for regeneration of CO 2 -rich adsorbents or absorbents is usually {{regarded as the}} most important criterion to evaluate different materials and processes for application in commercial-scale CO 2 capture systems. It is expected that the <b>regeneration</b> <b>heat</b> can be greatly reduced by replacing the mature aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) technology with amine-based solid adsorbents capturing systems, due to the much lower heat capacity of solid adsorbents comparing to aqueous MEA and the avoidance of evaporating a large amount of water in the regenerator. Comparing to the MEA technology, the <b>regeneration</b> <b>heat</b> for solid adsorbent based systems has not received adequate attention especially on the impacts of process related parameters. Further, the methodologies used in previous investigations to calculate the <b>regeneration</b> <b>heat</b> may have deficiencies in defining the working capacities, adopting proper heat recovery strategies and/or evaluating the effect of moisture co-adsorption. In this study, an energy equation to calculate the <b>regeneration</b> <b>heat</b> has been revised and proposed to systematically evaluate the most important parameters affecting the <b>regeneration</b> <b>heat,</b> including the physical properties of the adsorbents and process related variables including the heat of adsorption, specific heat capacity, working capacity, moisture adsorption of the polyethyleneimine (PEI) /silica adsorbent, the swing temperature difference and the degree of heat recovery.

During the expansion process, the <b>heat</b> <b>regeneration</b> subsystem heats the high-pressure air to improve the entrance enthalpy of starting point of air expansion. The electric power generation subsystem is implemented to drive the turbine to generate electricity with high-temperature air, therefore, finishing the conversion from molecular potential energy and thermal energy to electricity.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of application of low-boiling fluids in supercritical cycles of power plants (conventional and nuclear) which generate cheap electrical energy {{are described in}} this paper. Working fluid should have appropriate critical temperature {{in order to obtain}} high cycle efficiency. When the critical temperature of working fluid in the supercritical two-phase cycles is too high, there is no possibility for utilization of <b>heat</b> <b>regeneration</b> in a simple recuperator.

Reduction of internal irreversibility of thermodynamical cycles (i. e., increasing their efficiency) at supercritical conditions can be obtained by additional compression of a part or of entire flow of working fluid.
