50|$|Commonly {{pin tumbler}} locks {{are found in}} a {{cylinder}} {{that can be easily}} unscrewed by a locksmith to facilitate rekeying. The first main advantage to a <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> also known as a profile <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> or euro, is that the cylinder can be changed without altering the boltwork hardware. Removing the cylinder typically requires only loosening a set screw, then sliding the cylinder from the boltwork. The second is that it is usually possible to obtain, from various <b>lock</b> manufacturers, <b>cylinders</b> in different formats that can all be used with the same type of key. This allows the user to have keyed-alike, and master-keyed systems that incorporate a wide variety of different types of lock, such as nightlatches, deadbolts and roller <b>door</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R

40|$|DE 102006047939 A 1 UPAB: 20080501 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} a <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> (3) that is formed for {{bidirectional}} data exchange by radio. A {{wireless access point}} (2 a) is formed for bidirectional data exchange per radio with the cylinder and a central management unit (1) i. e. personal computer. The unit is connected with the point for the bidirectional data exchange. An association request signal is transmitted from the cylinder. Association response signals are transmitted from the point in a radio range after receiving the request signal. The point is connected with the cylinder over the radio based on the received response signal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for integrating a <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a network. USE - Keying system {{for use in a}} network e. g. Ethernet, wireless LAN, and home phoneline networking alliance (RTM: Not defined). ADVANTAGE - The design of the system enables automatic connection of the <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> with the keying system in a network in a simple manner, theoretical unlimitation of an automatic enhancement of the keying system about the additional <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a simple manner, prevention of non-authorized <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> to be connected with the network components, and facilitates a simple and flexible data transmission to the individual <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The number of the <b>locking</b> <b>cylinders</b> controlled by radio are monitored, configured and programmed in a simple manner. Manual contacts for the configuration of the cylinder and manual administration processes are eliminated...|$|R
50|$|Lock {{snapping}} is {{a method}} of forced entry that only affects certain types of <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> such as the euro cylinder which are commonly found on uPVC <b>doors</b> in Europe. <b>Lock</b> snapping involves applying a strong torque force to the <b>lock</b> <b>cylinder,</b> usually {{with a pair of}} locking pliers, thereby breaking the mechanism and allowing access to the latch. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to snap the lock and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from lock snapping.|$|R
50|$|On {{vehicles}} {{equipped with}} power central locking, the feature is activated from the inside drivers <b>door</b> <b>lock</b> switch only, by pushing the rocker switch to lock or unlock all doors.

Other <b>doors</b> can be <b>locked</b> or unlocked individually by pushing the respective <b>door</b> <b>lock</b> rocker switch, but it will not lock or unlock the other doors. The outside key <b>door</b> <b>lock</b> can unlock the drivers door only by turning the key partially, or with a complete turn to the left to unlock all doors.|$|R
