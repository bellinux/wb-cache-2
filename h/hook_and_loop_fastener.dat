50|$|The prickly {{heads of}} these plants (burrs) are noted for easily {{catching}} on to fur and clothing. In England, some birdwatchers have reported that birds have become entangled in the burrs leading to a slow death, as {{they are unable to}} free themselves.Burdock's clinging properties, in addition to thus providing an excellent mechanism for seed dispersal, led to the invention of <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fastener.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the U.S. Army, {{a simple}} patch with the legend [...] "MP" [...] worn {{on the left}} arm distinguishes a military-police soldier wearing the new Army Combat Uniform (ACU). This patch is {{attached}} to the uniform by <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fastener</b> commonly referred to as Velcro. For both garrison law-enforcement duty as well as for tactical field work, the patch is a subdued gray with black lettering.|$|E
50|$|De Mestral died in Commugny, Switzerland, {{where he}} is buried. The {{municipality}} posthumously named an avenue, L'avenue George de Mestral, in his honor.

50|$|The big {{breakthrough}} George de Mestral {{made was}} {{to think about}} hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. <b>Hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> was the miniaturisation of the <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> eyes. Shrinking the hooks led to the two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of hooks, touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing {{the size of the}} hooks, the strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more hooks for the same strength. The other difference is that <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> has indeterminate match-up between the <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> eyes. With larger <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> eye fasteners, each hook has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners,</b> matching up each of these hooks with the corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.|$|R

Google provides extra recommendations for large scale manufacturing, and pre-assembled kits based on these plans are available for less than [...] from multiple vendors, who have also created a number of Cardboard variations.|$|E
50|$|The zipper {{may be used}} {{to secure}} an article of clothing, a tent or other fabric enclosure, luggage, or other soft container. Another popular method of {{securing}} clothing presses a thin and sharpened wire through the fabric using a brooch or safety pin. A buckle is used in place of a zipper at times. Buttons are another way to secure clothing, and require dexterous fingers to properly use. Snap fasteners (also named poppers and press studs) and the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fastener</b> are a few less common zipper alternatives.|$|E

50|$|After {{taking his}} dog {{for a walk}} {{one day in the}} late 1940s (1948), George de Mestral, a Swiss inventor, became curious about the seeds of the burdock plant that had {{attached}} themselves to his clothes and to the dog's fur. Under a microscope, he looked closely at the hook system that the seeds use to hitchhike on passing animals aiding seed dispersal, and he realized that the same approach could be used to join other things together. His work {{led to the development of}} the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fastener,</b> which was initially sold under the Velcro brand name.|$|E
5000|$|An [...] ankle brace is {{a garment}} that is worn around the ankle {{to protect it}} or for {{immobilization}} while allowing it to heal. Ankle braces are used to immobilize the joint while providing heat and compression to the bones. They are common in injury rehabilitation processes that affect the ankle, being made of rigid fabric such nylon and neoprene that allow limited mobility of the foot and conform to the ankle by a <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fastener.</b> To ensure its fixation, the foot portion may include metal pieces. In severe cases, they incorporate metallic plates to better immobilize the joint.|$|E
50|$|Residential {{soundproofing}} aims {{to decrease}} or eliminate {{the effects of}} exterior noise. The main focus of residential soundproofing in existing structures is the windows and doors. Solid wood doors are a better sound barrier than hollow doors. Curtains {{can be used to}} damp sound either through use of heavy materials or through the use of air chambers known as honeycombs. Single-, double- and triple-honeycomb designs achieve relatively greater degrees of sound damping. The primary soundproofing limit of curtains is the lack of a seal {{at the edge of the}} curtain, although this may be alleviated with the use of sealing features, such as <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fastener,</b> adhesive, magnets, or other materials. Thickness of glass will play a role when diagnosing sound leakage. Double-pane windows achieve somewhat greater sound damping than single-pane windows when well sealed into the opening of the window frame and wall.|$|E
50|$|A Velcro hair roller {{is made of}} a {{strip of}} <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> that is wrapped around cylinders. They are {{available}} in different sizes {{and can be used}} on dry or wet hair. The rollers are self-holding because they do not need pins or clips to be held in place. But they are not considered sanitary and are not permitted by the state board in some states.|$|R
50|$|Shoe {{closures}} {{can resist}} a large force {{with only a}} small amount of <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners.</b> This is because the strap is wrapped through a slot, halving the force on the bond by acting as a pulley system (thus gaining a mechanical advantage), and further absorbing some of the force in friction around the tight bend. This layout also ensures that the force is parallel to the strips.|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century gaiters for riding {{typically}} {{were known}} as riding gaiters, distinguishing them from the other gaiters that were in general use. Today, half chaps are a type of gaiter worn by equestrians. Most forms fit over the calf. These are intended to protect the rider's leg from wear by the stirrup leathers and other saddle parts. Modern styles usually have a zipper or <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> {{on the outside of}} the leg.|$|R
50|$|Concerning {{antimicrobial}} therapy {{of surgical}} infection he started measuring antibiotic concentrations in tissue fluid representative for {{of the site}} of infection by analyzing body fluids and bone chips {{and that would have}} been disposed in the course of surgical procedures. Antibiotic concentrations measured in tissues was then be compared to concentrations required to kill bacteria to serve as foundation of anti-infective therapies. Based on these studies Dr. Wittmann habilitated for Professor of Surgery at University of Hamburg defending his thesis about the concentration dynamics of antimicrobials intra-abdominal infections.In 1972 Dr. Wittmann had the opportunity to work in Annaba, Algeria, and took his young family to Algeria for an anticipated two year commitment. After a year political unrest forced the Wittmanns to return to Germany but by then he had seen many diseases in their advanced stages including abdominal infections. The culmination of experiences led Dr. Wittmann to begin to develop a means to keep the abdominal wall safely open for serial intra-operative treatment and control of healing processes. Early attempts used a variety of temporary closure devices such des retention sutures, zippers and slide fasteners. Ultimately he discovered the method of hook and loop fasteners to be optimal for closing the abdomen temporarily. In 1988 he joined the faculty Robert E. Condon and Dr. Charles Aprahamian at the Medical College of Wisconsin and became a full Professor of Surgery. He developed one of the first US surgical critical care fellowship programs at the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1990 and became its first director. In 2000 Dr. Wittmann retired from the medical college but continued his work on staged abdominal repair and the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fastener</b> temporary fascia prosthesis. He remained active providing advice to surgeons worldwide using his website www.openabdomen.org and continued to lecture about the fundamental benefits of planned open abdomen.|$|E

2500|$|For some cuffs, a {{matching}} limb protection sleeve {{is available to}} help protect soft tissues under the cuff. [...] Without proper protection, underlying soft tissue is prone to damage caused by wrinkling, pinching or shearing. [...] Sleeves are sized according to the cuff width and the patient’s limb circumference. [...] They are intended to fit snugly and extend beyond {{the edge of the}} cuff to ensure that there is no direct contact between cuff and skin. [...] Sleeve materials that do not shed loose fibers are chosen to avoid lint becoming trapped in the cuff’s <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners,</b> which reduces their effectiveness.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} to Albert de Mestral, a civil engineer, and Marthe de Goumoëns in Colombier, near Lausanne, Switzerland. De Mestral {{designed}} a toy airplane at age twelve and patented it. He attended the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne. After graduation in 1930, {{he worked in the}} machine shop of an engineering company. He went for a hike and when he came back he discovered that his dog was covered in burs that had attached themselves to its fur. He then worked on inventing <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> for ten years starting in 1948. In 1955 he successfully patented <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop,</b> eventually selling 60 million yards (about 55,000 km) a year through a multimillion-dollar company.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} some deficiencies: it tends to {{accumulate}} hair, dust, and fur in its hooks {{after a few months}} of regular use. The loops can become elongated or broken after extended use. The hooks often become attached to articles of clothing, especially loosely woven items like sweaters. This clothing may be damaged when one attempts to remove the Velcro, even if the sides are separated slowly. The tearing noise made by unfastening <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> make it inappropriate for some applications. For example, a soldier in hiding would not want to alert the enemy to his position by opening a pocket. It also absorbs moisture and perspiration when worn next to the skin, which means it will smell if not washed.|$|R
40|$|Compression {{therapy is}} a key {{component}} in the effective management of people with lower limb problems associated with venous, lymphatic and fat disorders such as lipoedema. Individuals with lymphoedema, venous ulceration and lipoedema often require long-term compression therapy to prevent and manage problems such as chronic ulceration and skin changes, persistent swelling and shape distortion. Challenges remain in achieving acceptable, safe, effective and cost-efficient compression therapy choices. Adjustable compression wrap devices using <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners,</b> commonly called VELCRO brand fasteners, present new opportunities for improving treatment outcomes, supporting patient independence and self-management {{in the use of}} compression therapy.

50|$|Ceramic {{materials}}, {{materials processing}} and progress in ceramic penetration mechanics are significant areas {{of academic and}} industrial activity. This combined field of ceramics armor research is broad and is perhaps summarized best by The American Ceramics Society. ACerS has run an annual armor conference {{for a number of}} years and compiled a proceedings 2004-2007. An area of special activity pertaining to vests is the emerging use of small ceramic components. Large torso sized ceramic plates are complex to manufacture and are subject to cracking in use. Monolithic plates also have limited multi hit capacity as a result of their large impact fracture zone These are the motivations for new types of armor plate. These new designs use two- and three-dimensional arrays of ceramic elements that can be rigid, flexible or semi-flexible. Dragon Skin body armor is one of these systems. European developments in spherical and hexagonal arrays have resulted in products that have some flex and multi hit performance. The manufacture of array type systems with flex, consistent ballistic performance at edges of ceramic elements is an active area of research.

40|$|The Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Simulator is a {{portable}} training aid, or demonstration tool, designed to physically illustrate real-time critical-safety concepts of electrical lockout/tagout. The {{objective is to}} prevent misinterpretations of what is off and what is on during maintenance and repair of complex electrical systems. The simulator is designed {{in the form of}} a hinged box that opens up and stands on its own as an easel for demonstrations. On the outer face of the unit is a simulated circuit breaker box housing the switches. The breakers control the main power to the unit, a light bulb, and an electrical control cabinet. The light bulb is wired so that either of two breakers can provide power to it. When power is sent to the electrical control cabinet, a red indicator light illuminates. Inside the cabinet is the power supply from a personal computer. The power supply produces a 12 -V dc output that is sent over to a small fan next to it, also from a computer, and an amber light on the front of the cabinet illuminates. A separate switch powers the fan on and off. The power supply is behind a plastic shield to protect against exposure to live conductors. Electrical banana jacks are mounted in the plastic shield to allow a voltmeter to be connected safely when opening the cabinet and taking a meter reading to verify de-energization as part of a simulation exercise. This LOTO simulator prototype is designed and fabricated as an all-in-one unit. All accessories can be stored inside the hinged case, and there is a handle on top for ease of transport. The circuit breaker labels attach with <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>loop</b> <b>fasteners</b> so that they may be moved and changed to fit the training or demonstration scenario. The warning signs and labels on the electrical control box are magnetic, allowing for easy reconfiguration to emulate different equipment setups. A specially designed magnetic cover was made to disguise the indicator lights for demonstrations when these indicators are not used. The cover is disguised as an arc flash safety label that would typically be found on such a cabinet. One indicator light has a separate switch that can take it offline. This is to allow for demonstration to trainees on why it is important not to completely rely on indicator lights, but that they should always take a meter reading at the exposed conductors to absolutely verify de-energization before exposure. A clear plastic barrier and banana jacks inside the cabinet provide a safe way to plug in a voltmeter for demonstrations without exposure to the hazards of energized equipment. A small remote control unit is wired into the fan circuit. The remote allows the demonstrator to turn the fan on and off, provided that all of the breakers and switches leading to it are configured on as well. The remote feature was added in order to demonstrate the importance of starting the lockout/tagout task with energized equipment, then powering it down, isolating it, and locking it out to ensure that the correct breakers have been locked out...|$|R
