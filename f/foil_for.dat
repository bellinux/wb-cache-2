5|$|George {{was invited}} to meet with Grey's Anatomy {{executive}} producers after the show's casting agents saw her in the 2008 television drama, In Treatment. The actress' original contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances in season five, {{with the possibility of}} becoming a series regular. She was originally planned to be a romantic <b>foil</b> <b>for</b> Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), but the role was retooled after the former departed in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} Sycorax, a <b>foil</b> <b>for</b> Prospero, {{is closely related}} to the Medea of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Postcolonialist writers and critics see Sycorax as giving voice to peoples, particularly women, recovering from the effects of colonisation. Later versions of The Tempest, beginning with William Davenant's eighteenth-century adaptation, have given Sycorax a vocal role in the play, but maintained her image as a malevolent antagonist to Prospero.|$|E
40|$|Thin {{and stable}} {{diamond-like}} carbon (DLC) foils, which were fabricated at the Kurchatov Institute by sputter deposition, have proved recently to be advantageous for stripping and secondary electron timing of high energy heavy ions {{in a number}} of accelerator experiments. This resulted in expanding applications of these DLC foils which necessitated further development efforts directed toward the following applications of DLC targetry: (i) thin stripper <b>foils</b> <b>for</b> lower energy tandem accelerators, (ii) enlarged (up to 66 mm. in diameter) stop <b>foils</b> <b>for</b> improved time-of-flight elastic recoil detection ion beam analysis, and (iii) ultra-thin (about 0. 6 mug/cm(2)) DLC <b>foils</b> <b>for</b> some fundamental and applied physics experiments. Along with the fabrication of thin DLC stripper <b>foils</b> <b>for</b> tandem accelerators, much thicker (up to 200 mug/cm(2)) <b>foils</b> <b>for</b> post-stripping of heavy-ion beams in higher energy linacs, are within reach.

5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a <b>foil</b> <b>for</b> Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the back story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a <b>foil</b> <b>for</b> Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E

Created as an irritating <b>foil</b> <b>for</b> the character of Rupert Giles, he was intended to be killed off shortly after his first appearance, but the character was popular with his creators and was instead written into Angel where he joined a supernatural detective agency.
