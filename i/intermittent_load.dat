The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate systematically the effect of load amplitudes, frequencies and load durations of intermittently applied mechanical pressure on the sulfation of CS chains of cultured bovine articular cartilage explants. MethodsUsing a sinusoidal waveform of 0. 5 Hz frequency, cyclic compressive pressure of 0. 1 – 1. 0 MPa was applied for 10 s followed by a period of unloading lasting 10 – 1000 s. These <b>intermittent</b> <b>loading</b> protocols were repeated for a total duration of 1 – 6 days. Newly synthesized as well as endogenous CS chains were isolated, depolymerized and subsequently quantitated after fractionation by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. ResultsIncreasing the mechanical demands on cartilage explants by elevating either the duration or the frequency of loading can significantly alter the fine structure of newly synthesized CS in that less chains terminate on galNAc 4, 6 S and, in that simultaneously the ratio of the internal disaccharides ΔDi 6 S to ΔDi 4 S is increased. Similar results were obtained with explants being slightly mechanically challenged by low magnitudes of loads. ConclusionOur data show for the first time that <b>intermittent</b> <b>loading</b> of articular cartilage explants can significantly alter the sulfation pattern of the terminal CS residues as well as of the internal disaccharides. Furthermore, our results indicate that explants possess a physiological window of stress in which they are able to produce also a normal extracellular matrix...|$|R

The velocity vectors show that most of the liquid in the disc flows into vertebrae through endplates and only a small quantity of liquid flows through the annulus fibrosus at the loading step, however, at the unloading step, almost all the liquid flowing into IVD is through the endplates. Conclusions: The changing rate of pore pressure and effective stresses of nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus with higher permeability is smaller than that with smaller permeability. The degenerated endplate (with low permeability) yields high flow velocity decreasing gradient, which might impede liquid inflowing/outflowing smoothly through the endplates. The fluid flowing velocity in loading phase is faster than that in unloading phase, so a short resting time can relieve fatigue, but could not recover to the original liquid condition in IVDs.
