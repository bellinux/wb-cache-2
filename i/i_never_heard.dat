5|$|The train {{stopped at}} a station that had no town, and {{a short while later}} it passed the only banana {{plantation}} along the route that had its name written over the gate: Macondo. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba.|$|E
5|$|McGugin {{took time}} off from {{coaching}} {{to work in the}} mining business during the First World War. On a draft registration card completed in 1918, McGugin stated that he was the president of the Kensee Mining Company in Marion, Kentucky. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, Rabbit Curry was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. After learning about Curry's death McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean:During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> him utter a word his mother might not hear and approve. A game sportsman and scholar, truly he was gentle as a dove. He had a lion's heart, and now a hero's death. Poor Little Rabbit! How he pulls at the heart-strings of all of us who knew him and therefore honored and loved him tenderly.|$|E
500|$|At about 2:00p.m., Charles put {{his head}} on the block after saying a prayer and signalled the executioner when he was ready by {{stretching}} out his hands; he was then beheaded with one clean stroke. According to observer Philip Henry, a moan [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> before and desire I may never hear again" [...] rose from the assembled crowd, some of whom then dipped their handkerchiefs in the king's blood as a memento.|$|E

500|$|Ford was {{the only}} person to hold the {{president}}ial office without being elected as either president or vice-president. The choice of Ford to fulfill Spiro Agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. [...] "In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> him utter an unkind word," [...] said Martha Griffiths.|$|E
500|$|... "On Doing Good" [...] is {{mentioned}} in the Drapier's sixth letter when he states, [...] "I did very lately, as I thought it my duty, preach to the people under my inspection, upon the subject of Mr. Wood's coin; and although <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> that my sermon gave the least offence, as I am sure none was intended; yet, if it were now printed and published, I cannot say, I would insure it {{from the hands of}} the common hangman; or my own person from those of a messenger." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} in Massachusetts to Hutchinson's death was harsh. The Reverend Thomas Weld wrote, [...] "The Lord heard our groans to heaven, and freed {{us from our}} great and sore affliction…. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> that the Indians in those parts did ever before this commit the like outrage upon any one family or families; and therefore God's hand is the more apparently seen herein, to pick out this woeful woman". Peter Bulkley, the pastor at Concord, wrote, [...] "Let her damned heresies, and the just vengeance of God, by which she perished, terrify all her seduced followers from having any {{more to do with}} her leaven." ...|$|E

500|$|By May 1941, Sinatra {{topped the}} male singer polls in Billboard and Down Beat magazines. His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls {{of that time}} were called, {{revealed}} a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as [...] "Sinatramania" [...] after his [...] "legendary opening" [...] at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, [...] "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> such a commotion... All this for a fellow <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of." [...] Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as [...] "Swoonatra" [...] or [...] "The Voice", and his fans [...] "Sinatratics". They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, {{and within a few}} weeks of the show, some 1000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US. Sinatra's publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans, and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good. When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944 only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in. [...] Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity to touch his bed, and accost his person in the form of stealing clothing he was wearing, most commonly his bow-tie.|$|E
500|$|Aristotle however {{suggested}} that swallows and other birds hibernated. [...] This belief persisted {{as late as}} 1878, when Elliott Coues listed the titles of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. Even the [...] "highly observant" [...] Gilbert White, in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne, quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse [...] "while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone", though the man denied being an eyewitness. However, he also writes that [...] "as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> any such account worth attending to", and that if early swallows [...] "happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time—a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration", since he doubts they would [...] "return {{for a week or}} two to warmer latitudes".|$|E
500|$|Paul Verdon, in {{his history}} of All Black captains, Born to Lead, writes: [...] "The {{overwhelming}} evidence suggests Gallaher's leadership style, honed from {{time spent in the}} Boer War, was very effective." [...] Gallaher's biographer Matt Elliott asserts that in the century since his playing retirement [...] "his reputation as a player and leader have only enhanced". According to historian Terry McLean: [...] "In a long experience of reading and hearing about the man, one has never encountered, from the New Zealand angle, or from his fellow players, criticism of his qualities as a leader." [...] In the view of the English rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell, writing soon after Gallaher's death, the New Zealand captain was [...] "a very quiet, taciturn sort of cove, who spoke rarely about football or his own achievements... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> a soul who met him on that famous trip, say a disparaging word about him." ...|$|E

500|$|Within {{months of}} the marriage, Anne was {{pregnant}} but the baby, a girl, was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells, {{and over the next}} two years, she gave birth to two daughters in quick succession, Mary and Anne Sophia. In early 1687, within a matter of days, George and his two young daughters caught smallpox, and Anne suffered another miscarriage. George recovered, but both his daughters died. Lady Russell wrote that George and Anne had [...] "taken [...] very heavily. The first relief of that sorrow proceeded from the threatening of a greater, the Prince being so ill of a fever. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> any relation more moving than that of seeing them together. Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined." [...] He returned to Denmark for a two-month visit in mid-1687, while Anne remained in England. Later that year, after his return, Anne gave birth to another dead child, this time a son.|$|E

2500|$|Janick recalls it as follows: [...] "He rang {{me up and}} {{we talked}} but I {{remember}} saying, 'There is no way {{in this world that}} I am putting on make up or anything like that, I'm just not into that shit.' But we had a chat and he seemed like a nice enough guy. But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> back from him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to his critics, including Steve Poizner, Maldonado said, [...] "Since the budget was passed, you have gone around the state criticizing it and the role six Republicans played in its passage.

During the budget debate, which lasted over 100 days, I heard from thousands of Californians who {{took the time to}} give me their input on the state budget. But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> from you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Central Intelligence Agency also badly {{over-estimated}} {{the internal}} {{stability of the}} Soviet Union, and did not anticipate the speed of its collapse. Former DCI Stansfield Turner in 1991 wrote in the US Journal Foreign Affairs, [...] "We should not gloss over the enormity of this failure to forecast {{the magnitude of the}} Soviet crisis [...] [...] [...] Yet <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> a suggestion from the CIA, or the intelligence arms of the departments of Defense or State, that numerous Soviets recognized a growing, systemic economic problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Darwin {{appears to}} have had doubts as a month later {{in a letter to}} the French {{zoologist}} Armand de Quatrefages he wrote: [...] "I wish the translator had known more of Natural History; she must be a clever, but singular lady; but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of her, till she proposed to translate my book." [...] He was unhappy with Royer's footnotes and {{in a letter to the}} botanist Joseph Hooker he wrote: [...] "Almost everywhere in Origin, when I express great doubt, she appends a note explaining the difficulty or saying that there is none whatever!! It is really curious to know what conceited people there are in the world,..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mrs Williams {{insisted that}} there should be no {{graveyard}} at the church site, and a contemporary local tendency to fear of the subject may have some bearing on this decision. Arabella Elizabeth Tetley, a Beckwithshaw schoolmaster's wife, died of puerperal fever at age 23 years and was buried at Woodhouse Cemetery on Friday 17 April 1888. However gravedigger Fred Posey thought he saw [...] "an upheaval of the earth which he had placed upon the coffin and heard a creak which led him to believe that the buried woman was alive and trying to wrench the lid away." [...] He raised the alarm, saying that he had heard [...] "rattling" [...] in the coffin, and a [...] "knocking such as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> afore in a grave" [...] in 42 years of gravedigging. There was an exhumation and an inquest which ruled that there had been no disturbance within the coffin, so that the verdict was [...] "natural causes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clara {{first went}} to England in April 1856, while Robert was still living (but unable to travel). She was invited {{to play in a}} London Philharmonic Society concert by {{conductor}} William Sterndale Bennett, a good friend of Robert's. Clara was displeased with the little time spent on rehearsals: [...] "They call it a rehearsal here, if a piece is played through once." [...] She wrote that musical [...] "artists" [...] in England [...] "allow themselves to be treated as inferiors." [...] She was happy, though, to hear the cellist Alfredo Piatti play with [...] "a tone, a bravura, a certainty, such as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> before." [...] In May 1856 she played Robert's Piano Concerto in A minor with the New Philharmonic Society conducted by a Dr. Wylde, who Clara said had [...] "led a dreadful rehearsal" [...] and [...] "could not grasp the rhythm of the last movement." [...] Still, she returned to London the following year and performed in Britain in over 15 years of her career.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E
