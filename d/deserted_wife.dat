25|$|The Code {{recognized}} the importance of intent. A man who killed another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally and was then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does not say what would be the penalty of murder, but death is so often awarded where death is caused, that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor's fees. A brander, induced to remove a slave's identification mark, could swear to his ignorance and was free. The owner of an ox that gored a man on the street was only responsible for damages if the ox was known by him to be vicious—even if it caused death. If the mancipium died a natural death under the creditor's hand, the creditor was free. In ordinary cases, a person was not responsible for accident or if they exercised more than proper care. Poverty excused bigamy {{on the part of a}} <b>deserted</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E
500|$|The House of Lords {{effectively}} nullified Denning's {{work with}} the case National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth [...] AC 1175 in 1965, which ruled that the <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> had no licence to stay. The decision was very unpopular {{and led to the}} passing of the Matrimonial Homes Act 1967, which partially restored Denning's judgment {{in the form of a}} statute. Much of his work in favour of the <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> was based around his interpretation of the Married Women's Property Act 1882, which the House of Lords unanimously overruled in Pettitt v Pettitt [...] AC 777 in 1970. Further notable decisions by Denning in this area were Heseltine v Heseltine [...] 1 WLR 342 in 1971 and Wachtel v Wachtel [...] Fam 72 in 1973, which created basic rules for dividing family assets in a divorce case, something which had not previously been established in the law.|$|E
500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope you have the same trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deserted</b> <b>wives</b> with {{children}} became eligible for widows benefit {{if they had}} taken maintenance proceedings against their husbands and were not divorced (1936). Eligibility was later extended to <b>deserted</b> <b>wives</b> whose husband's whereabouts were known (1943) and to <b>deserted</b> <b>wives</b> who had no dependent children (1945).|$|R
50|$|The 1905 Annual Report of the Board {{shows that}} the highest group of people {{receiving}} temporary relief was those with illnesses and the lowest being those with husbands in prison. <b>Deserted</b> <b>wives</b> received little help. The Board tried to help those they considered to be most in need, more so than <b>deserted</b> <b>wives.</b> However, {{because of a lack}} of alternative systems of relief the Board decided they had to help them.|$|R
5000|$|The Pension Amendment Act (1936) {{extended}} pensions {{to a wider}} {{section of}} the population, including Lebanese, Chinese, invalids, and <b>deserted</b> <b>wives.</b>|$|R

60|$|Five {{years more}} passed, {{dating from the}} day when the <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> was laid in her grave. It was now the year {{eighteen}} hundred and sixty six.|$|E
60|$|The {{applications}} had {{all been}} within the last year, so {{that the man had}} probably learnt from Louisa Hall, the nursery-maid, that Cea was the child of a <b>deserted</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Destitute Persons Act (1910) made {{provision}} for illegitimate children and <b>deserted</b> <b>wives</b> and children. This legislation introduced {{the concept of}} attachment orders on wages, and was aimed at relieving destitution rather providing adequate long-term support.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the most}} notable {{contributions}} Mary Richmond gave was that she fought to obtain legislation for <b>deserted</b> <b>wives</b> and founded the Pennsylvania Child Labor Committee, the Public Charities Associated, the juvenile court, and the Housing Association.|$|R
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} {{precisely}} Mrs. Peedles arrived--as Flora MacDonald, in green velvet jacket and twelve to fifteen inches of plaid stocking. As a topic fitting the occasion {{we discussed the}} absent Mr. Peedles {{and the subject of}} <b>deserted</b> <b>wives</b> in general.|$|R
60|$|The {{second is}} not {{difficult}} to guess. It would have ended in the Divorce Court had not the <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> felt that a finer revenge would be secured to her by silence.|$|E
60|$|The <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> {{bore the}} {{bitterness}} and obloquy of her situation {{two years and}} a quarter; then she gave up, and drowned herself. A month afterwards the {{body was found in}} the water. Three weeks later Shelley married his mistress.|$|E
60|$|The first {{object that}} greeted Edgardo, {{as he rode}} up to the station on {{the arrival of the}} train, was the body of Burke the Slogger hanging on the cow-catcher; the second was the face of his <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> looking from the windows of a second-class carriage.|$|E
50|$|Another source, {{naming the}} poem as Xuanji Tu (Picture of the Turning Sphere), {{claims that it}} was a {{palindromic}} poem comprehensible only to Dou (which would explain why none of the Tang sources reprinted it), and that when he read it, he left his <b>desert</b> <b>wife</b> and returned to Su Hui.|$|R
50|$|Widowhood {{and wife}} {{desertion}} {{were much more}} common in 19th-century Australia than today, {{and in the absence}} of any social safety net for single mothers, women had to explore options to provide for their families, especially in remote areas. Pub-keeping provided jobs not only for widows and <b>deserted</b> <b>wives,</b> but also for many female ex-convicts.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Wilberforce {{noted that}} a <b>deserted</b> <b>wife’s</b> equity has been there partly because of a {{persistent}} post war housing shortage, and has been variously described as an equity, clog, licence or status of irremovability, and said {{this is all about}} whether despite Mrs Ainsworth’s rights against her husband, she had any against the bank. The wife, he continued, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the {{ordinary}} charge is fourpence, but widows {{get it for}} twopence for each child, and, perhaps, they may regard a <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> as a widow! There is a fine of twopence per hour for any child not taken away after eight, so you'll have {{to be up to}} time, mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I care not," [...] {{said the}} <b>deserted</b> <b>wife,</b> [...] "what degree of ridicule I may incur; if {{there be any}} one chance out of a hundred that I may obtain some {{certainty}} of my husband's fate, I would not miss that chance for whatever else the world can offer me." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not till}} the medical {{man had been}} summoned that his mind recurred to the words about his sister. He might have {{dismissed}} them as merely the jealous suspicion of the <b>deserted</b> <b>wife,</b> but that he remembered Lucilla's hint as to an attachment between Owen and Phoebe, {{and he knew that}} such would have been most welcome to Miss Charlecote.|$|E
50|$|He married May Ann Walsh in 1852; in 1863 he {{was charged}} with <b>deserting</b> his <b>wife.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1930, Parliament {{extended}} {{relief to}} <b>deserted</b> <b>wives,</b> by providing that, {{in the provinces}} where divorce was available, they could pursue proceedings {{on the grounds of}} desertion, so long as there had been separation from the husband for at least two years. In 1963, provision was made for the Senate of Canada to be able to dispose of parliamentary divorce petitions by way of resolution instead of by a private Act.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1966, Hamilton was {{appointed}} Secretary of the Department of Social Services. When the Whitlam Government was elected, {{the department was}} abolished and the new Department of Social Security established. Hamilton was Secretary of the new department {{for less than a}} month before he retired. During his time as head of the Social Services department, Hamilton broadened the department's scope by introducing legislation for <b>deserted</b> <b>wives,</b> for home care and for emergency relief.|$|R
60|$|But {{the horrors}} of the unknown had passed. Vague misgivings about her future as a <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> were at an end. The worst had once been matter of {{trembling}} conjecture; it was now matter of reason only, a limited badness. Her chief interest, the little Eustacia, still remained. There was humility in her grief, no defiance in her attitude; and when this is the case a shaken spirit is apt to be stilled.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was very}} terrible if true; if a {{temporary}} hallucination, sad. But, anyhow, {{here was this}} <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> of his, this passionately-fond woman, clinging to him without a suspicion {{that he would be}} anything to her but a protector. He saw that for him to be otherwise was not, in her mind, within the region of the possible. Tenderness was absolutely dominant in Clare at last. He kissed her endlessly with his white lips, and held her hand, and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{fact that}} Lady Grant {{had gone to}} Dresden was not long in {{reaching}} the ears of Mrs. Western. Dick Ross had heard at the club at Perth that she had gone, and had told Sir Francis. Sir Francis passed on the news to Miss Altifiorla, and from her it had reached the <b>deserted</b> <b>wife.</b> Miss Altifiorla had not told it direct, because at that time she and Cecilia {{were not supposed to}} be on friendly terms. But the tidings had got about and Mrs. Western had heard them.|$|E
50|$|After 1860, as {{the larger}} cities opened {{department}} stores, middle-class women {{did most of}} the shopping; increasingly they were served by young middle-class women clerks. Typically, most young women quit their jobs when they married. In some ethnic groups, however, married women were encouraged to work, especially among African-Americans, and Irish Catholics. When the husband operated a small shop or restaurant, wives and other family members could find employment there. Widows and <b>deserted</b> <b>wives</b> often operated boarding houses.|$|R
50|$|Kutumb Sakhi {{initially}} {{began as}} a group of women stitching petticoats from cloth purchased from a mill owned by the cricketer Vijay Merchant. However, to improve revenue, the organization turned to cooking snack foods; over the years, the organization has become quite successful in the Mumbai eatery business, and in turn, has served a role in empowering many women take control of the own futures. As of 2005, the organization employed around 150 women, many of who are widows or <b>deserted</b> <b>wives.</b>|$|R

60|$|How the husband's friend {{marked his}} sense of the husband's treachery has been told already. How he felt {{the death of the}} <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> is still left to tell. Report, which sees the inmost hearts of men, and delights in turning them outward to the public view, had always {{declared}} that Mr. Kendrew's life had its secret, and that the secret was a hopeless passion for the beautiful woman who had married his friend. Not a hint ever dropped to any living soul, not a word ever spoken to the woman herself, could be produced in proof of the assertion while the woman lived. When she died Report started up again more confidently than ever, and appealed to the man's own conduct as proof against the man himself.|$|E
60|$|Sir Philip's {{resolution}} {{threw his}} wife into agonies of terror; {{by which the}} worthy baronet was so much annoyed, that, contrary to his wont, he took some trouble to soothe her apprehensions, and once more brought her to shed tears, in which sorrow was not altogether unmingled with pleasure. Lady Bothwell asked, as a favour, Sir Philip's permission to receive her sister and her family into her own house during his absence on the Continent. Sir Philip readily assented to a proposition which saved expense, silenced the foolish {{people who might have}} talked of a <b>deserted</b> <b>wife</b> and family, and gratified Lady Bothwell, for whom he felt some respect, as for one who often spoke to him, always with freedom and sometimes with severity, without being deterred either by his raillery or the PRESTIGE of his reputation.|$|E
60|$|Her {{reluctance}} {{to communicate with}} her husband's parents might, she thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the reverse obtained. On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were {{under the impression that}} she was ultimately going to join her husband; and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after which he would come to fetch her, or that he would write for her to join him; in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world. This hope she still fostered. To let her parents know that she was a <b>deserted</b> <b>wife,</b> dependent, now that she had relieved their necessities, on her own hands for a living, after the éclat of a marriage which was to nullify the collapse of the first attempt, would be too much indeed.|$|E

In 1966, a Sydney City Mission report on the suburb described [...] "a lack of community life, a breakdown in family life, large numbers of <b>deserted</b> <b>wives,</b> needy children and bewildered people". Within two years of moving there, Bobby had been sentenced {{to five years in}} jail for assault and robbery after a fight at Blacktown RSL.|$|R
