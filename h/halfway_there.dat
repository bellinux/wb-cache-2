5|$|In September 1944, {{the brigade}} formed {{part of the}} second day's {{parachute}} landings at the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden. Problems reaching the bridges in Arnhem forced the divisional commander, Major-General Roy Urquhart, to divert one of the brigade's battalions to assist the 1st Parachute Brigade. After a short delay the brigade headed out for its objective. When only <b>halfway</b> <b>there,</b> however, the remaining two battalions were confronted by prepared German defences. The brigade, having suffered heavy losses, was eventually forced to withdraw. The next day, weakened by fighting at close quarters and now numbering around 150 men, the brigade eventually reached the divisional position at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|William Foster and William Eddy, both {{survivors}} of the snowshoe party, started from Bear Valley to intercept Reed, taking with them a man named John Stark. After one day, they met Reed helping his children, all frostbitten and bleeding but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to return to Truckee Lake with them. <b>Halfway</b> <b>there</b> they found the crudely mutilated and eaten remains of two children and Mrs. Graves, with one-year-old Elizabeth Graves crying beside her mother's body. Eleven survivors were huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two rescuers, hoping to save the healthiest, each took a child and left. John Stark refused to leave the others. Stark picked up two children and all the provisions, and assisted the nine remaining Breens and Graveses to Bear Valley.|$|E
5|$|On 8 and 9 January 1943, Div Cav {{advanced}} again. The A Squadron vehicles at Nofilia {{were loaded}} on transporters, which {{drove down the}} main road {{while the rest of}} the regiment screened the New Zealand Division advance. The A Squadron vehicles were unloaded near Wadi Bei el Chebir, east of the expected German rearguard near Wadi Temet, and the regiment caught up on 14 January. The following day, A Squadron crossed the road and withstood shelling by anti-tank guns and artillery until the afternoon. B Squadron probed south, also encountering German anti-tank guns. After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an anti-tank gun, B Squadron advanced through the German line, dislodging anti-tank guns and destroying a Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track. During the afternoon, C Squadron failed to break through the German centre but that night the Germans withdrew. On 16 January, the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at Sedada, losing a tank and carrier. C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness, losing a carrier to a mine on the trail. The regiment found an alternate route, ending the day in Wadi Merdum. On 18 January, Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni Ulid. The regiment advanced towards Tarhuna the following day, bivouacking <b>halfway</b> <b>there,</b> before discovering a route through the hills north of the road.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist [...] "doesn't bring {{much to the}} party. [...] It's {{not much of a}} film, but it sort of gets you <b>halfway</b> <b>there,</b> like a Yugo." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying, [...] "I'm yawning just writing this. [...] Sollett, hoping for a Before Sunrise/Before Sunset vibe, sadly settles for a soggy aftertaste." [...] In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Wilonsky likened the film to [...] "something crafted in a lab by 54-year-old hucksters trying to sell shit to the kids under the cheerless guise of '{{alternative}}.' The only thing it's an alternative to? Good." ...|$|E
500|$|Roth rewrote {{the lyrics}} for most tracks, {{as he wanted}} to {{incorporate}} {{a point of view}} from his current personal life. He declared that: [...] "All music is autobiographic. Particularly when it's not meant to be", adding that by retooling the songs [...] "there is a body of new that meets <b>halfway</b> <b>there,</b> that I think makes very colorful sense." [...] Only lead single [...] "Tattoo" [...] contains a synthesizer, which was played by Roth. Two other songs, [...] "You and Your Blues" [...] and [...] "As Is", have a processed guitar that sounds like a synth. Roth also performs acoustic guitar on the intro for [...] "Stay Frosty"—a song that he had written which was re-arranged by Wolfgang. Among the effects units used by Eddie on the album were his signature model MXR Phase 90, a Whammy pedal, and a Wah-wah pedal. The latter is prominently featured on the [...] "kind of Hendrix-ish" [...] "The Trouble with Never".|$|E
50|$|Lenape Lane is an unpaved one-lane {{dead-end}} street about three-quarter mile (1.1 km) in length running eastward off Shades {{just north of}} I-80.

This suggests that the chapel was built in 1854 and extended upwards in 1903.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the appeal}} of the river is its remote location, the very rugged and rough terrain, and lack of human presence. There are only five visible houses in the first 20 mi of river. At about 25 mi the Dry Devils River flows into the Devils, and is {{considered}} by many to be the <b>halfway</b> point. <b>There</b> are many homes in this point of the river and is called the Blue Sage Subdivision.|$|R
500|$|In October 2013, Nye began soliciting {{donations}} for {{the purchase}} of Angkor I, which was scheduled to return to the gallery unless $55,000 could be raised by 5pm on November 1, 2013. Two weeks prior to this deadline, the council had raised $31,750, more than $20,000 short of the asking price. In an interview published by The Oregonian, Nye said, [...] "Lee Kelly is a living legend and the pride of Oregon's artistic community. And his studio is right here in Clackamas County. He's a local treasure." [...] She also wrote in a press release, [...] "It would be a terrible loss to the community to have this sculpture removed, but it's fast becoming a reality". The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying [...] "We’re more than <b>halfway</b> <b>there,</b> but what we really need is a handful of lead donors to step forward and make this important work a permanent part of the City’s collection. And we need them now." [...] During the final two weeks of the fundraising campaign, the council draped a black parachute over the sculpture and posted signs requesting financial assistance, such as [...] "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, this sculpture is leaving... Let's hope it's not." ...|$|E
2500|$|It zig-zags northwestward for [...] towards Savant Lake, {{although}} as of 2011 {{the road}} reaches less than <b>halfway</b> <b>there.</b> It crosses several small rivers as it travels through the Boreal Forest before ending at a {{bridge over the}} Weaver River, south of Obonga-Ottertooth Provincial Park.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans {{pushed the}} British, Commonwealth and Greek forces {{steadily}} southward, using aerial and artillery bombardment, followed by waves of motorcycle and mountain troops (the rocky terrain {{making it difficult}} to employ tanks). The garrisons at Souda and Beritania gradually fell back along the road to Vitsilokoumos, north of Sfakia. About <b>halfway</b> <b>there,</b> near the village of Askyfou lay a large crater nicknamed [...] "The Saucer", the only place wide and flat enough for a large parachute drop. Troops were stationed about its perimeter, to prevent a landing that might block the retreat. Near Souda, the 5th New Zealand Brigade and the 2/7th Australian Battalion, held off the 141st Mountain Regiment, which had begun a flanking manoeuvre, and on 28 May, at the village of Stylos, the 5th New Zealand Brigade fought a rearguard action. The Luftwaffe was over Rethymno and Heraklion {{and they were able to}} retreat down the road.|$|E
50|$|The {{main stand}} is {{situated}} {{on the opposite side}} of the ground from the club offices and is a single-tier structure, covering half the length of the field, straddling the <b>halfway</b> line. <b>There</b> is also a small section of open terracing on one side and a small access space with gates and two entrances on its other side. The entrances are rarely, if ever, used and access is normally made from St Vincent Street, via the railway end of the ground.|$|R
50|$|In 1893 a cable tramway {{was built}} along Bank Road. <b>Halfway</b> up <b>there</b> was {{a stop at}} Smedley Street where Smedley's Hydro (built by John Smedley) was situated. Conceived by Job Smith, the tram was {{inspired}} by San Francisco's famous cable cars, and cost £20,000. When it was built it was the steepest tramway {{in the world at}} a gradient of 1 in 5½, and it rose 300 feet. The fare was tuppence up, penny down. It closed in 1927 after losing business to cars and buses.|$|R
50|$|It {{was split}} between two {{counties}} until 1965 {{when it became}} under one authority, (Huntingdon and Peterborough and, from 1974, Cambridgeshire).

2500|$|Liberal Democrats: Leader Nick Clegg {{stated in}} 2009 that his party backs legalisation. On 4 July 2009, {{in an article}} for LabourList, Clegg wrote that [...] "although civil {{partnerships}} have been a step forward, until same sex marriage is permitted {{it is impossible to}} claim gay and straight couples are treated equally." [...] Following this, the party's LGBT rights group LGBT+ Liberal Democrats launched a petition [...] "Marriage Without Borders" [...] calling for all gender restrictions on marriage and civil partnerships to be lifted, and for same-sex relationships to be recognised across Europe and internationally. The petition was run at Manchester Pride and Reading Pride in 2009, and launched online in January 2010 following an interview with Clegg in Attitude magazine in which he reaffirmed his commitment to equal marriage. However, this did not make it into the party's manifesto. In an interview in July 2010 Lib Dem deputy party leader Simon Hughes confirmed that the coalition Government plans to open marriage to same-sex couples, saying, [...] "It would be appropriate in Britain in 2010, 2011, for there to be the ability for civil marriage for straight people and gay people equally... The state ought to give equality. We’re <b>halfway</b> <b>there.</b> I {{think we ought to be}} able to get there in this parliament".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{species of}} whale were hunted in {{southern}} Labrador, the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale. The former were {{taken during the}} [...] "early" [...] season in the summer, while the latter was caught from the fall to early winter (October–January). DNA analysis of the old bones after a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century, in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence found that the right whale was by then less than 1% of the whales taken. During the peak of Terranova whaling (1560s–1580s) the Spanish Basques used well-armed galleons of up to 600–700 tons, while the French Basques usually fitted out smaller vessels. A 450-ton Basque ship carrying 100 or more men required about 300 hogsheads of cider and wine and 300–400 quintals of ship's biscuit, {{as well as other}} dry provisions. In Labrador the men subsisted mainly on locally caught cod and salmon, as well as the occasional caribou or wild duck. This diet was supplemented with dried peas, beans, chickpeas, olive oil, mustard seed, and bacon. Before leaving for Terranova sometime in the months of May or June, a priest went aboard the ships to bless them and say a special mass for the success of the expeditions. Sailing across the stormy North Atlantic must have been a very unpleasant experience for the crew of up to 130 men and boys, as they slept on the hard decks or filthy, vermin-invested straw palliasses. <b>Halfway</b> <b>there</b> the smell of refuse in the bilge would have been unbearable. After a voyage of two months the ships would anchor in one of the twelve harbors on the southern shore of Labrador and eastern Quebec. Archaeological evidence has been found for ten of these harbors – Middle Bay and Blanc-Sablon in Quebec, and Schooner Cove, West St. Modeste, East St. Modeste, Carrol Cove, Red Bay, Chateau Bay, Pleasure Harbour, and Cape Charles in southern Labrador. Once the ice had disappeared the ships entered the harbors where the coopers went ashore and erected their dwellings and workshops, while most of the crew lived aboard ship. The boys were also sent ashore to chop wood and prepare meals.|$|E

The second (slower) half of the piece features vocals by Jon Anderson and a narrative in Italian, by Krisma (Maurizio Arcieri and Christina Moser). [...] "See You Later" [...] has Vangelis on electric piano and staccato male atonal choir. About <b>halfway</b> through, <b>there</b> is a child narrative in French, with Anderson's vocals used in the finale.|$|R

The gallery was 163 ft high and was reached by a spiral staircase attached to the inside face of the wall. <b>Halfway</b> up <b>there</b> was a floor for making small lead shot. The gallery level at the top was used for making large shot.|$|R
50|$|The {{cartoons}} in {{the controversy}} parody India's national symbols, and {{are drawn to}} make a point on corruption in the government.

To the left, there is a pink flush, attached to a commode below with three flies hovering over it. The commode looks like the Indian Parliament.
