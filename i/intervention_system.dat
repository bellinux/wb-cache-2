This article considers the importance of a developmental perspective as an essential guide to early <b>intervention</b> service <b>systems.</b> Emphasized in this framework are three critical features: relationship formation, the continuity of interventions, and the comprehensiveness of interventions. Guidance to early <b>intervention</b> <b>systems</b> design with respect to structural and values principles is also discussed.

40|$|Several {{systems for}} {{treating}} alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) exist that operate on mobile phones. These systems are categorized into four groups: text-messaging monitoring and reminder <b>systems,</b> text-messaging <b>intervention</b> <b>systems,</b> comprehensive recovery management systems, and game-based systems. Text-messaging monitoring and reminder systems deliver reminders and prompt reporting of alcohol consumption, enabling continuous monitoring of alcohol use. Text-messaging <b>intervention</b> <b>systems</b> additionally deliver text messages {{designed to promote}} abstinence and recovery. Comprehensive recovery management systems use the capabilities of smart-phones to provide a variety of tools and services that can be tailored to individuals, including in-the-moment assessments and access to peer discussion groups.

40|$|Nowadays, an {{increasing}} need of <b>intervention</b> robotic <b>systems</b> {{can be observed}} in all kind of hazardous environments. In all these <b>intervention</b> <b>systems,</b> the human expert continues playing a central role from the decision making point of view. For instance, in underwater domains, when manipulation capabilities are required, only Remote Operated Vehicles, commercially available, can be used, normally using master-slave architectures and relaying all the responsibility in the pilot. Thus, the role played by human- machine interfaces represents a crucial point in current <b>intervention</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper presents a User Interface Abstraction Layer and introduces a new procedure to control an underwater robot vehicle by using a new intuitive and immersive interface, which will show to the user only the most relevant information about the current mission. Finally, some experiments have been carried out to compare a traditional setup and the new procedure, demonstrating reliability and feasibility of our approach.

50|$|PBIS {{comes with}} a variety of acronyms. Some schools cut out the “intervention” part, going with the proactive-only PBS system. PBIS is more akin to the three-tiered Response to <b>Intervention</b> <b>system.</b> Others add in the {{necessity}} of schoolwide (SW) implementation, dubbing the program SWPBIS. Whatever variation is used (here, PBIS), the primary practices included in the system are listed below. PBIS has shown promise in reducing exclusionary discipline practices overall, but has not shown, on its own, to be effective at reducing the racial disparities in student discipline, and in some cases has even been shown to exacerbate the discrepancies by further reducing discipline referrals for White students, but not for students of color. These criticisms have led to a call for examination of PBIS, and the integration of CLRP with PBIS in order to address systemic inequities in school discipline.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} if the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was effective in enhancing the skills of one student to prevent referral to special education and overcome learning barriers related to reading. A case study was compiled with data from three separate measures to determine if the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was effective at improving the case study student's barriers to learning in the subject of reading. When results from the case study student were analyzed, it was difficult to find progress that would indicate he was reading at grade level. While the data collected in regards to him was inconclusive, his teacher and support staff at the school believed that he made enough progress to not require a referral to special education.   In addition, this thesis examines teacher perspectives as to the effectiveness and use of the system within a classroom, as well as if the documentation and training provided are believed to be comprehensive and efficient. The CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> is a system for general education teacher use that helps teachers identify specific student barriers to learning, identify appropriate classroom and/or individual intervention strategies, provides equipment if appropriate, and incorporates a progress monitoring system to determine intervention effectiveness. It was implemented in both the 2010 - 2011 and 2012 - 2013 school years, and surveys to examine teacher perception were completed {{at the end of each}} year The results from the survey indicate that the teachers believed the <b>intervention</b> <b>system</b> was easy to use, yet teachers did not believe it reduced special education referrals or that the documentation provided by the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was helpful or easy to use. This may have been related to the training provided prior to using the system, as teachers believed that it did not appropriately address how to use the system. Despite these results, teachers believed that the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> was effective at improving student success. Further research must be conducted in order to further support the research questions presented in this survey study and the ability of the CATT <b>Intervention</b> <b>System</b> to improve a student's ability to be a successful learner within a classroom.   M.

40|$|Proceedings of the IEEE ICRA 2010. Workshop on Multimodal Human-Robot Interfaces hold on Anchorage (Alaska), May 2010 Graphical User Interfaces {{play a very}} {{important}} role in the context of Underwater <b>Intervention</b> <b>Systems.</b> Classical solutions, specially concerning Remotely Operated Vehicles, frequently require users with an advanced technical level for controlling the system. In addition, continuous human feedback in the robot control loop is normally needed, thus generating a significant stress and fatigue to the pilot. This paper shows work in progress towards a new multimodal user interface within the context of autonomous underwater robot <b>intervention</b> <b>systems.</b> We aim at providing an intuitive user interface that can greatly improve the nonexpert user’s performance and reduce the fatigue that operators normally experiment with classical solutions. For this, we widely adopt advanced interaction systems such as haptic devices, projectors, Head-Mounted Display and more.
