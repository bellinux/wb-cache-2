5000|$|The Government of South Korea {{enacted the}} [...] "Automotive Industry Promotion Law" [...] in 1962. Under this legislation, the {{importation}} of assembled automobiles was outlawed, subsidies were made available to assemblers who were also afforded tariff <b>exemption</b> <b>on</b> the <b>importation</b> of parts. Responsibility for deciding which firms would be authorized to undertake automobile manufacturing was held by the Minister of Trade and Industry, {{who at the time}} opted to appoint just one company for each product segment to maximize economies of scale. The minister initially favored the Sammi Corporation for passenger automobiles. Preference was shifted to Saenara Motors after the latter made alleged political contributions to the party recently established by the military government. Consequently, Saenara signed an agreement with Nissan who provided the company with technical assistance and a 35 million loan to facilitate the construction of a factory in Bupyeong-gu, Incheon. Saenara Motors began importing duty-free Datsun Bluebird (310) semi-knock-down kits from Nissan in November 1962 at a cost of [...] per unit. The assembled cars were then retailed at —thus producing large profit margins that allowed Saenara to provide political donations to the government. Due to a shortage in foreign currency, the junta later forbid the firm from importing further kits, leading to the cessation of manufacture in May 1963, having built only 2,773 cars. Saenara collapsed that July, thus resulting in its ownership transfer under joint management by the ministry and Hanil Bank.|$|R

40|$|PhDThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to reform customs {{valuation}} law and VAT <b>on</b> <b>importation</b> of goods under trends in trade globalisation, using Thailand as the example. To achieve this purpose, a number of related topics (e. g. the 'notional' and 'positive' concepts of value, international customs valuation systems - the Brussels Definition of Value and the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement the destination and origin principles, VAT <b>on</b> <b>importation,</b> and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)) are brought to analysis in a comprehensive way. The research findings indicate that the existing system of customs valuation in Thailand is arbitrary and constitutes a significant barrier to trade. Such problems will be reduced (or eliminated) under the new customs valuation legislation, based on the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement. However, {{the system of the}} WTO customs valuation is complicated, creating some difficulties for developing countries like Thailand to apply. In this connection, co-operation among ASEAN customs administrations should be enhanced. The 'regional minimum values' should also be applied for determining the customs value where the transactions within the ASEAN region are between related parties. With regard to VAT <b>on</b> <b>importation,</b> it is found that, in the two countries (the UK and Thailand) surveyed, there is no particular problem inherent in the destination-based VAT. Most problems relate to the administration as well as the base of VAT <b>on</b> <b>importation</b> in Thailand. Reforms on these matters have to be undertaken unilaterally and voluntarily to improve prospects for attracting foreign investment and increasing trade. This thesis is based upon law and agreements in force at 31 December 1999...|$|R
