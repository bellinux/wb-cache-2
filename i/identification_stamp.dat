5000|$|The {{deportation}} {{followed a}} series of steps to discriminate, persecute, and disenfranchise Jews in Norway. Jewish individuals were at first arrested, Jewish property was confiscated, Jews were ordered to report to local police stations and have their <b>identification</b> cards <b>stamped</b> with a [...] "J" [...] and fill in a lengthy form about their profession, holdings, and family. Based on the lists the police compiled, most Jewish adult men were arrested and detained in October 1942, and by November 26, women and children were also arrested for deportation. This is the only time in Norwegian history that Norwegian police had been ordered to arrest children.|$|R

30|$|From the 1 st to the 3 rd centuries A.D., the {{territory}} of Istria (present-day Croatia) was a prominent area of olive oil production. Archaeologists have identified the so-called Dressel 6 B amphora as the main container used in the transport and trade of this oil. So far archaeology and epigraphy have helped identify probable sources of production and two workshops in Istria, and have also allowed the reconstruction of main trade routes through the <b>identification</b> of <b>stamped</b> amphorae. However, much less {{is known about the}} organization of the production of these ceramic containers, which may have been conducted on an almost industrial scale. This preliminary study demonstrates how chemical analysis using energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF) may address this question and provide new answers and avenues of inquiry.|$|R

50|$|The uniform {{was made}} of a blue coat, red piped white collar and cuffs, white piped red lapels, blue piped red cuff flaps and {{shoulder}} straps, white turnbacks piped red, and brass buttons. Only the brass buttons had the units' <b>identification</b> numbers <b>stamped</b> on them. The lapels were fastened at the upper chest but sloped away below. The hat, a black felt bicorne, was the standard infantry headdress at some of Napoleon's greatest battles. In 1807, the hat {{was replaced by the}} shako, which {{was made of}} black felt, chevron on the side and visor, a brass diamond shaped plate stamped with the Imperial eagle over the unit's regimental number, white cords, and brass chin scales. Napoleon experimented with a few units by reintroducing white coats with facings of different colours specific to each unit (reminiscent of the old Royal army's coats), but these proved unpopular.|$|R

The law consisted of various paragraphs, four of {{which focused on}} Jews.The law prohibited relationships between those of German blood or related with Jews; it stated that violations could result in imprisonment.The law also {{made it clear that}} it was unlawful for Jews to employ German females or their family members under the age of 45. It was also deemed unacceptable for Jews {{to be associated with the}} Reich flag. People of Jewish descent and Germans who had Jewish spouses were persecuted by the Nazi regime. Everyone in Germany was required to carry around an identification card; however, Jewish people had specific <b>identification</b> marks <b>stamped</b> on their cards for police to easily determine and recognize who was Jewish. Those considered Mischlinge appeared to accept the Nuremberg Laws, although some people were oppressed. The Nazis put these laws to use in attempts to expel Jews and Mischlinge from the Aryan society.|$|R

50|$|A dye lot is {{a record}} taken during the dyeing of yarn to {{identify}} yarn that received its coloration in the same vat at the same time. Yarn manufacturers assign each lot a unique <b>identification</b> number and <b>stamp</b> it on the label before shipping. Slight differences in temperature, dyeing time, and other factors can result in different shades of the same color between different dye lots of otherwise identical production.

40|$|Marking bread {{was an old}} {{practice}} {{performed in}} different parts of the old world. It was done for religious, magical, economic and <b>identification</b> purposes. Bread <b>stamps</b> differ from other groups of stamps. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to identify such stamps, displayed or stored, in a number of Jordanian Archaeological Museums. A col-lection of twelve ancient bread stamps were identified and studied. Two of the stamps were of unknown provenance while the others came from al-Shuneh, Dhiban, Khirbet an-Nawafla, Abu-Sido and Jerash. The stamps are presented according to their museum col-lection since a chronological classification could not be achieved due to the fact that the majority of the stamps were purchased from antiquities dealers...|$|R
50|$|The second {{required}} element, {{at least}} for stamps intended to be used on international mail, {{is the name of}} the country. The first postage stamps, those of the United Kingdom, had no name. In 1874 the Universal Postal Union exempted Great Britain from its rule which stated that a country's name had to appear on their postage stamps, so a profile of the reigning monarch was all that was required for <b>identification</b> of Britain's <b>stamps.</b> To this day the UK remains the only country not required to name itself on its stamps. For all other UPU members, the name must appear in Latin letters. Many countries using non-Latin alphabets used only those on their early stamps, and they remain difficult for most collectors to identify today.|$|R

40|$|Previously we {{reported}} a novel strategy of “targeted killing ” through {{the design of}} narrow-spectrum molecules known as specifically targeted antimicrobial peptides (STAMPs) (R. Eckert et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 50 : 3651 – 3657, 2006; R. Eckert et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 50 : 1480 – 1488, 2006). Construction of these molecules requires the identification and the subsequent utilization of two conjoined yet functionally independent peptide components: the targeting and killing regions. In this study, we sought to design and synthesize {{a large number of}} STAMPs targeting Streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of human dental caries, in order to identify candidate peptides with increased killing speed and selectivity compared with their unmodified precursor antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We hypothesized that a combina-torial approach, utilizing a set number of AMP, targeting, and linker regions, would be an effective method for the <b>identification</b> of <b>STAMPs</b> with the desired level of activity. STAMPs composed of the Sm 6 S. mutans binding peptide and the PL- 135 AMP displayed selectivity at MICs after incubation for 18 to 24 h. A STAMP where PL- 135 was replaced by the B- 33 killing domain exhibited both selectivity and rapid killing within 1 min of exposure and displayed activity against multispecies biofilms grown in the presence of saliva. These results suggest that potent and selective STAMP molecules can be designed and improved via a tunable “building-block ” approach...|$|R
40|$|To {{conduct an}} {{elevation}} survey, a surveyor needs {{a starting point}} for which the exact elevation above mean sea level is known. These starting points are called benchmarks. State and federal agencies install benchmarks throughout every State, creating a network of elevation points which covers the entire continental United States. These benchmarks are considered to be permanent, and usually consist of a brass, bronze, or aluminum disc about 4 inches in diameter mounted in a cement post or in a drill hole in a permanent foundation. Each benchmark also has the installing agency's name and an <b>identification</b> number <b>stamped</b> into it. In December of 1980 the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) allotted the State of Delaware funds to determine the number and condition of federal benchmarks and other elevation reference control points. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), contained within FEMA, requires accurate flood surveys of property in flood-prone areas. An extensive and accurate benchmark network throughout the State is needed to help meet these needs.

40|$|Although {{modularity}} affords various {{options to}} the orthopedic surgeon, these benefits {{come at a}} price. The unintended bearing surface between the back surface of the tibial insert and the metallic tray results in micromotion leading to polyethylene wear debris. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the backside wear of tibial inserts from three modern total knee designs with very different locking mechanisms: Insall-Burstein II® (IB II®), Optetrak®, and Advance®. A random sample of 71 inserts were obtained from our institution’s retrieval collection and examined to assess the extent of wear, depth of wear, and wear damage modes. Patient records were also obtained to determine patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and reason for revision. Modes of wear damage (abrasion, burnishing, scratching, delamination, third body debris, surface deformation, and pitting) were then scored in each zone from 0 to 3 (0 [*]=[*] 0 %, 1 [*]=[*] 0 – 10 %, 2 [*]=[*] 10 – 50 %, and 3 [*]=[*]> 50 %). The depth of wear was subjectively identified as removal of manufacturing <b>identification</b> markings <b>stamped</b> onto the inferior surface of the polyethylene. Both Advance® and IB II® polyethylene inserts showed significantly higher scores for backside wear than the Optetrak® inserts. All IB II® and Advance® implants showed evidence of backside wear, whereas 17 % (5 out of 30) of the retrieved Optetrak® implants had no observable wear. There were no significant differences when comparing the depth of wear score between designs. The locking mechanism greatly affects the propensity for wear and should be considered when choosing a knee implant system...|$|R

[...] The first synagogue in Trondheim was established in 1899, and a newer one came into use by 1925. By 1900, 119 Jews were living in Trondheim, reaching 260 by 1940. The Nazi regime confiscated the synagogue in 1941, and used it for military uses. In January 1942, the town Jews' <b>identification</b> cards were <b>stamped</b> with the letter [...] "J", and confiscations started to {{be more and more}} common. Shortly after, Jews from Trondheim began to emigrate to Sweden. The rest were sent to Auschwitz in October 1942. In 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, around 80 Jews returned to the city. Out of the 135 individuals sent to Auschwitz, only five (5) remained in Norway. It is unclear how many others, if any, survived. The synagogue was repaired in 1947. In May 1997, a Jewish museum was opened in Trondheim. At the turn of the 21st century, 120 Jews were living in Trondheim.|$|R
5000|$|The latest {{models of}} cars often have {{sophisticated}} anti-theft devices, requiring sophisticated measures to defeat them. For the car thief, {{the difficulty in}} bypassing these security features may be nearly impossible or too time consuming. Most cars equipped with these systems are either stolen while the keys {{are still in the}} ignition - mostly from owner negligence at a gas station - or towed away by [...] "sneaker" [...] tow trucks. Advanced car theft [...] "rings" [...] have the knowledge and equipment needed to bypass this security. For instance, on cars equipped with RF transmitters inside of the key, the RF transmitter ID must match the security module and the engine computer. So, not only does the physical key cut have to match, the RF transmitter has to match as well. To get around this, some [...] "rings" [...] establish relationships with car dealers and get car keys cut by VIN directly from the dealer themselves. Other methods are to try multiple pre-cut keys, and to use code scanners for RF based systems. There may be many hidden places on the car where the VIN (Vehicle <b>Identification</b> Number) is <b>stamped.</b> The chop shop will likely be more familiar with these devices.|$|R
40|$|Milk is a food of high {{nutritional}} value {{and is considered}} one of the main animal products consumed today. At the same time, Brazil stands out as one of the leading milk producers in the world and, since 2006 has been showing growing increase in its production. On the other hand, it is observed from the beginning of the 1990 s, the growth of so-called informal milk and milk products (foods marketed without any kind of inspection), representing a challenge to be overcome related to food security. There are many diseases that can be transmitted by such foods, as tuberculosis and brucellosis, and there are few consumers who are aware of such information. The fact worsens the thought that milk and dairy products make up the diet of many children, elderly and weakened persons, which may make it more severe. Thus, this study aims to evaluate, through the use of questionnaires in 23 districts of São José do Rio Preto, the profile of 805 consumers or not, of milk and dairy products, the knowledge that they have about the diseases transmitted by milk and dairy products and the significance of the seals from Inspection Services. As a result, it was found that 97. 76 % (787 / 805) respondents consume milk or its derivatives, and about 30 % are obtained by informal means of commerce. The form of consumption of this product is quite variable, but the work shows that 3. 93 % (31 / 787) of the consumers still ingest raw milk without boiling or pasteurization and 65. 96 % (531 / 805) of consumers are unaware of the possible transmission of disease by the ingestion of milk. Furthermore 80. 24 % (646 / 805) of consumers do not seek the packaging if the product has gone through some kind of supervision before reaching the trade - <b>identification</b> through <b>stamps</b> organs of sanitary inspection. Obtaining such data aims to collaborate in future for the development of prevent programs in the city, and the information gathered will be available to assist inspections services to reduce the marketing of informal milk and dairy products and also in educational campaigns for consumers...|$|R
50|$|Low {{national}} plastic recycling {{rates have}} been due to the complexity of sorting and processing, unfavorable economics, and consumer confusion about which plastics can actually be recycled. Part of the confusion has been due {{to the use of the}} resin identification code which is not on all plastic parts but just a subset that includes the recycling symbol as part of its design. The resin <b>identification</b> code is <b>stamped</b> or printed on the bottom of containers and surrounded by a triangle of arrows. (See the table in Plastic.) The intent of these symbols was to make it easier to identify the type of plastics used to make a particular container and to indicate that the plastic is potentially recyclable. The question that remains is which types of plastics can be recycled by local recycling centers. In many communities, not all types of plastics are accepted for sidewalk recycling collection programs due to the high processing costs and complexity of the equipment required to recycle certain materials. There is also sometimes a seemingly low demand for the recycled product depending on a recycling center's proximity to entities seeking recycled materials. Another major barrier is that the cost to recycle certain materials and the corresponding market price for those materials sometimes does not present any opportunity for profit. The best example of this is polystyrene (commonly called styrofoam), although some communities, like Brookline, Massachusetts, are moving toward banning the distribution of polystyrene containers by local food and coffee businesses.|$|R
40|$|In this work, we have {{investigated}} three different research problems. In the first chapter, we introduce an imaging colorimeter for measuring tooth color {{that is based}} on two exposures with a digital camera using two different filters. We describe new procedures for alignment and calibration of the system. We also consider three different sources of illumination. We propose two approaches to estimating tooth color information from the acquired camera data, both of which employ linear regression. In the first approach, we estimate CIE XYZ coordinates of the tooth under a pre-selected illuminant. In the second approach, we estimate the spectral reflectance of the tooth, thus enabling us to predict tristimulus values under any illuminant. Finally, we present results from in vivo measurement of subject 2 ̆ 7 s teeth. ^ In the second chapter, a subspace matching method is developed to design color filters for a multi-spectral imaging system to capture the spectral reflectance of surfaces accurately with minimal number of measurements. The imaging colorimeter developed in chapter 1 is used as an example in the simulation where the performance of the best filters designed with our method and Wolski 2 ̆ 7 s [1] method are compared. ^ The third chapter describes the development of an automated prescreening tool, along with an image fidelity metric to reduce the workload of human observers involved in the image screening. This tool is capable of performing automatic image registration, configuration page <b>identification</b> and time <b>stamp</b> detection. A visualization module is also included to highlight regions of interest in an image. This tool works {{for a wide range of}} image types and content. ...|$|R
