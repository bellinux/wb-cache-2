They are eccentrically disposed in curves and other queer figures. All abut upon galleries running in sections along the lode-line, and intended ultimately to connect. The total length may be a thousand feet. Being cut in the gneiss, they require no timbering; but the floors are little raised above the level of the rivulet, and water percolates through roofs and walls. The latest tunnel has been driven past the new gallery, and has struck a second lode; this has never been worked by the natives, and stoping to above the springs may be found advisable. Ventilation is managed by means of the old abandoned native shafts. A very large quantity of ore is brought to bank. I found it hard to form an estimate, because it was in scattered heaps overgrown with vegetation; but I should not be surprised if it amounted to 5,000 tons. This means that want of proper machinery has resulted in a <b>dead</b> <b>capital</b> of from 20,000l. to 30,000l.|$|E

Gautier thinks, or seventy-two years ago he thought (and there has not been much change since), that [...] "Cordova has a more African look than any other city of Andalusia; its streets, or rather its lanes, whose tumultuous pavement resembles the bed of dry torrents, all littered with straw from the loads of passing donkeys, have nothing that recalls the manners and customs of Europe. The Moors, if they came back, would have no great trouble to reinstate themselves. ... The universal use of lime-wash gives a uniform tint to the monuments, blunts the lines of the architecture, effaces the ornamentation, and forbids you to read their age.... You cannot know the wall of a century ago from the wall of yesterday. Cordova, once the center of Arab civilization, is now a huddle of little white houses with corridors between them where two mules could hardly pass abreast. Life seems to have ebbed from the vast body, once animated by the active circulation of Moorish blood; nothing is left now but the blanched and calcined skeleton.... In spite of its Moslem air, Cordova is very Christian and rests under the special protection of the Archangel Raphael." [...] It is all rather contradictory; but Gautier owns that the great mosque is a [...] "monument unique in the world, and novel even for travelers who have had the fortune to admire the wonders of Moorish architecture at Granada or Seville." ...|$|E

After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 that overthrew the monarchy and established a republic, Gamal Abdel Nasser rose to power on themes that mixed Arab and Egyptian nationalism. Nasser saw Egypt as the leader of the Arab states and saw Egypt's role as promoting Arab solidarity against both the West and Israel. Nasser's first priority was end subordination to Britain which meant most urgently the removal of British bases privileges and acquire greater control over the Suez Canal. [...] In 1952 Nasser produced a work that was half autobiographical and half programtic. It offers and account o how he and other officers who overthrew the monarchy on July 23 of that year came to a decision to seize power and how they planned to use their newly won power. Egypt was briefly united with Syria from 1958 until 1961 when Syria abandoned the union. Nasser's successors, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak de-emphasized Arab nationalism and re-emphasized Egyptian nationalism based on Egypt's distinctiveness within the Arab world.

5000|$|The {{existence}} of such massive exclusion generates two parallel economies, legal and extra legal. An elite minority enjoys the economic benefits {{of the law and}} globalization, while the majority of entrepreneurs are stuck in poverty, where their assets—adding up to more than US$10 trillion worldwide—languish as <b>dead</b> <b>capital</b> {{in the shadows of the}} law.To survive, to protect their assets, and to do as much business as possible, the extralegals create their own rules. But because these local arrangements are full of shortcomings and are not easily enforceable, the extralegals also create their own social, political and economic problems that affect the society at large.Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, responsible nations around the developing world have worked hard to make the transition to a market economy, but have in general failed. Populist leaders have used this failure of the free market system to wipe out poverty in the developing world to beat their [...] "anti-globalization" [...] drums. But the ILD believes that the real enemy is within the flawed legal systems of developing nations that make it virtually impossible for the majority of their people—and their assets—to gain a stake in the market. The people of these countries have talent, enthusiasm, and an astonishing ability to wring a profit out of practically nothing`.What the poor majority in the developing world do not have is easy access to the legal system which, in the advanced nations of the world and for the elite in their countries, is the gateway to economic success, for it is in the legal system where property documents are created and standardized according to law. That documentation builds a public memory that permits society to engage in such crucial economic activities as identifying and gaining access to information about individuals, their assets, their titles, rights, charges and obligations; establishing the limits of liability for businesses; knowing an asset's previous economic situation; assuring protection of third parties; and quantifying and valuing assets and rights. These public memory mechanisms in turn facilitate such opportunities as access to credit, the establishment of systems of identification, the creation of systems for credit and insurance information, the provision for housing and infrastructure, the issue of shares, the mortgage of property and a host of other economic activities that drive a modern market economy.|$|E

The dramatic development of the financial markets in the recent years, related mainly to the development of communications technologies and to globalization, enabled Czech companies to make easy use of the capital markets to up-value their momentarily surplus <b>dead</b> <b>capital.</b> The reason why Czech companies have not used this possibility so much so far is partly the tradition of using banking institutions, partly the historically not very developed Czech financial market, and last but not least the worries about the risk of money depreciation. This thesis deals with the optimal portfolio creation methods in the conditions of the Prague Stock Exchange, including the risk management. The theoretical part of the thesis analyses the individual segments of the financial and capital markets from different points of view and it also analyses the <b>dead</b> <b>capital</b> management risks. An independent chapter is dedicated to the stock exchange indices as prospective underlying assets for financial derivatives. The chapter then analyses the structure of PX index, which includes the most liquid Czech shares. The thesis pays substantial attention to the legal and economic analyses of the financial derivatives as possible instruments, alternatively utilizable for appreciation of the <b>dead</b> <b>capital.</b> Financial derivatives do not necessarily represent a considerably higher risk for the company than using other financial instruments if their usage is accompanied by suitable risk mitigation methods. The view of financial derivatives as a game of hazard is analysed separately. This analysis aims to avoid potential legal complications that could be connected with financial derivatives. The closing section of the theoretical part describes the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and then it extends and modifies it for the conditions of the Prague Stock Exchange. The practical part of the thesis describes the methods of creating the optimal portfolio, which might help the company appreciate the <b>dead</b> <b>capital.</b> The procedures of creating the portfolio are verified on particular titles, including the possibility of using a financial derivative and comparison of both approaches.

"It {{may appear}} invidious in me, Miss Psyche Zenobia, to {{refer you to}} any article, or set of articles, {{in the way of}} model or study, yet perhaps I may as well call your {{attention}} to a few cases. Let me see. There was 'The <b>Dead</b> Alive,' a <b>capital</b> thing!--the record of a gentleman's sensations when entombed before the breath was out of his body--full of tastes, terror, sentiment, metaphysics, and erudition. You would have sworn that the writer had been born and brought up in a coffin. Then we had the 'Confessions of an Opium-eater'--fine, very fine!--glorious imagination--deep philosophy acute speculation--plenty of fire and fury, and a good spicing of the decidedly unintelligible. That was a nice bit of flummery, and went down the throats of the people delightfully. They would have it that Coleridge wrote the paper--but not so. It was composed by my pet baboon, Juniper, over a rummer of Hollands and water, 'hot, without sugar.'" [...] [This I could scarcely have believed had it been anybody but Mr. Blackwood, who assured me of it.] [...] "Then there was 'The Involuntary Experimentalist,' all about a gentleman who got baked in an oven, and came out alive and well, although certainly done to a turn. And then there was 'The Diary of a Late Physician,' where the merit lay in good rant, and indifferent Greek--both of them taking things with the public. And then there was 'The Man in the Bell,' a paper by-the-by, Miss Zenobia, which I cannot sufficiently recommend to your attention. It is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the clapper of a church bell, and is awakened by its tolling for a funeral. The sound drives him mad, and, accordingly, pulling out his tablets, he gives a record of his sensations. Sensations are the great things after all. Should you ever be drowned or hung, be sure and make a note of your sensations--they will be worth to you ten guineas a sheet. If you wish to write forcibly, Miss Zenobia, pay minute attention to the sensations." ...|$|R

In this article, I will argue why the poor class could not become an entrepreneur through the technical methode proposed by De Soto. And I will examine some tanzanian cases in order to support my argument. The critical point is that the law and lawyers of Tanzania have played the most important roles for the capital accumulation since the colonization of the nation and that the exploitation and the deprivation continued and protected by the law. Even, the law in an era of neoliberalism denies the employment rights and deprive the land of custom system from the poor only for the private profits.

40|$|D. Litt et Phil. The {{number of}} slums and {{squatter}} settlements is rising globally; this is recognised {{as a significant}} problem {{as many of the}} urban poor find housing in these settlements. With the expanding slum settlements comes a serious problem for many developing nations, that of finding a mechanism to improve these informal developments. These settlements are a symptom of poor urban governance and lack of financial resources causing the urban poor to be pushed into these dwellings and find themselves on the periphery of urban society, not only geographically but socially, economically and legally. Upgrading, integration and legalisation of these housing types is necessary if these peripheral suburbs are to be developed formally. Although many governments have tried top-down approaches of upgrade, these approachs have often failed to produce results as slum upgrades often lead to displacement of the original inhabitants who are ousted into areas even further to the periphery of urban centres. This thesis looks at alternatives to viewing settlements on the urban fringe as a quandary, by using a neoliberal theoretical framework (despite its many flaws), informal property markets in townships in Johannesburg, South Africa {{can be seen as a}} catalyst for wealth creation and local economic development. This is particularly important given the historical context of apartheid in South Africa and the segregation of the majority of the population into racially exclusive slums. The post-apartheid government has rallied to improve the lives of this group of poor and dispossessed people with the provision of decent housing a key aspect of this process. A neoliberal framework for economic development was embarked upon in South Africa, with the introduction of neoliberal economic policy (namely GEAR) in 1998, South Africa embarked on a process of reform to encourage market growth. This manifest itself in the ‘Breaking New Ground’ housing policy which adopted a neoliberal stance on Housing provision, and although not removing the role of government in providing low-cost housing, it strives for a market driven housing solution. With a shortage of over 1 million houses in the city, there should be every potential market orientated low-cost housing sector, yet capital within this property sector is often referred to as <b>dead</b> <b>capital</b> with no intrinsic value. This thesis challenges that view by determining the existence of Crisylida capital in township property assets. Crisylida capital is virgining capital in the low-cost property market that could lead to the accumulation of asset capital within this property group, estimated value of Crisylida capital in Johannesburg alone is R 6. 3 billion. Residents in low-cost housing in Township suburbs in Johannesburg recognise economic value in their dwelling, with only 21 % of participants valuing their property at less than R 10 000. Further, real estate agents working the township real estate market estimate that just over 50 % of properties in these areas are valued at over R 200 000. Within this property environment, security of tenure plays an important role in creating not only wealth creation but equally a sense of community ownership. Houses with tenure saw 37 % of respondents interested or actively participating in community projects, this compared to 13 % of respondents without tenure. This thesis points to a new understanding of low-cost property in Johannesburg, South Africa as a potential market worth billions of Rands that could inject wealth into the hands of marginalised communities. This in turn could assist in fostering sustainable socio-economic urban community within disenfranchised township suburbs...|$|E
