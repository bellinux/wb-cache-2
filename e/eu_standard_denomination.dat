This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the diffusion of <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> and product quality upgrading using highly disaggregated import data to the EU in the food industry. Results show that, on average, the diffusion of <b>EU</b> voluntary <b>standards</b> boosts the rate of quality upgrading.

40|$|Croatia’s EU {{accession}} of July 2013 {{may have}} significant impacts on neibouring exporters such as Bosnia and Herzegovina. Each EU member state {{is obliged to}} comply with various <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> based on the Acquis Communautaire. In the accession process, Croatia pursued institutional reforms in agriculture and food sectors, among others, {{under the direction of}} Brussels. Upon Slovenia’s EU accession in 2004, Croatia’s agricultural sector saw a same problem as today’s Bosnia. This paper examines the negative effects of <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> on trade flows between Croatia (then a non-EU member) and Slovenia (EU-accessing state) with particular reference to agricultural export from the former. The analysis implies that the <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> duly discourage trade flows of non-compliant agricultural and food sectors. The implications to relatively agriculture-dependent Bosnia are significant in terms of possible unemployment and social stability. But in the medium and longer term, the effort to comply with the standards can pay, like Croatia...|$|R
