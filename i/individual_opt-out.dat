2500|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution the labour movement has been concerned how economic globalisation would weaken the bargaining power of workers, as their employers could move to hire workers abroad without {{the protection of the}} labour standards at home. Following World War One, the Treaty of Versailles contained the first constitution of a new International Labour Organization founded on the principle that [...] "labour is not a commodity", and for the reason that [...] "peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice". The primary role of the ILO has been to coordinate principles of international labour law by issuing ILO Conventions, which codify labour laws on all matters. Members of the ILO can voluntarily adopt and ratify the conventions by enacting the rules in their domestic law. For instance, the first Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919 requires a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members states, although the Working Time Directive adopts its principles, subject to the <b>individual</b> <b>opt-out.</b> The present constitution of the ILO comes from the Declaration of Philadelphia 1944, and under the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 1998 classified eight conventions as core. Together these require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions Nos 87 and 98) abolition of forced labour (29 and 105) abolition labour by children before the end of compulsory school (138 and 182) and no discrimination at work (Nos 100 and 111). Compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory from the fact of membership, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, so that publicity will put public and international pressure to reform the laws. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or perhaps less frequent basis.|$|E

40|$|Default options can convey {{information}} {{relevant to}} making a default decision. This paper doc-uments a curious information asymmetry: Automatic enrollment defaults (where <b>individuals</b> <b>opt-out</b> of a program) are often thought to convey information about what policymakers think, whereas non-enrollment defaults (individuals opt into a program) are usually viewed as unin-formative. This information asymmetry arises because of {{a difference in the}} reasons imputed to policymakers when choosing automatic enrollment versus non-enrollment. Because people presume that inaction should be the default unless there is a good reason for doing otherwise, automatic enrollment defaults are more likely than non-enrollment defaults to communicate information about a policymaker’s reasons. Individuals assess what these reasons might be, and use these assessments to arrive at a default decision. Four experiments and one field study provide support for this framework...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{allocation}} rules on the stability of mass tort class actions. I analyze a two-stage model in which a defendant faces multiple plaintiffs with heterogeneous damage claims. In stage 1, the plaintiffs play a noncooperative coalition formation game. In stage 2, the class action and any <b>individual</b> actions by <b>opt-out</b> plaintiffs are litigated or settled. I examine how the method for allocating the class recovery interacts with other factors – {{the shape of the}} damage claim distribution, the scale benefits of the class action, and the plaintiffs’ probability of prevailing at trial and bargaining power in settlement negotiations – to determine the asymptotic stability of the global class. My results suggest criteria to attorney and courts for structuring and approving effi cient allocations plans in mass tort class actions and for evaluating the predominance and superiority requirements for class certification in mass tort cases...|$|R

40|$|The EU Working Time Directive {{has so far}} {{had little}} impact on an {{ingrained}} culture of long-hours working in the UK. Case {{studies suggest that the}} use of individual opt-outs from the 48 -hour limit on weekly working time is a principal reason for this. However, removal of the <b>individual</b> <b>opt-out</b> (currently under consideration at EU level) is unlikely to make much difference to UK practice {{in the absence of a}} wider review of working time policy. In particular, the UK’s individualised system of workplace bargaining is currently ill-placed to adapt to a continental European model of working time regulation. working time, labour standards, collective bargaining, European Union...|$|E
40|$|India is {{undertaking}} the world’s largest biometric ID card project – Aadhaar, also {{dubbed the}} "the world's biggest mass surveillance project". The government seems unaware, or unconcerned, {{that because of}} an inadequate legal framework for protecting citizens’ privacy this project will have catastrophic consequences. This overzealous project is obtaining demographic and biometric information and being forced upon Indian citizens, with no choice for an <b>individual</b> to <b>opt-out</b> of the system. The Indian government has claimed that setting up Aadhaar would establish a system of protection against wastage and corruption in the dispensation of social benefits. This draconian ID system is linking with every aspect of an individual’s life, from booking train tickets, registering marriages, or seeking scholarships, to mobile phone numbers, bank accounts, and schools and colleges. In many of these cases, it is mandatory. Thus, the government can exert absolute control by cross-referencing all transactions authenticated by or linked with Aadhaar. Indian society and politics {{has gone through a}} tectonic shift and is now in the grip of ‘absolutism’. Amid mounting governmental pressure, more than a billion Indians have signed up for Aadhaar. The aggregation of this data, along with various other data sets interlinked to Aadhaar, will enable the government to trace the movements, social relationships, and interactions of residents so that their private lives are laid bare. Seemingly innocuous, data when collated is capable of profiling residents’ lives. Once such data is in the government’s hands, wide latitude in access and use facilitates government abuse. Indeed, coercive application of Aadhaar creates a potential for mass surveillance, which in turn threatens the privacy of Indian citizens. We argue that this systemic mass invasion of privacy will diminish citizens’ autonomy of decision making: the choice of what to make public or keep private will no longer be theirs. In a high-octane, emotionally charged democracy like India, the fear of backlash will stop individuals from expressing disagreement with the government; they will increasingly self-censor their speech and interactions. Subjecting citizens to greater scrutiny and control will tilt the already imbalanced dynamics between the administration and the citizens, leading to erosion of democracy...|$|R
40|$|From breast {{implants}} to cigarettes, mass tort class actions are a prominent and controversial {{part of the}} contemporary litigation landscape. A critical component of these actions {{is the ability of}} class members to “opt out” and thereby exclude themselves from the effect of any class judgment. The tension between individual autonomy and the desire for global resolution of mass controversies has led to an intense debate concerning the circumstances under which opt-out rights should be constrained, if at all. This Article makes five distinct contributions to the class action literature. First, the Article applies the game theoretic concept of the “core” to class action litigation. Core theory describes the conditions under which coalitions tend to be stable and provides a ready analogue to class litigation. The Article next demonstrates that global class resolutions often require that litigants 2 ̆ 7 bargaining strategies, including opt-out rights, be constrained {{in order to create a}} core. Third, the Article demonstrates that opt-out rights often do not serve their intended purpose and can act primarily to frustrate the resolution of complex claims. Fourth, the Article proposes the conjecture that a core theoretic model while simplified and reductionist, is sufficiently robust to generate essentially all of the problems observed in class litigation. Agency and other problems that have been at the heart of much class action scholarship certainly exist, but may not be analytically essential to an explanation of observed settlement and litigation patterns. Finally, core theory highlights an inherent paradox in class actions. In cases where claims for individual autonomy are strongest, opt-out rights are powerful bargaining tools that can destroy class actions and dramatically shift power within classes. In classes with traditionally weaker claims for preserving <b>individual</b> autonomy, <b>opt-out</b> rights may be both unnecessary and unlikely to disrupt class-wide resolutions. The recognition of opt-out rights in cases where it is feasible for litigants to exercise them can thus destroy the effectiveness of the class mechanism that serves as the foundation for those rights in the first instance. Individual autonomy may thus be fundamentally incompatible with obtaining global resolution in mass tort and other kinds of class actions...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the {{challenges}} that European law poses for national legislation and practices regarding working time. The regulation of working time is situated {{at the crossroads of}} health and safety regulations and employment protection. The European Union has acknowledged the need to regulate and limit working time in the Working Time Directive (WTD); Directive 2003 / 88 /EC. This chapter examines the major topics of discussion concerning issues related to the implementation of the WTD in the Netherlands, notably annualised hours, flexible hours, the <b>individual</b> <b>opt-out,</b> on-call work and shift work. In the Netherlands trade unions consider that the Directive has been transposed into national law in a way which has reduced the level of protection previously available. However, our research has led {{to the conclusion that the}} implementation in the Netherlands is flexible because collective agreements are playing an important role in implementing the Working Time Directive in this country. Despite some problems, the implementation of the WTD in the Netherlands has not been controversial. However, some discrepancies between EU law and domestic definitions of the crucial concept of working time do persist which can lead to further litigation, especially in the case of on-call work. In general terms, the implementation of the WTD has left the main problem relating to working time in the Netherlands, its ‘successful’ part-time model, untouched...|$|E
