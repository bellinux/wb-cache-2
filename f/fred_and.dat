40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the gut protease activity of insecticide resistant gram caterpillar, Helicoverpa armigera. The leaf extracts of Peepal tree, Ficus religiosa (<b>FR)</b> <b>and</b> banyan tree, Ficus benghalensis (FB) mediated biogenic AgNPs were synthesized to modulate the function of gut protease activity in H. armigera (Ha). Bioassay with <b>FR</b> <b>and</b> FB AgNPs significantly reduced both larval weight and survival rate of H. armigera. The <b>FR</b> <b>and</b> FB AgNPs inhibited the Ha-Gut protease activity by 50 and 70 % at 100 μg concentration respectively. The <b>FR</b> <b>and</b> FB Silver nanoparticles were interacted and binds with high affinity with protease. The inhibition studies on Ha-gut protease activity may contribute towards developing new IRM (Insecticide Resistant Management) strategies against H. armigera to overcome insecticidal resistance issues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{networked}} video applications, {{the frame}} rate (<b>FR)</b> <b>and</b> quantization stepsize (QS) of a compressed video are often adapted {{in response to}} the changes of the available bandwidth. It is important to understand how do the variation of <b>FR</b> <b>and</b> QS and their variation pattern affect the video quality. In this paper, we investigate the impact of temporal variation of <b>FR</b> <b>and</b> QS on the perceptual video quality. Among all possible variation patterns, we focus on videos in which two FR’s (or QS’s) alternate over a fixed interval. We explore the human responses to such variation by conducting subjective evaluation of test videos with different variation magnitudes and frequencies. We further analyze statistical significance of the impact of variation magnitude, variation frequency, video content, and their interactions. By analyzing the subjective ratings, we propose two models for predicting the quality of video with alternating <b>FR</b> <b>and</b> QS, respectively, The proposed models have simple mathematical forms with a few content-dependent parameters. The models fit the measured data very well using parameters determined by least square fitting with the measured data. We further propose some guidelines for adaptation of <b>FR</b> <b>and</b> QS based on trends observed from subjective test results. Index Terms—perceptual video quality, frame rate, QS, tem-poral variation, quality metrics. I...|$|R
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Llandudno to <b>Fred</b> <b>and</b> Rose Southall, he was the middle child of three boys. Southall played youth {{football}} for his school team and the Llandudno Swifts, where he played alongside Joey Jones. He was educated at Ysgol John Bright, though left without any qualifications at age 16. At age 14 he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered {{a chance to play}} for the youth team of Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Düsseldorf, but decided against the move to Germany. The Swifts were a poor side that were regularly beaten heavily, though the near constant barrage of shots he faced enabled Southall to improve on his shot-stopping skills.|$|E

Harry is shocked to witness his father, James Potter, and Sirius {{bullying}} and humiliating Snape. Snape catches Harry and, enraged, refuses to continue the lessons. Distraught at this revelation of his father's character, Harry talks to Sirius and Lupin by using Floo powder through the fireplace in Umbridge's own office and learns more about his parents and their background. After helping Harry break into Umbridge's office, <b>Fred</b> <b>and</b> George then leave Hogwarts to start a joke-shop in Diagon Alley.|$|E

5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} <b>Fred,</b> <b>and</b> regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility. Two days later, the NHC noted that environmental conditions could become marginally favorable for redevelopment of the system. On September16, the circulation of Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
