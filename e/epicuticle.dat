5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new <b>epicuticle</b> inside the old one. After this new <b>epicuticle</b> is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
5|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers: the <b>epicuticle,</b> {{which is}} a thin and waxy water {{resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the procuticle. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the <b>epicuticle</b> and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.|$|E
25|$|After apolysis {{the insect}} {{is known as}} a pharate. Moulting fluid is then {{secreted}} into the exuvial space between the old cuticle and the epidermis, this contains inactive enzymes which are activated only after the new <b>epicuticle</b> is secreted. This prevents the new procuticle from getting digested as it is laid down. The lower regions of the old cuticle, the endocuticle and mesocuticle, are then digested by the enzymes and subsequently absorbed. The exocuticle and <b>epicuticle</b> resist digestion and are hence shed at ecdysis.|$|E
50|$|Kin {{can also}} be {{recognized}} a genetically determined odor, as studied in the primitively social sweat bee, Lasioglossum zephyrum. These bees can even recognize relatives they have never met and roughly determine relatedness. The Brazilian stingless bee Schwarziana quadripunctata uses a distinct combination of chemical hydrocarbons to recognize and locate kin. Each chemical odor, emitted from the organism's <b>epicuticles,</b> is unique and varies according to age, sex, location, and hierarchical position. Similarly, individuals of the stingless bee species Trigona fulviventris can distinguish kin from non-kin through recognition {{of a number of}} compounds, including hydrocarbons and fatty acids that are present in their wax and floral oils from plants used to construct their nests. In the species, Osmia rufa, kin selection has also been associated with mating selection. Females, specifically, will select males for mating with whom they are genetically more related to.|$|R
50|$|Kin {{recognition}} {{often goes}} hand in hand with communication. For instance, researchers compared the relative amounts of various hydrocarbon compounds present in the <b>epicuticles,</b> serving as a chemical odor to other individuals, of S. quadripunctata. The study showed that a diverse array of these chemicals were present in each member. They then charted these hydrocarbon differences and found a distinct separation according to colony location, age, sex, and hierarchal position. In particular, older workers, which are in charge of colony protection, had higher concentrations of the alkenes heptacosene and hentriacontene. It was thus deduced that these alkenes were vital parts of kin recognition. Some of these essential hydrocarbons were also found to be lacking in younger individuals, alluding to the idea that the chemicals are acquired as the exposure to the waxy comb, specific to each colony, increases.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Biosynthesized {{from very}} {{long-chain}} fatty acid wax precursors, n-alkanes make a valuable {{contribution to the}} taxonomy of plants. The alkane components of foliar <b>epicuticles</b> of seven Neotropical species of Lecythidaceae were investigated: Bertholletia excelsa, Cariniana legalis, Couroupita guianensis, Eschweilera alvimii, Eschweilera ovata, Gustavia augusta and Lecythis pisonis. Specimens were collected {{in the metropolitan area}} of Recife, Pernambuco, and their n-alkane fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography. The chemical relationships among the species were then evaluated using cophenetic correlation and UPGMA. Among the seven species, a total of 15 n-alkanes, with 21 - 35 carbon atoms, were identified and formed a consistent group of B. excelsa, C. guianensis, E. ovata, G. augusta, and L. pisonis with n-C 31. The greatest similarities were found between B. excelsa and L. pisonis, and between C. guianensis and G. augusta. Nevertheless, a phenetic analysis based on a larger number of species is needed to better understand the chemotaxonomic value of epicuticular n-alkanes within the Lecythidaceae...|$|R

25|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers; the <b>epicuticle,</b> {{which is}} a thin, waxy, {{water-resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and the layer under it called the procuticle. This is chitinous and much thicker than the <b>epicuticle</b> and has two layers, the outer is the exocuticle while the inner is the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and sclerotized. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects, especially the larval stages (e.g., caterpillars). Chemically, chitin is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose. In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient and quite tough. In arthropods, however, it is often modified, becoming embedded in a hardened proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton. In its pure form, it is leathery, but when encrusted in calcium carbonate, it becomes much harder. The difference between the unmodified and modified forms can be seen by comparing the body wall of a caterpillar (unmodified) to a beetle (modified).|$|E
40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) produced by plants have {{a major role in}} atmospheric chemistry. The different physicochemical properties of BVOCs affect their transport within and out of the plant as well as their reactions along the way. Some of these compounds may accumulate in or on the waxy surface layer of conifer needles and participate in chemical reactions on or near the foliage surface. The aim of this work was to determine whether terpenes, a key category of BVOCs produced by trees, {{can be found on the}} <b>epicuticles</b> of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and, if so, how they compare with the terpenes found in shoot emissions of the same tree. We measured shoot-level emissions of pine seedlings at a remote outdoor location in central Finland and subsequently analysed the needle surface waxes for the same compounds. Both emissions and wax extracts were clearly dominated by monoterpenes, but the proportion of sesquiterpenes was higher in the wax extracts. There were also differences in the terpene spectra of the emissions and the wax extracts. The results, therefore, support the existence of BVOC associated to the epicuticular waxes. We briefly discuss the different pathways for terpenes to reach the needle surfaces and the implications for air chemistry...|$|R
25|$|The {{muscular system}} of insects ranges {{from a few}} hundred muscles to a few thousand. Unlike {{vertebrates}} that have both smooth and striated muscles, insects have only striated muscles. Muscle cells are amassed into muscle fibers {{and then into the}} functional unit, the muscle. Muscles are attached to the body wall, with attachment fibers running through the cuticle and to the <b>epicuticle,</b> where they can move different parts of the body including appendages such as wings.|$|E

50|$|Several {{morphological}} adaptations allow Pimelia {{to survive}} in the desert, including the lipid layers of the <b>epicuticle,</b> fused sclerites, the subelytral cavity, and the texture of the body surface. Much of the success of tenebrionid beetles in desert habitats is due to the development of impermeable cuticles. The fused sclerites of desert tenebrionids minimize water loss, but they result in flightlessness. The main barrier to the outward flow of water through insect integument is the lipid layer of the <b>epicuticle.</b> In many terrestrial arthropods, the temperature affects the permeability of the cuticle. There is a sudden increase in the rate of transpiration at {{what is known as the}} transition temperature. This may coincide with a physical change, perhaps the disorientation of the lipid molecules in the <b>epicuticle.</b> In tenebrionid beetles, the spiracles open into a humid subelytral cavity rather than directly to the atmosphere, thus reducing water loss. Water retention by intact elytral covers is greater at 0% relative humidity than at 97%. The size of the cavity is not important. Transpiration increases if the elytra are removed, emphasizing the importance of the <b>epicuticle</b> and subelytral cavity. Pimelia have tubercles on the surface of their elytra which scatter and reflect incident energy.|$|E
