Here the exposition is based only on Walker’s definition of <b>instants</b> without using Russell’s definition of <b>instants.</b> The used here system of axioms is simpler than those preceding it in the literature and it treats only events. The attemp of mathematical contructions of the <b>instants</b> of Time by events follow Russell and Whitehead [1, 2]. Such constructions of Time are elaborated also by Robbs [3], N.

Here significant excitation refers primarily to the <b>instants</b> of glottal closure in voiced speech. The method computes the average slope of the unwrapped phase spectrum {{as a function of}} time. The <b>instants</b> where the phase slope function makes a positive zero-crossing correspond to the major excitations in the signal. For an analysis window size in the range of one to two pitch periods, these <b>instants</b> coincide with the <b>instants</b> of glottal closure in each pitch period.

40|$|Abstract—This letter {{proposes a}} time-effective method for {{determining}} the <b>instants</b> of significant excitation in speech signals. The <b>instants</b> of significant excitation correspond to the <b>instants</b> of glottal closure (epochs) {{in the case of}} voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. The proposed method consists of two phases: the first phase determines the approximate epoch locations using the Hilbert envelope of the linear prediction residual of the speech signal. The second phase determines the accurate locations of the <b>instants</b> of significant excitation by computing the group delay around the approximate epoch locations derived from the first phase. The accuracy in determining the <b>instants</b> of significant excitation and the time complexity of the proposed method is compared with the group delay based approach.

60|$|The {{theory of}} continuity, {{with which we}} shall be {{occupied}} in the present lecture, is, in most of its refinements and developments, a purely mathematical subject--very beautiful, very important, and very delightful, but not, strictly speaking, a part of philosophy. The logical basis of the theory alone belongs to philosophy, and alone will occupy us to-night. The way the problem of continuity enters into philosophy is, broadly speaking, the following: Space and time are treated by mathematicians as consisting of points and <b>instants,</b> {{but they also have}} a property, easier to feel than to define, which is called continuity, and is thought by many philosophers to be destroyed when they are resolved into points and <b>instants.</b> Zeno, as we shall see, proved that analysis into points and <b>instants</b> was impossible if we adhered to the view that the number of points or <b>instants</b> in a finite space or time must be finite. Later philosophers, believing infinite number to be self-contradictory, have found here an antinomy: Spaces and times could not consist of a finite number of points and <b>instants,</b> for such reasons as Zeno's; they could not consist of an infinite number of points and <b>instants,</b> because infinite numbers were supposed to be self-contradictory. Therefore spaces and times, if real at all, must not be regarded as composed of points and <b>instants.</b>|$|R
