The phosphate capacity has {{a close relationship with}} the phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index,</b> whereas the logarithm of phosphate capacity is 12. 724 greater than that of phosphate <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> at 1873 K (1600 degrees C).

30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In Section 2, the system model that is used throughout our analysis is described, {{and the problem of}} the uplink scheduling in CDMA systems is rigorously formulated as a multiconstraint optimization problem. It is demonstrated that this problem can be expressed as a weighted throughput maximization problem, under certain power and QoS constraints, where the weights are the control parameters that reflect fairness constraints. Based on the concept of power <b>index</b> <b>capacity,</b> this optimization problem is converted into a simpler linear knapsack problem in Section 3.1, where all the corresponding constraints are replaced by the users power index capacities at some certain system power index. The optimal solution of the latter problem is identified in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, while in Section 3.4, a stochastic approximation method is presented in order to effectively identify the required control parameters. Section 4 contains the performance evaluation of the proposed method, along with some numerical results and discussion, and finally Section 5 concludes the paper.|$|E
30|$|We {{study the}} {{fundamental}} problem of optimal transmission scheduling in a code-division multiple-access wireless system {{in order to maximize}} the uplink system throughput, while satisfying the users quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and maintaining fairness among them. The corresponding problem is expressed as a weighted throughput maximization problem, under certain power and QoS constraints, where the weights are the control parameters reflecting the fairness constraints. With the introduction of the power <b>index</b> <b>capacity,</b> it is shown that this optimization problem can be converted into a binary knapsack problem, where all the corresponding constraints are replaced by the power index capacities at some certain system power index. A two-step approach is followed to obtain the optimal solution. First, a simple method is proposed to find the optimal set of users to receive service for a given fixed target system load, and then the optimal solution is obtained as a global search within a certain range. Furthermore, a stochastic approximation method is presented to effectively identify the required control parameters. The performance evaluation reveals the advantages of our proposed policy over other existing ones and confirms that it achieves very high throughput while maintains fairness among the users, under different channel conditions and requirements.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} paper, the spatial heterogeneity of mechanical impedance {{of a typical}} chernozem was investigated. The distance between experimental points in the mechanical impedance space was explained by means of multidimensional scaling. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between dissimilarity indices and gradient separation with different data transformation methods revealed {{that the use of}} log-transformed data and Horn-Morisita distance was the most appropriate approach to reflect the relationship between the mechanical impedance of soil and ecological factors. A three dimensional variant of multidimensional scaling procedure was selected as the most appropriate decision. Environmental factors were estimated with the use of phytoindicator scales. Broad, medium and fine-scale components of spatial variation of mechanical impedance of soil were extracted using the principal coordinates of neighbour matrices method (PCNM). In the extracted dimensions, statistically significant phytoindicator scales were found to describe variability from 8 to 33 %. Dimension 1 correlated with a thermal climate indicator value, a hygromorphs index, an abundance of steppe species and meadow species. Dimension 2 correlated with a continental climate indicator value, carbonate content in the soil and the soil trophicity <b>index</b> (<b>capacity</b> of the soil for plant nutrition). Dimension 3 correlated with acidity, humidity and cryoclimate indicator values. Variation partitioning results revealed that environmental factors and spatial variables explained 47. 8 % of the total variation of the dimensions. Purely environmental component explained 18. 2 % of total variation. The spatial component and spatially structured environmental fractions explained 43. 6 %. The broad-scale spatial component explained 26. 4 % of dimensional variation, medium-scale – 6. 7 % and fine-scale – 5. 7 %. As a result of regression analysis, the broad-scale spatially structured environmental fractions were found to be connected with variability of moisture and thermal climate indicator values. The medium-scale component was revealed to be connected with variability of moisture, thermal climate, total salt regime and aeration of soil indicator value. The fine-scale component was connected with carbonate content in the soil, acidity and humidity indicator values...|$|E
