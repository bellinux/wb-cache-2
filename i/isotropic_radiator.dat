So the gain of any antenna is proportional to its aperture:So antennas with large effective apertures are high gain antennas, which have small angular beam widths. Most of their power is radiated in a narrow beam in one direction, and little in other directions. As receiving antennas, they are most sensitive to radio waves coming from one direction, and are much less sensitive to waves coming from other directions. Although these terms {{can be used as}} a function of direction, when no direction is specified, the gain and aperture are understood to refer to the antenna's axis of maximum gain, or boresight.|$|R

5000|$|In telecommunication, free-space {{path loss}} (FSPL) {{is the loss}} in signal {{strength}} of an electromagnetic wave that would result from a line-of-sight path through free space (usually air), with no obstacles nearby to cause reflection or diffraction.

40|$|Today, most {{satellite}} systems employ reflector antennas to generate narrow beams covering a certain area of Earth’s surface from orbit. However, the performance specification of modern communication systems require an increasing demand on the multi-beam, multi-channel, dual-polarization and beam shaping capabilities, which renders {{the design of}} such complex systems to a major challenge. A worldwide view is that Direct Radiating Arrays (DRAs) {{will be part of}} the future {{satellite systems}}. DRAs can handle these complexities, but the design solutions, based on conventional regular arrays are expensive due to a large number of required array elements (100 - 1000 in dense array for geosynchronous orbit) and active components, such as low noise and power amplifiers. For this reason, aperiodic or sparse arrays, where the array layout is optimized, constitute a very attractive solution for minimizing the number of elements and thus the cost. To design aperiodic arrays, Array Signal Processing (ASP) based methods are commonly used, which are advantageous when optimizing for complex antenna beam specifications [1 - 2], but often assume idealized antenna elements (e. g. <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiators</b> or uniform field apertures) while ignoring antenna mutual coupling and edge truncation effects. Electro-Magnetic Simulations (EMS) overcome these drawbacks [3], but their use is limited to simplistic ASP schemes. Due to extreme computational demands, such methods are primarily used to evaluate beam performance degradation effects, but do not incorporate sparse array ASP design procedures, and hence, these approaches result in suboptimal solutions. Our aim is to enhance the current methodology by accounting for realistic elements and critical array effects in a rigorous numerical manner, while adapting advanced ASP algorithms for fulfilling the required specification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an adaptive technique {{to extract the}} signal of interest (SOI) arriving from a known direction {{in the presence of}} strong interferers using a single snapshot of data. The antenna elements in this method can be nonuniformly spaced and there can be mutual coupling between them. In addition, near-field scatterers can also be present. First, the voltages induced in the antenna elements of the array due to interferers, mutual coupling between the elements, and near-field scatterers is preprocessed by applying a transformation matrix to these voltages through a rigorous electromagnetic analysis tool. This electromagnetic preprocessing technique transforms the voltages that are induced in a nonuniformly spaced array containing real antenna elements to a set of voltages that will be produced in a uniform linear virtual array (ULVA) containing omnidirectional <b>isotropic</b> point <b>radiators.</b> In the transformation matrix we would like to include various electromagnetic effects like mutual coupling between the antenna elements, presence of near-field scatterers and the platform effects on which the antenna array is mounted. This transformation matrix when applied to the actual measured voltages yields an equivalent set of voltages that will be induced in the ULVA. A direct data domain least squares adaptive algorithm is then applied to the processed voltages to extract the SOI in the presence of interferers. Limited numerical examples are presented to illustrate the novelty of the proposed method. Index Terms—Adaptive signal processing, antenna array mutual coupling, nonuniformly spaced arrays. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand on}} very high data rates for future {{wireless}} communication systems, which until today {{are limited to}} several tenths of Mbit/s (e. g. Wireless Local Area Network for IEEE 802. 11 a with 54 MBit/s) is growing. In order to overcome this problem, new multiple antenna systems (MIMO: Multiple Output Multiple I nput) are investigated and probably will replace the conventional single antenna systems, which use only one antenna element at the transmit and receive side, respectively. Deploying more antennas at {{both sides of a}} radio channel yields in a linear increase of the channels capacity to the number of the antenna elements used. Thus an optimized trade-off between spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing can be achieved. As a result of the higher diversity order, the signal quality is getting better even in cases of very large distances between transmit and receive antennas. Additionally, because of the spatial multiplexing, the required higher data rates can be also achieved. In both cases, independent of the enlargement of the data rates, the transmit power as well as the signal bandwidth could be held constant. MIMO-systems need both at the base and the mobile station a certain number of antenna elements. Therefore the goal of this work is the investigation and the realization of such antennas. It is known, that spatial multiplexing can be achieved, if identical (same polarization), spatial separated antennas are used. An alternative solution can be found on systems, which utilize the different polarization characteristics of the antennas. The great advantage of these antennas is their compact form, which is essential especially in the mobile terminals, and the independence of the antenna orientation, which is important for handheld devices. Therefore the deployment of antennas with orthogonal radiation patterns, evaluated by the radiation pattern correlation factor, is an elegant method to overcome the problems mentioned above. The first investigations have been made using simple dual-polarized antenna configurations and some advantages could be found. This fact has led to the extensive investigation of multiport antennas with more than two ports located as near as possible (ideally in the same place). The idea to investigate first a three-port and later on a four-port antenna has occured. The realized antennas, fulfil the following specifications which makes them a potential candidate for future MIMO Systems:• all ports are matched• low coupling between the Antenna ports• low radiation pattern correlation factor• satisfactory relative bandwidth of the return loss bettet than 10 dBFurthermore, more than one antenna structure has been investigated, to make the manufacturing easier and to cover as many as possible realisation possibilities. The question, why are these antennas a potential candidate for MIMO-systems, will be answered. The realized antennas will be investigated in different simulation scenarios and the yielded channel capacity of such MIMO-systems will be evaluated. This channel capacity will be compared with the channel capacity of identically polarized, spatially separated antennas such as half-wavelength Dipole or <b>isotropic</b> <b>radiators</b> of a certain polarization. In the conclusion, these results will be discussed. It is proven that the deployment of such multiport antennas yield in similar channel capacity values as the identically polarized antenna elements. Additionally, it is shown that the radio channels capacity depends strongly on properties of the examined indoor scenario, on the receiver position in the scenario {{as well as on the}} orientation of the antennas...|$|R
