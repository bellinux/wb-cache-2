50|$|During the 1950s, a {{large number}} of major {{automotive}} spare parts dealers in Germany came together to publish a <b>joint</b> <b>catalog</b> of automotive spare parts. From the mid-1960s on, the first gas stations began selling automotive accessories: This created competition for wholesalers that had been generating high revenues through sales of accessories. For that reason, several dealers decided to combine their purchase operations. For this to occur, a joint legal form had to be created. This is how ATR GmbH came about in 1967. ATR founding members included wholesalers Auto Merkur, Auto Staiger, Matthies, Stahlgruber und Wessels. ATR is the eldest trading cooperation for automotive spare parts in Germany. Founding members Johannes J. Matthies GmbH & Co KG in Hamburg and Stahlgruber GmbH in Poing, Bavaria have remained company partners until today.|$|E

5000|$|A Federal Stock Number (FSN) was an 11-digit numeric code. It {{was first}} used by the Defense Munitions Board's Cataloging Agency in 1949 to {{identify}} items in the <b>Joint</b> Army-Navy <b>Catalog</b> System. On July 7, 1952 Public Law 82-436 (Defense Cataloging and Standardization Act) {{was passed by the}} second session of the 82nd Congress. It authorized the FSN to replace the Ammunition Identification Code (AIC) and Ordnance Stock Number (OSN). The Federal Stock Number was used officially from 1953 to 1974, when it was replaced by the National Stock Number. The conversion from FSN to NSN was typically done by adding [...] "00" [...] between the first set of numbers (the Federal Supply Class, or FSC) and the second set of numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first attempt}} at an inter-service system was the Army-Navy Munitions Board, which would procure common items for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Items {{received}} the prefix [...] "AN/" [...] (for Army & Navy) to indicate their common use (and procured items like radios and some hand-grenades still do to this day). This existed from 1940 to 1942 before falling into a deep bureaucratic hibernation until 1945. In 1946, it was renamed the Defense Munitions Board. In 1947 they created the Cataloging Agency, a subordinate entity in charge of managing the <b>Joint</b> Army-Navy <b>Catalog</b> System. The Cataloging Agency began using the Federal Stock Number system {{for the first time}} in 1949 (though not referred to as such), but the other systems were still in use.|$|R
40|$|The need to {{accurately}} track breakups and satellite clusters, {{as well as}} to resolve uncorrelated tracks (UCTs), especially uncorrelated optical observations (UCOs), requires new, robust, and autonomous methods for space surveillance to enable the development and maintenance of the space catalog and to support the over-all SSA mission. This paper presents results on the performance of a newly-developed, statistically-robust, system-level, multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) capability for <b>joint</b> <b>catalog</b> maintenance, UCT/UCO res-olution, and initial orbit determination, in multiple regimes of space. A recent companion paper described some of the unique components contained within the authors ’ implementation of MHT, including the multi-frame data association problem and the statistical framework used for scoring the likelihood that a sequence of measurements, UCTs/UCOs, and other reports emanate from a common object (either newly-discovered or already catalogued). As demonstrated by the results in this paper, the MHT system provides superior tracking performance (compared to existing methods for data association) in realistic multi-sensor multi-object tracking scenarios over multiple regimes of space. Specifically, we demonstrate that the prototype MHT system can accurately and efficiently process tens of thousands of UCTs/UCOs emanating from thou-sands of space objects in realtime on a single processor. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{publisher}} Yakov Orenstein, who was founder and owner of ?Halyts?ka nakladnya? in Kolomyya and ?Ukrayins?ka nakladnya? in Berlin in the early 20 th century. The Orenshtayn?s publishing policy was analyzed. The first book of ?Halyts?ka nakladnya? was ?Nacherky istoriyi ukrayins?koyi literatury? by Bohdan Lepkyy. Works of the Ukrainian and world classical literature, atlases and musical notes, children books were published. The publisher lent books to those who could not buy them. During thirteen years, the publishing house ?Halyts?ka nakladnya? published more than 150 issues of the series ?Zahal?na biblioteka?. Besides Orenstein?s book production, we analyzed postcards with the Ukrainian motives. We investigated that during World War I Yakov Orenstein had to close his publishing house and got involved in social and political work. In 1919 he moved to Berlin, established the printing house ?Ukrayins?ka nakladnya?, and published the Ukrainian classics and modern writers`s books, illustrated children and youth publications, school textbooks, etc. Orenstein continued the book series of ?Zahal?na biblioteka?. Also, he published the <b>joint</b> <b>catalog</b> of ?Halyts?ka? and ?Ukrayins?ka nakladnya? 1903 ? 1919, which listed more than 350 publications. Since the early 30 ?s, Yakov Orenstein was persecuted because of his Jewish origins, so he curtailed his publishing activity in Berlin and moved to Warsaw. As a result, the great number of artistic, scientific, historical, educational, children, music books were published. Yakov Orenstein via his work put his efforts to get illiterate farmers and intelligentsia closer to the world and Ukrainian culture. He was a great promoter of the Ukrainian books...|$|E
40|$|The {{photographic}} collections, increasingly {{present in}} libraries, require numerous specifics, {{due to the}} fragility of the support and representation of the content. The objective of this research is to understand the processes that involve the processing of photographic collections in libraries, by comparing the methodologies developed and adopted. For methodological course of work, we opted for the qualitative and quantitative approach, which allowed to raise a questioning of the problems raised. For the survey was sent an online form with closed questions for 30 pre-selected libraries by having collections of photography, with return of 33 %. The study indicated that libraries adopt methodologies tailored to their needs and, in general, have no goals set exclusively for photographic collections. The formation of the collection is often done through accumulation, pointing to negative throughout the treatment process impacts, since the institution probably {{will not be able to}} handle a collection unplanned. From these libraries, 70 % had other types of documents in the collection (books, maps, etc [...] ) And 30 % reported having only photographs. As for the packaging, 70 % of institutions hold the photos in separate location and 30 %, along with other documents. It was observed that 60 % of institutions do not inventory and 40 %; considered large percentage, considering the importance of this documentation. Most institutions do not do preventive maintenance (80 %), which indicates that interventions are made only when they prove necessary. It was noticed that great attention is given to developing the cataloging record, suggesting that the more traditional processes of librarianship, as the technical processing, are being better addressed: data description for document identification and production, as authorship and statement of responsibility were cited by 90 % of libraries; the description of technical data relating to the support is taken by 30 %; data on the production and dissemination of knowledge are described by 30 %; and only 10 % of libraries describe the administrative data relating to patrimoniação. In the notes area, the information most commonly described in the cataloging record are related to: physical (70 %); data donor sources and previous owners (50 %); conservation status of the document (40 %); abstract (40 %); sustained interventions (30 %); recommendations (30 %) and movement history of photography (30 %); data on other forms of the same picture (20 %); and data relating to the original document (20 %). The registration permits <b>joint</b> <b>cataloging</b> the photograph to other documents described in 70 % of institutions, allowing the user to retrieve other documents. As for automation, 80 % of institutions have automated catalog, while 10 % use the MARC format. Most institutions (60 %) do not consider the technique to make the thematic representation, and 40 % said they consider it, which indicates that the thematic representation of photographic documents generally revolves around the simple identification of elements present in the image. To date, it is understood that research is an initial contribution to the study of methodologies for the treatment of photographic collections in libraries, having raised early questions and data that can support future research in the area...|$|R

The final mosaic reaches a median rms of 2. 3 μJy beam- 1 {{over the two}} square degrees at an angular resolution of 0. 75 ″. To fully account for the spectral shape and resolution variations across the broad (2 GHz) band, we image all data with a multiscale, multifrequency synthesis algorithm. We present a catalog of 10 830 radio sources down to 5 σ, out of which 67 are combined from multiple components. Comparing the positions of our 3 GHz sources with those from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) -COSMOS survey, we estimate that the astrometry is accurate to 0. 01 ″ at the bright end (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N 3 GHz > 20). Survival analysis on our data combined with the VLA-COSMOS 1. 4 GHz <b>Joint</b> Project <b>catalog</b> yields an expected median radio spectral index of α = - 0. 7. We compute completeness corrections via Monte Carlo simulations to derive the corrected 3 GHz source counts. Our counts are in agreement with previously derived 3 GHz counts based on single-pointing (0. 087 square degrees) VLA data. In summary, the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project simultaneously provides the largest and deepest radio continuum survey at high (0. 75 ″) angular resolution to date, bridging the gap between last-generation and next- generation surveys...|$|R

The survey {{is intended to be}} a multi-purpose survey used for a variety of science goals, including surveys of very high redshift galaxies and weak lensing studies. Four high galactic latitude fields, each 2 x 2 deg^ 2, have been selected along the celestial equator: 0226 - 04, 1003 + 01, 1400 + 05, and 2217 + 00. The 16 deg^ 2 of the "wide" survey are covered with exposure times of 2 h, 1. 5 h, 1 h, 1 h, while the 1. 3 x 1 deg^ 2 area of the "deep" survey {{at the center of the}} 0226 - 04 field is covered with exposure times of 7 h, 4. 5 h, 3 h, 3 h, in B,V,R and I respectively. The data is pipeline processed at the Terapix facility at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris to produce large mosaic images. The catalogs produced contain the positions, shape, total and aperture magnitudes for the 2. 175 million objects. The depth measured (3 sigma in a 3 arc-second aperture) is I_AB= 24. 8 in the "Wide" areas, and I_AB= 25. 3 in the deep area. Careful quality control has been applied on the data as described in <b>joint</b> papers. These <b>catalogs</b> are used to select targets for the VIRMOS-VLT Deep Survey, a large spectroscopic survey of the distant universe (Le Fèvre et al., 2003).
