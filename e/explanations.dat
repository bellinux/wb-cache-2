40|$|<b>Explanation</b> of {{observed}} phenomena {{is a major}} {{objective of}} both those who conduct and those who apply research in Information Systems (IS).

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce an expanded concept of <b>explanation</b> into the realm of IS research. We present a framework based on the four principle <b>explanation</b> types defined in modern philosophy: covering-law <b>explanation,</b> statistical-relevance <b>explanation,</b> contrast-class <b>explanation,</b> and functional <b>explanation.</b> A well-established research stream, media richness, is used to illustrate how the different <b>explanation</b> types complement each other in increasing comprehension of the phenomenon.

40|$|The overall issue {{addressed}} in {{this paper is to}} improve semantic interoperability among and across agent systems. We propose to use <b>explanation</b> as a way to approach that aim. The <b>explanation</b> process is expressed in terms of an <b>explanation</b> ontology shared by the agents who participate to the <b>explanation</b> session. The <b>explanation</b> ontology is defined in a way general enough to support a variety of <b>explanation</b> mechanisms. The paper describes the <b>explanation</b> ontology and provides a working through example illustrating how the proposed generic ontology can be used to develop specific <b>explanation</b> mechanism. Finally, the ontology is being integrated into a running agent platform – Agora to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|Teleological <b>explanation</b> has a {{structure}} {{in terms of}} means and end, as conceived by the agent. Any other notion of means and end which does not allow the description of means and end to be essentially the agent's, does not generate teleological <b>explanation.</b> Thus, {{the origin of the}} means and end structure of a teleological <b>explanation</b> {{is to be found in}} the agent's reason for acting. Teleological <b>explanation</b> is a distinct kind of <b>explanation</b> not to be assimilated to non-teleological kinds. When actions are explained teleologically, it is not open to us to eliminate the means and end structure, unless we want to eliminate the agent's point of view. The need for intentionality in the <b>explanation</b> of action works against the elimination of teleological <b>explanation</b> as a distinct kind of <b>explanation.</b> Teleological <b>explanation</b> for individual actions is causal. Individual occurrences, typically mental events, are implied in a teleological <b>explanation</b> and these can be construed as causes. Objections may be made to teleological <b>explanation</b> as it has been described. They are based on, either, the intentional features, or, the causal features of teleological <b>explanation.</b> It would seem that adequate answers can be found to these objections.

We propose ways that {{the goals of the}} user and system designer should be taken into account when deciding what is a good <b>explanation</b> for a given CBR system. Some general types of goals relevant to many CBR systems are identified, and used to survey existing methods of <b>explanation</b> in CBR. Finally, we identify some future challenges...|$|R

One important kind of explanatory concern involves asking {{a certain kind of}} “why” question. Answering such questions provides a personal <b>explanation,</b> namely, renders intelligible the beliefs and actions of other persons. I use contrasting theories of delusional misidentification to highlight how different facts about the phenomenon that is being explained impose constraints on the availability of personal <b>explanation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Because case-based {{reasoning}} (CBR) is an interpretable process, it is a reasoning mechanism that supports <b>explanation.</b> This {{can be done}} explicitly by the system designers incorporating <b>explanation</b> patterns in cases. This can be termed knowledge-intensive <b>explanation</b> in CBR. In this paper {{the focus is on}} case-based <b>explanation</b> that works by allowing users to consider the relation between different cases. The recommendation of a decision support system can be explained by presenting similar cases that motivate the recommendation. Users can derive insight from similar cases that have different outcomes. The differences in outcome are due to the differences in the un-matching features (provided the effect is not due to noisy data). This is a more knowledge-light approach to case-based <b>explanation.</b> This is appropriate for weak-theory domains where the details of the causal interactions in the domain are not well understood; experts would however be able to express the direction of causal interactions. In this paper we examine two such a knowledge-light frameworks for case-based <b>explanation.</b> We look at <b>explanation</b> oriented retrieval (EOR) a strategy which explicitly models <b>explanation</b> utility and also at the knowledge-light <b>explanation</b> framework (KLEF) that uses local logistic regression to support case-based <b>explanation.</b> ...|$|R
