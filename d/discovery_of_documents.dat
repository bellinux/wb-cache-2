25|$|After {{a series}} of {{interlocutory}} hearings over the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> that took more than seven months, the matter finally came before Justice Harun Hashim in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 4 February 1988. The judge ruled that under the existing law he had {{no option but to}} find the party, UMNO, to be an unlawful society due to the existence of several unregistered branches—an illegal act under the Societies Act of 1966. The question of the Assembly itself being illegal therefore became academic.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> {{written in}} the Elamite {{language}} and Babylonian language, {{it was thought that}} Chedorlaomer is a transliteration of the Elamite compound Kudur-Lagamar, meaning servant of Lagamaru - a reference to Lagamaru, an Elamite deity whose existence was mentioned by Ashurbanipal. However, no mention of an individual named Kudur Lagamar has yet been found; inscriptions that were thought to contain this name are now known to have different names (the confusion arose due to similar lettering). David Rohl identifies Chedorlaomer with an Elamite king named Kutir-Lagamar.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{approaches for}} automatic <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> classification knowledge from text databases.

We have also explored some variants of our IBRI approach. We have implemented our approach and extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale, real-world text database, namely the Reuters- 21578 collection. The results show that our new approach outperforms the RIPPER and instance-based approaches. 1 1 Introduction The volume of full-text data stored in text databases is increasing rapidly.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} new {{approaches}} for visualising and browsing document collections have been developed. These approaches try to address the problems associated with the growing amounts of content available and the changing patterns in the way people interact with information. Users now demand better support for exploring document collections to discover connections, compare and contrast information. Although visual search interfaces have the potential to improve the user experience in exploring document collections compared to textual search interfaces, they have not yet become as popular among users. The reasons for this range from the design of such visual interfaces to the way these interfaces are implemented and used. In this paper we study these reasons and determine the factors that contribute to an improved visual browsing experience. Consequently, by taking these factors into account, we propose a novel visual search interface that improves exploratory search and the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> relations. We explain our universal approach, and how it could be applied to any document collection, such as news articles, cultural heritage artifacts or research papers...|$|R
