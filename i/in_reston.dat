Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School <b>in</b> <b>Reston,</b> Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times {{over the next few weeks}} on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall.|$|E

25|$|Oliphant posits the NIH, CDC, {{or other}} federally funded bodies, may be involved, {{and they are}} {{supported}} by the US military.
