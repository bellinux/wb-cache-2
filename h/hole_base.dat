50|$|The castle has all {{the basic}} {{features}} of a tower house of this period such as machicolation, murder <b>hole,</b> <b>base</b> batter, mural passages, spiral staircase, gun-loops, garderobe and bawn. The first floor had collapsed but has been replaced in recent restoration works by the owners. The castle also boasts a barrel-vaulted ceiling making up the second floor which has been restored. The Tower House is three storeys high with an entrance in the west wall with a machicolation above it. There is a fire-proof vault over the ground floor in the interior and a spiral stair leads to the upper floors. There are round-headed, ogee-headed and flat headed windows. The bawn wall with its two square corner towers and entrance, which had a coat of arms, was reconstructed {{in the nineteenth century}} and gives a good impression of how an original Tower House might have looked, with a set of perimeter and internal defences. The inner bawn building in front of the west entrance appears to be a nineteenth-century construction.|$|E

40|$|Creep {{degradation}} of steam carrying {{vessels in the}} power generation industry is a concern {{that needs to be}} constantly monitored. The Weldcore® process has been earmarked as a potential method of creep sampling which will allow for thick-walled sections to be analysed. A component of the process involves plugging the resultant hole after removing a creep sample using a novel welding technique called friction hydro pillar processing. At the commencement of this study, insufficient data was available to warrant safe industrial application of the process. This research was conducted to evaluate the performance of 10 CrMo 910 friction hydro pillar process welds. The effects of downward force, stud taper angle, hole taper angle and <b>hole</b> <b>base</b> diameter on process response, defect population, static properties and dynamic performance were evaluated. The variation of downward force showed that higher forces produce significantly smaller defects and higher fatigue life. The occurrence of defects was linked to process parameters and geometry thereby identifying the correct parameters for safe use in the power generation industry. Flash formation was identified as an early indicator of weld defects and can assist with quality control in industrial applications. Methods of standardising the plunge depth and forge force were developed to identify the correct magnitudes for different geometries, without the need for testing. Defects were shown to populate specific regions of the weld and produce variations in fatigue life. Crack initiation sites were detected which will aid in identifying areas of focus in further research and development. Temperature measurements were linked to the occurrence of defects and crack initiation sites and have been identified as a method of identifying defective welds. The effects of process parameters and stud and hole taper angles on energy inputs and near interface temperatures were statistically evaluated. Downward force was shown to have the largest effect on energy input rates, total energy input and temperatures at the 11. 5 mm and 20. 5 mm positions. Smaller hole and stud taper angles produced lower energy inputs and were identified as more energy efficient than the larger taper angles. A regression model was also developed to predict the fatigue life of welds and can assist with critical process related decision making. A range of <b>hole</b> <b>base</b> diameters were identified which produced welds with low defect populations and fatigue performance {{similar to that of the}} parent plate. Larger <b>hole</b> <b>base</b> diameters were shown to produce significant defects along the hole bottom fillet, in the weld nugget and along the bond line. Temperature measurements of the larger diameter welds showed a delay in response and are attributed to a delayed contact of plasticised stud material with the sidewall. Welds with <b>hole</b> <b>base</b> diameters larger than 11 mm produced unrepeatable and defective welds, and also required higher energy inputs making smaller diameters more desirable. Analysis of all welds in this study revealed that clearance and interfacial pressures characterise the quality of friction hydro pillar process welds, therefore models were developed to aid in critical decision making with respect to downward force and geometry. This study has successfully evaluated the effects of process parameters and geometry on the properties of friction hydro pillar process welds and thereby has increased understanding of the process...|$|E

40|$|Quantum gravity {{correction}} is truly important to study tunnelling process of black <b>hole.</b> <b>Base</b> on the generalized uncertainty principle, we investigate {{the influence of}} quantum gravity and the result {{tell us that the}} quantum {{gravity correction}} accelerates the evaporation of black hole. Using corrected Dirac equation in curved spacetime and Hamilton-Jacobi method, we address the tunnelling of fermions in a 4 -dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime. After solving the equation of motion of the spin 1 / 2 field, we obtain the corrected Hawking temperature. It turns out that the correction depends not only on the mass of black hole but aslo on the mass of emitted fermions. In our calculation, the quantum gravity correction accelerates the increasing of Hawking temperature during the radiation explicitly. This correction leads to the increasing of the evaporation of black hole. Comment: 5 page...|$|E
40|$|The average soft X-ray {{emission}} from coronal holes {{observed on}} images obtained during rocket flights from 1974 to 1981 is measured. The variation of this emission over the solar cycle was then compared with photospheric magnetic flux measurements within coronal holes {{over the same}} period.

These quantitative results confirmed previous suggestions that the coronal brightness contrast between holes and large-scale structure decreased during this period of the cycle. Gas pressures at the <b>hole</b> <b>base</b> were estimated for assumed temperatures and found to vary from about 0. 03 dyne/sq cm in 1974 to 0. 35 dyne/sq cm in 1981.

40|$|Purpose: To examine {{anatomical}} {{changes in}} idiopathic macular holes during surgery using handheld spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT). Methods: Five eyes of 5 patients who underwent surgery for the repair of idiopathic macular holes were examined. The surgery included standard 25 -gauge, 3 -port pars plana vitrectomy, removal of the internal limiting membrane (ILM), fluid-air exchange, and 20 % sulfur hexafluoride tamponade. Intraoperative SD-OCT images of the macular holes were obtained after ILM removal and under fluid-air exchange using a handheld SD-OCT. From SD-OCT images, the macular <b>hole</b> <b>base</b> diameter (MHBD) was measured and compared. Results: All macular holes were successfully closed after the primary surgery. The mean MHBD under fluid-air exchange was significantly smaller than the mean MHBD after ILM removal and the preoperative mean MHBD. In 1 eye with a stage 3 macular hole, SD-OCT images revealed that the inner edges of the macular hole touched each other under fluid-air exchange. Conclusion: Fluid-air exchange significantly reduced MHBD during surgery to repair macular holes. Fluid-air exchange {{may be an important}} step for macular hole closure as it reduces the base diameter of the macular hole...|$|E

40|$|New UV and EUV {{observations}} of off-limb and upper solar corona {{made by the}} UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) and the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) are presented in this thesis. These data were used to establish the physical properties, such as temperature, density and element abundances, of different structures of the off-limb and upper corona. For this project, the UVCS team provided UV spectra of the extended solar corona, which included lines of primary interest for the characterization of this region and the solar wind. CDS data consisted of NIS (Normal Incidence Spectrometer) EUV spectra of the low corona. The data included several density-sensitive and temperature-sensitive lines which enabled diagnostic studies to be made. Absolute element abundances were derived from UVCS data; relative element abundances were derived from CDS data. The Differential Emission Measure (DEM) technique was used (for {{the first time on}} UVCS data) as the primary method for abundance study. Electron temperatures along the line of sight were derived applying the line ratio and the DEM techniques to both CDS and UVCS data. From the CDS data, electron densities along the line of sight were derived using the line ratio technique. For the UVCS data, the density was inferred using the 0 VI radiative and collisional components of the line. One equatorial and two mid-latitude streamers were observed with the two instruments, in the low corona and at about 1. 6 R®. Electron density and temperature profiles with the solar distance were derived. They appeared to satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. The equatorial streamer appeared to be cooler than the mid-latitude one. Moreover, while the former tended to isothermal values already in the low corona, the latter was multithermal at the base and isothermal at 1. 6 R®. The derived composition at 1. 6 R®. showed a depletion with respect to the photospheric values for almost all the elements. The Fe/O ratio found here was consistent with values found in the solar wind. Moreover, a depletion in element composition with increasing solar distance was also found. While observing off-limb in the south polar coronal hole, CDS {{observations of}} a macrospicule were obtained. For the first time the background emission was isolated from that of the macrospicule itself, and a diagnostic study of both regions was made. The ambient coronal hole appeared to have a density of = 2 x 108 cm - 3 that was about half the density found in the streamer base studied in this thesis. Multithermal components were found at the coronal <b>hole</b> <b>base.</b> The macrospicule spectrum indicated chromospheric and transition region temperatures, and fluctuations in density along the feature were registered. In particular, the data showed the presence of an outward-moving cloud of cool material. Its time evolution and velocity were studied. The maximum (initial) outflow velocity was about 80 km s- 1, consistent with the outflow velocity measured in interplume regions. An off-limb hot loop system was observed with CDS at mid-latitude. Its top and base were selected for diagnostic studies. Some newly observed hot lines were identified. The loop system appeared to be composed of multi-thermal plasma. The highest temperature registered was log T= 6. 4 {{at the top of the}} loop. A depletion of element abundances which mainly involves the plasma at the top of the loop was found. A coronal hole bounded by a loop system was observed with CDS. Electron density appeared up to a factor two higher in the boundary than in the coronal hole, and the loop system appeared multi-thermal. The ambient coronal hole temperature appeared to be enhanced by the proximity of this loop arcade. Abundances were derived in both regions, and the coronal hole boundary showed slight depletions relative to photospheric values. New coordinated observations with CDS and UVCS were made during one of the SOlO-Ulysses quadratures. Preliminary results regarding temperatures and densities of the core and boundary regions of streamers were obtained from UVCS data...|$|E
