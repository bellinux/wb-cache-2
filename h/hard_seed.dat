25|$|Physical {{dormancy}} or <b>hard</b> <b>seed</b> coats {{occurs when}} seeds are impermeable to water. At dormancy break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted {{in response to}} environmental cues, especially temperature, so water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant families where physical dormancy occurs include Anacardiaceae, Cannaceae, Convulvulaceae, Fabaceae and Malvaceae.|$|E
25|$|Leaching or the {{soaking in}} water removes {{chemical}} inhibitors in some seeds that prevent germination. Rain and melting snow naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best—if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in stagnant water, {{can result in}} oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with <b>hard</b> <b>seed</b> coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.|$|E
25|$|Other {{methods used}} {{to assist in the}} {{germination}} of seeds that have dormancy include prechilling, predrying, daily alternation of temperature, light exposure, potassium nitrate, the use of plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium hypochlorite, and others. Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks <b>hard</b> <b>seed</b> coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.|$|E

500|$|Golden wattle is {{cultivated}} in Australia and {{was introduced to}} the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it {{has been used as a}} windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is floriferous, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (chlorosis) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs [...] winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the <b>hard</b> <b>seed</b> coating.|$|E
2500|$|Canna seeds {{have a very}} <b>hard</b> <b>seed</b> coat, which {{contributes}} to their dormancy. [...] Germination is facilitated by scarification of the seed coat, which {{can be accomplished by}} several techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Scarification allows {{water and}} gases to {{penetrate}} into the seed; it includes methods to physically break the <b>hard</b> <b>seed</b> coats or soften them by chemicals, such as soaking {{in hot water}} or poking holes in the seed with a pin or rubbing them on sandpaper or cracking with a press or hammer. [...] Sometimes fruits are harvested while the seeds are still immature and the seed coat is not fully developed and sown right away before the seed coat become impermeable. [...] Under natural conditions, seed coats are worn down by rodents chewing on the seed, the seeds rubbing against rocks (seeds are moved by the wind or water currents), by undergoing freezing and thawing of surface water, or passing through an animal's digestive tract. In the latter case, the seed coat protects the seed from digestion, while often weakening the seed coat such that the embryo is ready to sprout when it is deposited, along {{with a bit of}} fecal matter that acts as fertilizer, far from the parent plant. [...] Microorganisms are often effective in breaking down <b>hard</b> <b>seed</b> coats and are sometimes used by people as a treatment; the seeds are stored in a moist warm sandy medium for several months under nonsterile conditions.|$|E
50|$|Wild {{forms are}} {{typically}} fine-stemmed, freely-branching and small-leaved, with a twining habit, photoperiod sensitivity and indeterminate growth (Lawn, 1995).

60|$|A still {{larger number}} of species owe their {{dispersal}} to birds in several distinct ways. An immense number of fruits {{in all parts of}} the world are devoured by birds, and have been attractively coloured (as we have seen), in order to be so devoured, because the seeds pass through the birds' bodies and germinate where they fall. We have seen how frequently birds are forced by gales of wind across a wide expanse of ocean, and thus seeds must be occasionally carried. It is a very suggestive fact, that all the trees and shrubs in the Azores bear berries or small fruits which are eaten by birds; while all those which bear larger fruits, or are eaten chiefly by mammals--such as oaks, beeches, hazels, crabs, etc.--are entirely wanting. Game-birds and waders often have portions of mud attached to their feet, and Mr. Darwin has proved by experiment that such mud frequently contains seeds. One partridge had such a quantity of mud attached to its foot as to contain seeds from which eighty-two plants germinated; this proves that a very small portion of mud may serve to convey seeds, and such an occurrence repeated even at long intervals may greatly aid in stocking remote islands with vegetation. Many seeds also adhere to the feathers of birds, and thus, again, may be conveyed as far as birds are ever carried.
