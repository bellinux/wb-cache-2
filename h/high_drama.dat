25|$|The primetime {{soap operas}} and drama {{series of the}} 1990s, such as Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place, Party of Five, The OC, and Dawson's Creek, focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, Brothers & Sisters, Ugly Betty, Private Practice, and more {{recently}} Revenge, Nashville, Scandal, Mistresses, and formerly Ringer, which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their <b>high</b> <b>drama</b> mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including Heroes and Friday Night Lights. The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of primetime telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.|$|E
25|$|Altogether, Tchaikovsky wrote four concertos (three for piano, one for violin), two concertante {{works for}} soloist and {{orchestra}} (one each for piano and cello) {{and a couple}} of short works. The First Piano Concerto, while faulted traditionally for having its opening melody in the wrong key and never restating that tune {{in the rest of the}} piece, shows an expert use of tonal instability to enhance tension and increase the tone of restlessness and <b>high</b> <b>drama.</b> The Violin Concerto, one of Tchaikovsky's freshest-sounding and least pretentious works, is filled with melodies that could have easily come from one of his ballets. The Second Piano Concerto, more formal in tone and less extroverted than the First, contains prominent solos for violin and cello in its slow movement, giving the impression of a concerto grosso for piano trio and orchestra. The Third Piano Concerto, initially the opening movement of a symphony in E flat, was left on Tchaikovsky's death as a single-movement composition. Tchaikovsky also promised a concerto for cello to Anatoliy Brandukov and one for flute to Paul Taffanel but died before he could work on either project in earnest.|$|E

A {{member of the}} Drew and Barrymore {{theatrical}} families, he initially tried to avoid the stage, and briefly attempted a career as an artist, but appeared on stage together with his father Maurice in 1900, and then his sister Ethel the following year. He began his career in 1903 and first gained attention as a stage actor in light comedy, then <b>high</b> <b>drama,</b> culminating in productions of Justice (1916), Richard III (1920) and Hamlet (1922); his portrayal of Hamlet led to him being called the [...] "greatest living American tragedian".|$|E

Stanford offered the work to the opera impresario Carl Rosa, who refused it and suggested that the composer should try to have it staged in Germany: [...] "Its success will (unfortunately) have much greater chances here if accepted abroad." [...] Referring to the enormous popularity of Sullivan's comic operas, Rosa added, [...] "If the work was of the Pinafore style it would be quite another matter." [...] Stanford had greatly enjoyed Sullivan's Cox and Box, but The Veiled Prophet was intended to be a serious work of <b>high</b> <b>drama</b> and romance.|$|E

Morris thought that the new material was weak, but when he voiced his opinion to Noel he was cut down: [...] " [...] I just carried on shovelling drugs up my nose." [...] Morris expressed regret at being unable to simply transfer the Mustique demos and overdub drums, vocals, and rhythm guitar, as the 8-track mixer he had employed required him to bounce tracks for overdubs, leaving him unable to remove the drum machine from the recordings.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, [...] Chopra {{appeared}} in six films. Her first two releases—Blackmail, and Karam—were commercially unsuccessful. Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of Rediff.com considered Blackmail to {{be a very}} predictable film and believed that her role as a police commissioner's wife was very limited from an acting point of view. Her performance in Karam was better received, Subhash K. Jha wrote that Chopra [...] "with her poised interpretation of <b>high</b> <b>drama,</b> flies high creating a character whose vulnerability and beauty are endorsed by both the inner and outer worlds created for her character." [...] Later that year Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in Vipul Amrutlal Shah's family drama , the story of a small businessman (played by Amitabh Bachchan) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies. During production, Chopra revisited Leh, a favourite childhood haunt, for the shooting of the song [...] "Subah Hogi". She suffered an accident during the filming for the song [...] "Do Me A Favour Let's Play Holi" [...] when she electrocuted herself, spending a day recovering in hospital.

500|$|While {{many of the}} {{concepts}} for the final version {{were present in the}} original mobile version, such as Overdive and the Twisted, the original story was scrapped when the game changed platforms. In creating the story for The 3rd Birthday, the team took inspiration from the 10-year gap in the character's in-game and real-time history. This meant that {{it would be difficult to}} create a straightforward sequel, so the team instead decided to make the game about Aya's return. Toriyama imagined story concepts such as the snowy New York setting and the image of a bloodstained wedding dress. These two concepts survived the platform change. Over the course of the development, he adjusted the plot numerous times to be more adult-oriented and to include complex narrative twists. The original concept was to make the game feel like a television drama, with multiple cliffhangers and moments of <b>high</b> <b>drama.</b> The game was designed from the outset as having no direct connection to the previous Parasite Eve games. The game's title came from it being Aya's third video game appearance, as well as it being a noticeable change in setting. The game's logo was designed to both look like the letter [...] "B" [...] and the number [...] "3". It was originally only going to represent the number, but Nomura added the extra lines to display the game's [...] "multi-faceted" [...] nature. A notable addition was the option to skip cutscenes, a feature the team regretted leaving out of Crisis Core.|$|E

The Washington Posts Chris Richards mused that [...] "the drums come avalanching on Lost in the World", calling it [...] "the grand finale this album deserves." [...] He continued that [...] "West serves up <b>high</b> <b>drama</b> at a breakneck tempo, with pining melodies crying out for a redemptive moment. But there's no final act of contrition. West is too 'lost in this plastic life.'" [...] Cole Mathew of Slant Magazine described the track as [...] "Kanye's much-anticipated reworking of Bon Iver's [...] "Woods" [...] from his classic EP", and wrote that [...] "it's astounding how he takes the strangest sample on the album and crafts it into a defiantly giddy dance number, complete with tribal drumming in the verses and group choruses that sound massive. It's a mad stroke of brilliance to take Justin Vernon's solitary ode to alienation {{and use it as}} the centerpiece of a catchy, communal reverie. It's experimental, to be sure, but it's also the closest the album comes to pure pop indulgence." [...] The song peaked on the South Korea Gaon Chart at position 104.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} critical acclaim from critics. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode calling it [...] "A super-sweet {{end to a}} super-sweet series!" [...] Mrs. Northman of television website, TV Fanatic said [...] "Overall, [...] "Hello Goodbye" [...] did wrap up each of our beloved characters lives in a nice pretty bow", they added [...] "We wanted MORE!" [...] The day after the episode's U.S. airing, {{a reporter for the}} British newspaper Daily Mail praised Betty's transformation saying [...] "Gone were the thick-rimmed glasses and braces that once defined America Ferrera's character, and in its place a professional career woman signalling the completion of a four-year metamorphosis." [...] However, some critics felt the ending of the episode was not enough. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the episode a mixed review saying it was [...] "like one long hug with loved ones you don't want to leave," [...] but added the conclusion was [...] "unsatisfying". New York magazine said [...] "The cast of Ugly Betty damn well earned a happy ending — and that's exactly what creator Silvio Horta gave them last night on the series finale". However, they also found the conclusion to be unsatisfying saying [...] "The one-hour finale easily could have been longer, meaning some plotlines went unresolved." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post said [...] "Last night, Ugly Betty attempted to earn a place in TV history, but I fear their last episode will be quickly forgotten by the fans". Wieselman also added [...] "On a show that always favored <b>high</b> <b>drama</b> and cool camp, I was saddened to see everyone get such an expected ending".

500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, <b>high</b> <b>drama</b> approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Fox's performance, {{saying that}} it was almost worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall of gave the episode a mixed review, saying that [...] "I find [...] and his love life {{simultaneously}} boring and obnoxious … [...] insufferable"; however, he enjoyed the subplots and commended the acting by Matthew Fox and Jorge Garcia. [...] James Poniewozik of Time did not enjoy the flashforwards, commenting that they were [...] "the first of the flashforwards that resembled one of the bad old flashbacks, in that it just reconfirmed character traits we already knew and showed Jack and Kate falling into patterns we knew from the past … I didn't get much from it". [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.5/10, making it his least favorite episode of the season. [...] Carabott wrote that [...] "this season [...] seems to have been relegated to playing second fiddle … oddly enough, even in his own episode, Jack really isn't given much to do" [...] and stated that [...] "the possible rekindling of Jack and Kate's romantic relationship on the island is juxtaposed quite well with their relationship during the flashforward." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "the pace … was a bit too slow" [...] and [...] "I usually like the Jack-centered episodes, but a bout of appendicitis simply does not make for <b>high</b> <b>drama</b> or stimulating action"; however, he noted that [...] "all in all, this was a good episode, but it was nothing special." [...] Compora praised Fox's increasingly good acting, but said that [...] "this season has seen much stronger lead performances from Michael Emerson [...] and Henry Ian Cusick [...]" [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "a break after last week's action- and information-packed episode", argued that Rousseau was not given a proper death and enjoyed Rose and Bernard's roles. [...] UGO's Sara shared Martell's sentiments in regard to Rose and Bernard's appearances and speculated that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] would not be enjoyed by fans who like Rousseau or do not like Jack. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode three out of five stars, saying that [...] "the Jack-Kate romantic intrigue is rather dull, while the appendix plot feels like an unnecessary narrative obstacle for viewers to surmount." ...|$|E
