5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{national}} central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued <b>euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> on a joint basis. <b>Euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept <b>euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of {{the total value of}} banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of <b>euro</b> <b>banknotes</b> are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.|$|E
