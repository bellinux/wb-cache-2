40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{designing}} a learning center to fit the instructional programs of Gallaudet College, {{a review of the}} literature and visits to 20 schools and colleges were made and options considered for the provision of nonprint materials. The costs, advantages, and utility of various nonprint retrieval systems are analyzed, specifically videocassette systems, television, and <b>dial</b> <b>access</b> equipment. Library functions necessary in the support of a nonprint collection are defined, including selection of materials, with emphasis on faculty participation; organization and housing of the collection; personnel; dissemination; outreach to students and faculty; and evaluation. Recommendations are then made, in the form of performance objectives through 1980, for the development of the nonprint retrieval services at Gallaudet College Library. Cost estimates are provided for achieving these objectives. Because the provision of such a learning center has implications for the total program of the college, suggestions are made for increased coordination between the library and students, faculty and administration.

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1999). All Rights Reserved. IESG Note The PPTP protocol was developed by a vendor consortium. The documentation of PPTP is provided as information to the Internet community. The PPP WG is currently defining a Standards Track protocol (L 2 TP) for tunneling PPP across packet-switched networks. This document specifies a protocol which allows the Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to be tunneled through an IP network. PPTP does not specify any changes to the PPP protocol but rather describes a new vehicle for carrying PPP. A client-server architecture is defined in order to decouple functions which exist in current Network Access Servers (NAS) and support Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The PPTP Network Server (PNS) is envisioned to run on a general purpose operating system while the client, {{referred to as a}} PPTP Access Concentrator (PAC) operates on a <b>dial</b> <b>access</b> platform.
