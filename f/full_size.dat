5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} in May and June, and {{fighting}} among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses {{a significant amount of}} weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach <b>full</b> <b>size</b> after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coins. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology.|$|E

5|$|According to {{production}} staff, scenes involving the alien queen {{were the most}} difficult to film. A life-sized mock-up was created by Stan Winston's company in the United States to see how it would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at 14 feet (4.3 m) tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the <b>full</b> <b>size</b> queen were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation. Additionally, a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots.|$|E
5|$|After {{the female}} lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the egg to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach <b>full</b> <b>size</b> at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches <b>full</b> <b>size</b> {{about two}} weeks after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E

Moving into the enclosed Elmer Lam gallery in stalls 17 through 20, aviation exhibits dominate, with a <b>full</b> <b>size</b> replica Wright Flyer, Piedmont Airlines exhibits, and more. Moving into the restoration shop occupying stalls 21 through 32, visitors may also see volunteers working on various railroad pieces, and even manufacturing parts. The remaining five stalls are dedicated to additional enclosed exhibits.|$|E
5|$|Freshly {{relocated}} from Sacramento, the San Antonio Texans {{finally found}} {{success on the}} field in 1995 playing in the brand new Alamodome. The Alamodome offered two advantages over other U.S. facilities - it was a multi-purpose facility with retractable seating that could accommodate a <b>full</b> <b>size</b> CFL field, also, it was an indoor, air-conditioned facility which meant the teams playing there {{did not have to}} deal with the summer heat. The team continued to be bankrolled by the enthusiastic Fred Anderson. Archer, entering his fifth year as Anderson's quarterback, led the second best offence in the league; he nevertheless suffered an injury late in the season, prompting the team to hire 45-year-old Joe Ferguson (whom Stephenson had coached as a member of the Buffalo Bills) out of retirement to serve as a backup. They finished 12–6 and finally made the playoffs. In the first round they trounced Birmingham, 51–9, before falling to the Baltimore Stallions, 21–11, in the South Division final. Team attendance was around the same level Anderson had previously seen in Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons.

5|$|Sue Hendrickson, amateur paleontologist, {{discovered}} {{the most complete}} (approximately 85%) and the largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith, South Dakota, on August 12, 1990. This Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Sue in her honor, was {{the object of a}} legal battle over its ownership. In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $7.6 million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date. From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History preparators spent over 25,000 man-hours taking the rock off each of the bones. The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made. The finished mount was then taken apart, and along with the bones, shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly. The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17, 2000 in the great hall (Stanley Field Hall) at the Field Museum of Natural History. A study of this specimen's fossilized bones showed that Sue reached <b>full</b> <b>size</b> at age 19 and died at age 28, the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived. Early speculation that Sue may have died from a bite {{to the back of the}} head was not confirmed. Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton, no bite marks were found. Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post-mortem trampling. Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat; the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat, ultimately leading Sue to starve because she could no longer swallow food. This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth-edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern-day birds that contract the same parasite.|$|E
