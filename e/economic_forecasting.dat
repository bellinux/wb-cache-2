25|$|According to King, LaRouche's {{associates}} had {{for some}} years {{been in contact with}} members of the Reagan administration about LaRouche's space-based weapons ideas. LaRouche proposed the development of defensive beam technologies as a policy that was in the interest of both the US and the USSR, as the alternative to an arms race in offensive weapons, and as a generator of spin-off economic benefits. Between February 1982 and February 1983, with the approval of the National Security Council, LaRouche met with Soviet embassy representative Evgeny Shershnev to discuss the proposal. During this period, Soviet economists also began to study LaRouche's <b>economic</b> <b>forecasting</b> model. However, following Reagan's public announcement of the SDI in March 1983, Soviet representatives broke off all contact with LaRouche and his representatives.|$|E

500|$|The {{aviation}} {{industry and the}} government have together commissioned two significant studies into {{the economic impact of}} air transport, both undertaken by the consultancy Oxford <b>Economic</b> <b>Forecasting</b> (OEF). The first; The Contribution of the Aviation Industry to the UK Economy, was published in 1999 and was used as a source of economic information in The Future of Air Transport White Paper. The second study; The Economic Contribution of the Aviation Industry in the UK, co-sponsored by the national tourist agency VisitBritain, was published in October 2006 to extend and update the earlier report, and was used as a source in the Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006. Both studies concluded that whilst aviation is an important industry in its own right, the most important contribution is as [...] "… a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole." ...|$|E
500|$|Environmental groups {{dispute the}} {{economic}} benefits that are claimed for air transport, and the OEF reports have been specifically challenged. The Aviation Environment Federation (AEF), publishing the Rebuttal of Oxford <b>Economic</b> <b>Forecasting</b> Report, has labelled the 2006 OEF report [...] "biased and misleading". AirportWatch, an umbrella movement for national environmental organisations and airport community groups opposed to aviation expansion, has produced {{a critique of the}} 2006 OEF report and the DfT’s reliance on economic research that has been [...] "… sponsored by the aviation industry." [...] In response to government policy supporting further growth in aviation, Friends of the Earth (FoE) published Pie in the Sky in September 2006. This study concludes that {{the economic benefits}} of aviation have been exaggerated, and that the costs arising from environmental damage, as well as to other sectors of the economy, are ignored. Also published in 2006, the Environmental Change Institute study Predict and decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy re-examined the economic arguments made in favour of aviation, concluding that restricting future growth would not necessarily be detrimental to the economy, and could potentially result in some economic benefits.|$|E

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> play an {{increasing}} role in U. S. budgetary and fiscal policies. This paper analyzes the accuracy and bias of <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> {{prepared by the}} Executive Branch and Congress. Short-run forecasts by the Executive Branch for the forthcoming year do not appear biased. They are as accurate as private forecasts and the forecasts of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO); they are not sensitive to political {{factors such as the}} size of the deficit. At the same time, the accuracy of Executive branch's short-run <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> has not improved over the period from 1962 to 1984, and the forecasts themselves can be well approximated by simple, single-equation models that use a small number of variables. In contrast to short-run <b>forecasts,</b> long-run <b>economic</b> <b>forecasts</b> of both the Executive branch and CBO are consistently optimistic. The degree of optimism increases with the length of the forecasting horizon and the degree of fiscal pressure the year in which they are issued. The Reagan Administration's long-run forecasts, while typically optimistic, have not been rosier than those issued under previous administrations. ...|$|R
