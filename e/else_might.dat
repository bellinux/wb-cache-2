On Christmas Day, Morgan's men rode through Glasgow, bound for Bacon Creek Station and the L bridge span. After quelling the stiff Union resistance, Morgan's men destroyed {{the bridge and}} several miles of railroad track. Whatever <b>else</b> <b>might</b> happen, they had succeeded in disrupting Rosecrans' supply line.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{sent his}} wife Charlotte to Europe to plead against the {{withdrawal}} of French troops. After an unsuccessful attempt at negotiating with Napoleon III, Charlotte then traveled to Rome to plead with Pius in 1866. As the days passed Charlotte's mental state became overtly paranoid. She sought refuge with the pope, and she would eat and drink only what was prepared for him, fearful that everything <b>else</b> <b>might</b> be poisoned. The pope, though alarmed, was accommodating to her and even agreed to let her stay in the Vatican one night after she voiced anxiety about her safety. She and her assistant were the first women to stay the night inside the Vatican.|$|E
25|$|If an {{individual}} possesses {{a good or}} service whose marginal utility to him is {{less than that of}} some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, {{an individual}} will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all <b>else</b> <b>might</b> not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.|$|E

500|$|When {{working on}} songs, Annie was {{involved}} with the whole recording and production processes, {{with a focus on}} the melodies. Annie stated that while promoting the album, she wanted to make sure people knew of her involvement in the album's writing and production. Of its twelve songs, ten were co-written by Annie. [...] She stated that although singing songs written by someone <b>else</b> <b>might</b> not feel less personal, [...] "It's special to be on the stage and actually sing something you had done." [...] With respect to her involvement in the songwriting process, Annie referred to herself as [...] "a bit of a control freak".|$|E

If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody <b>else</b> <b>might</b> do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{rights for}} The Time Traveler's Wife were optioned by Brad Pitt's {{production}} company Plan B Entertainment, {{in association with}} New Line Cinema, before the novel was even published. The adaptation was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Robert Schwentke, and stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by Warner Bros. on 14 August 2009. When asked {{about the prospect of}} her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, [...] "I've got my little movie that runs in my head. And I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody <b>else</b> <b>might</b> do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me." [...] In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. [...] For example, The New York Times wrote that the film was an [...] "often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation".|$|E

500|$|Described by Riley as the album's [...] "most {{derivative}} cut", [...] "Got to Get You into My Life" [...] {{was influenced}} by the Motown Sound and written by McCartney after he had seen Stevie Wonder perform at the Scotch of St James nightclub in February. The horn players on the track included members of Georgie Fame's group, the Blue Flames. To capture the desired sound, microphones were placed in the bells of the brass instruments, and the signals were heavily limited. A month later, a tape copy of these horn parts was superimposed with a slight delay, thereby doubling the presence of the brass contributions. Rodriguez terms the completed track [...] "an R shouter". Although cast {{in the form of a}} love song, McCartney described the lyric as [...] "an ode to pot, like someone <b>else</b> <b>might</b> write an ode to chocolate or a good claret". The initial version of the song, as issued on Anthology 2, featured acoustic backing and organ, and a harmonised refrain of [...] "I need your love", which was replaced by Harrison's guitar break on the more uptempo remake.|$|E

2500|$|In United States jurisprudence, {{there is}} a {{distinction}} between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or infringing (e.g., illegal MP3 copies). [...] Several courts have found that merely linking to someone else's website, even if by bypassing commercial advertising, is not copyright or trademark infringement, regardless of how much someone <b>else</b> <b>might</b> object. Linking to illegal or infringing content can be sufficiently problematic to give rise to legal liability.Compare [...] For a summary of the current status of US copyright law as to hyperlinking, see the discussion regarding the Arriba Soft and Perfect 10 cases.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Are we {{explaining}} consciousness yet?" [...] (2001), Dennett approves of {{an account}} of qualia defined as the deep, rich collection of individual neural responses that are too fine-grained for language to capture. For instance, a person might have an alarming reaction to yellow because of a yellow car that hit her previously, and someone <b>else</b> <b>might</b> have a nostalgic reaction to a comfort food. These effects are too individual-specific to be captured by English words.

2500|$|Acclaimed {{during his}} lifetime, Madetoja is today seldom heard outside the Nordic {{countries}} (the Elegia perhaps excepted). A few commentators, however, have described such neglect as unfortunate and undeserved, as Madetoja {{is one of}} the most important post-Sibelian Finnish symphonists. Part of this neglect is not unique to Madetoja: the titanic legacy of Sibelius has made it difficult for Finnish composers (especially his contemporaries), as a group, to gain much attention, and each has had to labor under his [...] "dominating shadow". However, with respect to the neglect of Madetoja in particular, something <b>else</b> <b>might</b> also be at play: Madetoja's eschewal of Romantic excess in favor of restraint, perhaps, has made him a tougher sell to audiences.

2500|$|Sam Jordison of The Guardian wrote, [...] "It is near impossible, I would say, not to {{root for}} Tom Ripley. Not to like him. Not, on some level, to want him to win. Patricia Highsmith does a fine job of {{ensuring}} he wheedles his way into our sympathies." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert made a similar appraisal of the character in his review of Purple Noon, Rene Clement's 1960 film adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley: [...] "Ripley is a criminal of intelligence and cunning who gets away with murder. He's charming and literate, and a monster. It's insidious, the way Highsmith seduces us into identifying with him and sharing his selfishness; Ripley believes that getting his own way is worth whatever price anyone <b>else</b> <b>might</b> have to pay. We all have {{a little of that}} in us." [...] Novelist Sarah Waters esteemed The Talented Mr. Ripley as the [...] "one book I wish I'd written." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Meyer, {{the book}} was {{inspired}} and influenced by Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, although she does not like the book. She said that characters of the book fascinate her and she enjoys reading certain parts, but does not enjoy the book as a whole because she finds it very depressing—an opinion expressed by Edward in Eclipse. When comparing Edward and Jacob to Heathcliff and Edgar Linton of Wuthering Heights, she said, [...] "You could look at Edward and Jacob from one perspective and say: Okay, this one is Heathcliff {{and this one is}} Edgar. And someone <b>else</b> <b>might</b> say: No, wait a second. Because of this reason and that reason, that one is Heathcliff and the other one is Edgar...I like that confusion, because that's how life is." [...] In August 2009, The Telegraph reported that HarperCollins' Wuthering Heights edition—which has a [...] "gothic" [...] cover similar to the Twilight covers—has sold more than 10,000 copies since May of that year, {{more than twice as many}} as the traditional Penguin Classics edition, and topped the newspaper's classic books chart for the first time due to Meyer referencing the novel.|$|E

They all seem to enjoy it equally." [...] Fellow founder Sickmen claims [...] "the original intent of the band [...] [...] was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock." [...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals.
