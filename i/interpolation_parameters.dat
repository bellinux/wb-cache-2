40|$|Regularized Spline with Tension {{was used}} to {{interpolate}} two data sets representing radioactivity measurements at 200 locations. A cross-validation analysis showed {{that the size of}} the training data sets was too low to find optimal parameters using the cross-validation procedure. The resulting surfaces were strongly smoothed and less realistic than expected. Therefore empirical <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameters</b> were used to interpolate the data. Despite the fact that this empirical selection did not produced interpolation results with a lower overall predictive error, it preserved better local fluctuations and anomalies of the phenomenon. The detection of these features is important in radioactivity monitoring and emergency situations. The poor reliability of cross-validation was also confirmed by evaluation data set. It was concluded that the optimization of <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameters</b> cannot rely on cross-validation when the modeled phenomenon is not sufficiently sampled. The sampling density should be sufficient to represent spatial variations of the phenomenon and, at the same time, allow the optimization of <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameters</b> using automated procedures...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} for estimating the <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameters</b> of language models (LM) which are used as classifiers. With the classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimation theoretically one {{needs to have a}} huge amount of data and the fundamental density assumption has to be correct. Usually one of these conditions is violated, so different optimization techniques like maximum mutual information (MMI) and minimum classification error (MCE) can be used instead, where the <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameters</b> are not optimized on its own but in consideration of all models together. In this paper we present how MCE and MMI techniques can be applied to two different kind of interpolation strategies: the linear interpolation, which is the standard interpolation method and the rational interpolation.

40|$|A numeric tool is {{presented}} for calculating volumes of topographic voids such as slump scars of landslides, canyons or craters (negative/concave morphology), or alternatively, bumps and hills (positive/convex morphology) {{by means of}} digital elevation models embedded within a geographical information system (GIS). In this study, {{it has been used}} to calculate landslide volumes. The basic idea is that a (singular) event (landslide, meteorite impact, volcanic eruption) has disturbed an intact surface such that it is still possible to distinguish between the former (undisturbed) landscape and the disturbance (crater, slide scar, debris avalanche). In such cases, it is possible to reconstruct the paleo-surface and to calculate the volume difference between both surfaces, thereby approximating the volume gain or loss caused by the event. I tested the approach using synthetically generated land surfaces that were created on the basis of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. Also, I show the application to two real cases, (1) the calculation of the volume of the Masaya Slide, a submarine landslide on the Pacific continental slope of Nicaragua, and (2) the calculation of the void of a segment of the Fish River Canyon, Namibia. The tool is provided as a script file for the free GIS GRASS.

The gait controller also optimizes the circulation path {{to establish the}} ground contact constraints by detecting the terrain surface using precomputed spheres. This paper presents a practical system for synthesizing gait animation in game environments. As well as improving the reality of animation, we should improve the efficiency and the maneuverability of the character, {{both of which are}} essential for interactive games. Our system supplies these practical demands by integrating a motion interpolation technique and a sampling-based control mechanism. We introduce a parameterized looped motion data structure, called a motion ring, for synthesizing a variety of cyclic motions. A continuous gait motion is synthesized by circulating through the motion ring while the <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameter</b> is adaptively controlled according to the terrain condition. The gait controller uses a sampling-based precomputation technique which efficiently searches natural foot contact on terrain of an arbitrary surface shape. The <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameter</b> is also controlled to obey the user control within the duration of quarter gait cycle. Although our system slightly sacrifices the physical correctness of the synthesized motion in order to quickly respond to user input, critical visual artifacts such as foot-skating and jerky movement are prevented.

With that, the <b>interpolation</b> <b>parameters</b> are defined individually for each observatory and depend on the instrumentation used, the measurement quality, the typical baseline value dispersion, etc. In the proposed method, the free parameter λ has a clearer physical meaning, and its selection is less subjective. Moreover, the selection of the parameter can be automated, for example, by the analysis of statistical features of the initial data. An important feature of the algorithm is the possibility of a quantitative estimation of the resulting data precision and, thus, determination of the problematic fragments in initial data without operator intervention.|$|E

This approach generates quadratic B-spline curves whose quality is comparable to that of cubic interpolating B-spline curves. This makes quadratic B-spline curves better choices than cubic B-spline curves in some applications in graphics and geometric modeling, since it is cheaper to render/subdivide a quadratic curve and it is easier to find the intersection of two quadratic curves...|$|R
