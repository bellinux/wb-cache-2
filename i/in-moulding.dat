In recent years, multi-material over-moulding {{has become one of}} the fastest growing sectors of the injection moulding industry mainly due to its <b>in-mould</b> assembly and <b>in-mould</b> decoration features.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{addition}} of 0. 05 wt. % to 0. 25 wt. % Ca, Zr, Al-FeSi alloy on in-ladle and <b>in-mould</b> inoculation of grey cast irons was investigated. In the present paper, the conclusions drawn {{are based on}} thermal analysis. For the solidification pattern, some specific cooling curves characteristics, such as the degree of undercooling {{at the beginning of}} eutectic solidifi cation {{and at the end of}} solidifi cation, as well as the recalescence level, are identifi ed to be more infl uenced by the inoculation technique. The degree of eutectic undercooling of the electrically melted base iron having 0. 025 % S, 0. 003 % Al and 3. 5 % Ce is excessively high (39 – 40 ℃), generating a relatively high need for inoculation. Under these conditions, the <b>in-mould</b> inoculation has a more signifi cant effect compared to ladle inoculation, especially at lower inoculant usage (less than 0. 20 wt. %). Generally, the efficiency of 0. 05 wt. %– 0. 15 wt. % of alloy for <b>in-mould</b> inoculation is comparable to, or better than, that of 0. 15 wt. %– 0. 25 wt. % addition in ladle inoculation procedures.

Solution based processing of organic materials offers the opportunity to manufacture large area, low cost illuminating surfaces but current processes are limited to two dimensions. The ability to apply electroluminescent materials onto three dimensional contoured surfaces would incorporate the illuminating function into objects, enhancing usability and removing the need for an additional light source. Furthermore, the integration directly into the manufacturing process, such as injection moulding, would have the added benefits of reducing manufacturing time, handling and have environmental and economic savings. Incorporating electronics manufacturing <b>in-mould</b> offers considerable potential for novel research and commercial applications. Electroluminescent multi-layer structures were constructed on 3 D surfaces, applying materials using an airbrush. Novel injection moulded electroluminescent devices were successfully made using insert moulding and <b>in-mould</b> layer application techniques, then characterised and compared to a bought device. Electroluminescent layers were also applied to injection moulded plastic parts as a post mould treatment for further comparison.

These thermal properties analysis were very important in order to produce optimum processing parameters and a better quality with longer life span of hinges and tension band which are widely applied to product packaging. The analysis of results showed that the measured <b>in-mould</b> temperature during injection moulding practical produced the correct trend as referred to the rheological theories of polypropylene.

The current research on non-migratory antiozonant systems for natural rubber follows a tripartite study involving the formulation of a coating compound with static and dynamic ozone testing of the coatings, a review of some commercial <b>in-mould</b> coating techniques and analysis of diffusion of a commercial antiozonant through a coating. An outline of the mixing of Nipol 1312, a low molecular weight nitrile butadiene rubber grade produced by leon Chemicals Inc., with other ingredients to produce a coating composition is also given. Test pieces of the natural rubber substrate were placed in pre-coated mould cavities and cured under compression to achieve covulcanisation between the substrate and the coating. All ozone tests were carried out under standard ASTM DI 149 - 911 D 518 - 91 conditions. Results show that the formulated nitrile rubber coating compound is able to protect natural rubber from ozone attack with no migration of the antiozonant as in classical chemical antiozonant systems. An up to date patent search on <b>in-mould</b> coating techniques and systems was carried out and evaluated in conjunction with some current commercial coating methods.

A series of CFRP laminates were prepared by the RTM technique varying the fibre volume content (30 to 60 %), reinforcement material (woven fabrics vs. unidirectional fibre reinforcements), curing temperatures (40 °C to 120 °C), additives (SiO 2 nanoparticles as matrix fillers) and using a surface finish applied as an <b>in-mould</b> coating. Laminate surfaces were characterized by roughness analysis (white-light interferometry) and wave-scan measurement to quantify {{the influence of the}} different manufacturing parameters on the surface quality. Especially the used resins were intensively characterized concerning thermal properties (CTE) and total resin shrinkage. These results correlate very well with the performed analysis of surface roughness. It is found that the fibre print through effect is significantly reduced by realising low total resin shrinkage and an even distribution of resin and fibres at the surface. Thus, using of unidirectional fibre reinforcement (no weft or sewing threads; very fine filaments), low curing temperatures (slow curing processes) and an <b>in-mould</b> coating are most successful for reduction of fibre print through effect and getting surface similar to Class A properties. In addition, the surface quality is quite positively affected by the application of nanoparticles and also strongly controlled by roughness of tooling...|$|R
