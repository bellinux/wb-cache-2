5000|$|Coelan Marine Coatings come in {{transparent}} gloss {{and silk}} finish with the primer coming in pigmented colors. They {{can be used}} on wood, fiberglass, and metal deck surfaces. They are also used to restore inflatable dinghies, boating fenders, and rub rails. Once applied, it is both flexible and resilient and able to bridge <b>hair</b> <b>line</b> <b>cracks</b> and stop leaks. [...] Colean Marine Coatings are water vapor permeable so they allow moisture to dissipate and are resistant to high wear and abrasion. They are used to refurbish wood such as teak, oak, mahogany and red ironwood but can also be used for softwoods such as pine, fir, larch, and spruce. They can also be used on many other surfaces including steel, fiberglass, and rubber. Colean Marine Coatings are designed to be “antislip” and are also often used on home furnishings as well as boats. Coelan Marine Coatings are rated {{among the best in the}} industry as they retain a good level of gloss and translucency.|$|R

50|$|If {{the skin}} defect does not exceed 3 cm in diameter, {{it can be}} closed primarily. If this is not {{possible}} without tension, the surrounding loose connective tissue can be undermined to attain more mobility. Different kinds of transpositions to close the defect with adjacent skin are possible: V-Y, Z, pinwheel flaps, advancement flaps, Orticochea flaps and rotation flaps. All these transpositions generate tension of the skin and may distort <b>hair</b> <b>lines.</b> A combination of the Orticochea and rotation flaps {{is illustrated by the}} pictures about the forehead defect.Another option is secondary healing, but this is aesthetically inferior to primary closure in hair bearing areas because of the resulting alopecia. If the scalp cannot be closed primarily and local reconstruction with hair bearing skin is needed because of <b>hair</b> <b>lines,</b> tissue expansion of hair bearing skin may be possible. The expansion process is uncomfortable on the short term, but long-term results are good.|$|R

40|$|The {{displacement}} discontinuity {{method is}} reviewed as a numerical technique for computing stresses and displacements distribution over a plane {{area in a}} homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic material. The elementary solution for a single <b>line</b> <b>crack</b> in an infinite body is derived. The displacement function over the line segment {{is assumed to be}} linear of the form ax + b, where a and b are functions of the displacement at the extreme nodes of the line segment. The numerical technique used to overcome the indefinite values of the analytical solution at the singular node points is explained. The problem of a pressurized <b>line</b> <b>crack</b> in an infinite body is fully investigated. Also studied are the problems of a circular disk acted upon by uniform radial pressures, and a circular hole in a thin infinite plate subjected to uniaxial tensile loads. In all cases, values resulting from the application of the linear displacement discontinuity method, the constant displacement discontinuity method and the theoretical method are examined and compared.

40|$|The Kumamoto Earthquake with {{magnitude}} of 7. 3 (Mj) on April 16 and 6. 5 (Mj) on April 14, 2016 have triggered numerous damages to the Tawarayama Tunnel in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. Distribution {{and characteristics of}} these seismic damages were investigated and summarized to assess potential influencing factors. Seismic damages are categorized into five patterns as follows: <b>lining</b> <b>cracks,</b> spalling and collapse of concrete lining, construction joint damage, pavement damage and groundwater leakage. Lining cracks can be further classified into ring crack, longitudinal crack, transverse crack and inclined crack. Site investigation showed the primary seismic damage was <b>lining</b> <b>crack,</b> especially ring crack. In special, an interesting phenomenon was observed that ring cracks occurred with an estimated average spacing of 10. 0 m in 23. 4 % spans of the Tawarayama Tunnel. This results from the interaction between seismic wave and special geological conditions that dense Andesite and crushed Andesite around the Tawarayama Tunnel appear in tilt alternately with space between 10 m and 20 m. Following these analysis, some recommendations were proposed for future tunnel planning...|$|R
