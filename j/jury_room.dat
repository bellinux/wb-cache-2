25|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004. The grand jury had nineteen jurors; the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors. Prosecution witnesses testified without defense cross-examination. The judge ruled that witnesses {{before the grand jury}} could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw in the grand <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> or what questions they were asked and their answers. Many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting, sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities. In February 2005 The Smoking Gun published the Grand Jury transcripts (1903 pages).|$|E

25|$|Sydney Lewis Hall is {{the home}} of the school of law on the {{historic}} campus of Washington and Lee in Lexington, Virginia. Lewis Hall was built in 1977 with a $9 million gift from Best Products founder Sydney Lewis and his wife Frances of Virginia. Lewis Hall was designed by Marcellus Wright Cox & Smith Architects in the Mid-century modern style. In addition to lecture halls, classrooms, and offices for faculty and staff, Lewis Hall houses the 150-seat Millhiser Moot Courtroom with the accompanying Robert E. Stroud Judge's Chambers and the Roger D. Groot <b>Jury</b> <b>Room.</b> The Millhiser Moot Courtroom serves as the continuity of operations site for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Lewis Hall also has a cafeteria for students, staff, and faculty called the Brief Stop, which serves food, snacks, and drinks. As part of its recently completed $35 million campaign, Honor Our Past, Build Our Future, the School of Law began an $8 million renovation and modernization project in the summer of 2014 and completed in the summer of 2015. The project resulted in more flexible space for student collaboration and study, new homes for four of the school's legal clinics and student organizations, more natural lighting, a new library reading room, a new high-tech trial courtroom, and an improved entry sequence and navigation for the building.|$|E
500|$|On February 20, 1858, Lahaina {{experienced}} a violent hurricane that destroyed approximately twenty buildings, including the original courthouse at Hale Piula, initially {{intended as a}} [...] palace for Kamehameha III.

The new courthouse housed offices for customs, the postal service, the tax collector, the governor of Maui, a magistrates' court, a courtroom, and a <b>jury</b> <b>room.</b> [...] When the Kingdom was overthrown, the flag of Hawaii at the Lahaina Courthouse was lowered by the assistant postmaster on August 12, 1898, and the flag of the United States was raised in its place. The Hawaiian flag was placed on display in a permanent exhibit at the courthouse in September 2002. The post office at the courthouse replaced the Hawaiian stamp with the US stamp on June 14, 1900.|$|E

500|$|The castle was now principally {{a prison}} and a court, still {{operating}} {{under the authority of}} the constable and the Forest Law originally established in 1217. The remaining buildings inside the bailey were converted into a courtroom and <b>jury</b> <b>room,</b> with {{the west side of the}} gatehouse being used as a jail for detaining prisoners. St Briavels Castle was primarily a debtors' prison– in England up until the Debtors' Act of 1869, individuals unable to pay their debts or fines could be detained in prison indefinitely to encourage payment. The conditions in the castle prison became increasingly notorious after a visit from the prison reformer John Howard in 1775 as part of his research for the first edition of his book The State of the Prisons, published two years later. Howard found the prison [...] "greatly out of repair", with the two inmates locked in a single room without exercise for the best of a year, with no fresh water, financial support or firewood. Graffiti on the stone walls of the castle jail includes the mournful inscription by a prisoner of the period [...] "For I have been here a great space; And I am weary of the place." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{oral history}} interview, Singh {{said that one}} of the murder trials that he had presided over, the [...] "Body in the Box" [...] case, led to the {{abolition}} of jury trials in Singapore criminal cases. Following the trial of a young man, Freddy Tan, for the murder of his friend whose decomposed body was found stuffed into a box, Singh agreed with the jury to convict Tan of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentence him to life imprisonment. However, he later learnt that in the <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> a bullying Dutch juror had wanted to impose the death penalty, but because the other jurors disliked his attitude they voted to impose a lower verdict on Tan. The father of the deceased felt an injustice had been done and went to see the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee then sent for Singh, and Singh informed him of what had happened with the jurors. Lee asked Singh, [...] "Well what do you think. Shall I abolish the jury?" [...] Singh replied that if he had tried Tan without a jury, he would have convicted him of murder without hesitation. Following a public inquiry, jury trials were abolished for all criminal cases in 1969.|$|E

[...] His observation of the twelve men was that [...] "their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound." [...] However, the film was a box office disappointment.

2500|$|The {{grand jury}} is a pre-{{constitutional}} common law institution, and a constitutional fixture {{in its own right}} exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states {{to the extent that the}} states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. [...] "Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the {{grand jury is}} similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [...] majority of the States." [...] Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. Grand juries, which return indictments in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given specific instructions regarding the law by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the exclusionary rule does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments cannot be introduced in court. Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.|$|E

2500|$|... 12 Angry Men is a 1957 American {{courtroom}} drama film {{adapted from}} a teleplay {{of the same name}} by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film {{tells the story of a}} jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: out of 96 minutes of run time, only three minutes take place outside of the <b>jury</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There {{was only}} one black juror, a 26-year-old woman named Gayle Lewis Daniels.

[...] The other jurors ignored her and reported to the judge that they were unanimous. [...] When the jury was polled {{in the presence of the}} court, Daniels was by then too frightened to speak up. [...] The other jurors had told her that she could be convicted of perjury if she continued to hold out, since she had testified, during jury selection, that she could vote for the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|General {{reaction}} to the verdict was one of shock and amazement. [...] In response to public {{reaction to}} the quick verdict, the jury issued a statement saying, [...] "We were present during the entire time of the trial, we heard everything that was said and saw everything that {{was done in the}} courtroom and heard nothing of what was being done and said outside, hence when we had agreed upon a verdict we did not know of anything to keep us in the <b>jury</b> <b>room</b> longer." [...] A misunderstanding of the jury instructions may have also {{played a role in the}} verdict. [...] The jury's understanding of the instructions was that they were required to find all of defendants guilty in order to convict and as they could not agree that all eight were involved they felt required to return a not guilty verdict.|$|E
50|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{original}} interior furnishings from 1871, and all that remains are the masonry bearing walls and cast iron columns. The hall was extensively renovated {{several times in the}} twentieth century. Some traces of old plaster, paint, and wallpaper are visible in some parts however. In the second floor chamber of the northeast pavilion, the wooden framework is also visible from the cove ceiling. When the structure was extended in 1961 it was necessary to remove some of the original cast iron columns, leaving except ten columns in the central pavilion. When a new Court House opened on King Street in 1981, the court rooms, judicial chambers, prisoner holding cells, clerk's office, <b>jury</b> <b>rooms,</b> witness room, and ancillary facilities were moved out of City Hall into this new building.
