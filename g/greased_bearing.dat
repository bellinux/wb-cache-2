40|$|Several {{industrial}} applications require rolling bearings to operate under both high load and oscillating motion. While the oscillating motion {{does not allow}} for EHD regime, the high load applied induces high contact pressures. Even if many works in the literature deal with rotating bearings, few works address high loaded oscillating bearings. The degradation scenario of high loaded oscillating bearings is here analysed step by step for both greased and ungreased bearings.

40|$|Grease {{is one of}} {{the major}} bearing {{components}} and the performance of a <b>grease</b> lubricated <b>bearing</b> is strongly determined by the performance of the grease. This paper describes how grease knowledge is linked to improved rolling bearing performance. First the various performance indicators will be described such as rolling bearing life, sealing performance, bearing friction, <b>bearing</b> noise and <b>grease</b> life. Next, the dominating grease parameters and specifications on these aspects will be given. It will also be shown how re-lubrication will enhance the bearing performance. There is synergy between <b>grease</b> formulation and <b>bearing</b> design. In the last years new generation <b>grease</b> lubricated <b>bearings</b> have been developed where grease technology was used to provide significantly lower friction and longer grease life. This was achieved by developing better greases but also by improving the internal bearing design, which could be done by using modern advancements in understanding the lubrication mechanisms. Finally, an outlook will be given on future developments in lubricating <b>greases</b> for rolling <b>bearings.</b> The various test methods are not described in this paper.

The later 401 was nearly identical mechanically, but with a redesigned exterior, more powerful motor, slightly different eddy current braking speed control and different turntable thrust bearing.

Production of the 301 started in 1953; the 301 was launched in 1954. The 401 was introduced in 1965 and produced until 1976.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} new results {{examining the}} relationship between <b>bearing</b> <b>grease</b> composition and rolling-sliding friction in lubricated contacts. Friction coefficient and lubricating film thickness {{of a series of}} commercially available <b>bearing</b> <b>greases</b> and their bled oils were measured in laboratory tribometers. Test greases were selected to cover a wide spectrum of thickener and base oil types, and base oil viscosities. The trends in measured friction coefficients were analysed in relation to grease composition in an attempt to establish the relative influence of individual grease components on friction. Two distinct operating regions with markedly different friction behaviour are identified for each grease. At relatively high speeds the greases behave approximately as their bled/base oils, while in the low speed region the frictional response is very dependent on their thickener type and properties of the lubricating film. Low viscosity, synthetic base oil seems to offer efficiency advantages in the high speed region regardless of thickener used, while the choice of thickener type is significant under low speed conditions...|$|R

Therefore they have received great attention {{in the field of}} condition monitoring. Different methods are detection and diagnosis of the bearing defects. Among them the commonly used technique is vibration signature analysis. The information obtained from the system vibration can be used for identifying its response subjected to various conditions.

Complete models will also be a valuable tool in the process of providing tailor-made greases for different applications. An understanding of the grease flow dynamics enables prediction of grease distribution for optimum lubrication and for the migration of wear- and contaminant particles. In this paper the potential of combined analytical modelling, flow visualizations, and numerical modelling in grease flow dynamics is presented. Specifically, the relation between the rheology of the grease {{and its impact on the}} flow motion is of interest in combination with validation of the numerical models in simplified geometries. The numerical models then enable simulations in more complex geometries of particular interest for the <b>grease</b> and <b>bearing</b> industry. It is shown that grease flow is heavily influenced by its non-Newtonian properties and the shear rates in the contact, resulting in distinct regions of yielded and un-yielded grease.

Experiments were performed on a test rig under simulated conditions to determine the life and failure mechanism of the <b>grease</b> lubricated <b>bearings</b> that support the input shaft {{of the space shuttle}} body flap actuators.

The Weibull analysis of the test data for a 2 -bearing shaft assembly in each body flap actuator established a reliability level of 99. 6 percent for a life of 12 missions.

40|$|The {{operational}} life of bearings is often {{determined by the}} performance of the lubricating grease. The consistency of the grease prevents it from leaking out of the bearing and provides good sealing properties. The possible ingress of water into the bearing will have a considerable impact not only on this consistency but also on the lubricating ability of the grease. There are numerous applications where water ingress may occur, such as in the steel, food, pulp, and paper industries. Some greases are less sensitive to water than others.
