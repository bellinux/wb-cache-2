40|$|Objectives : The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin on the adipogenesis in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells, lipolysis in rat epididymal adipocytes and histological changes in porcine adipose tissue. Methods : Inhibiton of preadipocyte differentiation and/or stimulation of lipolysis play important roles in reducing obesity. 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes were differentiated with adipogenic reagents by incubating for 3 days in the absence or presence of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract or capsaicin ranging from 0. 01 to 1 ㎎/㎖. The effects of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin on adipogenesis were examined by measuring GPDH activity and by Oil Red O staining. Mature adipocytes from rat epididymal fat pad was incubated with <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract or capsaicin ranging from 0. 01 to 1 ㎎/㎖ for 3 hrs. The effects of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin on lipolysis were examined by measuring free glycerol released. Fat tissue from pig skin was injected with <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract or capsaicinCFP ranging from 0. 1 to 10 ㎎/㎖ to examine the effects of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin on histological changes under light microscopy. Results : The following results were obtained from present study on adipogenesis of preadipocytes, lipolysis of adipocytes and histological changes in fat tissue. 1. <b>Hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin inhibited adipogenic differentiation at the concentration of 0. 1 and 0. 01 ㎎/㎖, respectively, indicating that capsaicin was more effective in inhibiting adipogenesis than <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract. 2. <b>Hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin decreased the activity of glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase(GPDH) at the concentration of 0. 1 and 0. 01 ㎎/㎖, respectively, indicating that capsaicin was more effective in inhibiting adipogenic differentiation than <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract. 3. <b>Hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin increased glycerol release at the concentration of 0. 1 ㎎/㎖. There was no difference in lipolytic activity between <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin at the corresponding concentration. 4. <b>Hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin caused shrinkage of fat cells, resulting in cell death at the concentration of 1. 0 ㎎/㎖, although capsaicin exerted this action over wide area than <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract. Conclusions : These results suggest that <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract and capsaicin efficiently inhibited adipogenesis, increased lipolysis of adipocytes and caused to shrink fat cells. Future studies are needed to make use of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> extract pharmacopuncture for the treatment of obesity...|$|R

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, <b>hot</b> <b>peppers,</b> saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} source-sink {{relationships}} {{on the performance}} of tomato and <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> was investigated in glasshouse experiments by pruning tomato trusses and <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit from plants trained to a single stem. The objectives were to characterize the effect of time, method and intensity of pruning on the yield and quality of tomato and <b>hot</b> <b>pepper.</b> Pruning at anthesis as compared to pruning at fruit-set had little effect on yield and fruit quality of both crops. Yield per truss increased steadily with intensity of pruning in tomato, due to increase in fruit size and fruit number per truss. Thus, total yield was not affected by pruning. In <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit size increased with intensity of pruning but total yield was significantly reduced and total plant dry mass depressed at higher source : sink ratios (two and three fruit pruned {{out of a total of}} six). Occurrence of fruit disorders such as blossom-end rot and fruit cracking increased with increasing source: sink ratio. Pruning of one truss in tomato and one fruit in <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> gave the best fruit quality in terms of fruit size, pericarp thickness and freedom from defects, without decreasing total and marketable yield. Removing a middle truss of tomato (third truss) gave the highest yield as compared to removing the youngest truss (sixth truss) or the oldest truss (first truss). The yield increase (relative to the control) in the remaining individual trusses tended to decrease with increasing distance of the trusses from the pruned truss. In <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> removal of the youngest fruit (sixth fruit) resulted in the highest yield in comparison to removal of the middle fruit (third fruit) and the oldest fruit (first fruit). The quantity of yield increase in the remaining individual fruits had no consistent trend regarding the relative distance of the fruits from the pruned fruit. Two pruning methods were tried on <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> and tomato to compare yield and fruit quality. The first method involved pruning of the first three consecutive trusses of tomato and the first three consecutive fruit of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> out of a total of six. The second method involved pruning of three alternating tomato trusses or <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit. Yield and yield components did not differ significantly for the two methods, but pruning alternate trusses of tomato and fruit of <b>hot</b> <b>pepper</b> reduced occurrence of fruit disorders.

From the remains that have been found, scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated maize, kidney beans, squash, cassava, <b>hot</b> <b>peppers,</b> and cotton plants, the last of which was used to make clothing. Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical, but it became showy, delicate, and big over time.
