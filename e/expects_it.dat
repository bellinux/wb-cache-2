25|$|Non-linear {{differential}} equations are {{formed by the}} products of the unknown function and its derivatives are allowed and its degree is > 1.There are very few methods of solving nonlinear {{differential equations}} exactly; those that are known typically depend on the equation having particular symmetries. Nonlinear differential equations can exhibit very complicated behavior over extended time intervals, characteristic of chaos. Even the fundamental questions of existence, uniqueness, and extendability of solutions for nonlinear differential equations, and well-posedness of initial and boundary value problems for nonlinear PDEs are hard problems and their resolution in special cases {{is considered to be a}} significant advance in the mathematical theory (cf. Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness). However, if the differential equation is a correctly formulated representation of a meaningful physical process, then one <b>expects</b> <b>it</b> to have a solution.|$|E

2500|$|Lev Grossman's New York Times best-seller The Magicians is a {{contemporary}} dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author <b>expects</b> <b>it</b> to be experienced as such. Not {{only is the}} land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock {{in the home of}} an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. [...] Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the [...] "wood between the worlds" [...] from The Magician's Nephew, an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to The Magician's Nephew is echoed in the title of the book.|$|E

2500|$|As of August 2013, the USAF {{believes}} that the LRS-B can reach Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2025. Reportedly, the main risk is funding, {{in light of the}} F-35 Lightning II's acquisition difficulties and a lack of an [...] "urgent threat". Prior bomber programs were hindered by a lack of funding, only 21 B-2 Spirits were produced out of 132 planned and fewer B-1 Lancers were built than were envisioned; both programs were scaled down due to spiraling per aircraft costs. Research funding was allocated, as stealthy technologies to counter anti-access/area-denial threats were spared from budget cuts. The USAF stated the LRS-B is a top priority as it is believed that China will overcome the B-2's low-observable features by the 2020s. Where possible, existing technologies and proven subsystems will be used in order to keep it within budget, instead of developing new and riskier ones. Components such as engines and radars may be off-the-shelf or adaptions of existing models, such as derivative technologies of the F-35. The LRS-B is intended to perform any long range mission, rather than one specialized mission, which drove up the cost of the B-2. The USAF <b>expects</b> <b>it</b> to cost $1 billion each with development costs factored in, and aims for a per-aircraft cost of $550 million, considered reasonable for a limited production run military aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Samantha Jane [...] "Sam" [...] Marquez (Vanessa Marcil) is {{the self-proclaimed}} best casino host in the world. [...] She {{lives in a}} Montecito suite, and is portrayed as a {{ruthless}} businessperson whose sole interest is to get high rollers {{to play at the}} Montecito. [...] However, in the season-four episode, [...] "The Burning Bedouin", she reveals that she is only [...] "cold and jaded because everyone <b>expects</b> <b>it</b> of her", and [...] "underneath it all, she is weak and pathetic like everyone else." [...] She was married to billionaire Casey Manning, from whom she was estranged for seven years prior to divorcing. She is also involved in an on-and-off relationship with Det. Woody Hoyt from Crossing Jordan, which ends officially based on the events from season-four episode, [...] "History of Violins". From [...] "The Burning Bedouin", she is seen to be currently in love with and waiting for Jeremy, who fell into a 20-year coma after falling off a stool at a slot machine; he is the man who first brought her to Las Vegas from Austin, Texas. Following the death of her ex-husband Casey in a freak fishing accident (he is later revealed to have been poisoned), Sam is left control of the casino. She becomes the latest former owner of the Montecito after failing to pay the back taxes owed on the property. Her ownership of the Montecito lasts for a week, when A.J. Cooper buys the Montecito by paying off the back taxes. A.J. fires Sam when she is rude to his ranch manager's son. After Delinda intervenes, Sam and Cooper work things out over a milkshake, bowling, beers, and cigars, and Cooper agrees to rehire Sam. Sam is originally from Texas and enjoys playing bingo. [...] In the season-five finale, Casey Manning's younger brother Vic Manning visits the Montecito to take over the ownership of the casino. At the end of the show, Sam and Vic are said to plan to get married. When asked why Sam wants to marry Vic – she always stated she did not have feelings for him, though he loved her – she says it is because Vic understands her and will not try to change her; plus, he reminds her of Casey.|$|E
