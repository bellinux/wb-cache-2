40|$|An initiation-promotion {{bioassay}} in CD- 1 mice {{was used}} to examine the role of chronic irritation and inflammation in tumor promotion by petroleum middle distillates. A representative hydrodesulfurized middle distillate (API 81 - 07) was selected as the test article. Test groups (54 mice per group) were initiated once with 50 ug of 7, 12 -dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA). Promotion with API 81 - 07 consisted of twice weekly treatments for 25 weeks with either 25 ul, 50 ul, 50 ul + daily treatment with 15 ug dexamethasone, 50 ul + post-application washings, and 100 ul. Three mice from each group were sacrificed at 21 day intervals (24 total per group). The skin from interim sacrificed (IS) mice was examined histopathologically for tumor, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, pseudo-epitheliomatous hyperplasia, epidermal crusting, and subacute inflammation. <b>In-life</b> <b>observations</b> included examination of all mice for erythema and edema for 8 weeks following the first promotion treatment.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionRecombinant factor IX Fc {{fusion protein}} (rFIXFc) is a {{recombinant}} coagulation factor {{composed of a}} single molecule of recombinant factor IX (rFIX) covalently fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1) with no intervening sequence. An extensive nonclinical program was performed to support the clinical development of rFIXFc for treatment of people with hemophilia B. Materials and MethodsRepeat-dose toxicology studies of rFIXFc were performed in 2 relevant species: Sprague Dawley rats (4 -week study) and cynomolgus monkeys (5 - and 27 -week studies). Assessments included <b>in-life</b> <b>observations,</b> electrocardiograms (monkeys only), laboratory evaluations (including hematology and blood chemistry), postmortem analyses, local tolerance, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Allometric scaling was performed with PK data from multiple species, including humans. Local tolerance (single-dose study) and thrombogenic potential (Wessler stasis model) of rFIXFc were tested in New Zealand White rabbits. ResultsThere were no significant local or systemic toxicity findings in the repeat-dose studies. Allometric scaling data suggested that animal rFIXFc PK results are predictive of human PK parameters. There were no findings from the local tolerance study in rabbits; thrombogenic activity was less than that elicited by rFIX and a prothrombin complex concentrate, and similar to vehicle control. ConclusionsrFIXFc was well tolerated in toxicology studies and demonstrated a low thrombogenic potential. These {{results are consistent with}} phase 1 / 2 a and phase 3 clinical studies of rFIXFc in people with hemophilia B...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionRecombinant factor VIII Fc {{fusion protein}} (rFVIIIFc) {{is a novel}} {{recombinant}} factor VIII with a prolonged half-life, developed {{for the treatment of}} hemophilia A. Studies that evaluated the toxicological effects of rFVIIIFc in 2 pharmacologically relevant species, cynomolgus monkeys and Sprague Dawley rats, are reported here. Materials and MethodsIn repeat-dose toxicology studies, rats and monkeys received 0, 50, 250, or 1000 IU/kg rFVIIIFc every other day for 4 weeks. In a high-dose tolerance study, monkeys received 1 rFVIIIFc dose of 3000, 10, 000, or 20, 000 IU/kg. Evaluations included <b>in-life</b> <b>observations,</b> laboratory and post-mortem evaluations, pharmacokinetics, and local tolerance. Allometric scaling, using data from 4 animal species and humans, was used to evaluate the relationship between animal and human pharmacokinetics. ResultsrFVIIIFc was well tolerated with no adverse toxicological findings directly attributable to rFVIIIFc. As expected, antibodies to this fully human protein developed in rats and monkeys in a time-dependent fashion following repeated dosing, leading to increased clearance in both species. There were no local reactions (infusion site) or evidence of thrombosis at high doses in rats and monkeys. Allometric scaling demonstrated more rapid clearance in small animals compared with humans and a volume of distribution (steady state) proportional to body weight across species, suggesting that animal pharmacokinetics are predictive of human pharmacokinetics. ConclusionsRepeated doses of rFVIIIFc in 2 relevant animal species and high doses of rFVIIIFc in monkeys were well tolerated. These results supported the clinical safety of rFVIIIFc observed in phase 1 / 2 a and phase 3 clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Genome {{maintenance}} {{is considered a}} prime longevity assurance mechanism as apparent from many progeroid human syndromes that are caused by genome maintenance defects. The ERCC 1 protein is involved in three genome maintenance systems: nucleotide excision repair, interstrand cross-link repair, and homologous recombination. Here we describe <b>in-life</b> and post-mortem <b>observations</b> for a hypomorphic Ercc 1 variant, Ercc 1 &#x 2212;/&#x 0394; 7, which is hemizygous for a single truncated Ercc 1 allele, encoding a protein lacking the last seven amino acids. Ercc 1 &#x 2212;/&#x 0394; 7 mice were much smaller and median life span was markedly reduced compared to wild-type siblings: 20 and 118 weeks, respectively. Multiple {{signs and symptoms of}} aging were found to occur at an accelerated rate in the Ercc 1 &#x 2212;/&#x 0394; 7 mice as compared to wild-type controls, including a decline in weight of both whole body and various organs, numerous histopathological lesions, and immune parameters.

40|$|The identification, recording, and {{interpretation}} of nasal lesions can be a difficult task in toxicology studies. The objective {{of this article is}} to provide some guidelines for approaches to nasal toxicologic pathology, based on the authorâ€™s experience and information available in the published literature. Identification of treatment-induced nasal lesions requires adequate <b>in-life</b> and post-mortem <b>observation,</b> and thorough his-topathology. Histopathologic assessment is dependent upon high quality and consistent histologic prepara-tions, adequate knowledge of nasal anatomy and histology, and experience with the range of aging, background, and treatment-induced lesions that may be encountered. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the number of articles reporting nasal pathology in studies for which materials were delivered by inhalation and by non-inhalation routes. Because of the increasing size of this database, it is recommended that stan-dardized and systematic nomenclature be developed for these changes. The following points are considered to be particularly important: 1) alert animal care staff to clinical changes that may indicate nasal lesions; 2) screen animals for nasal disease, such as nasal nematodes in non-human primates; 3) record gross lesions during trimming of decalcified nasal tissues; 4) save spare tissue in fixative; 5) remember that the normal bilateral symmetry of the nose can be a valuable diagnostic aid; 6) avoid excessive lumping or splitting of diagnoses; 7) develop a logical order for recording of lesions (the approach preferred by the author i...|$|R
40|$|Neonatologists prefer {{non-invasive}} ventilation {{methods for}} pre-term neonates, who often require surfactant treatment. Therefore, a technology for non-invasive surfactant administration {{would be highly}} appreciated. We have developed a Continuous Powder Aerosolization (CPA) system for the generation of a humidified recombinant surfactant protein-C (rSP-C) surfactant aerosol for non-invasive administration to pre-term neonates via bi-nasal prongs. Before conducting clinical trials, safety testing in an adequate pre-clinical animal model is necessary. In contrast to existing pre-term lamb models, this model should use non-intubated animals to include upper airways for safety testing. Pre-term animals should have already a sufficient respiratory drive to breathe spontaneously on non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support, but their lungs should still be pre-mature to be comparable with the clinical situation {{for the treatment of}} pre-term infants. The aim of this feasibility study was therefore to establish a CPAP-stable, non-intubated pre-term lamb model for the investigation of safety, efficacy, and pulmonary deposition of a humidified rSP-C surfactant aerosol. For this purpose, 19 pre-term lambs with a gestational age of 135 - 137 days (term: about 144 days) were delivered via Caesarean section. Four animals died before start of treatment, while the remaining animals were treated via customized bi-nasal prongs with rSP-C surfactant aerosol or humidified air as vehicle control. To determine pulmonary deposition, selected animals received rSP-C surfactant labelled with samarium oxide as non-radioactive tracer. Treatment was started at 30 min of age and was continued for 1 or 2. 5 h. Investigations during the <b>in-life</b> phase included <b>observation</b> of clinical signs, haematology, blood gas analysis, and determination of minute volume. At 3 h of age, animals were euthanized and organs removed for histopathology investigation or for determination of pulmonary deposition. Administration of humidified, aerosolized rSP-C surfactant was well tolerated, and histopathology investigation of upper airways and lungs revealed no aerosol-related changes. Mean body weight-corrected pulmonary deposition of rSP-C surfactant ranged from 1. 7 to 7. 7 mg/kg depending on the duration of treatment and aerosolization parameters used. A trend towards reduced spontaneous minute volumes indicating reduced breathing efforts and towards reduced lung weights indicating less fluid in the lungs of surfactant-treated animals compared to animals of the vehicle control group could be seen. Taken together, a CPAP-stable, non-intubated pre-term lamb model was successfully established and the parameters for the investigation of safety, efficacy, and pulmonary deposition of aerosolized rSP-C surfactant for the subsequent main study were identified...|$|R
40|$|Background. This study {{investigated}} behavioral recovery in rats following implanting increasing doses of CTX 0 E 03 cells into the putamen ipsilateral to the stroke damage. Postmortem histological analysis investigated possible mechanisms of behavioral recovery. Methods. At 4 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), rats {{were treated with}} 4500, 45 000, or 450 000 CTX 0 E 03 cells or vehicle implanted into the putamen with testing on a battery of tasks preocclusion and postocclusion. Histological examination of brains included assessment of lesion volumes, implant cell survival and differentiation, changes to host brain matrix, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis using immunohis-tochemical methods. Results. Statistically significant dose-related recovery in sensorimotor function deficits (bilateral asymmetry test [BAT; P <. 0002] in the mid- and high-dose groups and rotameter test after amphetamine exposure [P <. 05] in the high-dose group) {{was found in the}} CTX 0 E 03 cell implanted groups compared to the vehicle group. In-life functional improvements correlated with cell dose, though did not correlate with survival of CTX 0 E 03 cells measured at postmortem. Surviving CTX 0 E 03 cells differentiated into oligodendroglial and endothelial phenotypes. MCAO-induced reduction of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) was partially restored to that observed in sham operated controls. No adverse CTX 0 E 03 cell-related effects were observed during <b>in-life</b> <b>observations</b> or on tissue histology. Conclusions. This study found that the implantation of CTX 0 E 03 human neural stem cells in rats after MCAO stroke promoted significant behavioral recovery depending on cell dose. The authors propose a paracrine trophic mechanism, which is triggered early after CTX 0 E 0...|$|E
