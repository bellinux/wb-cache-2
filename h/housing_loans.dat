40|$|The {{increasing}} {{of housing}} needs in Indonesia {{result in the}} increasing of housing demand. However, both goverment and private sectors still can not provide affordable house. One of goverment policy to incerease the purchasing power of housing is by generates subsidizies fund for <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> called Fasilitas Likuiditas Pembiayaan Perumahan. This fund aims to create affordable <b>housing</b> <b>loan.</b> Furthermore, banking sector which has important role in distribution of housing fund faces some problems to raise the <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> distribution. This condition caused by some macroecomonic {{factors such as the}} rate of inflation and fluctuation of Indonesia exchange rate called rupiah. Moreover, interest rates as one of government financial policies also influence the level of <b>housing</b> <b>loan.</b> Therefore, this research purposes to analyze both macroeconomics and financial policy factors that affect the level of <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> distribution. Besides, this research also uses multiple regressions and multiple correlations to analysis the influence of macroeconomics and financial policy factors. The multiple regressions and multiple correlations show that interest rate, inflation rate, and fluctuation of exchange rate have influence to the <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> level of distribution. The interest rate has significant influence and correlation to the <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> level distribution. Nevertheless, the fluctuation of Indonesia exchange rate has low correlation and influence to the <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> level of distribution.

25|$|The Great Depression wrought {{havoc on}} the U.S. housing market. By 1933, an {{estimated}} 20 to 25% of the nation's outstanding mortgage debt was in default. Fannie Mae was established in 1938 by amendments to the National Housing Act as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Originally chartered as the National Mortgage Association of Washington, the organization's explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home mortgages {{in an attempt to}} raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing. Fannie Mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more <b>housing</b> <b>loans,</b> primarily by buying Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages. For the first thirty years following its inception, Fannie Mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market. Other considerations may have motivated the New Deal focus on the housing market: {{about a third of the}} nation's unemployed were in the building trade, and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build.|$|E

40|$|Background [...] It {{is unknown}} how socio-demographic {{variables}} impact on access to <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> schemes among the older persons in Nigeria. This has become essential {{in order to}} improve the preparation for old age among Nigerians. Reliable information is also required to formulate comprehensive social security system for the elderly. Quantitative data was collected through individual-based questionnaire. Multi-stage sampling procedure was employed to select local government areas, enumeration areas and individuals for the study. In all, 810 respondents were interviewed. Family size, type of family, education and living arrangement are significantly related to access to <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> scheme. In the male model, with the exception of family size and religion, all the characteristics are insignificantly associated with access to <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> scheme. In this model, while those with 1 - 3 children are 1. 7 times more likely, those with more than 6 children are 22 percent less likely to have benefited from <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> scheme than those with 4 - 6 children. With respect to religion, those who are traditionalists are 65 percent less likely to have benefited from <b>housing</b> <b>loan</b> scheme than the Muslims. The idea that old-age security and well being in Nigeria should remain the primary responsibility of the family is untenable.
