40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of a non-narcotic, {{centrally}} acting antitussive, <b>fominoben</b> (PB 89), on hypoxia in sixty patients suffering from chronic obstructive lung diseases (COLD), utilizing a double-blind method and using the antitussive dextromethorphan as a reference drug. By the oral administration of a dose of 2 <b>fominoben</b> tablets (160 mg) three times a day for 2 weeks, a significant increase in arterial O! pressure (PaO), a decrease in arterial CO! pressure (PaCO!), and a rise in pH were observed. However, alveolar-arterial O! difference (A-aDO!) was not improved. On the other hand, after administration of a dose of 2 dextromethorphan tablets (30 mg) three times a day for 2 weeks, no increase in PaD!, no decrease in PaCO! and no improvement in A-aDO! were observed, although a rise in pH was seen. The increase in PaO! by <b>fominoben</b> was marked in COLD with dyspnoea. No improvement ofA-aDO] despite a decrease in PaCO! suggests that <b>fominoben</b> might increase alveolar ventilation, in spite of its effect as an antitussive, exerting a favourable effect on hypoxia. It is, therefore, speculated that the cough centre and the respiratory centre are capable of functioning independently ofeach other...|$|E
40|$|Binding of {{dextromethorphan}} (DM) to {{guinea pig}} brain is stereoselective, since levome-thorphan is 20 times weaker than DM in competing for DM sites. In general, opiate agonists and antagonists {{as well as}} their corresponding dextrorotatory isomers are weak competitors for tritiated dextromethorphan ([3 H]DM) binding sites and display ICo values in the micromolar range. In contrast, several non-narcotic, centrally acting anti-tussives are inhibitory in the nanomolar range (ICw values for caramiphen, carbetapen-tane, dimethoxanate, and pipazethate are 25 nM, 9 nii, 41 imi, and 190 n. si, respectively). Other antitussives, such as levopropoxyphene, chiophedianol, and <b>fominoben,</b> have poor affinity for DM sites whereas the antitussive noscapine enhances DM binding by increas-ing the affinity of DM for its central binding sites. Additional competition studies indicate that there is no correlation of DM binding with any of the known or putative neurotrans-mitters in the central nervous system. DM binding is also not related to tricycic antidepressant binding sites or biogenic amine uptake sites. However, certain phenothi-azine neuroleptics and typical and atypical antidepressants inhibit binding with ICo values in the nanomolar range. Moreover, the anticonvulsant drug diphenythydantoin enhances DM binding {{in a manner similar to}} that of noscapine. Preliminary experiments utilizing acid extracts of brain have not demonstrated the presence of an endogenous ligand for DM sites. The binding characteristics of DM sites studied in rat and mouse brain indicate that the relative potencies of several antitussives to inhibit specific DM binding vary according to species. High-affinity, saturable, and stereoselective [3 H]DM binding sites are present in liver homogenates, but several differences have been found for these peripheral binding sites and those described for brain. Although the nature of central DM binding sites is not known, the potent interaction of several classes of centrally acting antitussives with DM sites suggests that they may be related to the mechanism of action of this drug...|$|E
