5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart <b>is</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E

5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy <b>is</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
