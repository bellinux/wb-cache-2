40|$|The within-tree {{variability}} of drying properties, including {{the green and}} <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents,</b> the basic density, and the diffusion coefficient, has been investigated for regrowth blackbutt timber (Eucalyptus pilularis Sm). Timber boards from two regrowth trees were taken from Northern New South Wales in Australia, and dried in a lab scale kiln. The pattern of variation within the two trees was similar, such that the diffusion coefficient was strongly correlated with the initial <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and basic density. Principal components analysis suggested that the timber boards with low basic densities and high initial <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> had higher diffusion coefficients. A potential reason is {{that if there is}} less wood material per unit volume, then this leaves more space for water to occupy, and there is also less resistance for the diffusive transport of moisture. In addition, this suggested correlation was also evident in the analysis of variance (ANOVA). A simulation study, using the timber data measured from the experiments in this paper, was also conducted to estimate how different hardwood drying schedules are likely to affect the distribution of the <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents,</b> and the time taken to reach an average stack <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 0. 15 kg/ kg. A revised version of the drying schedule used for the experiments in this paper, i. e. adding 5 ºC to the dry and wet-bulb temperatures, has been predicted to be a better drying schedule out of the four drying schedules studied, due to it drying the timber quicker as well as having a small dispersion of <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{recorded}} {{decrease in}} <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> {{can be compared}} to the values represented by the points A and B on the steady-state boundary curves depicted in Fig.  16. Sorption experiments were performed for the construction of these boundary curves and for the calibration of the depicted desorption scanning curve. The adsorption boundary curve provides an equilibrium <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 8.9 % at a relative humidity of 60 %, see point A in Fig.  16, which lies somewhat above the range of initial <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> measured in the panels, see Fig.  17. Upon lowering the relative humidity towards 20 %, the <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> in Fig.  16 smoothly decreases along the desorption scanning curve towards an equilibrium <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 5.1 % on the desorption boundary curve, as indicated by point B in Fig.  16. It can be observed that this value lies approximately a factor of 1.5 below the range of <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> recorded in the panels, see Fig.  17. The almost horizontal slopes observed {{at the end of the}} curves in Fig.  17 nevertheless suggest that these <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> closely correspond to a steady state of hygroscopic equilibrium. The difference of a factor of 1.5 in equilibrium <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> may be due to the reliability of the moisture sensors: unfortunately some inaccuracies caused by signal interference, signal instability and the influence of the electric current on the measured <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> did appear during the testing procedure.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{performance}} problems with hardboard siding in southern Florida, the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed a local standard requiring prefinishing of siding and priming of all siding surfaces, including the back. However, {{the effectiveness of}} these practices was questioned. To determine if back-priming or factory finishing improves durability and performance of hardboard siding, we installed factory-finished and factory-primed siding on two buildings in southern Florida. The buildings were identical except that one had gutters and no overhangs and the other had overhangs and no gutters. Half the siding was back-primed and half was not. <b>Moisture</b> <b>content,</b> temperature, and air pressure difference across the siding were continuously monitored for 2 years. Condition and thickness of siding boards were recorded every 3 months. After removal from the buildings, siding was inspected and <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were determined. The siding was in excellent condition after about 2 years of outside exposure. There was no evidence that back-priming the siding reduced its in-service <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Whether the siding was from the overhang building or the guttered building did not seem to make a difference, but inspection of the windows and <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> of the trim strongly suggested that overhangs provided additional protection on the gable ends (gutters were only present on the sidewalls) ...|$|R
50|$|Moisture {{content in}} grain {{is related to}} the {{relative}} humidity and the temperature of the surrounding air. Equilibrium moisture content point is the point when grain no longer losing or gaining water when contacting with drying air. The <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of the grain is up to the amount of moisture in the drying air, which is the relative humidity. The low relative humidity means air is dry and it has a large potential of picking up water. The lower the relative humidity is, the drier the air is. In general, one-half reduce in relative humidity is caused by 20° degree increase in air temperature.|$|E
50|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of tonnes of wheat, corn, soybean, rice and other grains as sorghum, sunflower seeds, rapeseed/canola, barley, oats, etc., are dried in grain dryers. In the main agricultural countries, drying comprises the reduction of moisture from about 17-30%w/w to values between 8 and 15%w/w, depending on the grain. The <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> for drying must be adequate for storage. The more oil the grain has, the lower its storage moisture content will be (though its initial moisture for drying will also be lower). Cereals are often dried to 14% w/w, while oilseeds, to 12.5% (soybeans), 8% (sunflower) and 9% (peanuts). Drying is carried out as a requisite for safe storage, in order to inhibit microbial growth. However, low temperatures in storage are also highly recommended to avoid degradative reactions and, especially, the growth of insects and mites. A good maximum storage temperature is about 18 °C.|$|E
50|$|Although {{granular}} cheese can {{be created}} using any method that achieves the designated standard for physical and chemical properties, there is one method that is generally used. First, the milk or cream may be warmed and treated with hydrogen peroxide and catalase, producing water and oxygen gas. Then, a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture is added, and the product is treated with clotting enzymes to form a semisolid mass. This mass is cut, stirred, and heated to separate the curd and the whey. Increasing {{the amount of time}} between cutting and heating will increase both the <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and the milkfat content of the cheese, thereby increasing the yield. There follows an alternating cycle of draining of the whey and stirring. After most of the whey has been drained, the curd is salted, drained, and pressed into the desired form. The remaining product may be cured if the original dairy products were not pasteurized. A common method of curing is to dry the cheese on racks for about a week, then to wax it and place it in coolers until the time of consumption.|$|E

40|$|Drying yellow-dent {{field corn}} from harvest {{moisture}} levels to safe storage levels {{is a major}} cost for producers. This cost can be minimized by precise control of the <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> through feed-forward or feedback control. One of the difficulties in achieving control of corn drying is the inaccuracy of dielectric moisture measurements due to non-uniform moisture distributions within kernels after drying. After dried grain has equilibrated for several hours, moisture measurements are somewhat different than immediately after drying. This research examined these effects for yellow-dent field corn over a range of measurement frequencies and drying conditions. Prediction equations relating dielectric constant to moisture content were developed {{for a range of}} radio frequencies. The differences between predicted moisture values for recently dried and equilibrated corn were found to be dependent on the measurement frequency and the <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of the grain. For some conditions, particularly for low measurement frequencies and high final moisture contents, predicted moisture contents increased after equilibration.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe {{impact of}} the {{variability}} in timber properties has been a challenge for companies involved in drying timber, which have to handle these variations {{and at the same}} time meet the requirements stated in the Australian/New Zealand Standard for the assessment of dried timber quality (2001). The definition of quality considered in this study is to both minimize the dispersion of the <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> in dried timber boards, and to reduce cracking/checking. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the timber properties of plantation timber appear to be more variable compared with the properties of old growth or regrowth timber. Therefore, this thesis focuses on measuring the amount of variability of timber properties by conducting drying experiments using timber boards taken from different locations within a single tree and between trees, for regrowth and plantation blackbutt timber (Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.). The quantified variabilities were then used to develop optimized timber drying schedules that are intended to dry regrowth and plantation blackbutt boards as quickly as possible (highest productivity) without cracking (quality loss) in the presence of large biological variability. Blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis Sm.) was the chosen species for this thesis because of its abundance in New South Wales. It is considered to be one of the most important eucalypts for planting in NSW. It has superior growth and high survival rates compared with other eucalyptus species, and the timber is marketable. Lastly, conventional kiln drying was considered in this thesis compared with other drying methods such as air drying and solar kilns due to (arguably) better control of the drying conditions and faster throughput in conventional drying. The higher costs of conventional kiln drying are compensated, relative to open—air drying, by the reduction in stock level and faster turnaround of green to dried timber. Firstly, an overview of previous work on the development and evaluation of different drying schedules was given. Previous work either developed optimized drying schedules to minimize the dispersion of the <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents,</b> or reduced cracking/checking. No schedule has been developed to satisfy both aspects of quality. In addition, only one report has taken into consideration biological variability in the development of an optimized drying schedule, but this approach has not been tested experimentally. In addition, the information on the variability of biological parameters was very limited, was assumed to be normally distributed, and the parameters were assumed to be uncorrelated with one another. There is little information about the variability in timber properties with respect to drying, including how strongly they are correlated. This thesis has particularly addressed this aspect of the problem. Drying experiments using conventional kiln drying were conducted. The properties of two regrowth blackbutt logs (36 boards) and two plantation blackbutt logs (24 boards), have been measured and analysed for the within—tree variation of timber properties. In a separate set of experiments, two boards were taken from each log, from a total of 12 regrowth logs and 10 plantation logs, to study the between—tree variability of the timber properties of blackbutt timber. The timber properties measured consisted of the basic density, the initial <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> the diffusion coefficient, the failure strain, the failure stress, the modulus of elasticity and the shrinkage. The amount of cracking or checking and the dispersion of <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were assessed. 90...|$|R

A range of veneer thicknesses, platen temperatures and <b>final</b> dry <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were examined. Thicknesses included were nominal 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 inches; platen temperatures were 325, 375, 425 and 460 °F. Drying of both sapwood and heartwood was carried out to <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> of either one, five or nine percent. Gluebond quality was evaluated using shear strength and percentage wood failure as criteria. Three aging methods were employed: none, vacuum-pressure soaking and cyclic boiling. The effective limit on subsequent gluability of platen-dried veneers {{was found to be}} a function of both platen temperature and drying time. Thin veneers (0. 1 and 0. 2 inch) typical of commercial plywood operations were most gluable after drying at the lowest platen temperature examined, 325 °F. However, 0. 4 inch thick veneers were best dried at a high platen temperature, 460 °F, and had laminate shear strengths equivalent to thin veneer panels. Shear strength after vacuum-pressure aging appeared to be the best method of performance evaluation of parallel-laminated platen-dried veneers. Percentage wood failure was uniformly high for all veneer thicknesses and platen temperatures. Shear strength was only moderately predictable empirically; platen temperature and temperature x drying time were the most important influences on subsequent mechanical capacity. Drying times to five percent <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> varied from less than one minute for 0. 1 inch veneer at 460 °F to approximately 20 minutes for 0. 4 inch sapwood veneer dried at 325 °F.

Experimental data on radio-frequency drying of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) beams without pith were used to present a data evaluation method for the length of internal checks of kiln-dried lumber based on a hierarchical model. Occurrence of the internal check phenomenon was determined with the underlying data-generating process, and the length of internal checks was modeled in relation to heating temperature, initial moisture content, <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> and basic density. The diagnosis of the posterior model parameters revealed that heating temperature, initial moisture content, and basic density have a positive influence on the occurrence of internal checks, while <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> has a negative influence. A comparison between the developed hierarchical model and conventional statistical analysis used in research on lumber drying showed that a much more detailed analysis of internal check length could be performed by the hierarchical model.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. After harvest, most {{rough rice}} {{research}} samples are dried using ambient air, {{the temperature and}} relative humidity of which oscillates. Fluctuations in environmental conditions produce variation in the <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> (MCs) of samples, yielding inconsistent functional properties. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop an alternative method for drying small rough rice samples using silica gel that would be capable of yielding accurate and precise final MCs while maintaining grain quality. Drying experiments incorporated a combination of 1 ‐ and 5 ‐g moisture‐permeable packets of silica gel, mixed with rough rice samples in plastic bags. The average adsorptive capacity of the packets in closed rough rice samples was established as 25 % to 27 % (i. e., 0. 25 ‐ to 0. 27 ‐g water / 1 ‐g silica gel). A desired final MC (12. 5 %) was achieved for silica‐gel‐dried rice samples within four to five days, and the milling quality of samples dried to 12. 5 % MC, expressed as head rice yield, was not significantly different from that of control‐dried samples...|$|R
40|$|Solar dryers are {{imperative}} for the tropical and sub-Saharan African countries, which {{are faced with}} the duo challenges of inadequate electrical energy supply, which has severely limited the application of conventional refrigeration as a means of preservation of agricultural produce, and the need to make produce competitive in the international market. In this study, a cost-effective natural convection solar dryer was developed; the thermal and drying analyses were done and tested to obtain some performance evaluation parameters for the system in order to examine its efficiency and effectiveness by drying some plantain fillets. The collector and system efficiencies are found to be 46. 4 % and 78. 73 %, respectively, while a percentage moisture removal of 77. 5 % was achieved at the 20 th hour in order to give <b>final</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> of 15. 75 % in the product, which still maintained its integrity.

40|$|Abstract Clove {{is one of}} {{the major}} state crops in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. In 2 ll total planted area in this region reached about 44, 0 U 0 hectares. Although drying is a crucial step, {{information}} concenring the drying behaviors of clove is limited. This research was designed to understand such behaviors, especially when drying air flow rates were varied under a constant drying teryerature. This study was conducted from October 2012 to January 2013. Sanples used weri mature green-cloves, obtained from Sinjai Regency - South Sulawesi. The initial <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> ofthese samples were about 7 |Yo-wb (wet basis). Three levels of drying air velocity (0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 m/s) were applied under a constant drying tenrperature of 45 "C. About 25 g sample arranged in a single layer was used for every drying run. The experiment was caried out using a ttay dryer, Model EH-TD- 300 Eunha Fluid Science. A digital balance was used to weigh the sample at every hour elapsed drying time. The drying process was terminated when the weight reduction had reached about 0. 03 g. It took abnltfi. 26, 24, arfi, 2 O hours to reach such reduction for drying air velocities of 0. 5, l.
