5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Doria are {{traced back to}} an area of {{disturbed}} weather off the northeastern coast of Florida on September 4. For several days, the low pressure system meandered as its central barometric pressure gradually fell. The storm is estimated to <b>have</b> <b>organized</b> into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 8. At the time, it was situated north of Grand Bahama Island. Drifting westward, the cyclone attained tropical storm intensity early the next day. Doria turned northeastward and accelerated as it moved away from Florida. On September 10, the tropical storm achieved hurricane force. Cold air became entrained into the hurricane's circulation by September 11, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm. However, its forward motion slowed and it once again strengthened.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Krovanh {{can be traced}} back to an area of {{persistent}} convection well east of Chuuk State on August13. Over the course of the day the disturbance gradually consolidated within favorable atmospheric conditions, and at 1800UTC that day the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) assessed the system to <b>have</b> <b>organized</b> sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression. Shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper-level low for much of the storm's early existence; however, at 0600UTC on August15, the system was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) as a tropical depression. The depression tracked northwestward under the influence of a nearby ridge. Strengthening and development of the tropical cyclone was very minimal over the next few days, and on August18, both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring the system due to the lack of an identifiable low-level circulation center.|$|E

5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder <b>have</b> <b>organized</b> several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E
