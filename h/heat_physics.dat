Then it gives a concise summary of the main conclusions drawn from recent experiments that were either focusing on studying RF <b>heating</b> <b>physics</b> aspects or that were adopting RF heating as a tool to study plasma behavior. Depending on the minority concentration chosen, different physical phenomena are observed. At very low concentration (X[He- 3] > 10 % electron mode conversion damping becomes dominant. Evidence for the Fuchs et al standing wave effect (Fuchs et al 1995 Phys. Plasmas 2 1637 - 47) on the absorption is presented. RF induced deuterium tails were observed in mode conversion experiments with large X[He- 3] (approximate to 18 %). As tentative modeling shows, the formation of these tails can be explained as a consequence of wave power absorption by neutral beam particles that efficiently interact with the waves well away from the cold D cyclotron resonance position {{as a result of their}} substantial Doppler shift. As both ion and electron RF power deposition profiles in (He- 3) -D plasmas are fairly narrow-giving rise to localized heat sources-the RF heating method is an ideal tool for performing transport studies. Various of the experiments discussed here were done in plasmas with internal transport barriers (ITBs).
