40|$|This study {{examined}} the concept of organizational uncertainty and the involvement of public relations practitioners. Understanding organizational uncertainty is imperative {{to the success of}} an organization, but the effects of uncertainty have been relatively undertheorized within public relations. To close the gap, this study blended multidisciplinary theories pertaining to uncertainty with a triangulated methodological approach. First, this study took a macro-organizational look at uncertainty by analyzing trends in the literature and conducting qualitative in-depth interviews with members of management and employees in an organization. The results of this portion of the study found uncertainty to be multi-layered and the most common causes of uncertainty to be organizational changes, unclear policies, <b>job</b> <b>insecurities,</b> and the external environment. This data was then used to conduct a micro-organizational analysis of uncertainty. Therefore, the second step of this study expanded on the organizational findings to look at the role of public relations in uncertainty management. Through this study, a valuable survey instrument was created containing five significant factors of: <b>job</b> <b>insecurities,</b> the external environment, organization uncertainty, practitioner perceived involvement, and practitioner feelings. It was administered, primarily through use of the Internet, to members of the Public Relations Society of America (N= 1, 135), yielding a response rate of 31. 8 percent. The results of this study indicated that public relations practitioners do not perceive four main causes of uncertainty, but instead they perceive two: <b>job</b> <b>insecurities</b> and the external environment. The results also suggest that public relations practitioners personally have low feelings of uncertainty, although they believed their organizations have moderate levels of uncertainty. Additionally, this study found that practitioners reported being moderately involved in the management of uncertainty, with the level of involvement most influenced by <b>job</b> <b>insecurities.</b> Finally, the results found that public relations practitioners most frequently used electronic communication to help employees cope with organizational uncertainty pertaining to organizational change, policies, and the external environment. However, with <b>job</b> <b>insecurities,</b> interpersonal communication was the most popular communication strategy. Overall, {{the results of this study}} bring us a step closer in establishing a framework for public relations practitioner involvement in the management of organizational uncertainty...|$|R

25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of <b>job</b> <b>insecurity,</b> Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

40|$|We use {{register}} {{data for}} Denmark (IDA) {{merged with the}} Danish Work Environment Cohort Survey (1995 - 2000 - 2005) to estimate the effect of employment insecurity on health for a sample of Danish employees. We consider two health measures from the SF- 36 Health Survey Instrument: a vitality scale for general wellbeing and a mental health scale. We use three dimensions of perceived employment insecurity: the fear of job loss (<b>job</b> tenure <b>insecurity),</b> of being transferred against will (<b>job</b> status <b>insecurity)</b> and of not finding another job if the current one is lost (employability insecurity). The nature of the dataset enables us to account for both individual and firm fixed. Results show that, overall, employment insecurity matters for both health measures. All the three insecurity dimensions increase psychological distress of workers, while general wellbeing is negatively affected mostly by employability prospects. We also exploit within country variability in employment protection rules by tenure and between blue and white collars to analyse differences in the health effect of our insecurity measures over these dimensions. We find substantial heterogeneity by tenure (attenuated effects by increasing tenure especially for <b>job</b> tenure <b>insecurity)</b> and occupation (white collars are worse off in their health gradient compared to blue collars) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{insecurity}} {{about four}} types of involuntary work transition. These are labeled here domain <b>insecurities</b> and include <b>job</b> facet <b>insecurity,</b> <b>job</b> loss <b>insecurity,</b> occupation insecurity and employment insecurity. The primary purpose was to distinguish the insecurities conceptually and demonstrate their independence empirically. The domain insecurities were defined and their features identified from a review of literature on various work attitudes. Viable cognitive and affective measures of insecurity were suggested from the conceptual discussion. Data were collected through a self-report questionnaire distributed using a snowball methodology. Validation of the proposed insecurity measures against reliable correlates of insecurity (pessimism and anxiety) supported operationalizing insecurity by affect alone. Correlation analysis clearly distinguished the domain insecurities. The secondary purpose of the thesis was to explore the content and nomological network of the domain insecurities. To this end, key features of the domain insecurities were scrutinized. This analysis particularly set employment insecurity apart from the other insecurities. Data were collected on antecedents and coping with the insecurities. Multiple regression analysis using a repeated-measures design yielded common antecedents of the four insecurities. A significant interaction emerged between age and domain, reflecting different occupational and employment concerns across age groups. Factor analysis with varimax rotation of the coping checklist developed for this thesis supported the formation of four coping scales: palliation, job search, self-development through education, and withdrawal. Multiple regression analysis using a repeated-measures design revealed that people cope with all insecurities through palliation, withdrawal and self-development activities.

2500|$|Job stress {{results from}} various {{interactions}} {{of the worker}} and {{the environment of the}} work they perform their duties. [...] Location, gender, environment, and many other factors contribute to the buildup of stress. [...] Job stress results from the interaction of the worker and the conditions of work. Views differ on the importance of worker characteristics versus working conditions as the primary cause of job stress. The differing viewpoints suggest different ways to prevent stress at work. Differences in individual characteristics such as personality and coping skills can be very important in predicting whether certain job conditions will result in stress. [...] In other words, what is stressful for one person may not be a problem for someone else. This viewpoint underlies prevention strategies that focus on workers and ways to help them cope with demanding job conditions. In general, occupational stress is caused by a mismatch between perceived effort and perceived reward, and/or a sense of low control in a job with high demands. Low social support at work and <b>job</b> <b>insecurity</b> can also increase occupational stress. Psychosocial stressors are a major cause of occupational stress.|$|E

Methodology: The research is qualitative and covers both, the managerial and employees’ approach through application of Herzberg (1966) motivational theory to assess certain changes in employees’ motivation level during the Post-Merger phase. Primary data is sourced from face to face interviews of respondents and narrated in empirical findings. Analysis and conclusion are derived {{on the basis of}} the State of Art theories. Conclusion: Merger affects the employees’ motivations by ignoring their motivational factors, communication and information sharing management. Managerial role is important to answer the employees’ <b>job</b> <b>insecurities</b> and maintain the level of their motivation effectively. Optimum employees-organization relationship can be secured through effective information and communication management for the success of corporate objectives and employees’ satisfaction.

According to the WHO, employment and working conditions greatly affect health equity (Kivimaki et al., 2003). [...] This occurs because poor employment conditions exposes individuals to health hazards, which {{are more likely}} for low-status jobs. Evidence confirms that high job demand, low control, and low rewards for effort in these low status jobs are risk factors for mental and physical health problems, such as a 50% excess risk of heart disease (Stansfeld & Candy, 2006). [...] The growing power of massive, conglomerate global corporations and institutions to set labor policy and standards agendas has disempowered workers, unions, and the job-seeking by subjecting these individuals to health-damaging working conditions.

[...] In high- income countries, there has been a growth in <b>job</b> <b>insecurity</b> and precarious employment arrangements (such as informal work, temporary work, part-time work, and piecework), job losses, and a weakening of regulatory protections.

As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, <b>job</b> <b>insecurity</b> and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes for us to see Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees are just trying to earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the public does not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation.

Youth waithood involves navigating precarious conditions arising under neoliberalism and its economic liberalization reforms, and developing new subjectivities resulting from the acquisition of extra skills set, maintaining social networks, and engaging in new political formations (Jeffrey, 2008). Informed by concepts of neoliberal subjectivities, opportunity spaces, and Bourdieuâs forms of capital, I conducted qualitative research with university students in six public universities, and with educated young farmers in Western, Eastern, and Central regions of Kenya. I investigated how Kenyan youth navigate waithood by occupying new opportunity spaces opened up by student environmentalism and agricultural entrepreneurialism â two areas that have been reconfigured by global discourses of environmental change, green jobs, and agricultural transformation. My findings show that the occupational aspirations of educated youth were changing to include navigation strategies of portfolio occupations, tarmacking, and side-hustling. Within the new opportunity spaces, these youth realized neoliberal subjectivities that enabled them to garner capitals through self-making, entrepreneurialism, and reworking of elite distinctions. Student environmentalistsâ navigation strategies included acquiring environmental knowledge and work experiences; joining networks of environmental professionals; and participating in environmental anti-politics. Educated young farmers embraced ideologies of portfolio occupations and green livelihoods. They also relied on the reconfigurations of gendered identities and the rural-urban divide, competitive individualism, and associational life to rework their occupational aspirations and maintain elite distinctions in society. In sum, negotiating youth waithood is a complex, intertwined, and uncertain process involving flexibilities and chance opportunities to access, maintain, and utilize capitals.
