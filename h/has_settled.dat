5|$|There {{are various}} climatic areas in Israel and areas it <b>has</b> <b>settled</b> that allow {{a variety of}} {{products}} to be grown. Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain. Figs, pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas. The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes, kiwis and bananas, while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes, apples and cherries.|$|E
5|$|In the Warriors universe, a {{large group}} of feral cats <b>has</b> <b>settled</b> into a forest, and claimed it for their own. The cats are split into four smaller Clans: ThunderClan lives in {{woodland}} areas, WindClan reside on the moors, RiverClan by the lake and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. A fifth Clan, SkyClan, also used {{to be a part of}} this system, but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed to make human houses. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan, for example, will swim in the river to catch fish, whilst the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and <b>has</b> <b>settled</b> abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E

5|$|Set in the author's present day, the interwar period, {{the novel}} centers on two strangers who arrive at {{different}} times in Jefferson, Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, a fictional county based on Faulkner's home, Lafayette County, Mississippi. The plot first focuses on Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Alabama looking for {{the father of her}} unborn child, and then shifts to explore the life of Joe Christmas, a man who <b>has</b> <b>settled</b> in Jefferson and passes as white, but who secretly believes he has some black ancestry. After a series of flashbacks narrating Christmas's early life, the plot resumes with his living and working with Lucas Burch, the father of Lena's child, who fled to Jefferson and changed his name when he found out that Lena was pregnant. The woman on whose property Christmas and Burch have been living, Joanna Burden, a descendant of Yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of Jefferson, is murdered. Burch is caught {{at the scene of the}} crime and reveals that Christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black, thus implying that he is guilty of her murder. While Burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in Christmas, Lena is assisted by Byron Bunch, a shy, mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her. Bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town, the disgraced former minister Gail Hightower, to help Lena give birth and protect Christmas from being lynched. Though Hightower refuses the latter, Christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman. Burch leaves town without his reward, and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he picked up on the road to Tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child, both looking for the woman's husband.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary physics <b>has</b> <b>settled</b> on the Planck {{scale as}} the most {{suitable}} scale for a unified theory. The Planck scale was, however, anticipated by George Stoney. Like Planck after him, Stoney realised that large-scale effects such as gravity and small-scale effects such as electromagnetism naturally imply an intermediate scale where physical differences might be rationalised. This intermediate scale comprises units (Stoney scale units) of mass, length, time etc., yet mass is the cornerstone.|$|E

The story is based on comments made by Philipp Melanchthon, though it is thought that he was not in Wittenberg at the time.|$|E
