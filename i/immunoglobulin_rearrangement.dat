40|$|AIMS: For {{patients}} who have multiple lymphomas with discordant pathology, it is relevant {{to determine whether there}} is one disseminated lymphoma or two unrelated lymphomas. Patients with disseminated, clonally related lymphomas are usually treated with the most powerful drugs available, while patients with unrelated (primary) lymphomas receive mainly standard first-line therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used next-generation sequencing on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine to characterize the immunoglobulin heavy gene V-D-J rearrangements in two diagnostic tissue samples, including formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue, of two patients with iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated Epstein-Barr virus lymphoproliferative disorder, with ulcerative colitis as underlying disease. The <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing revealed undoubtedly clonally related lesions in two tissue biopsies that were taken over time in the first patient, which is concordant with disseminated lymphoma. The other patient showed two clonally unrelated lesions, which is incompatible with clonal dissemination. This information was not inferred from evaluation of the heavy and light chain rearrangements by fragment analysis, which is currently the gold standard. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the diagnostic application of next-generation sequencing of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> assessment in pathology for clinical decision-making in patients with several simultaneous or subsequent lymphoproliferations...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} the Southern blot hybridization technique to diagnose B-cell lymphoma by detecting clonal <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangements</b> in lymph node and other biopsy tissues. DNA was isolated {{from a wide variety of}} neoplastic and non-neoplastic specimens and analyzed for the presence of rearranged immunoglobulin genes using radiolabeled DNA probes specific for the heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin constant region genes. Among the specimens examined, clonal <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangements</b> were found only in biopsy samples of B-cell lymphoma and not in samples containing reactive lymphoid processes or non-B-cell cancers. In lymphomas, the presence of rearrangements for either the kappa or lambda light-chain gene correlated with expression of one or the other of these chains when cellular immunoglobulins could be detected by frozen-section immunophenotyping techniques. The analysis of <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangements</b> offers several advantages over conventional diagnostic methods for lymphomas, including improved sensitivity in detecting minor populations of neoplastic lymphocytes composing as little as 1 % of the total cell population. In addition, clonal <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangements</b> are demonstrable in a subset of lymphomas that lack detectable surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, thus offering positive evidence for both malignancy and the B-cell origin of these tumors. Our studies indicate that detection of <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangements</b> is a valuable method for diagnosis and classification of various lymphoproliferative disorders that are difficult to evaluate histologically or that lack distinctive antigenic markers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring B {{lymphocyte}} development, pro-B {{cells that}} fail to rearrange an immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain allele productively are thought to undergo developmental arrest and death, but because these cells are short-lived in vivo they are not well characterized. Transgenic mice expressing the apoptosis regulatory gene bcl-xL in the B lineage developed large expansions of pro-B cells in bone marrow. V(D) J rearrangements in the expanded population were nearly all nonproductive, and DJH rearrangements were enriched for joints in DH reading frame 2 and for aberrant joints with extensive DH or JH deletions. Thus, the death of pro-B cells with failed <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangements</b> occurs by apoptosis, and bcl-xL can deliver a strong survival signal at the pro-B stage. This analysis also demonstrates that <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangement</b> is less precise than previously appreciated...|$|R

40|$|Abelson {{murine leukemia}} virus-transformed cells have {{provided}} the principal model for study of the early events in immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. In this communication, we describe {{a new type of}} Abelson virus-transformed pre-B-cell line that is arrested at the DJH stage of the recombination process. These cells differ from other pre-B transformants with respect to two properties associated with the <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> process. First, in contrast to cell lines undergoing VH-to-DJH joining in vitro, none of these cell lines contained detectable levels of RNAs transcribed from their unrearranged VH genes. Second, only some of the cell lines recombined exogenous heptamer-nonamer sequences, indicating that many of them have lost at least a portion of the enzymatic machinery that mediates recombination. The correlation between the absence of unrearranged VH RNAs and the inability to rearrange endogenous immunoglobulin gene segments suggests that VH gene transcription is required both to maintain an active recombination system and for the final step in variable-region formation...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTissue {{regeneration}} is an orchestrated {{progression of}} cells from an immature state to a mature one, conventionally represented as distinctive cell subsets. A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine {{the depth of}} single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL- 7 /STAT 5 and cellular events such as <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement,</b> highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and “corrupted” developmental processes including cancer...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reports of}} "lineage {{switching}} " from a lymphoid to macrophage phenotype have left unresolved {{the question of}} whether such cells are functional macrophages or nonfunctional products of differentiation gone awry. This study demonstrates that several "macrophage-like " cell lines derived from v-Ha-ras-transformed pre-B cells have gained the capacity to effectively present antigen in MHC-restricted fashion. Using an assay involving the cocultivation of putative antigen-presenting cells with chicken ovalbumin (cOVA) and a cOVA-specific T-cell hybridoma, "lineage switch " cell lines were found to present antigen as effectively as macrophage-containing peritoneal exudates. Neither the original pre-B-cell precursors nor B-cell lymphomas derived from them present antigen. Thus, we have demonstrated that these "lineage switch" macrophages are capable of antigen presentation, a mature differentiated function. While gaining macrophage characteristics, these cells have also rearranged their kappa light-chain immunoglobulin locus, suggesting that macrophage differentiation and <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> are not mutually exclusive processes. The existence of both lymphoid and myeloid characteristics in a cell fully capable of antigen presentation suggests greater plasticity in hematopoietic lineage commitment than conventionally thought to be the case...|$|E
40|$|Homozygous {{mutation}} at the scid locus in {{the mouse}} {{results in the}} aberrant rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene segments. We introduced a retroviral vector containing an inversional <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> cassette into scid pre-B cells. Most rearrangements were accompanied by large deletions, consistent with previously characterized effects of the scid mutation. However, two cell clones were identified which contained perfect reciprocal fragments and wild-type coding joints, documenting, on a molecular level, the ability of scid pre-B cells to generate functional protein-coding domains. Subsequent rearrangement of the DGR cassette {{in one of these}} clones was accompanied by a deletion, suggesting that this cell clone had not reverted the scid mutation. Indeed, induced rearrangement of the endogenous kappa loci in these two cell clones resulted in a mixture of scid and wild-type V-J kappa joints, as assayed by a polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. In addition, three immunoglobulin mu- scid pre-B cell lines showed both scid and wild-type V-J kappa joins. These experiments strongly suggest that the V(D) J recombinase activity in scid lymphoid cells is diminished but not absent, consistent with the known leakiness of the scid mutation...|$|E
40|$|In {{multiple}} myeloma, circulating "clonotypic" B cells, that {{express the}} <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> of the malignant plasma cell clone, can be indirectly detected by PCR. Their role as potential "feeder" cells for the malignant plasma cell pool remains controversial. Here we {{established for the}} first time an approach that allows direct tracking of such clonotypic cells by labeling with patient-specific immunoglobulin ligands in 15 patients with myeloma. Fifty percent of patients showed evidence of clonotypic B cells in blood or bone marrow by PCR. Epitope-mimicking peptides from random libraries were selected on each patient's individual immunoglobulin and used as ligands to trace cells expressing the idiotypic immunoglobulin on their surface. We established a flow cytometry and immunofluorescence protocol to track clonotypic B cells and validated it in two independent monoclonal B cell systems. Using this method, we found clonotypic B cells in only one out of 15 myeloma patients. In view of the assay's validated sensitivity level of 10 (- 3), this surprising data suggests that the abundance of such cells has been vastly overestimated in the past and that they apparently represent a very rare population in myeloma. Our novel tracing approach may open perspectives to isolate and analyze clonotypic B cells and determine their role in myeloma pathobiology...|$|E

40|$|<b>Immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangement</b> {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the more commonly performed assays available on the hematopathology menu of clinical molecular pathology laboratories. The analysis of these rearrangements provides useful information on a number of different levels in the evaluation of lymphoproliferations. An appreciation of the various mechanisms involved in the numerous physiological pathways affecting the immunoglobulin genes, and hence antibody molecules, is central to an understanding of B-cell development vis-à-vis the generation of immunological diversity. Knowledge about the intricate complexities of these mechanisms is also germane to an evaluation of testing methodologies. With this information, it is easier to develop an understanding of how contemporary molecular testing of <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangements</b> has evolved, from historically quite heterogeneous, fairly flawed, and rather ugly approaches to current more-standardized protocols. In addition, recognition of how such genetic changes with good intentions can turn bad has fostered increasing insights into the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> {{involves}} {{random and}} imprecise processes that act to both create and constrain diversity. Two such processes are {{the loss of}} nucleotides through the action of unknown exonuclease(s) {{and the addition of}} P nucleotides. The study of such processes has been compromised by difficulties in reliably aligning immunoglobulin genes and in the partitioning of nucleotides between segment ends, and between N and P nucleotides. Results A dataset of 294 human IgM sequences was created and partitioned {{with the aid of a}} probabilistic model. Non-random removal of nucleotides is seen between the three IGH gene types with the IGHV gene averaging removals of 1. 2 nucleotides compared to 4. 7 for the other gene ends (p Conclusions The loss of nucleotides due to the action of exonucleases is not random, but is influenced by the nucleotide composition of the genes. P nucleotides do not make a significant contribution to diversity of immunoglobulin sequences. Although palindromic sequences are present in 10 % of immunologlobulin rearrangements, most of the 'palindromic' nucleotides are likely to have been inserted into the junction during the process of N nucleotide addition. P nucleotides can only be stated with confidence to contribute to diversity of less than 1 % of sequences. Any attempt to identify P nucleotides in immunoglobulins is therefore likely to introduce errors into the partitioning of such sequences. </p...|$|E
40|$|Marrow {{residual}} disease (RD) {{in patients}} with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) who are in complete remission (CR) after treatment with purine analogues {{is reported to have}} a prognostic value, but sample dilution, factors interfering with marrow aspiration, or undetectable <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> can affect the assessment of RD by molecular or immunologic methods. As demonstrated for hairy cell leukemia and follicular lymphoma, bone marrow trephine biopsy specimen immunostaining (BMT/IS) can successfully detect residual malignant cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} use BMT/IS and computerized image analysis (CIMA) of bcl- 2 -positive cells to quantify RD in B-CLL patients in CR, after achievement of CR and more than 1 year later. This methodology was compared with other conventional techniques, i. e. cytologic, flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis. BMT/IS readily detected RD in every trephine biopsy specimen examined, either after CR or at distant follow-up. CIMA allowed an objective quantification of residual B-CLL cells, as evidenced by the correlation with semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction results. Both analyses indicated a progression of RD. This finding was also supported (but inconsistently) by the other techniques. CIMA with an interstitial labeling index, therefore, seems to be a reproducible and sensitive method to detect persistence and progression of RD {{in patients with}} B-CLL.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is an angiocentric and angiodestructive lymphoreticular proliferation, {{which usually}} {{involves}} the lungs, {{but may also}} involve {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Unique involvement of the CNS has been reported rarely. We report our experience with LYG confined to the brain and review the pertinent literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1995 to September 2007, we identified patients with isolated brain LYG through a search of the histopathology database of the Catholic University of Rome; medical and radiological data were analyzed. Immunophenotype, in situ hybridization analysis of EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBER ISH) and <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> studies were performed on the pathological specimens. RESULTS: Four patients with brain-LYG (male/female 1 : 1, mean age 44 years) underwent surgery in the study period. Subsequent therapy was tailored according to LYG grading. At the latest follow-up (range from 18 to 221 months), patient conditions had improved in all cases. EBER ISH was negative in all cases. Study of the IgH chain gene documented a monoclonal pattern in two cases. CONCLUSIONS: CNS-LYG is a rare disease that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of both diffuse and space-occupying cerebral lesions. Primary cerebral LYG seems not to be associated with EBV and appears to have a better prognosis than systemic LYG with CNS localization, which is frequently EBV positive...|$|E
40|$|Gene-targeted mice were {{generated}} with a loxP-neomycin resistance gene (neor) cassette inserted upstream of the J� 1 region and {{replacement of the}} glycine 154 codon in the C� 1 gene with a serine codon. This insertion dramatically increases V� 1 -J� 1 recombination. J� 1 germline transcription levels in pre-B cells and thymus cells are also greatly increased, apparently due to the strong housekeeping phosphoglycerine kinase (PGK) promoter driving the neo gene. In contrast, deletion of the neo gene causes {{a significant decrease in}} VJ� 1 recombination to levels below those in normal mice. This reduction is due to the loxP site left on the chromosome which reduces the J� 1 germline transcription in cis. Thus, the correlation between germline transcription and variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) recombination is not just an all or none phenomenon. Rather, the transcription efficiency is directly associated with the recombination efficiency. Furthermore, J� 1 and V� 1 germline transcription itself is not sufficient to lead to VJ recombination in T cells or early pre-B cells. The findings may suggest that in vivo: (a) locus and cell type–specific transactivators direct the immunoglobulin or T cell receptor loci, respectively, to a “recombination factory ” in the nucleus, and (b) transcription complexes deliver V(D) J recombinase to the recombination signal sequences.

However, the characteristics of Ig rearrangements in the population from the South of France have not yet been established. Here, we studied CLL B-cell repertoire and mutational pattern in a Southern French cohort of patients using an in-house protocol for whole sequencing of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Described biased usage of variable, diversity and joining genes between the mutated and unmutated groups was found in our population. However, variable gene frequencies are more in accordance with those observed in the Mediterranean patients. We found that the third complementary-determining region (CDR) length was higher in unmutated sequences, because of bias in the diversity and joining genes usage and not due to the N diversity. Mutations found in CLL followed the features of canonical somatic hypermutation mechanism: preference of targeting for activation-induced cytidine deaminase and polymerase motifs, base change bias for transitions and more replacement mutations occurring in CDRs than in frame-work regions. Surprisingly, localization of activation-induced cytidine deaminase motifs onto the variable gene showed a preference for frame-work regions. The study of the characteristics at the age of diagnosis showed no difference in clinical outcome, but suggested a tendency of increased replacement and transition-over-transversion mutations and a longer third CDR length in older patients...|$|E

Infection of newborn inbred NMRI mice with Akv induced 35 % plasma cell proliferations (PCPs) (consistent with plasmacytoma), 33 % diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 25 % follicular B-cell lymphomas and few splenic marginal zone and small B-cell lymphomas. Deleting one copy of the 99 -bp proviral enhancer sequence still allowed induction of multiple B-cell tumor types, although PCPs dominated (77 %). Additional mutation of binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor, Ets, Runx, or basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors in the proviral U 3 region, however, shifted disease induction to almost exclusively PCPs, but had no major influence on tumor latency periods. Southern analysis of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangements</b> and ecotropic provirus integration patterns showed that many of the tumors/cell proliferations induced by each virus were polyclonal.

40|$|In Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, {{known as}} {{lymphoblastoid}} cell lines (LCLs), LMP 2 A binds the tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn, blocking B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and viral lytic replication. SH 2 domains in Syk mediate binding to a phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in LMP 2 A. Mutation of the LMP 2 A ITAM in LCLs eliminates Syk binding {{and allows for}} full BCR signaling, thereby delineating {{the significance of the}} LMP 2 A-Syk interaction. In transgenic mice, LMP 2 A causes a developmental alteration characterized by a block in surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> resulting in BCR-negative B cells. Normally B cells lacking cognate BCR are rapidly apoptosed; however, LMP 2 A trans-genic B cells develop and survive without a BCR. When bred into the recombinase activating gene 1 null (RAG 2 / 2) background, all LMP 2 A transgenic lines produce BCR-negative B cells that develop and survive in the periphery.

In this study, LMP 2 A ITAM mutant transgenic mice were generated to investigate whether the LMP 2 A ITAM is essential for the survival phenotype in vivo. LMP 2 A ITAM mutant B cells develop normally, although transgene expression is comparable to that in previously described nonmutated LMP 2 A transgenic B cells.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} the t(14; 18) (q 32;q 21) chromosomal translocation found in follicular lymphoma, we examined the structure of both derivative (der) chromosomal breakpoints {{as well as their}} germ-line predecessors. We noted that chromosome segment 18 q 21 was juxtaposed with immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain gene diversity (DH) regions on all five der(18) chromosomes we examined, and we confirmed the juncture with immunoglobulin H-chain gene joining (JH) regions on the der(14) chromosome. However, the t(14; 18) was not fully reciprocal in that chromosome 14 DNA between the DH and JH regions was deleted. Furthermore, extra nucleotides, reminiscent of "N" segments, were present at the der(14) and possibly der(18) junctions. This indicates that despite the mature B-cell phenotype of follicular lymphoma, the t(14; 18) occurs during attempted DH-JH joining, the earliest event in <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement</b> in a pre-B-cell. Our detailed analysis of the germ-line 18 q 21 region indicated that most breakpoints clustered within a 150 -base-pair major breakpoint region. However, we found no evidence for evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin-like recombinational signals at 18 q 21, arguing against a role for immunoglobulin recombinase in chromosome 18 breakage. Instead, a direct repeat duplication of chromosome 18 sequences was discovered at both chromosomal junctures, typical of the repair of a naturally occurring staggered double-stranded DNA break. These results prompt a translocation model with illegitimate pairing of a staggered double-stranded DNA break at 18 q 21 and an immunoglobulin endonuclease-mediated break at 14 q 32 and with N-segment addition, repair, and ligation to generate der(14) and der(18) chromosomes...|$|E

DNA sequencing studies predict five changes in the amino acid sequence of the myc protein, two of which occur in a region within the second exon which is highly conserved in evolution. Southern blotting data indicate that the first exon of c-myc is rearranged 3 ' to 3 ' with the pseudo-epsilon gene. Because CA 46 cells contain two rearranged mu genes, the translocation must have occurred after <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>rearrangement.</b> The position of the breakpoint in CA 46 occurs within a 20 -base-pair region of the first intron of c-myc to which breakpoints have been mapped for two additional B-cell lymphomas with the t(8; 14) translocation, ST 486 and the Manca cell line. The region of the heavy chain locus to which c-myc has translocated is different in each case. Comparisons have {{been made of the}} levels of transcripts of the translocated c-myc gene in ST 486 and CA 46, where the gene is not associated with the heavy chain enhancer, with its expression in the Manca cell, in which it is. The c-myc gene is transcribed at similar levels in all three cases...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Primary {{localised}} orbital amyloidosis {{is a rare}} disease. The {{purpose of}} this study was to describe two cases of primary orbital amyloidosis and emphasise the value of molecular analysis of <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangement</b> in identifying a monoclonal population of cells responsible for the amyloid production. METHODS: Charts and biopsy specimens of each case were reviewed. Conventional light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangement</b> were performed in both cases. RESULTS: An unusual presentation of localised primary amyloidosis with bilateral and extensive enlargement of multiple extraocular muscles was seen in case 1. The presence of amyloid deposits was confirmed by biopsy in both cases. Evidence of a monoclonal population of plasma cells was shown by immunohistochemical analysis in case 2 only. The monoclonal origin of the cells responsible for the amyloid deposition was determined by PCR analysis demonstrating immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: A monoclonal population of plasma cells responsible for the amyloid deposition was present in these two cases. PCR analysis is extremely helpful in determining monoclonality, a finding that may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: The {{inference}} of pre-mutation <b>immunoglobulin</b> (Ig) <b>rearrangements</b> {{is essential}} {{in the study of}} the antibody repertoires produced in response to infection, in B-cell neoplasms and in autoimmune disease. Often, there are several rearrangements that are nearly equivalent as candidates for a given Ig gene, but have different consequences in an analysis. Our aim in this article is to develop a probabilistic model of the rearrangement process and a Bayesian method for estimating posterior probabilities for the comparison of multiple plausible rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|An EBV-transformed {{lymphoblastoid}} B {{cell clone}} (A 12) derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes of an HIV- 1 -infected individual is described. The immunoglobulin isotype produced by this clone was IgM, and Southern blot analysis of <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene <b>rearrangement</b> showed a monoclonal pattern. The A 12 monoclonal antibody was specific for the p 24 {{product of the}} HIV- 1 gag gene. This clone is now in continuous culture for more than 8 months and no changes in its biologic properties have been observed...|$|R
