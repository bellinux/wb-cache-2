500|$|In 1998, Ray said, [...] "I'd written 'You Really Got Me' as {{tribute to}} all those great blues people I love: Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy." [...] Dave cited Gerry Mulligan as an inspiration, saying, [...] "Ray was a great fan of Gerry Mulligan, who was in , and as {{he sat at the}} piano at home, <b>he</b> <b>sort</b> of messed around in a vein similar to Mulligan and came up with this figure based on a 12-bar blues". Dave has also said that song had been {{inspired}} by Jimmy Giuffre's song [...] "The Train and the River". According to the band's manager, Larry Page, the song's characteristic riff came about while working out the chords of the Kingsmen's [...] "Louie Louie". Lyrically, the song was said to be influenced by an encounter with one of the band's [...] "first serious female fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick is the ignorant {{but very}} humorous best friend of SpongeBob SquarePants. He {{is portrayed as}} being an {{overweight}} [...] dimwitted, pink starfish residing in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Patrick gets dumber throughout the series and {{has been shown to}} make many ludicrous mistakes. Despite this, he has occasionally been portrayed as a savant, with articulate observance to certain subjects in specific detail (in which cases he is ironically less dense than SpongeBob, as he expressed suspicion to Squidward's resentment toward them in the episodes [...] "Jellyfishing" [...] and [...] "SB-129", implying <b>he</b> <b>sort</b> of knows that Squidward hates them; he is also a natural boat driver, a skill SpongeBob has never managed to master). However, he always reverts quickly back to his usual, unintelligent self after displaying a moment of wisdom. He holds no form of occupation except for several very brief stints working at the Krusty Krab and at the Chum Bucket in a variety of positions, and mostly spends his time either clowning around with SpongeBob, catching jellyfish with him, or lounging beneath the rock under which he resides.|$|E

500|$|After some {{errors in}} her {{pronunciation}} of Sanskrit shloka [...] "Yoga Taravali" [...] during the song [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons {{to learn the}} basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Dr B P T Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, <b>he</b> <b>sort</b> of pushes us another step further. 'Maybe we should try this', or 'I really don't want to hear that'. And then of course, later on, it creeps in my brain, and I'm like, 'maybe I should have done a background vocal on that'. And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, <b>he</b> <b>sort</b> of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
500|$|... "For June Bolan, {{the alarm}} bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under {{lock and key}} for three days, {{occasionally}} shoving a ration of biscuits under the door." [...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and <b>he</b> <b>sort</b> of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E

2500|$|When Anselmo {{called in}} the {{aftermath}} of the murders, Rita Haney, Darrell's girlfriend, answered one of Anselmo's calls and said she would [...] "blow Anselmo's head off" [...] if he attended Darrell's funeral. He was buried with Eddie Van Halen's black and yellow-striped Charvel electric guitar (sometimes referred to as [...] "Bumblebee"), which was pictured with Van Halen on the inner sleeve and back cover of the album Van Halen II. Dimebag had asked for one of these guitars in 2004, shortly before he was shot. Eddie Van Halen originally agreed to make Darrell a copy of the guitar, but upon hearing of Abbott's death, offered to place the actual guitar in his casket. Dimebag was buried in a Kiss Kasket (a casket inspired by the band Kiss). Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons said, [...] "There were a limited number made and I sent mine to the family of 'Dimebag' Darrell. He requested in his will to be buried in a Kiss Kasket, as <b>he</b> <b>sort</b> of learned his rock 'n' roll roots by listening to us for some strange reason." [...] Not long after Darrell's murder, Anselmo received a heated message from Vinnie, which (according to Anselmo) [...] "went along the lines that my (Anselmo's) day was coming." [...] Anselmo's rebuttal was that everybody's day is coming and that if his day should end before Vinnie's it would not change anything, except for Vinnie to go through [...] "losing another brother".|$|E
