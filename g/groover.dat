5000|$|<b>Groover</b> began {{training}} the black stallion Ace's Sensation in 1966; {{at the same}} time he was also training another black stallion named Sensational Shadow. He continued training both horses simultaneously until he felt that he should focus his attention on Ace's Sensation; Sensational Shadow's owners moved him to Steve Hill's stables and then on to C. A. Bobo's, where he won a World Grand Championship. In 1968 Ace's Sensation and <b>Groover</b> placed third in the World Grand Championship; in 1969 he placed fourth. <b>Groover</b> had hopes to win the next year, 1970, but early in the year [...] "Ace" [...] bowed two tendons in an accident during a small show. <b>Groover</b> and the horse's owner, Randall Rollins, took him to several equine veterinarians and put Ace's Sensation on swimming therapy to build his muscles without strain. He was not healed enough to be ridden until three weeks prior to the Celebration, but <b>Groover</b> entered him. During the Preliminary Stallion class, Ace's Sensation stumbled and <b>Groover</b> feared the horse had been reinjured. Upon dismounting and checking the horse's legs, he found that Ace had thrown a shoe but was unhurt. Ace's Sensation and <b>Groover</b> went on to win that class and the World Grand Championship that year, and <b>Groover</b> was also named Trainer of the Year. Besides Ace's Sensation, <b>Groover</b> had several other notable horses, including the mare Ebony's Darling Lady, who won the Three-Year-Old World Championship.|$|E
