50|$|Most {{molluscs}} are herbivorous, grazing on algae or filter feeders. For those grazing, two feeding {{strategies are}} predominant. Some feed on microscopic, filamentous algae, often using their radula as a 'rake' to comb up filaments {{from the sea}} floor. Others feed on macroscopic 'plants' such as kelp, rasping the plant surface with its radula. To employ this strategy, the plant has to be large enough for the mollusc to 'sit' on, so smaller macroscopic plants are not as often eaten as their larger counterparts.Filter feeders are molluscs that feed by straining suspended matter and <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> from water, typically by passing the water over their gills.

5000|$|Like other sea anemones, G. prolifera is a predator, {{catching}} plankton {{with its}} tentacles. When a prey item is encountered, a rhythmic succession of reflex actions take place {{by which the}} <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> is passed by the tentacles to the mouth and then swallowed. Locomotion is by [...] "walking" [...] or swimming. The anemone walks by making a series of short, looping steps, first extending its column parallel with the substrate, then attaching one tentacle to the substrate {{by means of the}} cnidocytes, detaching the pedal base, reattaching it close to the single, now contracted, tentacle, releasing this tentacle and straightening up. Each step takes half a minute or more and advances the anemone a few millimetres. Swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously; the tentacles are used like oars and a bout of swimming may consist of ten to thirty strokes. Swimming takes place after the anemone is stimulated sharply in some way or is attacked by a nudibranch.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} nocturnal and spends {{the day in}} a hiding place. It only feeds when the water {{conditions}} are optimal. When the current is too strong it keeps its arms folded up but at moderate current speed it climbs to an elevated position and spreads its arms wide. The arms are much branched and the mesh size is small, so it probably captures {{a wide variety of}} prey. The part of the arms near their base overlap one another and may serve to create a degree of turbulence which may assist the outer parts of the arms in their food capture or bring further food particles within reach. When feeding, it orientates itself towards the current in order to maximise its food collection ability. When it touches a <b>food</b> <b>particle,</b> the smallest branches close around it to form a ball which is then moved to the mouth. Even small juvenile fishes, shrimps and similar-sized organisms can be captured by these means. Typical perches are on the top of large corals or the top of gorgonians, and it uses the lower parts of the arms to hold itself in place. During the day it retreats down {{to the base of the}} coral or gorgonian, or hides in a crevice in the structure during the day. If a light is shone on it while it is feeding at night, it curls itself up, taking several minutes to become a fist-sized structure.|$|E
5000|$|Cephalochordates {{employ a}} filter feeding system to consume microorganisms. The oral hood {{serves as the}} {{entrance}} for <b>food</b> <b>particles,</b> and possesses buccal cirri, which assist in sifting out larger <b>food</b> <b>particles</b> before they enter the buccal cavity. Epithelial cilia lining the mouth and pharynx form a specialized [...] "wheel organ" [...] situated at the dorsal and posterior end of the cavity. The motion of the cilia resembles the motion of a turning wheel, hence the organ's name, and transports the captured <b>food</b> <b>particles.</b> Behind this organ is the velum, which acts as an internal filter before food enters the pharynx. The <b>food</b> <b>particles</b> adhere to secreted mucus on the pharyngeal bars before being brought to the epibranchial groove on the dorsal side of the pharynx.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> sizes (diameter) that produce the fastest growth (S-opt) in juvenile Nile tilapia, and modeling the growth penalties for particles departing from S-opt. Three 14 -day experiments were run with 3, 7 and 11 g juveniles, which {{were raised in}} 120 -L flow-through cylindro-conical tanks at 29 +/- 1 degrees C, fed at the optimum feeding level (R-opt) and weighed at weekly intervals. In each experiment, four different sizes of pellets (diameter) were evaluated (0. 5 -mm intervals, 1. 0 - 3. 5 mm; three replications per pellet size). At {{the end of each}} experiment, food intake and gastric evacuation rate were determined by radiographic methods following the use of ballotini labelled feed. The results indicate that i) in all experiments, specific growth rates (SGRs) are significantly depressed for the largest particles; ii) S-opt increases with increasing fish size (1. 4 mm at 3 g, to 2. 5 mm at 20 g); iii) the optimum particle size relative to mouth width (MW) varies only slightly with fish size (28 to 25 % MW from 3 to 20 g); iv) growth heterogeneity is proportional to <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size; and, v) food intake and gastric evacuation rates are inversely proportional to <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size. A growth model (SGR) was constructed with a stepwise multiple-regression analysis against fish size, feeding level and <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size (R- 2 = 0. 853, df = 71). For a particular fish size, the growth-to-particle size relationship is a log-log second order polynomial, which implies that the growth penalty is more severe when fish are fed small than large particles. By contrast, application of food particles slightly smaller than S-opt tends to minimize growth heterogeneity. As fish size increases, the width of the SGR-to-S relationship broadens; so, the penalty for distributing particles departing from S-opt is lower, and feeding strategies are facilitated...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{mastication}} is {{a process}} combining simultaneous food comminution and lubrication. The initiation of swallowing, which is voluntary, has been thought to depend on separate thresholds for <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size and for particle lubrication. Instead of this duality, we suggest that swallowing is initiated when it is sensed that a batch of food particles is binding together under viscous forces so as to form a bolus. Bolus formation ensures that when the food mass is swallowed, it will pass the pharyngeal region safely without risk of inhaling small particles into the lower respiratory tract. Crucial for bolus formation is <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size reduction by mastication. This allows the tongue to pack particles together tightly by pressure against the hard palate. A major function of salivation is to fill the gradually reducing spaces between particles, so increasing viscous cohesion and promoting bolus formation. If swallowing is delayed, excessive saliva floods the bolus, separating particles and reducing cohesion. Swallowing then becomes more precarious. Our model {{suggests that there is}} an optimum moment for a mammal to swallow, defined in terms of a peak cohesive force between food particles. The model is tested on human mastication with two foods, brazil nut and raw carrot, which have very different particle size breakdown rates. The peak cohesive force is much greater with brazil nuts but both foods are predicted to be swallowed after similar numbers of chews despite the very different <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size reductions achieved at that stage. The predicted number of chews to swallow is in broad agreement with published data. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|NoThe {{ability of}} prisms to {{effectively}} dissipate contact stress {{at the surface}} will influence wear rates in teeth. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to begin to quantify the effect of prism orientation on surface stresses. Seven finite element models of enamel microstructure were created, each model differing in the angulation of prism orientation with regard to the wear surface. For validation purposes, the mechanical behavior of the model was compared with published experimental data. In order to test the enamel under lateral loads, a compressed <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> was dragged across the surface from the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) towards the outer enamel surface (OES). Under these conditions, tensile stresses in the enamel model increased with increases in the coefficient of friction. More importantly, stresses were found to be lowest in models in which the prisms approach the surface at lower angles (i. e., more obliquely cut prisms), and highest when the prisms approached the surface at 60 ° (i. e., less obliquely cut). Finally, the direction of travel of the simulated <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> was reversed, allowing comparison of the difference in behavior between trailing and leading edge enamels (i. e., when the <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> was dragged either towards or away from the DEJ). Stresses at the trailing edge were usually lower than stresses at the leading edge. Taken together with what is known about prism orientation in primate teeth, such findings imply greater wear resistance at the intercuspal region and less wear resistance at the lateral enamel at midcrown. Such findings appear to be supported by archeological evidence...|$|E
40|$|The rate of <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> uptake of the {{tropical}} sponge Pseudosuberites aff. andrewsi was studied in relation to particle concentrations and particle size. A range of different concentrations of either the marine microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta (~ 5 - 8 7 m) or the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. (~ 1 7 m) was supplied to the sponges. D. tertiolecta had a pronounced effect on the filtration activity of the sponges: at concentrations higher than approximately 4 2 105 cells/cm 3, the filtration rates dropped dramatically. Such a clear effect was not found for Synechococcus sp. The results further showed that the maximal amount of food (when expressed in organic carbon) {{that can be taken}} up per cubic centimeter of sponge volume per unit of time should in principle be sufficient to enable growth (irrespective of the <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> type). At the maximal <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> concentration that did not affect the filtration rates, the uptake of organic carbon is already highly in excess of the amount of organic carbon that the sponges need to cope with their respiratory demand. Based on these findings, a series of growth experiments was carried out in which the sponges were subjected to a constant concentration of different types of food particles (Synechococcus sp. and the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana and Nannochloropsis sp). Although initial growth was sometimes observed, continuous growth at a constant rate could not be obtained.

40|$|A major {{difference}} between reptile and mammalian herbivores is that the former do not masticate their food. Actually, <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size reduction by chewing is usually {{considered one of the}} adaptations facilitating the higher metabolic rates of mammals. However, quantitative comparisons of ingesta particle size between the clades have, to our knowledge, not been performed so far. We measured mean fecal particle size (MPS) in 79 captive individuals of 14 reptile herbivore species (tortoises, lizards, and Corucia zebrata) by wet sieving and compared the results with a mammalian dataset. MPS increased with body mass in both clades, but at a significantly higher level in reptiles. Limited evidence in free-ranging and captive individuals of Testudo hermanni indicates that in reptiles, the ability to crop food and <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size significantly influence fecal particle size. The opportunistic observation of a drastic particle size difference between stomach and intestinal contents corroborates findings that in reptiles, in contrast to terrestrial mammals, significant ingesta particle size reduction does occur in the gastrointestinal tract, most likely owing to microbial action during very long ingesta retention. Whether behavioral adaptations to controlling ingesta particle size, such as deliberate small bite sizes, are adaptive strategies in reptiles remains to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{the breath}} {{hydrogen}} test in this thesis has focussed primarily {{on the study of}} carbohydrate assimilation in healthy dogs and in dogs with gastrointestinal disease. The gastrointestinal handling of dietary carbohydrates and the rationale, applications, and limitations of the breath hydrogen test have been reviewed. Studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size on carbohydrate digestion and the effect of dehydration on breath hydrogen concentrations in healthy dogs. In addition, breath hydrogen testing was used to assess the assimilation of four commonly used commercial carbohydrate sources in dogs with gastrointestinal disease. In each study, expired breath samples were collected at regular intervals after the ingestion of a carbohydrate test meal. The excretion of hydrogen in the breath was compared between groups, mainly by analysis of the areas under the breath hydrogen concentration versus time curves. The reduction of <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size was found to cause starch granule disruption and significantly decreased the amount of malassimilated rice. The assimilation of corn, however, {{did not appear to be}} altered by reducing the <b>food</b> <b>particle</b> size. Instead, an earlier rise of breath hydrogen concentrations occurred, indicating more rapid orocolic transit and/or fermentability of the smaller corn particles. Five percent dehydration, induced by food and water deprivation, was found to significantly elevate breath hydrogen concentrations and was associated with a significantly greater number of flatus-contaminated breath samples. This increased breath hydrogen excretion associated with increased flatulence in dehydrated dogs was attributed to a greater "net" production of hydrogen within the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, breath hydrogen concentrations were not found to vary significantly between four different extrusion cooked carbohydrate sources (wheat, potato, corn, rice). However, it could not be concluded that these carbohydrates were assimilated to a similar extent as in vitro fermentation results revealed marked differences in the amount of hydrogen produced per gram of carbohydrate fermented at different fermentation times. Individual dogs with gastrointestinal disease appeared to differ in their ability to assimilate the four different carbohydrate sources. In addition, dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency were found to malabsorb significantly more carbohydrate than the dogs with mild inflammatory bowel disease. In conclusion, food processing to reduce carbohydrate particle size appears to increase the assimilation of rice. Methods to reduce the particle size of rice should be considered in the formulation of veterinary therapeutic diets for the management of diarrhoea. Mild dehydration appears to increase breath hydrogen excretion. This suggests that breath hydrogen tests should not be performed on animals that are suboptimally hydrated until their hydration deficits have been restored. The marked individual variation of carbohydrate assimilation noted in dogs with gastrointestinal disease, suggests that clinicians should consider altering the carbohydrate source offered to dogs with intractable malassimilation. with the aim of finding the carbohydrate best tolerated. Finally, direct comparison of breath hydrogen concentrations should not be used to compare the digestibility of different complex carbohydrates unless an accurate means is available of comparing the amount of hydrogen produced per gram of substrate fermented in vivo...|$|E
