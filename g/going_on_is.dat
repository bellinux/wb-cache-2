He said that despite it being his [...] "400th version," [...] he was [...] "still not happy with it." [...] He believed that an early scene in which spoils are distributed from a cart in front of Pompey represented the first real sense of how the series would depict city life. He said, [...] "I {{think this is the}} first time that we get sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which was a very different version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> a real trick." ...|$|E
