However, most calcrete profiles are poly-genetic, where different processes may act during their evolution leading to fabric transformation, facies superimposition (Durand et al., 2007; Khalaf, 2007). Accumulations of calcium carbonate in soils, weathering profiles are particularly widespread in arid, semi-arid regions receiving rainfall between 400, 600 mm/yr, both on calcareous, non-* Corresponding author...|$|E
