I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of Ziva's fate, Glasberg stated [...] "Tremendous {{thought was}} put into every element of what you saw last night...down to the lines of dialogue, the {{specific}} wordage.

2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for me, {{to tell you}} the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets â€“ that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E
6000|$|That held me perplexed for a space. [...] . Well, anyhow <b>I</b> was <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> all! Thank God <b>I</b> was <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> all! Then, as I {{turned to}} go on, I thought of my mother.|$|R

6000|$|... "You're mistaken there. I'm getting {{something}} every minute--something that {{will stay with}} me all my life. After <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> you <b>it</b> doesn't matter. I came into the hills just naturally, the way the elk does. After that girl reported me, life didn't count. Seeing you has changed me. It matters {{a whole lot to}} me this minute, and when <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> you <b>it's</b> stormy sunset for me, sure thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Jessie, I have {{exhausted}} all my {{powers of}} persuasion. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> entirely to yourself {{to do as}} you think best." ...|$|E
60|$|These are my thoughts, after {{frequently}} {{reflecting on}} the case under all its circumstances; and so <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to your wiser judgments.|$|E
60|$|I {{have nothing}} to report, at present, except that I shall find out all I {{want to know about}} this {{locality}} before <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Still, I {{intend to}} take it. We {{have gone into}} this before. If I leave Dayspring before I find the silver, <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] she cheerfully answered. [...] "You may padlock me, or {{put me in}} an iron cage, if you please. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> all to you." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{account of}} the ensuing {{operation}} is so tragic and full of mournful interest that <b>I</b> must <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to another letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. <b>I</b> will <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to you, Captain Putnam, if I {{was really}} a pupil when Mr. Crabtree hauled me off to the guardroom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mamma, why shouldn't he? And why shouldn't Papa let {{him have}} the property; <b>I</b> mean, <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to him instead of to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 10: This {{was written}} before the {{publication}} of the Origin of Species. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> standing because it shows the stage of thought then arrived at.] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> must <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to you," [...] said Mr. Tadpole. [...] "You must {{remember}} what we are fighting for. The constitution is at stake." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{strove to}} put such {{thoughts}} {{from my mind}} that <b>I</b> might <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> free {{to do the work}} to which I had now vowed myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] I agreed. [...] "I {{will spend}} the night in Mr. Delora's rooms. <b>I</b> shall <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to you to make all the arrangements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This riding," [...] she began; [...] "it's {{not what}} they call the right thing. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to you. You know the world. You are Mr. Harnish, the millionaire--" ...|$|E
