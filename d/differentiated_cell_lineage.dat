40|$|Trophectoderm (TE), {{the first}} <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineage</b> of {{mammalian}} embryogenesis, forms the placenta, a structure unique to mammalian development. The differentiation of TE is a hallmark event in early mammalian development, but molecular mechanisms underlying this first differentiation event remain obscure. Embryonic stem (ES) cells can be induced to differentiate into the TE lineage by forced {{repression of the}} POUfamily transcription factor, Oct 3 / 4. We show here that this event can be mimicked by overexpression of Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx 2), which is sufficient to generate proper trophoblast stem (TS) cells. Cdx 2 is dispensable for trophectoderm differentiation induced by Oct 3 / 4 repression but essential for TS cell self-renewal. In preimplantation embryos, Cdx 2 is initially coexpressed with Oct 3 / 4 and they form a complex for the reciprocal repression of their target genes in ES cells. This suggests that reciprocal inhibition between lineagespecific transcription factors might {{be involved in the}} first differentiation event of mammalian development...|$|E
40|$|We {{transfected}} {{the human}} EJ bladder carcinoma oncogene (Ha-rasEJ- 1) into multipotential embryonal carcinoma cell line P 19. The transgenic P 19 (ras+) cells expressed {{high levels of}} both the mRNA and the p 21 EJ protein derived from the oncogene. When cultured {{in the presence of}} retinoic acid, P 19 (ras+) cells differentiated and developed into the same spectrum of differentiated cell types as the parental P 19 cells (namely, neurons, astrocytes, and fibroblast-like cells). Thus, it seems unlikely that the Ha-ras- 1 proto-oncogene product plays a role in initiation of differentiation or in the choice of <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineage.</b> Most of the P 19 (ras+) -derived differentiated cells contained relatively low levels of p 21 EJ and were nontransformed, whereas certain cells with fibroblast-like morphology continued to express the Ha-rasEJ- 1 gene at high levels and were transformed (i. e., immortal and anchorage independent). Fibroblasts derived from P 19 cells did not become transformed following transfection of the Ha-rasEJ- 1 oncogene, suggesting that transformation of the fibroblast cells only occurred if the oncogene was present and expressed during {{the early stages of the}} developmental lineage...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{overexpression}} of defined {{combinations of}} master regulator genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming: {{the acquisition of}} an alternative predicted phenotype from a <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineage.</b> This can be of particular importance in cardiac regenerative medicine wherein the heart lacks the capacity to heal itself, but simultaneously contains a large pool of fibroblasts. In this study we determined the cardio-inducing capacity of ten transcription factors to actuate cellular reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp 1 and SMARCD 3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA 4, TBX 5, and MEF 2 C. In particular, combinations of five or seven transcription factors enhanced the activation of cardiac reporter vectors, and induced an upregulation of cardiac-specific genes. Global gene expression analysis also demonstrated a significantly greater cardio-inducing effect when the transcription factors MYOCD and SRF were used. Detection of cross-striated cells was highly dependent on the cell culture conditions and was enhanced {{by the addition of}} valproic acid and JAK inhibitor. Although we detected Ca 2 + transient oscillations in the reprogrammed cells, we did not detect significant changes in resting membrane potential or spontaneously contracting cells. This study further elucidates the cardio-inducing effect of the transcriptional networks involved in cardiac cellular reprogramming...|$|E

Cytological application of molecular probes to three lineages, those responsible for the formation of the skeleton, the gut, and the aboral ectodermal wall of the late embryo, has demonstrated expression of lineage-specific genes long before overt morphological differentiation.

It is of major importance to investigate whether such shared global control mechanisms indicate a common mechanistic basis for preservation of the stem cell state, initiation of differentiation programs, and coordination of cell state transitions...|$|R
40|$|Haem {{is found}} in all living cells as the {{prosthetic}} group {{of a wide range}} of proteins such as cytochromes, haemoglobins and peroxidases. Nevertheless, the potential toxicity of the haem has been extensively demonstrated (Aft and Mueller, 1983; Vincent et al., 1988; Schmitt et al., 1993) and is often connected with its action as a catalyst for the formation of oxygen radicals. Haem can also associate to phospholipid membranes and make them leaky, by physically disturbing the bilayer structure (Schmitt et al., 1993). Organisms that feed on vertebrate haemoglobin face a very special situation as digestion results in the production of remarkably high amounts of haem. Biocrystallization of haem into an insoluble aggregate called haemozoin is a major defence mechanism that makes it possible for several organisms to feed on blood. The structure of haemozoin has recently been resolved (Pagola et al., 2000) and its presence, originally thought to be restricted to the malaria parasite, has now been detected in Rhodnius prolixus, a blood-sucking insect (Oliveira et al., 1999), and in the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni (Oliveira et al., 2000). Haem aggregation occurs either in an intracellular digestive vacuole where the haemoglobin molecule is hydrolyzed, as in Plasmodium (Goldberg et al., 1990; Slater et al., 1991), or extracellularly, as in Rhodnius and Schistosoma (Oliveira et al., 1999, 2000). After hatching, the Boophilus microplus larvae find their vertebrate host. During the following 3 weeks, the tick larva feeds on small amounts of blood, and after maturation, over a period slightly longer than 1 day, the adult female ingests blood equivalent to approximately 100 times its own body mass. Being a single-host tick, the engorged female drops from the bovine host and dies approximately 1 month later. Most of the digestion takes place over a few days following the meal, in parallel with the development of a large number of eggs. In insects, digestion takes place at the midgut lumen, but ticks have developed a <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineage</b> that phagocytoses the blood meal, so digestion is thought to be essentiall...|$|E

Nanomaterials, on the other hand, provide unique physical size, surface chemistry, conductivity, and topographical microenvironment to regulate stem cell differentiation through multidimensional approaches to facilitate gene delivery, cell–cell, and cell–ECM interactions. In this review, nanomaterials are demonstrated to work both alone and synergistically to guide selective stem cell differentiation. From three different nanotechnology families, three approaches are shown: (1) soluble microenvironmental factors; (2) insoluble physical microenvironment; and (3) nano-topographical features. As regenerative medicine is heavily invested in effective stem cell therapy, this review is inspired to generate discussions in the potential clinical applications of multi-dimensional nanomaterials.|$|R

30|$|The cardiac side-population (SP) {{represents}} a subpopulation of cardiac progenitors possessing the unique ability to efflux a DNA binding dye (namely Hoechst 33342) conferred by an ATP-binding cassette transporter (Unno et al. 2012).

We have developed CellNet, a network biology platform that more accurately assesses the fidelity of cellular engineering than existing methodologies and generates hypotheses for improving cell derivations. Analyzing expression data from 56 published reports, we found that cells derived via directed differentiation more closely resemble their in vivo counterparts than products of direct conversion, as reflected by the establishment of target cell-type gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Furthermore, we discovered that directly converted cells fail to adequately silence expression programs of the starting population and that the establishment of unintended GRNs is common to virtually every cellular engineering paradigm. CellNet provides a platform for quantifying how closely engineered cell populations resemble their target cell type and a rational strategy to guide enhanced cellular engineering...|$|R

Here we report that normal adult mammalian bone marrow contains cells, expressing the cell surface antigen CD 34, that naturally express the genes that are characteristic of ESCs and that are required to generate iPSCs. In addition, these CD 34 + cells spontaneously express, without genetic manipulation, genes characteristic of the three embryonic germ layers ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. In addition to the neural lineage genes we previously reported in these CD 34 + cells, we found that they express genes of the mesodermal cardiac muscle lineage and of the endodermal pancreatic lineage as well as intestinal lineage genes. Thus, these normal cells in the adult spontaneously exhibit the characteristics of embryonic-like stem cells...|$|R
40|$|Directed gene {{transfer}} into specific <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> in vivo {{is an attractive}} approach for both modulating gene expression and correcting inherited mutations such as emphysema caused by human α 1 antitrypsin (hAAT) deficiency. However, somatic tissues are mainly comprised of heterogeneous, <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> that can be short lived and difficult to specifically transfect. Here, we describe an intratracheally instilled lentiviral system able to deliver genes selectively {{to as many as}} 70 % of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the mouse lung. Following a single in vivo lentiviral transduction, genetically tagged AMs persisted in lung alveoli and expressed transferred genes for the lifetime of the adult mouse. A prolonged macrophage lifespan, rather than precursor cell proliferation, accounted for the surprisingly sustained presence of transduced AMs. We utilized this long-lived population to achieve localized secretion of therapeutic levels of hAAT protein in lung epithelial lining fluid. In an established mouse model of emphysema, lentivirally delivered hAAT ameliorated the progression of emphysema, as evidenced by attenuation of increased lung compliance and alveolar size. After 24 weeks of sustained gene expression, no humoral or cellular immune responses to hAAT protein were detected. Our results challenge the dogma that AMs are short lived and suggest that these <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells</b> may be a possible target cell population for in vivo gene therapy applications, including the sustained correction of hAAT deficiency...|$|R

Results Transcriptome analysis of both nRBC and RBC enriched populations was performed using chicken Affymetrix gene expression arrays.

To investigate its role in other adult stem cell populations, we generated a mouse expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre from the Bmi 1 locus. We found that Bmi 1 is expressed in discrete cells located {{near the bottom of}} crypts in the small intestine, predominantly four cells above the base of the crypt (+ 4 position). Over time, these cells proliferate, expand, self-renew and give rise to all the <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> of the small intestine epithelium. The induction of a stable form of beta-catenin in these cells was sufficient to rapidly generate adenomas. Moreover, ablation of Bmi 1 (+) cells using a Rosa 26 conditional allele, expressing diphtheria toxin, led to crypt loss. These experiments identify Bmi 1 as an intestinal stem cell marker in vivo. Unexpectedly, the distribution of Bmi 1 -expressing stem cells {{along the length of the}} small intestine suggested that mammals use more than one molecularly distinguishable adult stem cell subpopulation to maintain organ homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{composition and}} morphology {{of the stomach}} epithelium have been described in detail; however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of the various <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> {{as well as the}} function of mature gastric cells are far less clear. Recently, dissection of the molecular anatomy of the stomach has been boosted by the advent of functional genomics, which allows investigators to determine patterns of gene expression across virtually the entire cellular transcriptome. In this review, we discuss the impact of functional genomic studies on the understanding of gastric epithelial physiology. We show how functional genomic studies have uncovered genes that are useful as new cell lineage-specific markers of differentiation and provide new insights into cell physiology. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor B (Vegfb) has been identified as a parietal cell-specific marker that may allow parietal cells to regulate the mucosal vascular network. We also discuss how functional genomics has identified aberrantly expressed genes in disease states. Human epididymis 4 (HE 4), for example, was recently identified as a metaplasia-induced gene product in mice based on microarray analysis. Finally, we will examine how analysis of higher-order patterns of gene expression can go beyond simply identifying individual genes to show how cells work as integrated systems. Specifically, we show how application of a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of gene expression patterns from multiple tissues identifies the gastric parietal cell as an outlier, unlike other <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> in the stomach or elsewhere in the body...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPigment {{cells of}} the zebrafish, Danio rerio, offer an {{exceptionally}} tractable system for studying the genetic and cellular bases of cell fate decisions. In the zebrafish, neural crest cells generate three types of pigment cells during embryogenesis: yellow xanthophores, iridescent iridophores and black melanophores. In this study, we present evidence for a model whereby melanophores and iridophores descend from a common precursor whose fate is regulated by an interplay between the transcription factors Mitf and Foxd 3. Loss of mitfa, a key regulator of melanophore development, resulted in supernumerary ectopic iridophores while loss of foxd 3, a mitfa repressor, resulted in fewer iridophores. Double mutants showed a restoration of iridophores, suggesting that one of Foxd 3 's roles is to suppress mitfa to promote iridophore development. Foxd 3 co-localized with pnp 4 a, a novel marker of early iridophore development, and was necessary for its expression. A considerable overlap was found between iridoblast and melanoblast markers but not xanthoblast markers, which resolved as <b>cells</b> began to <b>differentiate.</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>lineage</b> analyses using the photoconvertible marker, EosFP, revealed that both melanophores and iridophores develop from a mitfa+ precursor.

Using non-pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations as clonal markers, the authors reveal the stem cell organisation of the human squamous oesophagus and of Barrett's metaplasia and determine the mechanism of clonal expansion of mutations. Methods Mutated cells were identified using enzyme histochemistry to detect activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO). CCO-deficient cells were laser-captured and mutations confirmed by PCR sequencing. <b>Cell</b> <b>lineages</b> were identified using immunohistochemistry. Results The normal squamous oesophagus contained CCO-deficient patches varying in size from around 30  μm up to about 1  mm. These patches were clonal as each area within a CCO-deficient patch contained an identical mitochondrial DNA mutation. In Barrett's metaplasia partially CCO-deficient glands indicate that glands are maintained by multiple stem cells. Wholly mutated Barrett's metaplasia glands containing all the expected <b>differentiated</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> were seen, demonstrating multilineage differentiation from a clonal population of Barrett's metaplasia stem cells. Patches of clonally mutated Barrett's metaplasia glands were observed, indicating glands can divide to form patches. In one patient, both the regenerating squamous epithelium and the underlying glandular tissue shared a clonal mutation, indicating that they are derived from a common progenitor cell. Conclusion In normal oesophageal squamous epithelium, a single stem cell clone can populate large areas of epithelium. Barrett's metaplasia glands are clonal units, contain multiple multipotential stem cells and most likely divide by fission. Furthermore, a single cell of origin can give rise to both squamous and glandular epithelium suggesting oesophageal plasticity...|$|R

In this study we analyzed expression pattern of Isl 1 and its co-factor Ldb 1 in small intestine. We also studied the biological role of Ldb 1 in gut endoderm. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed a relatively high level of expression of Lhx 1, Isl 1, Isl 2, Lmx 1 a, Ldb 1 and Ldb 2 mRNAs in the gut tissue as compared to the level of less abundant detectable Lmx 1 b mRNA. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated a unique pattern of Ldb 1 and Islet 1 proteins in the crypt compartment. Ldb 1 is produced at a low level in majority of crypt cells; but, its abundant expression was demonstrated for some single cells. Islet 1 is also expressed in single cells of the crypt. Double staining experiments with Ldb 1 and Isl 1 antibodies showed that both genes are co-expressed in certain cells of the crypt.

The phenotype of Pax 6 -/- knockout mice suggests nonredundant functions of the {{transcription factor}} in the development of glucagon-expressing a-cells as this cell type is absent in the mutants. We ask the question of how the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells, in particular that of a-cells, is affected by selective inactivation of either one of the three major domains of Pax 6. Results: The Pax 6 Aey 18 mutant mouse line, in which the paired domain is inactivated, showed a phenotype similar to that of Pax 6 -/- knockout mice with a near complete absence of glucagon-positive a-cells (0 - 4 cells/section; ≤ 1 % of wt), reduced b-cell area (74 % of wt) and disorganized islets.

We also studied two mouse lines with mutations in the homeodomain, Pax 6 4 Neu and Pax 6 132 - 14 Neu. Neighboring amino acids are affected in the two lines and both point mutations abolish DNA binding of the classical P 3 homeodomain target sequence.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} epithelium comprises <b>differentiated</b> <b>cells</b> of four <b>lineages</b> {{maintained by}} precursor cells. As the Notch pathway controls {{the fate of}} proliferating cells in many systems, we investigated the effect of conditional expression of an activated Notch mutant in intestinal epithelium. An {{increase in the number}} of goblet cells occurs within 8 h of induction, due to an effect of Notch on post-mitotic cells, not on precursors. This observation broadens the role of Notch into controlling postmitotic differentiation and indicates that the composition of the epithelium is not solely determined by progenitor cells...|$|R
40|$|Human {{endometrium}} contains mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (eMSC) {{which have the}} ability to <b>differentiate</b> into three <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> and the potential in therapeutic applications. We hypothesize that using environmental induction in culture media such as dexamethasone, human recombinant insulin and human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) can <b>differentiate</b> endometrial stem <b>cells</b> into myoblast. These agents have a broad range of effects in myoblast differentiation in-vitro. We used immunohystochemistry analysis and RT –PCR to evaluate the presence of skeletal muscle- specific proteins some of which are expressed in the early stage of differentiation including myoD and Desmin which expressed at later stages of differentiation. In conclusion eMSC can differentiate in culture media which contains above mentioned factors and use for therapeutic purpose in muscular degenerative disease...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{evaluated}} whether (i) 5 -azacytidine (AZA), a well-known demethylating agent, could be able to modify the phenotype of human preadipocytes and (ii) the modified cells could possess multilineage differentiation potential. Human preadipocytes at the 3 rd passage were treated for 48 or 96 h with 10 mu M AZA and then expanded up to passage 5. Stem cell markers, such as OCT- 4, Nanog, and Sox 2, were upregulated after 96 h of treatment with the demethylating treatment. Further, decreases in the expression of genes, such as adipose differentiation-related protein, characterizing the preadipocytes were noted. Our data showed that AZA-treated preadipocytes <b>differentiated</b> into <b>cell</b> <b>lineages</b> derived from mesoderm. Indeed, after incubation with inductive media for 3 weeks, osteblast-, chondrocyte-, and myoblast-like cells were detected in the cultures. Interestingly, both upregulation of stem cell markers and differentiation potential were maintained by the treated cultures expanded until the 5 th passage. Taken together, our results suggest that AZA, {{without the use of}} transduction methods, convert preadipocytes to a less differentiated state that can be induced, under suitable stimuli, to the formation of mesoderm-derived <b>cell</b> <b>lineages...</b>|$|R
40|$|Postnatal mesenchymal {{stem cells}} have the {{capacity}} to <b>differentiate</b> into multiple <b>cell</b> <b>lineages.</b> This study explored the possibility of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) for potential application in tendon tissue engineering. The expression of tendon-related markers such as scleraxis, tenascin-C, tenomodulin, eye absent homologue 2, collagens I and VI was detected in dental pulp tissue. Interestingly, under mechanical stimulation, these tendon-related markers were significantly enhanced when DPSCs were seeded in aligned polyglycolic acid (PGA) fibre scaffolds. Furthermore, mature tendon-like tissue was formed after transplantation of DPSC-PGA constructs under mechanical loading conditions in a mouse model. This study demonstrates that DPSCs could be a potential stem cell source for tissue engineering of tendon-like tissue...|$|R
