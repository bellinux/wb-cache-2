2500|$|The Ceramic Type [...] "Ometepe Red Slipped-Incised" [...] {{is found}} on Ometepe Island. It is a Late Polychrome Period ceramic type, {{and it is}} usually found {{in the form of}} jar sherds. This type of ceramic is {{identifiable}} because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>scraped</b> on both the inside and out, and smoothing and polishing is done on the exterior body and rim. The slip, over the rim and outside, is a dull red to brown, while only the inside of the neck is slipped. Lines are cut into the lip of the jar, and triangles are the most common motif, either interlocking or meeting tip to tip. Other ceramic types found on the island include: Granada Polychrome from the Middle Polychrome Period, Castillo Late Polychrome, and Luna Ware Polychrome (Healy, 1980).|$|E

50|$|Tomato paste is {{traditionally}} made {{in parts of}} Sicily, southern Italy and Malta by spreading out a much-reduced tomato sauce on wooden boards that are set outdoors under the hot August sun to dry the paste until it is thick enough, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>scraped</b> up and held together in a richly colored, dark ball. Today, this artisan product is harder to find than the industrial version (which is much thinner).

50|$|The güira is {{most often}} found in merengue tipico where it serves as one of {{multiple}} percussion instruments, most usually interlocking with {{the rhythm of the}} tambora, a fairly small horizontally mounted rustic drum normally played with one stick and one bare hand. Mastering its usual 'correct' playing techniques has been dubbed very challenging. Güireros may use a variety of playing techniques to play various rhythms, however nearly all playing is done with one hand only holding the instrument from its large rounded (to reduce hand fatigue) handle, while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>scraped</b> with the other (dominant) hand holding the brush, which may be made for this purpose, but in practice is typically a metal-tined afro pick hair styling comb, although some players may use a cane- or plastic-toothed scraper.|$|E

50|$|While {{historically}} both chia {{seed oil}} and a waxy substance from an insect larva were both used, today only chia seed oil is used, mixed with mineral or vegetable pigments. Most Guerrero lacquerware is distinguished {{by the use}} of a “scratch” (rayado) technique for decoration, although pieces with inlay or painted motifs are also made. The rayado technique has its origins from Asian pieces brought by the Manila Galleon, but the current incarnation became popular in the 20th century. The technique consists of two or more layers of lacquer of different colors. When the new layer is added on top of the old, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>scraped</b> with a tool such as a quill before it is dried to expose the color underneath in areas. The designs appear to be in relief. The color is generally over a base of red, white or black. The items that are lacquered today include boxes, chests, gourds.|$|E

50|$|A {{chemical}} depilatory is {{a cosmetic}} preparation used to remove {{hair from the}} skin on the body.

5000|$|One {{method of}} {{gathering}} sea salt is to draw seawater into marsh basins or salt pans {{and allow the}} water to evaporate, leaving behind the salt that was dissolved in it. As the water evaporates, most of the salt precipitates out {{on the bottom of}} the marsh or pan (and is later collected as ordinary sea salt), but some salt crystals float on the surface of the water, forming a delicate crust of intricate pyramidal crystals. This is fleur de sel. The delicacy requires that it be harvested by hand, so this is done with traditional methods using traditional tools. In France, the workers who collect fleur de sel are called paludiers, and they employ a wooden rake called a lousse à fleur to gently rake it from the water. In Portugal, a butterfly-shaped sieve called a borboleta is used instead. It is then put in special boxes so that it will dry in the sun, and to avoid disturbing the flakes as it is transported for packaging. Historically, the workers who harvested fleur de sel were women, because it was believed that as the salt crystals were so delicate, they needed to be collected by [...] "the more delicate sex." [...] Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>scraped</b> from the salt marsh like cream from milk, fleur de sel has been called [...] "the cream of the salt pans." [...] It is also called [...] "the caviar of sea salts." ...|$|E

50|$|Heavy-duty tools {{could be}} used as axes for woodworking. Both {{choppers}} and large flakes were probably used for this purpose. Once a branch <b>was</b> separated, <b>it</b> could <b>be</b> <b>scraped</b> clean with a scraper, or hollowed with pointed tools. Such uses are attested by characteristic microscopic alterations of edges used to scrape wood. Oldowan tools could also have been used for preparing hides. Hides must be cut by slicing, piercing and scraping it clean of residues. Flakes are most suitable for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|They {{associate}} additional properties such as: advanced rendering parameters (e.g. specularity, BRDF); physics behavioural properties (such as friction, density); {{or sound}} triggers alongside texture information for surfaces. For example, if a texture makes an object look like wood, it will sound like wood (if something hits <b>it</b> or <b>is</b> <b>scraped</b> along a surface), break like wood, and even float like wood. If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made of metal, it will sound like metal, dent like metal, and sink like metal. This allows more flexibility when making objects in games.|$|R
50|$|Franciscan {{rocks are}} thought to have formed prior to {{creation}} of the San Andreas Fault when an ancient deep-sea trench existed along the California continental margin. This trench, most of which is no longer evident, resulted from subduction of oceanic crust of the Farallon tectonic plate beneath continental crust of the North American Plate. As oceanic crust descended beneath the continent, volcanic rocks, mainly basalt, making up the lower plate, and marine sediments deposited on top of <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>scraped</b> off and accreted (i.e., added) to {{the leading edge of the}} overriding plate. This resulted in widespread deformation with development of thrust faults and folding. Ophiolite (which weathers to serpentine), and rocks altered by high-pressure metamorphism (such as blueschist) were emplaced during this episode. Deformation and emplacement continued during subsequent creation of the San Andreas fault to result in a complex chaotic assemblage of diverse rock types that some refer to as a mélange.|$|R
