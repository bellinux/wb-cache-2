40|$|One of {{the main}} {{components}} of the next generation protected military satellite communication systems is dynamic bandwidth resource allocation (DBRA). A centralized DBRA algorithm on the satellite dynamically grants terminals time and frequency resources as their traffic demands and channel conditions change, leading to significant increase in the overall system throughput. This paper address one potential issue associated with DBRA for the satellite uplink channel, which is a multi-frequency time-division multiple access (MF-TDMA) channel. As DBRA dynamically assigns time-frequency slots to terminals, there may be uneven temporal gaps in the assignment if special care were not taken. When this happens, even though average rate demands can be met, applications may experience larger than desired delay and jitter, which may reduce the quality of certain voice and video applications. This paper presents a novel algorithm for allocating and packing time-frequency slots in a jitter-aware fashion by using groups of <b>evenly</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>slots.</b> The achievable delay and jitter performance is evaluated using an OPNET simulation.

40|$|GEOScan is a {{grassroots}} effort, proposed as globally networked orbiting observation facility utilizing the main Iridium NEXT 66 -satellite constellation. This {{will create a}} revolutionary new capability of massively dense, global geoscience observations and targets elusive questions that scientists have not previously been able to answer, and will not answer, until simultaneous global measurements are made. This effort is enabled by Iridium {{as part of its}} Hosted Payload Program. By developing a common sensor suite the logistical and cost barriers for transmitting massive amounts of data from 66 satellites configured in 6 orbital planes with 11 <b>evenly</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>slots</b> per plane is removed. Each sensor suite of GEOScan's networked orbital observation facility consists of 6 system sensors: a Radiometer to measure Earth's total outgoing radiation; a GPS Compact Total Electron Content Sensor to image Earth's plasma environment and gravity field; a MicroCam Multispectral Imager to measure global cloud cover, vegetation, land use, and bright aurora, and also take the first uniform instantaneous image of the Earth; a Radiation Belt Mapping System (dosimeters) to measure energetic electron and proton distributions; a Compact Earth Observing Spectrometer to measure aerosol-atmospheric composition and vegetation; and MEMS Accelerometers to deduce non-conservative forces aiding gravity and neutral drag studies. Our analysis shows that the instrument suites evaluated in a constellation configuration onboard the Iridium NEXT satellites are poised to provide major breakthroughs in Earth and geospace science. GEOScan commercial-of-the-shelf instruments provide low-cost space situational awareness and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance opportunities. © (2012) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
