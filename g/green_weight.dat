To achieve this objective 440 trees were cubed by the Hohenadl’s method using 10 sections. These trees had ages ranging from 6 to 17 years, and were located in several counties inside the Curitiba (Parana) metropolitan region. The stems from 194 trees were weighed in the field. Samples of bark from these trees were collected, weighed in the field (<b>green</b> <b>weight)</b> and brought to the laboratory for drying until constant weight (dry weight); thus it was calculated the relationship dry weight/green weight of the sample and extrapolation for the whole stem. For the modeling, several mathematical models from the literature for estimating dry weight of Acacia mearnsii were selected. New models based on the forward’s method were also built. Twenty different models were adjusted using the 1 /d²h to weight the arithmetic models with two entries and 1 /d² for the models with single entry. The best models for each case were selected basing on the adjusted coefficient of determination (R²aj), standard error of estimate in percentage (syx %) and on the residual graphic distribution. In general, the new models built with variables most correlated with the respective independent variables were the most precise. The best fitting were obtained for bark volume and <b>green</b> <b>weight,</b> with syx% ranging from 15 to 18 %, and R²aj from 0. 96 to 0. 98.

The {{final moisture content}} profiles and quality of two dried veneer thicknesses A and B (3 and 1. 5 mm in thickness respectively) are determined. Veneer gluability of the two veneer thicknesses, dried by two different methods, are examined. The dimensional stability of veneer and plywood samples made from these dried veneers are also examined. <b>Green</b> <b>weight</b> per unit area {{was used as an}} indicator of moisture content during drying. A wide variation in final moisture content of dried veneer was found to be due to the presence of earlywood and latewood in veneer sample A and juvenile wood in veneer sample B. Green veneer sorting, based on water content per area or volume, <b>green</b> <b>weight</b> per area and percent saturation, can be used to improve drying performance. Statistical analysis indicates that the final veneer moisture content profiles estimated from <b>green</b> <b>weight</b> per unit area for two dried veneer thicknesses A and B dried by microwave, are not significantly different from those under conventional drying. However, the result indicates that microwave drying resulted in a higher degree of moisture content uniformity for both veneer thicknesses, whereas excessive drying occurred on the outer sections for both veneer thicknesses under conventional drying. A dark color was found in the dried veneer of both thicknesses under microwave drying compared to those of conventionally dried veneers. Statistically, both drying methods resulted in similar veneer quality, except microwave drying resulted in better veneer quality with respect to flatness, and has a low flatness ratio. Microwave dried veneer also had low percent shrinkage for both veneer thicknesses compared to conventionally dried veneer samples. Veneer gluability for veneer A is better than for veneer B, higher in the percentage of wood failures and greater glueline shear strength. Microwave drying resulted in better veneer gluability.
