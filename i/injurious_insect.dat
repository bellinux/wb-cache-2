These invasions have averaged about one every five years, although they have occurred at rather irregular intervals. The last one was very destructive and was at its height during the period from 1914 to 1916 [...] A large proportion of such losses is preventable, although no remedy is known which will destroy the pest or save the crop once it has become thoroughly infested.

In the present study, the effect of a UV-absorbing net (Bionet) on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the potato aphid on lettuce plants was evaluated. A field experiment was conducted during three seasons in two identical tunnels divided in four plots. A set of lettuce plants were artificially infested with Macrosiphum euphorbiae adults and the population was estimated by counting aphids on every plant over 7 to 9 weeks. Insect population grew exponentially but a significantly lower aphid density was present on plants grown under the UV-absorbing cover compared to a standard 50 mesh net. Similarly, in laboratory conditions, life table parameters were significantly reduced under the Bionet. Moreover, SADIE analysis showed that the spatial distribution of aphids was effectively limited under the UV-absorbing nets. Our results indicate that UV-absorbing nets should be considered as an important component of lettuce indoor cropping systems preventing pesticide applications and reducing the risk of spread of aphid-borne virus diseases...|$|E
40|$|Diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is {{the most}} <b>injurious</b> <b>insect</b> pest of {{brassica}} crops throughout the world. In many countries it has developed resistance to almost every synthetic insecticide used against it including Bt formulations. In addition to resistance, the destruction of its natural enemies through indiscriminate use of broadspectrum insecticides is considered responsible for its high pest status. Population studies of P. xylostella and its parasitoids in the Eastern Cape, Gauteng and North-West Provinces of South Africa revealed that the pest is naturally controlled if insecticides are not used. A total of 3 egg-larval parasitoids, 8 larval parasitoids, 4 larval-pupal parasitoids, 6 pupal parasitoids and 12 hyperparasitoids {{have been identified as}} being associated with P. xylostella in South Africa. An insecticide check method was used {{to assess the impact of}} parasitoids on levels of infestations by P. xylostella. In the sprayed plots parasitism of P. xylostella larvae and pupae fluctuated between 5 - 10 % whereas in the untreated plots parasitism peaked above 90 %.

40|$|Citation: Houser, John Samuel. Spraying against insect injury a {{prominent}} factor in orchard management. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1904. Introduction: Plants like animals {{seem to be}} more subject to disease and parasitic attack when they appear in large numbers than when found singly, and these attacks seem to increase in proportion to the increase in numbers of the plant grown. For many hundreds of years they were considered to be inevitable that they were uncontrollable as far as the hand of man was concerned. But within the last half century, beginning about the time when Paris green was found to successfully combat the Colorado potato beetle (Doryphora decemlineata Say) in America, and a few years later when a mixture of copper sulfate, milk and water was accidentally found in France to prevent downy mildew on the grape, (Peronspora viticola B. & C.), men began to believe that it might be possible, at least in a measure, to control them. Having come to this supposition they at once began experimenting that they might determine with some degree of definiteness to what extent their theory would hold good. As a result of this movement, they not only arrived at the positive conclusion that many of our most <b>injurious</b> <b>insect</b> and plant diseases may be controlled if properly treated, but also many different spraying mixtures were discovered...|$|E
40|$|Mulsant, is {{the most}} <b>injurious</b> <b>insect</b> pest of beans. The adults are 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 long, {{slightly}} oval and yellow-ish with 16 black spots on their wing covers (elytra). The adults look like large ladybird beetles and are classified in the ladybird beetle family, Coccinellidae. While the Mexican bean beetle and the closely related squash beetle feed on plants, other ladybird beetle spe-cies prey on insects and mites. Life History The adult Mexican bean beetle overwinters under leaves or other debris in grassy, weedy areas and around fence rows or trees. The adults move into the bean fields and gardens soon after the bean plants emerge. The adults feed {{for a week or}} two before laying their yellow egg masses on the underside of the leaves. The eggs hatch in five to 14 days. The bright yellow larvae are oval-shaped with six rows of branched spines. The larvae feed for two to five weeks. Larvae and adults feed on all types of beans and are an occasional pest of soybeans. They generally feed on the underside of leaves, removing all of the leaf tissue except the clear layer on the upper side of the leaf, called the epidermis. This damage, called “window-paning, ” gives the leaves a lacelike or skeletonized ap-pearance. The remaining leaf tissue turns brown in a couple of days, giving the field a burnt cast. New pods and stems are often attacked, and severely damaged plants may die prematurely. Control Early-maturing bean varieties and fall plantings allow crops to escape most of the serious Mexican bean beetle damage occurring in July and August. Destroying old plants and removing pods promptly will aid in slowing the buildup of Mexican bean beetle populations. Treatment is needed if populations of Mexican bean beetle...|$|E
