40|$|Trivalent oral <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccine</b> (roPV) {{has been}} used in Gaza since 1967. After an ini-tial {{decrease}} of 33 % in the incidence of the paralytic disease, no further decrease could be noted. The mean annual incidence until 1977 was 10 per 100, 000 inhabitants. Two outbreaks caused by poliovirus type 1 were registered in 1974 and 1976 with an incidence of 18 per 100, 000 inhabitants. In these outbreaks, 34 % and 50070 of the affected chil-dren, respectively, had receivedthree to four doses of ropy.

40|$|To {{secure a}} polio-free world, the live {{attenuated}} oral <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) will eventually {{need to be}} replaced with <b>inactivated</b> <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> (IPV). However, current IPV delivery is less suitable for campaign use than OPV, and more expensive. We are progressing a microarray patch delivery platform, the Nanopatch, as an easy-to-use device to administer vaccines, including IPV. The Nanopatch contains an ultra-high density array (10, 000 /cm(2)) of short (similar to 230 mu m) microprojections that delivers dry coated vaccine into the skin. Here, we compare the relative immunogenicity of Nanopatch immunisation versus intramuscular injection in rats, using monovalent and trivalent formulations of IPV. Nanopatch delivery elicits faster antibody response kinetics, with high titres of neutralising antibody after just one (IPV 2) or two (IPV 1 and IPV 3) immunisations, while IM injection requires two (IPV 2) or three (IPV 1 and IPV 3) immunisations to induce similar responses. Seroconversion to each poliovirus type was seen in 100 % of rats that received similar to 1 / 40 th of a human dose of IPV delivered by Nanopatch, but not in rats given similar to 1 / 8 th or similar to 1 / 40 th dose by IM injection.

40|$|An assay for the {{evaluation}} of protective properties of <b>inactivated</b> <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> (IPVs) in transgenic (Tg) mice susceptible to poliovirus has been developed and optimized for type 2 IPV. This method was used to compare the immunogenicity and protective properties of experimental IPV produced from the attenuated Sabin strain (sIPV) with those of conventional IPV (cIPV) produced from the wild-type (wt) poliovirus MEF- 1 strain. Modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to measure immune response in serum and saliva samples from test mice. Tg mice were vaccinated and were challenged either with wt poliovirus or virulent poliovirus derived from the vaccine strain. Compared with cIPV, sIPV induced lower levels of antibodies and did not completely protect mice against challenge with wt virus but did protect mice against challenge with the virulent vaccine-derived strain. This may be due to an 18 % nucleotide difference between the MEF- 1 and Sabin 2 strains, resulting in 72 amino acid substitutions and leading to antigenic dissimilarity. Immunological properties of both strains, revealed by cross-neutralization tests and ELISAs, confirmed that MEF- 1 possesses broader immunogenicity than does Sabin 2.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionReplacing live-attenuated oral <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> (OPV) with <b>inactivated</b> <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> (IPV) {{is part of}} {{the global}} {{strategy}} to eradicate poliomyelitis. China was declared polio-free in 2000 but continues to record cases of vaccine-associated-poliomyelitis and vaccine-derived-poliovirus outbreaks. Two pilot safety studies and two larger immunogenicity trials evaluated the non-inferiority of IPV (Poliorix‚Ñ¢, GSK Vaccines, Belgium) versus OPV in infants and booster vaccination in toddlers primed with either IPV or OPV in China. MethodsIn pilot safety studies, 25 infants received 3 -dose IPV primary vaccination (Study A, www. clinicaltrial. gov NCT 00937404) and 25 received an IPV booster after priming with three OPV doses (Study B, NCT 01021293). In the randomised, controlled immunogenicity and safety trial (Study C, NCT 00920439), infants received 3 -dose primary vaccination with IPV (N= 541) or OPV (N= 535) at 2, 3, 4 months of age, and a booster IPV dose at 18 - 24 months (N= 470, Study D, NCT 01323647 : extension of study C). Blood samples were collected before and one month post-dose- 3 and booster. Reactogenicity was assessed using diary cards. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were captured throughout each study. ResultsStudy A and B showed that IPV priming and IPV boosting (after OPV) was safe. Study C: One month post-dose- 3, all IPV and ‚â• 98. 3 % OPV recipients had seroprotective antibody titres towards each poliovirus type. The immune response elicited by IPV was non-inferior to Chinese OPV. Seroprotective antibody titres persisted in ‚â• 94. 7 % IPV and ‚â• 96. 1 % OPV recipients at 18 ‚Äì 24 months (Study D). IPV had a clinically acceptable safety profile in all studies. Grade 3 local and systemic reactions were uncommon. No SAEs were related to IPV administration. ConclusionTrivalent IPV is non-inferior to OPV in terms of seroprotection (in the Chinese vaccination schedule) in infant and toddlers, with a clinically acceptable safety profile...|$|R

A total of 1685 infants were enrolled; 24 -week serum specimens were available for 1291 infants (77 %). Across the study sites at 24 weeks of age, the proportion of seropositive children in the combined schedule group was 95 - 99 % for type 1, 99 - 100 % for type 2, and 97 - 100 % for type 3.

In the Gambia and Oman, seroprevalences in the IPV group were lower for type 1 (significantly lower in the Gambia); significantly lower for type 2; and significantly higher for type 3, compared with the OPV group.

Studies of mucosal immunity induced by oral <b>poliovirus</b> (OPV) or <b>inactivated</b> <b>poliovirus</b> (IPV) <b>vaccines</b> and mixed schedules thereof will determine the effectiveness of different vaccine strategies to block virus shedding. We used samples from a clinical trial of different vaccination schedules to measure intestinal immunity as judged by neutralisation of virus and virus-specific IgA in stools. MethodsIn the FIDEC trial, Latin American infants {{were randomly assigned to}} nine groups to assess the efficacy of two schedules of bivalent OPV (bOPV) and IPV and challenge with monovalent type 2 OPV, and stools samples were collected. We selected three groups of particular interest‚Äîthe bOPV control group (serotypes 1 and 3 at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), the trivalent attenuated OPV (tOPV) control group (tOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), and the bOPV‚ÄìIPV group (bOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks plus IPV at 14 weeks). Neutralising activity and poliovirus type-specific IgA were measured in stool after a monovalent OPV type 2 challenge at 18 weeks of age. Mucosal immunity was measured by in-vitro neutralisation of a type 2 polio pseudovirus (PV 2). Neutralisation titres and total and poliovirus-type-specific IgG and IgA concentrations in stools were assessed in samples collected before challenge and 2 weeks after challenge from all participants. Findings 210 infants from Guatemala and Dominican Republic were included in this analysis. Of 38 infants tested for mucosal antibody in the tOPV group, two were shedding virus 1 week after challenge, compared with 59 of 85 infants receiving bOPV (p< 0 ¬∑ 0001) and 53 of 87 infants receiving bOPV‚ÄìIPV (p< 0 ¬∑ 0001). Mucosal type 2 neutralisation and type-specific IgA were noted primarily in response to tOPV. An inverse correlation was noted between virus shedding and both serum type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p< 0 ¬∑ 0001) and mucosal type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p< 0 ¬∑ 0001). InterpretationMucosal type- 2 -specific antibodies can be measured in stool and develop in response to receipt of OPV type 2 either in the primary vaccine series or at challenge.

40|$|No <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccines</b> can be {{expected}} to eliminate the paralytic poliomye. litis that is caused by nonpolio enteroviruses or the cases that have been and continue to be diagnosed erroneously as paralytic poliomyelitis. Polioviruses have ~een re~~vered from the feces of patients with paralytic disease that is definitely not poliomyelitis, and very rare cases of so-called "vaccine-associated " paralytic disease cannot be regarded as hav-ing been caused by the vaccine virus when it is present in the feces and even more so when no virus is recovered. Surveys for residual poliomyelitis paralysis in tropical coun-tries indicate an average annual incidence that is as high or higher than in the United States in the prevaccine era. Oral <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccine</b> has eliminated paralytic poliomyelitis caused by polioviruses in many temperat~-climate countrie ~ in which a large proportion of children remain unvaccinated or incompletely. vaccmated: Oral <b>poliovirus</b> <b>vaccine</b> can also eliminate paralytic poliomyelitis from tropical countnes but a different strategy is needed for using the vaccine.
