Ziegler led a program of work at IBM which culminated in the publication of a number of papers (Ziegler and Lanford, 1979) demonstrating that cosmic rays also could cause soft errors. Indeed, in modern devices, cosmic rays may be the predominant cause. Although the primary particle of the cosmic ray does not generally reach the Earth's surface, it creates a shower of energetic secondary particles. At the Earth's surface approximately 95% of the particles capable of causing soft errors are energetic neutrons with the remainder composed of protons and pions.IBM estimated in 1996 that one error per month per 256 MiB of ram was expected for a desktop computer.This flux of energetic neutrons is typically referred to as [...] "cosmic rays" [...] in the soft error literature.

Further, we show that a small perturbation of a single critical parameter can bias this architecture into functioning like a graded response, a bistable switch, an oscillator, or a pulse generator.

In addition, a deficit in the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been hypothesized. The risk gene neuregulin 1 may play a major role in this process. We demonstrated a higher expression of the NMDA receptor subunit 2 D in the right cerebellar regions of schizophrenia patients, which may be a secondary upregulation due to a dysfunctional receptor. In contrast, the neuregulin 1 risk variant containing at least one C-allele was associated with decreased expression of NMDA receptor subunit 2 C, leading to a dysfunction of the NMDA receptor, which in turn may lead to a dysfunction of the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) system. Accordingly, from post-mortem studies, there is accumulating evidence that GABAergic signaling is decreased in the cerebellum of schizophrenia patients. As patients in these studies are treated with antipsychotics long term, we evaluated the effect of long-term haloperidol and clozapine treatment in an animal model.

Among these attacks, fault attacks can be used to <b>disturb</b> the <b>circuit</b> while performing a computation to retrieve the secret. Among possible means of injecting a fault, laser beams have proven to be accurate and powerful. The laser can be used to illuminate the circuit either from its frontside (i. e., where metal interconnections are first encountered) or from the backside (i. e., through the substrate). Historically, frontside injection was preferred because it does not require the die to be thinned. Nevertheless, due to the increasing integration of metal layers in modern technologies, frontside injections do not allow targeting of any desired location. Indeed, metal lines act as mirrors, and they reflect and refract most of the energy provided by the laser beam. Conversely, backside injections, although more difficult to set up, allow an increase of the resolution of the target location and remove the drawbacks of the frontside technique. This article compares experimental results from frontside and backside fault injections. The effectiveness of the two techniques is measured in terms of exploitable errors on an AES circuit (i. e., errors {{that can be used to}} extract the value of the secret key used during the encryption process).

40|$|Abstract—A {{modeling}} of the metallic wires susceptibility facing to the disturbances caused by electromagnetic (EM) near-field (NF) radiated by electronic structures in radio frequencies (RF) is introduced {{by using a}} hybrid method. This latter {{is based on the}} use of the given EM-data calculated or determined from the standard computation tools associated with basic analytical methods expressing the coupling voltages at the victim wire extremities and the EM-NF radiations. In difference to the classical methods based on the far-field radiations, the main benefit of this method lies on the possibility to take into account the evanescent waves from the disturbing elements. The basic principle illustrating the hybrid method principle is explained. To verify the relevance of the method proposed, we consider a metallic wire having cm-length above the ground plane disturbed by the EM-near-waves from the electronic circuits in proximity. For that, we model the EM radiation of the <b>disturbing</b> electronic <b>circuits</b> and then, apply the hybrid method to evaluate the coupling voltages induced through the wires. By considering the radiations around hundreds MHz, we demonstrate that the hybrid method proposed enables us to generate voltages in good agreement with the simulations performed with the commercial tools. Two types of realistic configurations are studied. First, with a microstrip loop circuit radiating at about 0. 7 GHz, we calculated induced voltages at the extremities of the structures.

Therefore robustness of cellular control circuits {{seems to be a}} general, essential feature. The same property however provides a challenge to the investigator because it hinders the estimation of kinetic parameters and thus the quantitative understanding of cellular regulation. The current study investigated the value of mathematical modeling in the elucidation of cellular control circuits under these constraints. A subsystem responsible for mitotic control in budding yeast cell cycle regulation was chosen as example. On the basis of scare quantitative experimental data we were able to develop a detailed mechanistic model. The model showed desirable descriptive and predictive character. For instance, model predictions agreed well with experimental observations without additional parameter adaptation. Furthermore, the model allowed for specifying barely characterized regulatory interactions. Determination of parameter estimation accuracy subsequently showed that the information content of the data available was much higher than generally expected. Combined data for wild type and for variants with only five measured variables lead to acceptable estimates for about half of the 114 kinetic parameters in this complex model. Analysis also proved, that the combination of data from the unperturbed and the <b>disturbed</b> control <b>circuit</b> was essential for this outcome. Parameter estimation accuracy additionally gives a quantitative measure for robustness, which in our case strongly supports the concept of highly optimized tolerance, i. e. of the co-existence of robustness and fragility in cellular control.

As a result, huge amounts of power is drawn by the power source, which causes high disturbances. A voltage buffer always has a very high input impedance, approaching infinity; as a result, no matter what value the load impedance is, the source voltage will be totally spanned on the buffer impedance(because of Ohm's law); the voltage across the buffer impedance is the input voltage. Because the resistance is infinity, the circuit will draw very little current, and will not <b>disturb</b> the original <b>circuit.</b> Because the output current is generated by the voltage source via buffer, the buffer acts as a barrier between the source and load, thus preventing the load resistance affecting the source network.|$|R

Voxel-based morphometric analysis using the Brain Analysis Morphological Mapping (BAMM) software package was employed to explore alterations of the regional grey (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes in EOS patients.

Results: EOS patients had significantly reduced GM volume in the left parahippocampal, inferior frontal, and superior temporal gyri, compared with the controls. They also had less WM volume in the left posterior limb of the internal capsule and the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. The positive symptom score of PANSS (higher values corresponding to more severe symptoms) was negatively related to GM volume in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} hybrid non isolated/ non {{inverting}} Nx interleaved DC-DC multilevel Boost Converter {{for renewable energy}} applications is presented. The presented hybrid topology {{is derived from the}} conventional interleaved converter and the Nx Multilevel boost converter. In renewable energy applications, generated energy cannot be directly used at application end. In most of the cases it needs to be stepped up with DC-DC converter at operating voltage levels as per the requirement of the application. Though conventional boost converter can theoretically be used for this purpose, but obtaining such high gain implies that boost converter should operate at it its maximum duty cycle, which is not feasible due to the great variations in the output voltage caused by small variations in the duty cycle, leading the boost converter to instability and also increases the voltage stress across switches. The advantages of presenting topology of DC-DC converter are high voltage conversion, reduce ripple, low voltage stress, non inverting without utilizing the high duty and transformer.

The behavioral tests electronic von-Frey and Walking track test were carried out. For immunohistochemistry we used markers to detect different synapse profiles as well as glial reaction. The behavioral results showed a significant decrease in sensory and motor function after lesion. The reimplantation decreased glial reaction and improved synaptic plasticity of afferent inputs. Cell therapy further enhanced the rewiring process. In addition, both reimplanted groups presented twice as much motor control compared to the non-treated group.

Conclusion Our findings of regional volume alterations of GM and WM in EOS patients coincide with those of previous studies of adult onset schizophrenia patients. However, in brain regions that had no overall structural differences between EOS patients and controls (that is, the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus, the right thalamus, the cerebellum, and the pons), within-subject analysis of EOS patients alone revealed that there were significant associations of the volume in these areas and the symptom severity. These findings suggest that at an early stage of the illness, especially for those with onset before brain maturation, a wide range of <b>disturbed</b> neural <b>circuits,</b> including these brain regions that show no apparent morphological changes, may contribute to the formation of the symptomatology. </p...|$|R
50|$|In 808, at Li Jiang's and Pei's suggestion, Emperor Xianzong, when declaring {{a general}} pardon, did not send eunuchs {{out to the}} {{circuits}} as messengers, to avoid the eunuchs demanding bribes and <b>disturbing</b> the <b>circuits.</b> In 809, during a drought, Li Jiang and fellow imperial scholar Bai Juyi made several recommendations — decreasing taxes, decreasing the number of ladies in waiting, disallowing regional governors from submitting tributes (so {{that they would not}} extract wealth from the people), and the banning of slave-capture in the southern regions of the realm. Emperor Xianzong accepted their suggestions. In 809, at the suggestion of Li Jiang and his fellow imperial scholars that Emperor Xianzong should have a crown prince, Emperor Xianzong created his oldest son Li Ning crown prince. Later that year, when the military governor Pei Jun (裴均) submitted a tribute of silver vessels despite the regulations banning the tributes, Li Jiang and Bai pointed out to Emperor Xianzong that if his edicts were to be taken seriously, he needed to decline the tribute; Emperor Xianzong thus transferred the silver vessels to the bureau of finances, but thereafter ordered the circuits not to inform the imperial censors on tributes, despite Bai's objections. Meanwhile, as Wang Shizhen the military governor of Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), had just recently died, Emperor Xianzong considered using the opportunity to seize control of Chengde (which had been ruled in a de facto independence from the imperial government), rather than allowing Wang's son Wang Chengzong to inherit the circuit. Li Jiang and the other imperial scholars opposed, pointing out that Chengde would be more difficult of a target than Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), then ruled by Wu Shaoyang. However, Emperor Xianzong, persuaded by the powerful eunuch Tutu Chengcui, prepared for a campaign against Chengde anyway. Meanwhile, later that year, after Tutu headed a project to rebuild Anguo Temple (安國寺) and built a grand monument, intending to use it to praise Emperor Xianzong, Li Jiang pointed out that in history, the truly great rulers did not establish monuments for themselves. Emperor Xianzong thus ordered the monument destroyed.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence relating thalamic {{changes to the}} generation and/or maintenance of neuropathic pain. We have recently reported that neuropathic orofacial pain is associated with altered thalamic anatomy, biochemistry, and activity, which may result in <b>disturbed</b> thalamocortical oscillatory <b>circuits.</b> Despite this evidence, {{it is possible that}} these thalamic changes are not responsible for the presence of pain per se, but result {{as a consequence of the}} injury. To clarify this subject, we compared brain activity and biochemistry in 12 people with below-level neuropathic pain after complete thoracic spinal cord injury with 11 people with similar injuries and no neuropathic pain and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. Quantitative arterial spinal labelling was used to measure thalamic activity, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine changes in neuronal variability quantifying N-acetylaspartate and alterations in inhibitory function quantifying gamma amino butyric acid. This study revealed that the presence of neuropathic pain is associated with significant changes in thalamic biochemistry and neuronal activity. More specifically, the presence of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury is associated with significant reductions in thalamic N-acetylaspartate, gamma amino butyric acid content, and blood flow in the region of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Spinal cord injury on its own did not account for these changes. These findings support the hypothesis that neuropathic pain is associated with altered thalamic structure and function, which may disturb central processing and play a key role in the experience of neuropathic pain.

40|$|MHRD PhD scholarshipWith Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs) pervading our lives, {{security}} issues are {{emerging as a}} serious problem and attacks against these systems are becoming more critical and sophisticated. We have designed and implemented different hardware based solutions to ensure security of an MPSoC. Security assisting modules can be implemented at different abstraction levels of an MPSoC design. We propose solutions both at circuit level and system level of abstractions. At the VLSI circuit level abstraction, we consider the problem of presence of noise voltage in input signal coming from outside world. This noise voltage <b>disturbs</b> the normal <b>circuit</b> operation inside a chip causing false logic reception. If the disturbance is caused intentionally {{the security of a}} chip may be compromised causing glitch/transient attack. We propose an input receiver with hysteresis characteristic that can work at voltage levels between 0. 9 V and 5 V. The circuit can protect the MPSoC from glitch/transient attack. At the system level, we propose solutions targeting Network-on-Chip (NoC) as the on-chip communication medium. We survey the possible attack scenarios on present-day MPSoCs and investigate a new attack scenario, i. e., router attack targeted toward NoC enabled MPSoC. We propose different monitoring-based countermeasures against routing table-based router attack in an MPSoC having multiple Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Software attacks, {{the most common type of}} attacks, mainly exploit vulnerabilities like buffer overflow. This is possible if proper access control to memory is absent in the system. We propose four hardware based mechanisms to implement Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model in NoC based MPSoC...|$|R
