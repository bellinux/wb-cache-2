5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 {{would be hard-pressed to}} imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from the total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys 21 point {{comeback}} {{win against}} the Rams {{was a new}} Cowboys record for the largest point deficit that a Cowboys team has <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from and won - {{in a game that}} didn't go into overtime. It also became the third 21-point comeback victory in Cowboys history. The other two coming in overtime in 1984 against New Orleans and 1999 against Washington.|$|E
25|$|The Bulls then {{advanced}} {{to face the}} Detroit Pistons, marking {{the first time the}} Central Division rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991. The Pistons won the first three games including a big comeback in Game 3. No NBA team had <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from a 0–3 deficit to win the series, but the Bulls avoided a sweep by winning Game 4 by 10 points. The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit, and had a chance to make NBA history. But they lost at home in game 6 by 10, and the Pistons won the series 4–2 on May 17.|$|E

25|$|A fellow Liverpudlian, Jackie Lomax {{signed to}} the Beatles' Apple Publishing as an {{in-house}} songwriter in 1967, writing songs and recording demos at the company's original headquarters, on Baker Street in central London. John Lennon {{was the first}} to suggest he should consider becoming a solo artist, and with the formation of Apple Records in early 1968, George Harrison committed to producing an album by Lomax on the new label. Lomax later admitted he was concerned that the album might never get made since he was unsure whether Harrison would <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from India, where the Beatles were attending the Maharishi's Transcendental Meditation course in the early months of 1968.|$|E
25|$|Leonard had 20 {{points and}} 14 rebounds in another rout of the Heat, as the Spurs won 107–86 {{to take a}} 3–1 lead in the series; no team had <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from a 3–1 deficit in the Finals until two years later. San Antonio again built a large lead on the road before halftime, taking a 55–33 lead {{in the second quarter}} after scoring seven {{consecutive}} points, culminated by a soaring dunk by Leonard. The Spurs defense held Miami to just 35 percent shooting in the first half after allowing the Heat to shoot 50 percent overall in the prior game. The Heat had followed their prior 13 playoff losses with a win.|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{claimed he}} [...] "didn't start {{thinking}} about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved {{back and forth on}} the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E

[...] When Bakshi returned to the United States, {{he learned that the}} cost of developing blown-up prints of each frame had risen. He did not want to repeat the process that had been used on Wizards, which was unsuitable for the level of detail he intended for The Lord of the Rings, so Bakshi and camera technician Ted Bemiller created their own photographic enlarger to process the footage cheaply. Live-action special effects and analog optics were used in place of animation to keep the visual effects budget low and give the film a more realistic look. Among the voice actors was the well-regarded John Hurt, who performed the role of Aragorn. The project's high-profile brought heavy trade journal coverage, and fans such as Mick Jagger visited the studio for the chance to play a role. Animator Carl Bell loved drawing Aragorn so much that Bakshi gave Bell the live-action costume, which he wore while animating.|$|E
500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to come back in the days he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I was alone in the end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and I dropped the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E

500|$|In Russell's {{penultimate}} season, the 1967–68 season, {{his numbers}} slowly declined, but at age 34, he still tallied 12.5 {{points per game}} and 18.6 rebounds per game (the latter good for the third highest average in the league). In the Eastern Division Finals, the 76ers had the better record than the Celtics and were slightly favored. But then, national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. With eight of the ten starting players on Sixers and Celtics being African American, both teams were in deep shock, and there were calls to cancel the series. In a game called as [...] "unreal" [...] and [...] "devoid of emotion", the Sixers lost 127–118 on April 5. In Game 2, Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 win, and in Games 3 and 4, the Sixers won, with Chamberlain suspiciously often defended by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry, causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down. Prior to Game 5, the Celtics seemed dead: no NBA team had <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from a 3–1 deficit. However, the Celtics rallied back, winning Game 5 122–104 and Game 6 114–106, powered by a spirited Havlicek and helped by a terrible Sixers shooting slump. In Game 7, 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making {{it the first time}} in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3–1. Russell limited Chamberlain to only two shot attempts in the second half. Despite this, the Celtics were leading only 97–95 with 34 seconds left when Russell closed out the game with several consecutive clutch plays. He made a free throw, blocked a shot by Sixers player Chet Walker, grabbed a rebound off a miss by Sixers player Hal Greer, and finally passed the ball to teammate Sam Jones, who scored to clinch the win. Boston then beat the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 in the NBA Finals, giving Russell his tenth title in 12 years. For his efforts Russell was named Sports Illustrateds Sportsman of the Year. After losing for the fifth straight time against Russell and his Celtics, Hall-of-Fame Lakers guard Jerry West stated, [...] "If I had a choice of any basketball player in the league, my No.1 choice has to be Bill Russell. Bill Russell never ceases to amaze me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Angels nearly {{reached the}} World Series in the 1982 postseason. Reggie Jackson, who {{previously}} starred for the Oakland Athletics and the New York Yankees, joined the Angels {{that year and}} teamed with many holdovers from the 1979 team for the 1982 effort. The team was helmed by manager Gene Mauch, who would also manage the team during their [...] postseason appearance. After clinching their second AL West championship, the Angels won {{the first two games}} of the best-of-five ALCS against the AL East champion Milwaukee Brewers — then promptly dropped the next three in a row to lose the series. As Steve Bisheff wrote in Tales from the Angels Dugout, [...] "No team in history had <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from an 0–2 deficit to win in a best-of-five series. Of course, no team had ever faced the Angels in that situation." [...] (At that time, the team with home field advantage played the first two games on the road before hosting the final three games at home, a format that was changed following the [...] season. In subsequent years, the same has happened to other teams.) ...|$|E
