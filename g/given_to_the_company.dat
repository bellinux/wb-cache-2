2500|$|Initially, {{landscaping}} of {{the grounds}} was <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> of Frederick Law Olmsted, who had designed Manhattan's Central Park. [...] Rockefeller Senior was unhappy with this work however and assumed control of the design himself, transplanting whole mature trees, designing lookouts and the several scenic winding roads. In 1906, the further design of Kykuit's grounds was undertaken by the architect William Welles Bosworth, who designed the surrounding terraces and gardens with fountains, pavilions and classical sculpture. These gardens in the Beaux-Arts style are considered Bosworth's best work in the United States, looking out over very fine views of the Hudson River. His original gardens still exist, with plantings carefully replaced over time, although his entrance forecourt was extended in 1913. The terraced gardens include a Morning Garden, Grand Staircase, Japanese Garden, Italian Garden, Japanese-style brook, Japanese Tea-house, large Oceanus fountain, Temple of Aphrodite, loggia, and semicircular rose garden.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman had}} an answer to this appeal very clearly set forth in her mind though {{she was unable to}} produce it clearly in words. When the {{marriage}} had been first discussed she had opposed it with all her power, because she had believed the man to be wicked. He was unregenerate;--and when she had put it to her husband and to the Nicholases and to the Daniels to see whether such was not the case, they had not contradicted her. It was acknowledged that he was such a one as Robert,--a worldly man all round. And then he was worse than Robert, having been a spendthrift, a gambler, and, if the rumours which had reached them were true, <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> of loose women. She had striven with all her might that such a one {{should not be allowed to}} take her daughter from her, and had striven in vain. He had succeeded;--but his character was not changed by his success. Did she not know him to be chaff that must be separated by the wind from the corn and then consumed in the fire? His character was not altered because that human being whom she loved the best in all the world had fallen into his power. He was not the less chaff,--the less likely to be burned. That her daughter should become chaff also,--ah, there was the agony of it! If instead of taking the husband and wife together she could even now separate them,--would it not be her duty to do so? Of all duties would it not be the first? Let the misery here be what it might, what was that to eternal misery or to eternal bliss? When therefore she was asked whether she would be doing evil were she to be gracious to her own son-in-law, she was quite, quite sure that any such civility would be a sin. The man was pitch,--though she had been coerced by the exigencies of a worldly courtesy to deny that she had intended to say so. He was pitch to her, and she declared to herself that were she to touch him she would be denied. But she knew not in what language to explain all this. 'What you call graciousness, Hester, is an obligation of which religion knows nothing,' she said after a pause.|$|E
