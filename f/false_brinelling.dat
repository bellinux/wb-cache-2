50|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion {{has been extensively}} discussed in the literature. The main difference is that <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> occurs under lubricated and fretting under dry contact conditions. Between <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion also exists a time-dependend connection.|$|E
50|$|Bearings {{of modern}} wind {{turbines}} are often affected by <b>false</b> <b>brinelling.</b> Especially the pitch bearing, {{which is used}} under oscillation, shows often <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> damages.|$|E
50|$|<b>False</b> <b>brinelling</b> is {{a bearing}} {{damage caused by}} fretting, with or without corrosion, that causes {{imprints}} that look similar to brinelling, but are caused by a different mechanism. <b>False</b> <b>brinelling</b> may occur in bearings which act under small oscillations or vibrations.|$|E

50|$|A similar-looking kind {{of damage}} is called <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> and {{is caused by}} {{fretting}} wear. This occurs when contacting bodies vibrate {{against each other in}} the presence of very small loads, which pushes lubricant out of the contact surface area, and the bearing assembly cannot move far enough to redistribute the displaced lubricant. The result is a finely polished surface that resembles a brinell mark, but has not permanently deformed either contacting surface. This type of <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> usually occurs in bearings during transportation, between the time of manufacture and installation. The polished surfaces are often mistaken for brinelling, although no actual damage to the bearing exists. The <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> will disappear after a short break-in period of operation.|$|E
50|$|<b>False</b> <b>brinelling</b> {{was first}} {{mentioned}} by Almen in 1937. Almen found that wheel bearings were damaged {{before they were}} used by customers. Furthermore, {{he found that the}} bearings were more damaged for long-distance shipping of the cars and that the season of shipping also had an influence. The reason for the damaged bearings were micro-oscillations which occurred due to the shipping. Because the damage has a similar look to brinelling, it was called <b>false</b> <b>brinelling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{load and}} {{operating}} situation of pitch bearings are for rolling element bearings comparatively unfavorable. The bearings {{are exposed to}} high loads and small reciprocating movements created by the pitch system or vibrations from the wind profile. The small reciprocating movements between rolling elements and raceway can lead to wear phenomena like <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion. Furthermore, the high loads can lead to truncation of the contact ellipse. Due to the small reciprocating movements calculation methods to estimate the bearing service life [...] and the friction torque are not useable for pitch bearings. Newer controlling concepts of pitch control, like individual pitch control, will lead to smaller and more frequent oscillation amplitudes which could favor <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> and fretting corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|Until recently, bicycle {{headsets}} {{tended to}} suffer from <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> in the [...] "straight ahead" [...] steering position, due to small movements caused by flexing of the fork. Good modern headsets incorporate a plain bearing to accommodate this flexing, leaving the ball race to provide pure rotational movement.|$|E
50|$|Also if {{a bearing}} is not rotating, {{oscillating}} {{forces on the}} bearing can cause impact damage to the bearing race or the rolling elements, known as brinelling. A second lesser form called <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> occurs if the bearing only rotates across a short arc and pushes lubricant out away from the rolling elements.|$|E
50|$|Doyoyo's honors thesis was on {{the design}} and {{construction}} of mechanical equipment to investigate <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> of heavy-duty bearings in electric motors. Having completed his requirements of a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering before graduation, he was admitted by Brown University as a visiting undergraduate student, taking graduate courses in solid mechanics, materials science, and applied mathematics. He earned masters' degrees in solid mechanics and applied mathematics in 1995 and 1996, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} {{is to have a}} 45 degree interface in the headset where this flexing movement can be accommodated, preserving the relative alignment of the races and allowing the ball bearings to take pure axial and rotational loads. Shimano cartridge bearing headsets do this by allowing the cartridges to move relative to the pressed-in cups, while Stronglight roller bearing headsets, and most threadless headsets, now have loose upper and lower races which can move relative to the cups. Modern headsets, therefore, rarely suffer from <b>false</b> <b>brinelling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{often work}} well in non-ideal conditions, but sometimes minor problems cause bearings to fail quickly and mysteriously. For example, with a stationary (non-rotating) load, small vibrations can gradually press out the lubricant between the races and rollers or balls (<b>false</b> <b>brinelling).</b> Without lubricant the bearing fails, {{even though it is}} not rotating and thus is apparently not being used. For these sorts of reasons, much of bearing design is about failure analysis. Vibration based analysis can be used for fault identification of bearings.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{cause of}} <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> {{is that the}} design of the bearing does not have a method for {{redistribution}} of lubricant without large rotational movement of all bearing surfaces in the raceway. Lubricant is pushed out of a loaded region during small oscillatory movements and vibration where the bearings surfaces repeatedly do not move very far. Without lubricant, wear is increased when the small oscillatory movements occur again. It is possible for the resulting wear debris to oxidize and form an abrasive compound which further accelerates wear.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there are}} many other {{apparent}} causes of bearing failure, most can be reduced to these three. For example, a bearing which is run dry of lubricant fails not because it is [...] "without lubricant", but because lack of lubrication leads to fatigue and welding, and the resulting wear debris can cause abrasion. Similar events occur in <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> damage. In high speed applications, the oil flow also reduces the bearing metal temperature by convection. The oil becomes the heat sink for the friction losses generated by the bearing.|$|E
5000|$|Rolling element {{bearing life}} is {{determined}} by load, temperature, maintenance, lubrication, material defects, contamination, handling, installation and other factors. These factors can all {{have a significant effect}} on bearing life. For example, the service life of bearings in one application was extended dramatically by changing how the bearings were stored before installation and use, as vibrations during storage caused lubricant failure even when the only load on the bearing was its own weight; [...] the resulting damage is often <b>false</b> <b>brinelling.</b> [...] Bearing life is statistical: several samples of a given bearing will often exhibit a bell curve of service life, with a few samples showing significantly better or worse life. Bearing life varies because microscopic structure and contamination vary greatly even where macroscopically they seem identical.|$|E
5000|$|On {{bicycles}} ridden only in dry conditions and/or with fenders, {{the normal}} failure mode is a progressive notchiness in the steering, described as [...] "indexing" [...] in the bicycle world, caused by pitting {{of the races}} or <b>false</b> <b>brinelling,</b> although the term stems from a misunderstanding of the cause; true brinelling is caused merely by pressing the ball axially into the race, and {{it is almost impossible}} to replicate this damage even by striking the fork crown repeatedly with a hammer. The pits are by far deepest at the front and back of the head tube, and are actually caused by flexing of the fork blades, which is transmitted to the steerer tube. This misaligns the bearings and causes fretting, a small amplitude, large stress movement which tears metal from the races at the points where the balls rest.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) occurs due to {{the result}} of cyclic stress developed during operation and mechanism that involve in fretting failure of rolling element bearing. As bearing raceways of non-rotating rolling element bearings exposed to vibration or sliding oscillation <b>false</b> <b>Brinelling</b> occurs. Bearing surface due to <b>false</b> <b>Brinelling</b> tends to damage within a short period, due to cavities created on the bearing raceway. Recommendation towards enhancement of bearing life is also suggested...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the concept of {{physical}} mesomechanics, which allows any plastic shear in the stressed body to be considered as a loss of shear stability of the material in local stress concentration zones. This approach, which is physically very well-grounded, allowed us to consider from one standpoint the processes of machining by cutting and wear of steels. Physical and mechanical regularities in the effect of certain processing operations on the shape and roughness of the hydraulic cylinder surface are found. The mechanisms of the spatial self-organization of the relief and surface of bearings under conditions of <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> are summarized and analyzed. The data obtained can be used for further scientific generalization or prediction and diagnostics of the surface condition of loadcarrying and support elements of mechanical systems under study...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 79 - 83. <b>False</b> <b>brinelling</b> is a wear {{phenomenon}} {{that occurs in}} stationary rolling element bearings. Vibrations from adjacent running machinery are transmitted to the stationary bearing via the machinery foundations, and result in relative motion between the rollers and the races. This results in wear scars {{at the point of}} contact between the rollers and the race. The wear scars result in premature failure of the bearings. There are a large number of parameters that affect the rate of <b>false</b> <b>brinelling.</b> Most of these parameters are not free to be altered by the user of the bearing. There are two parameters that can be altered, the type of lubricant, and the slip amplitude of the vibration. The slip amplitude can be altered by changing the stiffness of the foundation of the equipment. By varying these two parameters {{it should be possible to}} limit the amount of damage to the bearing. In the work reported here, a shaker was used to axially vibrate a flat "outer race" in a lubricant bath, against a cylindrical roller. The relative motion was measured by means of a proximity probe. Two lubricants were tested: SAE 30 oil and LGEP 2 / 1 grease. Two different wear mechanisms, exhibiting vastly different wear rates, were discovered for the oil tests. At low slip amplitudes, smaller than 25 um, the results suggested that elastic deformation of the contacting surfaces was the means of displacement accommodation. At larger slip amplitudes the results suggested relative motion between the two contacting surfaces, which was marked by a bifurcation in the wear rate versus slip amplitude curve. The one branch of the curve, which for ease of explanation is called wear mechanism one, exhibited a low wear rate, which increased in a linear fashion with respect to the slip amplitude. The second branch of the curve, wear mechanism two, approximated a step function, with a very rapid increase in the wear rate with respect to the slip amplitude. This rapid increase is followed by a slow linear increase in the wear rate with respect to the slip amplitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} given to the {{detection}} of different fault types in the inner or outer race of roller bearing. The first group covers faults with an extension beyond the spacing between two rolling elements. In these cases some of the classical methods like envelop techniques could fail. We show that the vibration structure generated by a rough surface differs from a normal state even if the signal energy is eliminated by normalisation of the data. Suitable time domain features are a mathematical description of the shape of selected time domain peaks, which could easily be calculated by the higher derivatives of the time acceleration signal and some parameters characterizing the randomness of the peak positions. After the step of extracting 30 features from the time signal a feature selection process is executed automatically. This enables the selection of a feature subset which is best suited to the present fault situation. As a second group we start investigations for the early detection of very small bearing damages like <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> faults, which occur {{in the presence of a}} small relative motion between the rollers and raceways during non-rotation times. This leads to a damage which is characterized by elliptical wear marks in the axial direction at each roller position. Some test rig results indicate the high potential of the new time domain features for both fault types...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades the {{increase}} in power of mechanical systems {{and the demand for}} increasing service life leads mechanical components of a system to work in extreme conditions. Moreover, actual mechanical systems include surfaces in sliding contact that are subjected to wear if exposed to high vibration. In fact, the vibration of components in contact results in large oscillations of the local contact stresses, due to the local deformation of the components at the contact interfaces. To approach correctly tribological problems, the coupling between the scale of the mechanism (system dynamics) and the scale of the contact needs to be accounted for. This paper presents an analysis concerning the influence of the vibrations induced by aircraft engines on the contact stresses of rolling bearings of the bleed system valves. To study the wear, resulting from <b>false</b> <b>brinelling</b> at the contact surfaces between balls and races of the bearings, it is then necessary to determine the forces due to the system vibrations and acting at the bearing connections with the structure. In order to perform a numerical transient analysis of the system dynamics a nonlinear simplified model of the valve (mechanism scale) is developed. The model is validated by comparing the numerical results with experimental tests. The time behaviour of the global forces on the bearings, and the respective displacements between the contact surfaces, are then used as inputs for a finite element model of the bearings (contact scale). The model is used to calculate and analyze the behaviour in time of the local contact constraints between race and balls. This analysis, developed in the framework of a European project, {{is an example of the}} proposed general approach to contact problems, by coupling the analysis of the mechanism and contact scales...|$|E

In particular actual mechanical systems include surfaces in sliding contact that are subjected to wear if exposed to high vibration. In fact, the vibration of components in contact results ill large oscillations of the local contact stresses, due to the local deformation of the components at the contact interfaces. Thus the necessity to approach an interdisciplinary problem dealing with dynamics (system vibrations) and tribology (contact behavior). This paper presents an analysis concerning {{the influence of the}} vibrations induced by aircraft engines oil the wear of contact surfaces of rolling bearings of the bleed system valves. The study is developed on the framework of an European project. To study the wear. resulting of fretting and <b>false</b> <b>Brinelling</b> known to occur in quasi-static assemblies in vibratory environment, at the contact surfaces between balls and rings of the valve bearings it is then necessary to achieve the forces dues to the system vibrations and acting at the bearings connections with the structure. In order to perform a numerical transient analysis of the system dynamics a nonlinear simplified model of the valve is developed. The model includes the stiffness of the preloading springs, the nonlinearity of the bearings stiffness and the nonlinearity due to the possible detachments and impacts between the bearings and the frame of the valve. The input of the models is the induced vibrations by the aircraft engine. The outputs are the relative vibration between the frame of the valve and the shaft charring the butterfly, which corresponds to the relative displacements between the outer and the inner rings of the bearings (the bearings are sited between these two components) and the time behaviour of the forces between the bearings and the frame of the valve [...] The model is validated by comparing the numerical results of the relative displacement with experimental results from vibration tests carried out on valve assembly. The time behaviour of the forces and the respective displacements between the contact surfaces, achieved with the presented analysis, will be the inputs for a Finite Element Model developed to reproduce and analyze the local contact constraint...|$|E
