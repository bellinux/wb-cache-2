The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18â€“19. After the forces there, {{the remainder of the}} North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North.

Iraqi {{refugees}} were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, she wanted to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. She had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{was born}} in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, {{when he arrived in}} East Florida, a {{province}} of Spanish Florida, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer {{in the northern part of}} the province before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and continued to farm. During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to U.S. governance, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the King of Spain and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the New River area in 1826 to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> far as possible from the Spanish influence.|$|E

25|$|The first brood {{of workers}} {{are all of}} normal size, but the next {{generation}} of workers are generally smaller. This is due to the decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae.

25|$|Under the American regime's homesteading system, an {{individual}} {{could get up}} to 16 hectares of land, while a corporation could <b>get</b> <b>as</b> much as 1,024 hectares.
