25|$|The S-parameters {{are members}} of a family of similar parameters, other {{examples}} being: Y-parameters, Z-parameters, H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters. They differ from these, in the sense that S-parameters do not use open or short circuit conditions to characterize a linear electrical network; instead, matched loads are used. These terminations are much easier to use at <b>high</b> <b>signal</b> frequencies than open-circuit and short-circuit terminations. Moreover, the quantities are measured in terms of power.|$|E
25|$|Using a {{plane of}} light formed by {{focusing}} light through a cylindrical lens at a narrow angle or by scanning {{a line of}} light in a plane perpendicular to the axis of objective, high resolution optical sections can be taken. Single plane illumination, or light sheet illumination, is also accomplished using beam shaping techniques incorporating multiple-prism beam expanders. The images are captured by CCDs. These variants allow very fast and <b>high</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio image capture.|$|E

For 1 cm long strip silicon nitride waveguides, we theoretically expect more than 500 times <b>higher</b> <b>signal</b> compared to the confocal microscopic systems. The results of our preliminary measurements indicate at least 50 times <b>higher</b> <b>signal.</b> For slotted waveguides, the preliminary measurement result yields about 300 times <b>higher</b> <b>signal</b> compared to confocal microscope while the theoretical figure is more than 2000.

25|$|The {{memory effect}} is {{evaluated}} using {{the ratio of}} Rmax to Rmin (see figure). This ratio increases with decreasing light intensity and has a value of 1.5–1.6 at 0.1 lux and 1.05–1.10 at 1000 lux for PerkinElmer devices. In some low-resistive RO models this ratio was as high as 5.5, but by 2009 their production has been discontinued. High-resistance photoresistors typically have a less pronounced memory effect, are less sensitive to temperature, and have a more linear response, but are also relatively slow. Some devices designed in the 1960s had a negligible memory effect, but exhibited unacceptably <b>high</b> <b>signal</b> distortions at high current levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{output of}} a given {{microphone}} delivers the same power whether it is low or high impedance. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with vacuum-tube guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively <b>high</b> <b>signal</b> input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200Ω or lower. Professional vacuum-tube sound equipment incorporates a transformer that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available {{that can be used}} in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.|$|E
2500|$|The Es layer ( [...] E-layer) is {{characterized}} by small, thin clouds of intense ionization, which can support reflection of radio waves, rarely up to 225nbsp&MHz. Sporadic-E events may last {{for just a few}} minutes to several hours. Sporadic E propagation makes VHF-operating radio amateurs very excited, as propagation paths that are generally unreachable can open up. There are multiple causes of sporadic-E that are still being pursued by researchers. This propagation occurs most frequently during the summer months when <b>high</b> <b>signal</b> levels may be reached. The skip distances are generally around [...] Distances for one hop propagation can be anywhere from [...] to [...] Double-hop reception over [...] is possible.|$|E

2500|$|Electrostatic {{loudspeakers}} use a {{high voltage}} electric field (rather than a magnetic field) {{to drive a}} thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning. [...] However, their optimum listening area is small {{and they are not}} very efficient speakers. [...] They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency. [...] This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with <b>high</b> <b>signal</b> levels.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibility that some artifactual <b>high</b> <b>signals</b> produced in CSF with fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery MR sequenc-es could be due to inhomogeneity in the amplitude of the initial inversion pulse, and that this problem could be re-duced or eliminated by the use of adiabatic inversion puls-es. Studies with four volunteers showed dependence of <b>high</b> CSF <b>signals</b> in the posterior fossa on radiofrequency pulse amplitudes and that these signals could be eliminated by the use of adiabatic inversion pulses. Two illustrative clin-ical cases are included.
