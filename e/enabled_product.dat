40|$|IT <b>enabled</b> <b>products</b> are {{the result}} of a fusion of IT with the core {{functionalities}} of any product or device around us. This fusion is leading to numerous benefits and advantages that are just beginning to appear. However, with the increasing number and sophistication of vulnerabilities and threats in IT, the IT <b>enabled</b> <b>products</b> have also come in the line of fire. Due to the critical and diverse nature of these products, it is important that a holistic security framework exists that addresses security in the early phases of product development. The current state of security in IT <b>enabled</b> <b>products</b> strongly suggests this need along with the efforts of industry leaders in respective fields. In this thesis, the author has made an effort to address security in the IT <b>enabled</b> <b>products</b> by proposing a new framework based on the Balanced Scorecard. The proposed framework uses the concept of the four views and other characteristics of the Balanced Scorecard and it has a strong focus on security. The proposed framework has been evaluated by Prof. James E. Goldman; the chair of this thesis committee and its application has also been demonstrated to one of the discussed case examples of security failures. From this research, it has been concluded that the proposed framework can indeed effectively address security in the IT <b>enabled</b> <b>products.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{approaches}} for balancing mixed-model assembly lines rely on detailed prognoses {{of the demand}} for each model to be produced on the line (model-mix). With {{the help of the}} anticipated model-mix a joint precedence graph for a virtual average model is deduced, so that the mixed-model balancing problem is reduced to the single-model case and traditional balancing approaches can be employed. Today's ever increasing product variety often impedes reliable prognoses for individual models. Instead, forecasts for the estimated occurrences of each product feature (e. g., percentage of cars with air conditioning) are merely obtainable. This paper shows how the generation of joint precedence graphs is to be altered to account for this fundamental change in information. This way, a balancing of mixed-model assembly lines which are confronted {{with a high degree of}} product variety is <b>enabled.</b> <b>Product</b> variety; Mixed-model assembly lines; Balancing; Joint Precedence Graphs...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, online product reviews has <b>enabled</b> <b>product</b> {{designers}} {{to better understand}} product related issues from the users' perspective. In the design community, {{there are a number}} of studies that have focused on studying product reviews in various analysis perspectives. While these are essential, we noticed that contextual annotation of tags has not been fully explored. We reckoned that such an annotation is equally important to better clarify the tags' context where tasks such as design experience analysis and faceted product comparison can be made possible. However, the challenge lies in automatic discovery of contextual tags from product reviews. Consequently, this paper proposed a learnable approach to address this issue. A ranking algorithm is proposed to rank important key terms along with an approach to discover contextual annotation of a given term. The performance evaluation of our proposal is done using two annotated corpus. A case study using a small laptop reviews corpus is also reported to showcase how our algorithm can be applied towards product understanding and product ontology development.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} natural dualities for {{varieties}} of bilattice-based algebras. Such varieties {{have been widely}} studied as semantic models in situations where information is incomplete or inconsistent. The most popular tool for studying bilattices-based algebras is product representation. The authors recently set up a widely applicable algebraic framework which <b>enabled</b> <b>product</b> representations over a base variety to be derived in a uniform and categorical manner. By combining this methodology with that of natural duality theory, we demonstrate {{how to build a}} natural duality for any bilattice-based variety which has a suitable product representation over a dualisable base variety. This procedure allows us systematically to present economical natural dualities for many bilattice-based varieties, for most of which no dual representation has previously been given. Among our results we highlight that for bilattices with a generalised conflation operation (not assumed to be an involution or commute with negation). Here both the associated product representation and the duality are new. Finally we outline analogous procedures for pre-bilattice-based algebras (so negation is absent). Comment: 18 page...|$|E

40|$|Video Conferencing {{systems have}} become highly {{popular with the}} {{explosion}} of bandwidth and computing power. This has made high quality video conference possible on embedded hand held devices. This has created an ecosystem of companies developing applications which are powered by video conferencing libraries and a parallel ecosystem of companies who make those video conferencing libraries. An application developer has to design his system {{in a way that}} the video conferencing library (which is the backbone of the application) is efficiently integrated and is performing optimally. In order to do that, the developer must be acutely aware of features such as platform compatibility, resource usage, performance boundaries and bottlenecks of the library in order to make an informed decision. Hence the developer needs a test-bench which can evaluate the above mentioned features. This thesis mainly discusses the need to arrive at one such test framework followed by the framework itself. The framework designed in this thesis consists of a network emulator which is combined with a popular network protocol analyser. It profiles the library and monitors variables essential to Quality of Service (QoS) like bandwidth usage, frame rates, frame/packet sizes and audio/video delay under varying network conditions. By observing the change in these variables, the QoS offered by the library can be determined. This information can also be extrapolated to understand the challenges in guaranteeing a minimum quality of experience (QoE). This thesis applies the framework on one chosen library (Library 1) and Google Hangouts and discusses the results. The performance of the library under varying network conditions (bandwidth, packet loss and latency) is observed, enabling Presence Displays BV to extract information about how the library works. Presence Displays BV is building a video conferencing <b>enabled</b> <b>product</b> and uses the framework discussed in this thesis to analyse video conferencing libraries in order to build the application around it. It has been observed that Library 1 favours video quality above other parameters and only compromises video quality to accommodate more users participating in a call. Google Hangouts favours audio, motion content in the video, interactivity and robustness over video quality. This information can be used to configure Library 1 in a way such that it delivers maximum QoE in the available resources.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the First Part (Chapters 1 and 2) {{is devoted to}} a {{literature}} review concerning gyros and similar meat products, and the food preparation technology with cook-chill systems, among which is the technology sous vide. Subjects regarding “Reduced” and “Low-fat” meat products were also examined. In the Second Part the experiment of the thesis is presented. The studies and their findings are as follows: ¦ Using a production technology based in the principles of sous vide technology, the effect of percentage of salt, water and oil addition, {{with or without the}} addition of phosphates, were tested in order the ideal addition to be determined. The under assessment parameters were the processing yield, chemical composition, pH and shear-force values. A 10 -member panel evaluated the sensory attributes of the product (Chapter 3). Yield was 71. 94 % when salt and water were added in 1. 5 % and 15 %, respectively. The addition of phosphates did not increase the yield. On the contrary, simultaneous addition of corn oil and phosphates in 0. 2 % increased yield significantly. When 50 ml oil per Kg meat was added, the addition of phosphates resulted in increase of yield from 74. 90 to 78. 23 %. Respectively, when the oil addition was 75 ml per Kg meat, yield increased from 74. 14 to 79. 19 % by the phosphates addition. Oil addition resulted in pH values decrease of samples, from 6. 4 without the oil addition to 6. 2, when oil was added in 5 %. The overall palatability of the product during sensory evaluation was high, while the fat content despite the oil addition did not exceed 6 %. ¦ The effect of various parameters of the technology production on the processing yield and qualitative characteristics of the final product was evaluated. These parameters related to meat pieces size, the thermal process, the quantity of brine, the duration of tumbling process and the way of storage (refrigerated or frozen). The aim of these studies was the development of alternative “gyros” production technologies. The ability of microwave reheating of the product was also examined (Chapter 4). From preliminary results and experimentations, apart from the technology developed in Chapter 3 (Technology A), three more technologies arose, that could be proposed for “gyros” production (Technologies B, C, D). In technology A the product was refrigerated, while Technologies B, C, D provided the capability for frozen storage of products. Technology D, moreover <b>enabled</b> <b>product</b> reheating easily and quickly using microwaves. Processing yield of Technology A was 74. 24 %. For Technology B, yield was 82. 07 % when product was refrigerated and 77. 07 % when was frozen. Similarly, for Technology C the corresponding values were 75. 08 % and 68. 77 %, respectively. For Technology D, for both ways of storage, yield surpassed 84 %. Frozen products of Technologies B and C had lower preference scores than the refrigerated ones. For the product of Technology D, panellists did not detected differences between refrigerated and frozen storage. The protein, humidity, fat and ash content of the refrigerated products varied from 22. 6 to 28. 2 %, 64. 2 to 68. 0 %, 5. 1 to 7. 3 % and 1. 9 to 2. 5 %, respectively. In frozen products the corresponding values were from 23. 8 to 22. 9, 65. 7 to 67. 9 % and 2. 0 to 2. 5 %. ¦ In final products produced according to the proposed technologies and in samples of traditional gyros the fat content was determined. These products were also subjected in consumer evaluation (Chapter 5). The new “gyros” products had significantly reduced fat content compared to traditional gyros samples. The reduction exceeded 60 % for products A, B, C and was almost 49 % for product D. During evaluation from a consumer panel, it was realized that these new products achieved satisfactory acceptability. Despite the fact that the new products achieved moderate scores for appearance and taste in comparison to traditional gyros, the 85, 77. 5, 75 and 80 % of participating consumers would have chosen to consume products A, B, C and D respectively, instead of traditional gyros. This percentage reached 87. 5 % if the new products were labelled as “reduced fat gyros”. ...|$|E
