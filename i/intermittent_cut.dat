40|$|AbstractKnowledge of tool {{behaviour}} during <b>intermittent</b> <b>cut</b> machining {{of various}} work material is much required {{in order to}} improve the efficiency of the machining process. The tool-work impact and related effects of tool wear and surface roughness are often the subjects of interest. Even though, more work has been done to establish the relationship between cutting speed, tool wear and surface roughness during intermittent milling, there is no significant data available for AISI 1030 steel. To fill the gap, the machining of AISI 1030 steel using both coated and uncoated inserts were performed. Results were used to develop a linear regression model by which the relation between the machining parameters and the response were established. Results on tool wear patterns and wear mechanisms were compared between coated and uncoated inserts. Cyclic load on inserts and unstable temperature at cutting zone leads to flank wear and progressive chipping, which were the dominant failure modes observed. Coated inserts out performed uncoated inserts in terms of tool wear and surface roughness. The results also revealed that the feed rate was the dominant factor affecting surface roughness, whereas the cutting speed significantly contributes to the tool wear...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: Thermal injury during {{dental implant}} {{placement}} and restoration is a clinical concern {{as it may}} cause bone damage and compromise osseointegration. The threshold level for heat-induced cortical bone necrosis is 47 °C for 60 seconds. Objectives: To measure the amount of heat transferred to the implant-bone interface when a two-piece or one-piece abutment was prepared in vertical and horizontal direction using various time intervals. Materials and Methods: Three groups of samples (n = 24), one-piece and two-piece implant and natural teeth, were {{used in this study}} to compare the amount of heat transferred to the implant-bone interface. This study used cooling system in the 10, 20, 30, and 60 seconds time intervals. The Thermocouples (K type) were attached to each sample at the crestal, middle and apical points. To have a similar condition with the oral cavity, each implant was embedded separately in transparent acrylic resin in a 37 °C water bath. To have a constant cutting pressure, the turbine was fixed on the stable stand and a 100 g counterweight hanged to it. Then, the bath was fixed in front of it and cutting started at vertical and horizontal directions for 10, 20, 30, 60 seconds. Results: The maximum decrease from 37 °C was observed in two-piece implant at the apical point (3. 95 °C) after 60 seconds and the minimum decrease was seen in one-piece implant at the crestal point (0. 6 °C) after 60 seconds. Also the minimum increase was observed in the natural teeth at the apical point (0. 15 °C) at 10 seconds and the maximum temperature increase was seen in one-piece implant at the apical point (1. 95 °C) at 20 seconds. Conclusions: Within the limitation of this study, it was concluded that to reduce the thermal damage on the bone tissue, an <b>intermittent</b> <b>cut</b> up to 20 seconds is acceptable. Cutting one-piece implant caused more heat transfer than that of two-piece implan...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of {{regenerative}} {{machine tool}} chatter requires {{a knowledge of}} the cutting forces existing under vibration conditions. Previous direct experimental work has been very limited in its range and has given results which contradicted those derived from observations on regenerative chatter. A description of suitable experimental rigs and the results obtained from these rigs are given. The results show that there are large phase changes of cutting force relative to chip thickness when vibrating. A simplified criterion is given for assessing machining stability and it is shown that the observed phase changes will greatly affect machining stability; in some cases machining will be stable regardless of machine damping. The requirements for machining stability contradict those for long cutting tool life so a compromise must be reached in practical cases. The cutting process is not, in general, amenable to quantitative analysis but theories have been put forward to explain the observed force phase and amplitude changes. There is a reasonable qualitative correlation between experiment and theory for most of the experimental range. Temperature estimates involved in phase change estimates show that there are large tool temperature variations under chatter or milling conditions. These temperature variations and the consequent thermal stresses are likely to cause tool failure with brittle materials such as carbides. The results obtained under steady cutting conditions such as lathe turning have been extended to <b>intermittent</b> <b>cuts</b> as encountered in milling. The tests show that there is no fundamental difference between steady and <b>intermittent</b> <b>cuts.</b> Suggestions are put forward for the large amount of further work required to clarify the mechanisms of the outing process and to extend cutting force knowledge for chatter prevention...|$|R
50|$|According to estimates, 50% of the {{electricity}} generated in Argentina depends on gas-powered plants. The national energy matrix has no emergency reserves and by 2004 it was functioning {{at the top of}} its capacity. At this point, barely emerging from the seasonal low demand caused by summer, a large number of industrial facilities and power plants started suffering <b>intermittent</b> <b>cuts</b> in their supply of natural gas. Between February and May the cuts amounted to an average of 9.5 million m³ a day, about 13% of industrial demand, {{and by the end of}} May they grew to a maximum of 22 million m³. The most seriously affected regions were the capital, certain regions of the province of Buenos Aires, and the province of La Pampa.|$|R
