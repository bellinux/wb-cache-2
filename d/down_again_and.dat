5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns <b>down</b> <b>again),</b> <b>and</b> {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E
25|$|The natural nuclear {{reactors}} formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that {{acted as a}} neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back <b>down</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained {{for hundreds of thousands}} of years.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two matches, Kazushi faced in Braga a consistently aggressive opponent, with the luta livre practitioner landing effective muay thai knees and kicks until Sakuraba put him down.

25|$|Coppell was fit {{enough to}} play in the League Cup final of 1983 which – in a reverse of events in 1977 – opponents Liverpool won 2–1. But as Manchester United progressed also to the FA Cup final in the same year, Coppell's knee had broken <b>down</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> he missed the final against Brighton & Hove Albion, which ended 2–2 and {{ultimately}} concluded in a 4–0 victory for Manchester United in the replay.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fourth}} quarter got underway, Hayes {{realized}} that his offense needed to play more aggressive and not punt the ball back to Michigan after each possession. Kern was tackled for a loss on the Buckeyes' first drive of the quarter, on fourth down. Michigan got the ball back at the Ohio State 40, and Michigan continued to churn out the yards, getting {{the ball to the}} Buckeye 10. Craw went for it on fourth-and-one and failed, keeping Ohio State in the game. Ohio State's offense went three-and-out, then Michigan drove the ball again to the Buckeye red zone. Craw tried to get a first <b>down</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> was once again rebuffed.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 6 Hours of Silverstone, {{witnessed}} a nose-to-tail fight between the Audi R18 of Bernhard and Fässler and the Peugeot 908 of Sébastien Bourdais and Simon Pagenaud, but was temporarily finished after a spin by Bernhard. A conservative drive from Pagenaud saw Fässler {{close the gap}} right <b>down</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> in fact jump into the lead. Pagenaud picked up the pace and the two cars were on each other's tails {{until the end of}} the fourth hour when damaged rear bodywork needed replacing on the Audi. This gave the Peugeot a one-minute advantage that it did not give up. Third was the OAK Racing's Pescarolo 01 piloted by Olivier Pla and Alexandre Prémat.|$|E

25|$|Mayweather {{controlled}} the fight from the beginning, knocking Hatton {{out in the}} 10th round to retain the welterweight championship. Hatton suffered a cut over his right eye in round three; from that point, his pace and movement began to slow. In round six, Hatton lost a point for punching the back of Mayweather's head as he was draped over the ropes. During the tenth round, Hatton was caught by a checked left hook thrown from Mayweather's hip; after falling headfirst into the turnbuckle, he hit the floor. Hatton made it to his feet, but was dazed. Two more lefts in quick succession knocked Hatton <b>down</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> referee Cortez stopped the fight at 1:35 of round ten. Official scorecards read 88–82, 89–81, and 89–81 {{at the time of}} stoppage, all in favor of Mayweather.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} Catholic churches. The largest church in Carrick Mór is St Nicholas' churchwhich {{was built in}} 1879, {{replacing}} an earlier church {{of the same name}} built in 1804. In Carrick Beg are the small St Molleran's parish church (parts of which date back to the 13th century) and the larger Franciscan friary. The Franciscan order's presence in Carrick dates back to 1336 with the granting of land for a friary by the 1st Earl of Ormond. However, the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIII led to the closure of the friary. Just prior to the invasion of Ireland by Cromwell, the friars had returned for an 11-year period, before being shut <b>down</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> the friars having to go underground to avoid persecution. It was not until 1820 and the onset of Catholic Emancipation that the friars were able to fully return and a new chapel was built. The friars served the local community until the lack of vocations to the order led to the order finally leaving Carrick-Beg in 2006.|$|E
25|$|As {{the green}} light signalled {{the start of the}} race, Hill and Schumacher both made brisk starts and led into Sainte Dévote, but behind them a {{multiple}} collision between Coulthard and the two Ferraris caused the race to be red-flagged to a halt. Coulthard was slightly slower away from the line and was challenged {{on the outside of the}} run to the first corner by Berger, and on the inside by Alesi. As the track narrowed at the entry to Sainte Devote, there was not enough space for the three cars to run side-by-side, and Alesi made contact with the rear-right quarter of Coulthard's car, which in turn pushed it into Berger. The Williams was launched up into the air and spun through 180 degrees before crashing <b>down</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> coming to a halt at the apex of the corner with broken suspension, whilst the two damaged Ferraris also made further contact with each other before coming to rest at the same point. Most of the pursuing drivers, led by Brundle, threaded their way through the stationary cars, but Irvine knocked off his front wing, Boullion sustained a broken diffuser, and Katayama, Salo, Morbidelli, Inoue and Schiattarella were all forced to come to a halt as they negotiated the obstacles. With the track now completely blocked, the race was halted and preparations were immediately made for a completely fresh start.|$|E

500|$|After {{the attack}} on Southland, UB-14 broke <b>down</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> put in at Chanak to await repairs. While there on 4 September, word came of the British {{submarine}} [...] entangled in Turkish antisubmarine nets off Nagara Point. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and UB-14s cook, {{a man by the}} name of Herzig, set out in a rowboat to observe the Turkish attempts to destroy E7. After several mines that formed part of the net had been detonated to no avail, von Heimburg and his group rowed out and repeatedly dropped a plumb line until it contacted metal. Then, von Heimburg dropped a Turkish sinker mine with a shortened fuse right on top of E7. After the hand-dropped mine detonated too close for the British submarine's captain's comfort, he ordered his boat surfaced, abandoned, and scuttled. Between shellfire from the Turkish shore batteries and E7s scuttling charges, von Heimburg and company narrowly escaped harm. While most sources credit E7s sinking to the Turkish efforts, author Robert Stern contends that von Heimburg and UB-14 deserve partial credit for the demise of E7.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 28 April 1789, Bounty lay about [...] south of the island of Tofua. After a largely sleepless night, Christian had decided to act. He {{understood}} from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and, after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin, he learned the names of several more. With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh [...] "called as loudly as [...] could in hopes of assistance". The commotion woke Fryer, who saw, from his cabin opposite, the mutineers frogmarching Bligh away. The mutineers ordered Fryer to [...] "lay <b>down</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> hold my tongue or I was a dead man".|$|E
