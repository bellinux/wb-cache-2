Being a multicultural country, Indonesia is rich in ethnic and minority literature {{to contribute to the}} world. However, due to misconceptions among Indonesian educators and decision makers, consciously or unconsciously this local geniusÂ has long been marginalized and less appreciated. In many English departments, for example, its value and significance has been underestimated. A survey of collaborative writing classes in English Department of UPI has revealed that the students positively responded the Sundanese literature-based writingÂ courses. The course was successful in two ways: <b>developing</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> collaborative workshop and raising awareness of their own ethnic literature, which is a bridge to appreciate English literature...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 34 - 35). Can a child sit down, {{pick up a}} pencil, {{and start}} writing? Have you ever met a child who says, ?I don?t know what to write about?? <b>Writing</b> is a <b>skill</b> that takes time to develop, a skill that a child can grasp when given the opportunity and support. Teachers need to help children <b>develop</b> basic <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> and also help children give meaning to their writing. Research shows that play gives children experience, builds cognitive development, grows social skills, and can set the foundations for further learning. Research also reveals that if teachers help children <b>develop</b> basic <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> mini-lessons and support children by helping them give meaning to their writing, a child can experience success with writing. Play can give children meaning and ideas to bring to their writing. It can spark a child?s creativity and inspire them to pick up that pencil and start writing. This action research project examines children at play and studies if play and/or gender influence {{the quality and quantity}} of writing of a transitional writer. Twenty-one children (ten male, eleven female) in first grade participated in a four-week study. Six of twenty-one children (three male, three female) were chosen to be part of a focus group. These six children have an array of writing abilities (two high, two medium, two low, one male and female in each writing ability). Before starting the research, four prewriting pieces were collected from each child giving a baseline before play was introduced into his or her writing. For four weeks, every Tuesday and Thursday, during the children?s writing block, the children wrote for ten to fifteen minutes after coming in from recess. During this time children were given a choice about what they could write about. The writings from Tuesday and Thursday were collected and the six children?s writings were analyzed by using a rubric to look at {{the quality and quantity of}} their writing. Pre-and post-writing attitude surveys were used to give the researcher an understanding of how the children felt about writing. A checklist was also used to measure children?s engagement. Eight pieces of writing were collected to analyze the progress of the six focus children. Throughout this study the qualitative and quantitative data collected from the children demonstrates their attitudes towards writing, engagement in the writing process, and shows changes in their quality, quantity, neatness, punctuation and spelling in their writing with play being introduced before their writing block...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted as the needs for <b>developing</b> the students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> <b>through</b> literature learning (short stories). The assumption that literature only represented recitation lesson, it {{was not able to}} promote students’ language skills and that the quality of literature learning was low become the foundation in conducting the investigation. The aim of the investigation in general is to <b>develop</b> students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> by applying reader response strategy and visual symbols in order to promote students’ moral. Specifically, this inquiry is expected to describe about the acceptability, comparison, impact, strength and shortcomings, and the model of literature learning to promote <b>writing</b> <b>skills.</b> This research used a quantitative approach with a quasi-experiment design. Nevertheless, qualitative approach was also usable to analyze students’ writing. The subject of the {{research was}} the students of the fifth-grade of SD ASMI Bandung that involved 40 students as the sample, that is 20 students in the quasi-experiment class and the rest in the control one. The instruments of data collecting were test, observation, and questionnaire. The statistical procedure for quantitative method was a t-test while the qualitative one used descriptive-analysis technique. It was concluded that (1) the model of nonverbal and verbal response in literature learning was able to promote students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skills,</b> (2) the model of nonverbal and verbal response possessed the strength comparatively in quasi-experiment class, (3) the shortcomings of the model were it spent much time as students responded both nonverbally and verbally and guided questions facilitated students to express their responses. (4) the model of nonverbal and verbal response indicated the significant difference to the increasing of students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> in the quasi-experiment class. And (5) the model of nonverbal and verbal response showed good qualification where the aspect of cognitive, affective, and psychomotor were developed. This study may have theoretical and practical implication to the development of <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> by applying the model of nonverbal and verbal response which is combined with the model of inductive thinking and the basic operation. Theoretically, this study implies that learning and education do not only exploit students to master the learning purpose but also the process of learning and education are able to emerge on the surface relevant to the goal of based-competency curriculum. Practically, the model of nonverbal and verbal can be used to promote literature learning in all levels of education...|$|R
40|$|Improving children’s <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> is a {{significant}} concern in schools. A key problem identified {{is a lack of}} engagement and motivation with writing tasks, something which can be particularly pronounced with boys. Computer game creation has potential as an activity for improving <b>writing</b> <b>skills.</b> It can be very motivating, especially for boys, and offers an excellent opportunity for <b>developing</b> <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> within a media-rich context. We argue that whilst existing game creation tools make the activity possible for school-aged children, they fall short of supporting <b>writing</b> <b>skills</b> development because the interfaces focus attention on non-literary aspects of game creation.

This action research study consisted of two cycles, carried out in nine sessions from January 5 th 2011 to February 2 nd 2011. The researcher worked collaboratively with the English teacher and the students. The subjects of this research were 36 students of Grade X Office Administration 2 of SMK Negeri 1 Tempel. The data {{of this study were}} qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative data were obtained by observing the teaching and learning process during the implementation of the actions and interviewing the students and the collaborator. The qualitative data were in the forms of field notes and interview transcripts. Meanwhile, the quantitative data were obtained by conducting a survey and assessing the students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skill</b> <b>through</b> a pretest and two posttests. Therefore, the quantitative data were students’ responses to the questionnaire and students’ writing scores. The data collected from class observations and interviews were analyzed based on the qualitative data analysis model by Miles and Huberman (1994). Meanwhile, the data collected from survey and writing tests were computed by using Microsoft Excel computer program and SPSS versions 17. 0 and the results were analysed by using descriptive statistics. The results of Cycle I showed that the use of picture media was effective to improve students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skills.</b> Some actions were implemented in Cycle I: using pictures to improve students’ motivation in writing, using classroom English in the teaching and learning process, and improving students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skill</b> <b>through</b> pictures. Though the implementation of using classroom English was not maximal, the implementation of actions in Cycle I was successful to make the students familiar with English words. Therefore, the researcher improved the action in Cycle II by maximizing the use of English and minimizing the use of Bahasa Indonesia in the instructions. Besides, in Cycle II, the implemented actions included improving students’ motivation in writing by using picture games, improving students’ <b>writing</b> <b>skill</b> <b>through</b> pictures, and using tasks in improving students’ punctuation and capitalization mastery.
