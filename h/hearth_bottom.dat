40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractory}} {{is a major}} limitation to the campaign life of a blast furnace. Titanium from titania addition in the burden or tuyere injection can react with carbon and nitrogen in molten pig iron to form titanium carbonitride, giving the so-called titanium-rich scaffold or buildup on the hearth surface, to protect the hearth from subsequent erosion. In the current article, a mathematical model based on computational fluid dynamics is proposed to simulate the behavior of solid particles in the liquid iron. The model considers the fluid/solid particle flow through a packed bed, conjugated heat transfer, species transport, and thermodynamic of key chemical reactions. A region of high solid concentration is predicted at the <b>hearth</b> <b>bottom</b> surface. Regions of solid formation and dissolution can be identified, which depend on the local temperature and chemical equilibrium. The sensitivity to the key model parameters for the solid phase is analyzed. The model provides an insight into the fundamental mechanism of solid particle formation, and it may form a basic model for subsequent development to study the formation of titanium scaffold in the blast furnace hearth...|$|E
40|$|The {{campaign}} {{life of a}} {{blast furnace}} {{is limited by the}} erosion of hearth refractories. Flow and temperature distributions of the liquid iron have a significant influence on the erosion mechanism. In this work, an improved three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model is developed to simulate the flow and heat transfer phenomena in the hearth of BlueScope¿s Port Kembla No. 5 Blast Furnace. Model improvements feature more justified input parameters in turbulence modeling, buoyancy modeling, wall boundary conditions, material properties, and modeling of the solidification of iron. The model is validated by comparing the calculated temperatures with the thermocouple data available, where agreements are established within ± 3 pct. The flow distribution in the hearth is discussed for intact and eroded hearth profiles, for sitting and floating coke bed states. It is shown that natural convection affects the flow in several ways: for example, the formation of (a) stagnant zones preventing <b>hearth</b> <b>bottom</b> from eroding or (b) the downward jetting of molten liquid promoting side wall erosion, or (c) at times, a vortex-like peripheral flow, promoting the ¿elephant foot¿ type erosion. A significant influence of coke bed permeability on the macroscopic flow pattern and the refractory temperature is observed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCircumferential BF hearth shell {{stress was}} {{measured}} {{during the two}} blast furnaces blow-in periods. BF 1 had the hearth with not developed salamander. It was blew down after reline and few days of full tuyeres operation. BF 3 hearth had fully developed salamander after 12 years of operation. Before start up both BF hearths were identical cleaned up 1 m bellow the tap hole elevation. Blow in line on BF 1 also BF 3 salamander were circumferential trenched out up to the <b>hearth</b> <b>bottom</b> elevation down. Maximal measured BF 1 hearth shell tension level reached 100 MPa. 160 MPa was the detected maximal BF 3 hearth shell tension. Tension level 100 MPa was detected 6 days after start up on both furnaces, This level stayed identical on BF 1 {{for the next four}} days but on BF 3 tension rose during the next two days period up to level 160 MPa. Maximal pressure started relieve on both furnaces 8 days after start up. Hearth shell stress stabilized on both furnaces on range 30 – 50 MPa when hearth thermocouples readings started stabilize. Data shows significant contribution of hearth refractory to hearth shell stress creation. Melting rate, tuyeres opening strategy, casting schedule can contribute to BF hearth shell stress control during the blow in period...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Priory of Lavinadiere was a {{possession}} {{of the order of}} the Latin Canons of the Holy Sepulchre. Study of the clergy-house site began in the mid- 1990 s, and excavations have been undertaken there on a regular basis since 2003. Evidence for smithing activities in the priory was recorded in the filling of a ditch dating from the Middle Ages. A 16 th-century smithy was excavated, located north of the stone buildings. Residues from the two periods were studied, <b>hearth</b> <b>bottoms</b> were measured and weighed, and metallo graphic examination undertaken. The bottoms were found to form two groups. The distribution of hammerscale in the smithy was examined, leading to hypotheses about space management. The hammerscale was sorted by type and their microstructures studied. Metallurgical activity in the priory seems to have consisted of the making and repair of small objects...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} iron slag in excavation {{layers of the}} Hellenistic to Byzantine city of Sagalassos (SW Turkey), indicates continuous iron working from the 1 st to 7 th century AD. The slag samples are identified as smithing <b>hearth</b> <b>bottoms</b> and are found in dump fills, building foundations and road constructions. Though several smelting sites {{are present in the}} 1800 km² large territory of the city, the chemical signature of the smelting slag does not correspond to the characteristics of the smithing slag found in the city itself. The smithing slag does offer insight in the smithing techniques applied, which in turn provides information about the objects produced and production chain or “chaîne opératoire” followed for iron production in Sagalassos. Textural and mineralogical analyses reveal two main smithing techniques were applied throughout the 1 st to 7 th century AD. The most commonly applied smithing technique is used for the production of simple bulk materials, like hammers or anvils. Microscopic textures in the slag show mainly mechanical deformation at relatively high temperatures. The second, more sophisticated smithing technique shows the blacksmith treated the iron at different temperatures. The presence of high lime contents indicates the use of a flux and/or a protective agent against oxidation. This technique was applied to make more complex objects or objects with cutting edges. Based on the reconstruction of the smithing techniques, the iron production of Sagalassos produced mainly everyday bulk material. The current study demonstrates the importance of using the mineralogy of smithing slag in reconstructing the technological evolution of iron production. Microtextural and mineralogical studies and comparison with modern smithing techniques offer greater insight in the complex world of Roman blacksmithing. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|This {{combination}} of events {{led to the}} first Franklin stoves being manufactured by Warwick furnaces, which was owned and managed by Grace from his marriage to Rebecca. The stoves originally had an arched and decorated front plate. The stove had a projecting <b>hearth</b> at the <b>bottom</b> that was inserted into a fireplace and the smoke was guided up through the chimney. [...] The stove was more efficient in producing heat for the room than an open fireplace.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The process {{developed}} in the U K to produce magnesium hydroxide from seawater is described, together with the heat reatment that he hydroxide r ceives toproduce the active oxide. Some of the characteristics required of the dolomite used in the process are also discussed. Impurities introduced by the seawater a e noted and {{the means by which}} they can be reduced explained. Magnesium oxide has long been an important industrial material. The major tonnage outlet for magnesia has been the refractories industry in which it is employed as 'dead-burned' grain magnesite for the construction and maintenance of the <b>hearths</b> or <b>bottoms</b> of open-hearth steel furnaces. Magnesia also is used in the form of calcined refractory magnesite brick and as a chemical addition in the manufacture of chrome, olivine and other refractories. The industrial importance of magnesia is due to its chemical behaviour and this is largely determined by the position of magnesium in the periodic table. Magnesium oxide is a weak base, particularly at high temperatures, and therefore magnesium oxide is barely attacked by alkalis but readily by acids. All strong mineral acids dissolve or corrode magnesiu...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{constructions of}} {{electric}} ferroalloy furnaces are still based on applying {{in the lower}} "liquid " areas the standard carbon materials. What can be illustrated by the experience from several years, {{in the part of}} tap hole, <b>hearth</b> walls and <b>bottom,</b> is that so-called carbon or semigraphite microporous materials are suc-cessfully being applied. These materials, compared to the standard carbon, give better resistance to the attack by liquid metal and other wear factors. Generally this group includes materials characterised by considerable share of pores of diameters below 1 μm (significantly exceeding 90 % of total porosity). The microporosity increases the resistance to the infiltration of the liquid metal. The effect of microporosity can be obtained by introducing silicon (or its compound) additive to materials based on electrically (or gas) calcined anthracites, electrographite and binder. Moreover, by introducing other ceramic additives, the microporous materials are more resistant to dissolution by the liquid metal. Observing the trends of "improving the materials " in the last years, it is clearly seen that the share of non-carbon additives is bigger and bigger, so we can reasonably speak of rather carbon-ceramic materials. In this paper, the survey of the most important quality criteria, which must be met by the carbon furnace linings, as well as the new testing methods will be presented. 1...|$|R
50|$|Uan Muhuggiag {{appears to}} have been {{inhabited}} from at least the 6th millennium BC to about 2700 BC, although not necessarily continuously. The stratigraphic sequence comprises seven distinct occupation levels. Layer 1 is the very top layer, followed by layer 1a. The middle level is labeled from 2a to 2d, with 2d being the oldest. Finally, below that, there is also a layer 3, which is further subdivided into section A, at the top, and section B, at the bottom. Layer 1 has been dated as beginning around 3800 BP, and consists of loose aeolian sand at the very top, slightly cemented sand and dung below that, and <b>hearths</b> at the <b>bottom.</b> Further down, layer 2 has evidence of humified organic sand and lenses of fresh plant remains. These two layers represent the period of human occupation of the shelter. Layer 3 has even stronger humidified sand, as well as gypsum concretions. The stratigraphic sequence suggests that the shelter was inhabited during a much wetter period than today. The Tashwinat Mummy was found on the eastern side of a 160 by 80 cm. excavation, under the lowest layer of coals, where the sandstone floor showed a deliberate round excavation of about 25 cm. in diameter and 3 cm. deep. The mummy lay just beneath a layer of vegetable fibers.|$|R
60|$|During {{the day he}} {{contented}} {{himself with}} eating some dates and an oatmeal cake or two; but at sunset he added to this two or three fish that he had split open and hung up to dry {{in the sun and}} wind. There was charcoal on board, and a flat stone served as a <b>hearth</b> in the <b>bottom</b> of the boat, but he had no means of lighting a fire, for this the fishermen would have brought off when they came on board in the morning. After he had finished his meal and taken his place again at the tiller he altered his course. Hitherto he had been steering to the south of east, following the line of coast, but he now saw before him the projecting promontory of Cape Mezurata, which marks the western entrance of the great Gulf of Sydra; and he now directed his course two points north of east, so as to strike the opposite promontory, known as Grenna, more than a hundred miles away. The wind fell much lighter, and he shook out the sail to its full extent. All night he kept at his post, but finding the wind perfectly steady he lashed the tiller so as to keep the boat's head in the direction in which he was steering, and dozed for some hours, waking up occasionally to assure himself that she was keeping her course.|$|R
