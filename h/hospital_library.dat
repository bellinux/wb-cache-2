40|$|Objective: To {{reflect the}} {{situation}} of the websites of the <b>hospital</b> <b>libraries</b> in Spain in 2003. Material and methods: The websites of the <b>hospital</b> <b>libraries</b> have been located through C- 17 directory, various hospital directories and searching Google, Altavista and Alltheweb. It has been applied the questionnaire of evaluation of websites with pondered punctuation by Lluís Codina. Visibility indicators have been obtained as well as accessibility according TAW. Results: From the C- 17 catalogue have been retrieved 176 <b>hospital</b> <b>libraries,</b> of which 13 have a website; we added to these other 19 websites found through other directories and search engines. Of those 32 websites, 2 were not active; the remaining 30 were analyzed. Five of them passed the Codina's test of level I. In the TAW priority level 1, the problems detected automatically oscillated between 0 and 77. Conclusions: The results show the low number of <b>hospital</b> <b>libraries</b> with websites on the internet. The websites quality should be improved following the recommendations of the checkup lists to evaluate digital resources on the internet. The scarce visibility of these webs, hinders greatly its localization. On the other hand, the low accessibility rate of these webs blocks their visualization to handicapped people...|$|R
40|$|Are {{applicable}} {{and useful}} librarian performance indicators (UNE 50137 standard) for <b>hospital</b> <b>libraries?</b> Objectives: Test {{the effectiveness of}} librarian performance indicators {{as a tool to}} assess Health Science and <b>Hospital</b> <b>libraries</b> and try to define those that would be are considered most relevant for this type of libraries. Material and methods: We selected 6 performance indicators (UNE 50137) that we considered would be easy to obtain and we try to reliably achieve the same data in 4 <b>Hospital</b> <b>libraries</b> with similar features. We unifyed measurement criteria to perform calculations, in order to perform a reliable comparisson, and annual calculations to: patrons costs; visits to the library per capita; cost per visit to the library; speed of services of document obtaining; volume of loans; loans per capita. In some cases it was necessary to extract representative samples, obtained randomly so as not to bias the results. All these calculations were performed using the annual accounting information and statistical data obtained as common tasks of libraries. Results: A table was elaborated synthesizing the main results obtained for the 6 selected indicators was elaborated. Conclusions: It is very complicated to apply the same criteria measurement in the different libraries because we do not collect the same data or in the same way, and we do not have accurate and homogeneous measurement systems. The criteria and methodology for data collection has to be unifyed to obtain valid and comparable indicators. These data and these indicators are not really representative of our work. Discussion: can UNE 50137 standard apply for <b>hospital</b> <b>libraries?</b> Do the indicators really measure performance in the field of <b>hospital</b> <b>libraries?</b> To what extent are these data useful...|$|R
