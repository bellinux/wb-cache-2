2500|$|A {{recent study}} found that the {{psychological}} benefits of kangaroo care <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> preterm infants are fairly extensive.

[...] Older parents may have additional life experience or resilience, leading to decreased anxiety. [...] Higher socioeconomic status may contribute to less anxiety as well. [...] These factors may lead to lower levels of baseline anxiety, and therefore a further decrease of anxiety following kangaroo care. [...] Factors such as gestational age, parental gender, and marital status did not appear to affect parental anxiety. [...] Kangaroo care was shown to decrease anxiety scores in both mothers and fathers, also unrelated to parents’ marital status.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, the American Association of Christian Counselors amended its code {{of ethics}} to {{eliminate}} the promotion of conversion therapy for homosexuals and encouraged them to be celibate instead.

The authors argue that the doctor's medical ethics means they should place {{the interests of the}} patient above the cultural sensitivities of the parents, and confidentially counsel the patient about resources for LGBT youth facing bullying, and advise the parents about resources <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> LGBT children. In 2014, major therapy professional bodies in the United Kingdom issued a joint consensus statement opposing conversion therapy.

2500|$|Giessel was up {{for reelection}} in 2016. Due to all the {{previous}} issues resulting from redistricting, {{this would be the}} first time Giessel was eligible to have a 4-year term. Giessel’s initial Democratic challenger, local non-profit executive and advocate Hilary Morgan, dropped out of the senate race early in [...] 2016. Shortly before the filing deadline, longtime registered Democrat and President of the Alaska AFL-CIO, Vince Beltrami emerged, filing to run as an independent. The race {{became one of the most}} expensive state senate races in Alaska history. Giessel won the November general election, defeating challenger Vince Beltrami, 51.90% to 47.57%. Giessel again campaigned on positions strongly supporting natural resource development, diversified economic development, right-sizing Alaska state government, the creation of a comprehensive plan to the state government’s budget challenges, [...] and again supported more school choice options <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> K-12 students. Due to the continued budget shortfall, further reductions in state spending continued as a top priority for the new senate majority caucus.

2500|$|Referencing {{contemporary}} Western {{views on}} gender diversity, psychologist Diane Ehrensaft states: [...] "I am witnessing a shake-up {{in the mental}} health community as training sessions, workshops and conferences are proliferating all over this country and around the world, demanding that we reevaluate the binary system of gender, throw out the idea that gender nonconformity is a disorder, and establish new guidelines for facilitating the healthy development of gender-creative children." [...] Child-adolescent psychiatrist Edgardo Menvielle and psychotherapist Catherine Tuerck offer a support group <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> gender non-conforming children at the Children's National Medical Centre in Washington D.C., aimed [...] "not at changing children's behaviours but at helping parents to be supportive". Other publications are beginning to call for a similar approach, to support parents to help their child become their authentic self. Community organizations established to support these families have begun to develop, such as Gender Spectrum, Trans Youth Family Allies, Gender Creative Kids Canada, and Trans Kids Purple Rainbow, as well as conferences such as Gender Odyssey Family Conference and summer camps such as Camp Aranu'tiq, all with the goal of supporting healthy families with gender non conforming or transgender children. Popular media accounts of parents assisting their children to live in their felt gender role have recently begun to emerge. These stories demonstrate that children and their parents face substantial stigma; however, Menvielle maintains that [...] "the therapist should focus on helping the child and family cope with intolerance and social prejudice, not on the child's behaviours, interests or choice of playmates". A host of new terms being applied to these children (such as gender variant), gender non-conforming, gender-creative and gender-independent) indicates that many are beginning to reject the label of Gender Identity Disorder in Children.|$|E
