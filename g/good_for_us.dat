500|$|Despite {{their history}} in the competition, Liverpool manager Roy Evans, felt this would not count for {{anything}} in the final: [...] "Our players haven't really got that much Wembley experience, certainly {{not in terms of}} finals. It will be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to have Ian Rush and John Barnes out there." [...] Striker Rush had picked up a hamstring injury while playing for the Welsh national team against Bulgaria, but was expected to be fit. Midfielder Mark Kennedy would not feature in the final as he was ineligible.|$|E
500|$|When {{the band}} was first started, their lead vocalist {{introduced}} them to bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More, and the group has since cited them as major influences to their musical style. The group is considered to have launched the careers of {{three members of the}} nu metal band Korn. Drummer David Silveria said that [...] "L.A.P.D. really was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> because we learned about the industry and how things work." [...] Korn has influenced bands such as Slipknot, Saliva, Breaking Benjamin, Cold, and Flyleaf.|$|E
500|$|Wenger apologised for his team’s behaviour: [...] "I feel {{we should}} not have reacted at all. Overall we are sorry for what happened. When you do not behave like you want to, then you have to apologise." [...] He had no regrets over his team {{selection}} and suggested {{it was part of the}} player's learning process. Wenger said of Walcott: [...] "…he had a very good performance and scored a great goal. That is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and good news for England." [...] Gilberto Silva described Arsenal’s defeat as a “sad memory” and wanted to use the loss to motivate the team for their coming matches.|$|E
6000|$|... "Might try it," [...] {{suggested}} the boy. [...] "The cop says they're not particular, and what's <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{ought to be}} <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> them." ...|$|R

500|$|... "We {{have had}} the {{opportunity}} to play Germany a fair bit in our preparation so our game plan was to have strong defensive pressure and take it from there", Kean told the media. [...] "It started off really <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, D’Esposito {{said he had}} {{considered}} making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including Loki, a young Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, and Black Widow. Regarding Loki, D’Esposito said [...] "Being on Asgard {{is very difficult for}} us to do in a short. It’s just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it’s over. One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don’t want to do something that’s half baked because it’s not <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and it’s not good for our fans." [...] In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on Sin and Crossbones, Jessica Jones, and Damage Control.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Gittings and Lahusen {{pushed the}} American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to grant couple's {{membership}} to them, for a reduced price on health insurance. One {{of her last}} acts as an activist was {{to come out in}} the newsletter published by the assisted living facility they reside in. On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania after a long battle with breast cancer. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: [...] "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and {{what it meant to be}} gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off our backs, to oil the closet door hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and for the rest of the world too. It's hard work— but it's vital, and it's gratifying, and it's often fun!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{to return}} to our boat. We carried our new prince into it, and helped him over the side, because of his lameness. We made signs to him that his men must carry our <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> and showed him what we had; he answered, [...] "Si, Seignior," [...] or, [...] "Yes, sir" [...] (for we had taught him that word {{and the meaning of}} it), and taking up a bundle, he made signs to us, that when his arm was well he would carry some <b>for</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R

500|$|In March 1629, King Charles {{dissolved}} Parliament, beginning {{eleven years}} of rule without Parliament. [...] This action apparently raised new concerns among the company's principals; in their July meeting, Governor Matthew Cradock {{proposed that the}} company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony. [...] It also worried Winthrop, who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament. [...] He wrote, [...] "If the Lord seeth it wilbe <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> he will provide a shelter & a hidinge place for us and others". [...] During the following months, he became more involved with the company, meeting with others in Lincolnshire. [...] By early August, he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration and, on 12 August, he circulated a paper providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration. [...] His name appears in formal connection with the company on the Cambridge Agreement, signed 26 August; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non-emigrating shareholders of the company.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, a 1967 letter {{surfaced}} in which Lennon {{wrote to a}} fan saying the Beatles [...] "were lucky to have met" [...] the Maharishi. A 2011 article in The Telegraph reported Harrison as saying: [...] "Maharishi only ever did <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> and although I have not been with him physically, I never left him". [...] In 2007, a Canadian actress, Maggie Blue O'Hara, announced plans to renovate and convert the property into {{a home for the}} street children of New Delhi. In 2011, a plan was announced by the state government to build an Ayush Gram on the site. In 2003, Jerry Hall produced a series for the BBC titled Gurus, which included interviews with TM initiates, Jagger, and Cooke de Herrera, and a visit to the ashram in Rishikesh. Saltzman's photographs at the ashram have subsequently been displayed in galleries worldwide, published in two books and in a permanent exhibition above the retail units in the departure lounge of Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Mira Nair began work on a documentary film about the Beatles' visit to India; although no date for the film release has been announced.|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
5000|$|... Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor {{welcomed the}} arrest as <b>good</b> news <b>for</b> justice and {{regional}} stability, stating, [...] "This is <b>good</b> news <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> {{this part of}} Europe and for the world, but also for all the victims of Milošević's destructive policy." ...|$|R

2500|$|Lopez-Alegria later {{stated that}} he was skeptical of private {{tourists}} a few years ago, but now believes {{it is essential to}} the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: [...] "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as well," [...] he said. Ansari's presence in space [...] "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world." ...|$|E

You won't have any problem with Saddam. We'll be rid of the bastard soon enough. And in his place we'll install a pro-Western dictator, who will be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and for you." [...] He later denied saying this, but Avital confirmed it, according to Ben Terrall, an adviser to Maad H. Abu-Ghazalah, a Libertarian Party candidate who ran against Lantos that year.|$|E
2500|$|At 15:31 local time, {{the crew}} finally {{declared}} {{that there was}} no throttle response from either engine. As a result, the Captain took over the control from the First Officer. Even though the left engine of Flight 992's was inoperative, the crew didn't issue any emergency call at all. After the left engine failed, the right engine also started to fail, which was confirmed later by the crew. The crew then switched off several systems on the plane's engine, which were the engine anti – ice, ignition, and bleed – air. At the time, the Captain was still calm and didn't feel any emergency, stating [...] “okay this one is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> so far”.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Evans, looking round disparagingly. [...] "It ain’t <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> now; I was {{promoted}} to sergeant this morning. A sergeant can’t live in a common place like this." ...|$|R
2500|$|Illness {{is cited}} in Somerset's {{history as a}} {{potential}} reason why Young {{was seen as a}} [...] "moody and intimidating" [...] cricketer by his fellow players. Younger left-arm spinner Horace Hazell is quoted as saying: [...] "I admired him– he was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> Tom was very strict and didn't approve of us signing autographs outside the Oval. He didn't want us getting big ideas too quickly." [...] All-rounder Bill Andrews is reported as having asked Young why, after making 32 opening the innings against Larwood and Voce in a match against Nottinghamshire, he had kept his pads on. Young allegedly replied: [...] "Waste of time taking 'em off, son. We'll be soon bloody well in again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to {{release of the}} first videos, ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said on Fox News on September 20, 2009, [...] "n a way, this was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> so what it did was show up to us what weaknesses we have, and we have moved swiftly ... in order to correct that." [...] She said that after viewing the tapes, she had fired all the employees featured and had begun a comprehensive external investigation. As ACORN learned more from its employees of what had taken place, it called the videos [...] "false" [...] and [...] "defamatory". A spokesman accused O'Keefe of dubbing the audio on the videos. On September 23, 2009, ACORN filed suit in a Baltimore court against the filmmakers, citing [...] "extreme emotional distress" [...] of the ACORN workers and violation of two-party consent recording laws. It later allowed the suit to lapse.|$|E
2500|$|Gomez's {{appearance}} and portrayal were highlighted by some reviewers. Rap-Up {{called it the}} singer's most intimate video yet, while Idolator's Carl Williott called it [...] "understated". Alyssa Bailey of Elle said the clip was [...] "basically an instruction on how to be hot" [...] and proved [...] "power in vulnerability". Teen Vogue writer Casey Lewis said, [...] "But {{if she wants to}} look <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> she certainly succeeds...Actually good is an understatement". According to Geller, Gomez was as involved in the clip's overall intimacy as Muller, and her portrayal was [...] "well-played". Geller lauded the visual as [...] "a masterpiece of suggestion", saying that although Gomez's shower scene was [...] "PG-13", it was [...] "still sexy enough to make any respectable fan's tongue hang out". Francesca Bacardi of E! said Gomez should permanently choose her [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] natural look sported in the clip.|$|E

2500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2008 Under-19 World Cup the West Indies under-19s competed in the 2007–08 KFC Cup. Bravo played for the side in two matches, the first saw his team dismissed for a one-day record low total of 18, Bravo was one of six players who was dismissed without scoring. Bravo {{described it as a}} learning experience saying: [...] "Collins was getting a lot of movement and Edwards was bowling very fast. It was difficult to get them away but the experience was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and it came in handy in the other games." [...] At the under-19 World Cup Bravo played in all five of West Indies matches scoring 165 runs at 55. In the plate final against Nepal he took three wickets for nine runs (3/9) and scored 24 not out.

2500|$|Commenting {{on the use}} of the Oslo Session String Quartet, Rygg said, [...] "We {{worked a}} lot with {{simulating}} stringed instruments, so it's always <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to get some people in and play the real thing. I suppose strings and piano are our instruments of preference; those are the sounds we like to work with. That timbre, you know? In terms of writing music — not that we really write music per se, but say we did write music, we'd write it for strings and piano." [...] Adding, [...] "A lot of times when we get musicians into the studio we just get them to play along with preliminary ideas or themes. We can record hours of music and end up using one minute of it. But this time we had the body of the songs before the string quartet came, and we wrote down a part for them. It was a little more disciplined than before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{were often}} divided in their reviews for Wah Wah, but were mostly positive. The Independent said that [...] "a {{little bit of}} {{confusion}} is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> all" [...] whilst the NME called it [...] "one of the few genuinely engaging dance albums around." [...] Nonetheless, fans were more divided by the album, with the album's experimental bent meaning {{there was little to}} appeal to the more casual James fan. Retrospective assessment has been more positive, with Record Collector calling it a [...] "landmark" [...] album, whilst Allmusic noted that it was [...] "one of the more uncommercial albums any band of its stature and its accompanying major label has had a hand in releasing." [...] Select magazine named it the 45th best album of 1994 in their year-end critics poll. Wah Wah was remastered and re-released on clear heavyweight double vinyl in March 2015, alongside a remastered CD version in an expanded box set also containing a remastered edition of Laid, Laid & Wah Wah.|$|E
2500|$|Outsourcing is a {{new name}} for a long-standing phenomenon: the {{movement}} of jobs from the USA to countries where wages, benefits {{and the cost of}} living are much lower. In the 1970s and 1980s, heavy manufacturing jobs went to other countries by the tens of thousands. The result was cheaper <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> consumers and less pollution in many of the nation's industrial cities. Economists who backed the trend envisioned a new [...] "knowledge economy" [...] in which well-trained Americans would become the world's designers, innovators and administrators. The dirty work would be sent overseas.|$|R
