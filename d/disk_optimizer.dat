Diskeeper, a tool for reducing file fragmentation; V-locity Virtual Machine, a platform <b>disk</b> <b>optimizer</b> for virtual server; Undelete, which offers protection from and recovery of accidentally deleted files.|$|E
50|$|Spyware {{detection}} is made an {{even bigger}} priority in newer versions of the computer program, with the System Protector feature used to monitor the computer’s processes for any suspicious activity. A <b>Disk</b> <b>Optimizer</b> is also included with the latest versions of Advanced System Optimizer, which allows the applications on the machine to run more quickly and for the machine to boot in a faster manner. An Undelete feature is also included, allowing users to easily recover files that were accidentally removed from the computer system.|$|E
50|$|This {{version of}} Norton was {{released}} on September 5, 2012, together with the newest Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products. It was described as Version-Less in Symantec's press release alluding to automatic updates that always keep the software to its latest version. There is no specific version reference anywhere {{in the description of}} the software. The software is compatible with Windows 8. This version of Norton 360 features enhancements in social networking protection, anti-scam capabilities, and stronger networking defenses. Norton also introduced the extra tune up <b>disk</b> <b>optimizer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Reduces overall disk {{performance}} on systems where data is accessed regularly and in parallel on multiple partitions, because it forces the disk's read/write head {{to move back}} and forth on the disk to access data on each partition and to maintain and update file system administration areas on each partition. It also prevents <b>disk</b> <b>optimizers</b> from moving all frequently accessed files closer to each other on the disk, which could reduce the number and distance of required head movements. Files can still be moved closer to each other on each partition, but those areas themselves will still be far apart on the disk. (See [...] "short stroking" [...] considerations above.) This issue does not apply to Solid-state drives as access times on those are neither affected by nor dependent upon relative sector positions.|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} the end of 1982, the IBM PC DOS {{operating}} system that shipped with early IBM Personal Computers included a <b>Disk</b> Volume Organization <b>Optimizer</b> to defragment the 5¼-inch floppy disks that those machines used. Microsoft's MS-DOS did not defragment hard disks. Several third party software developers marketed defragmenters to fill this gap. MS-DOS 6.0 introduced Defrag. Windows NT, however, did not offer a Defrag utility, and Symantec was suggested as a possible source of the utility.|$|R
