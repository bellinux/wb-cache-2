40|$|Membrane {{complement}} (C) 1 receptors pecific {{for different}} parts of the C 3 molecule and for /~IH, C 5 a, and Clq have been described on a variety of different cell types (1). CR 1, specific for C 3 b and C 4 b, and CRz for C 3 d have been isolated and shown to be glycoproteins of 205, 000 Mr and 72, 000 Mr, respectively (2 - 4). Recently, the f l lH receptor also was isolated successfully using an anti- /~lH idiotypic ant ibody (5). 2 Specific antibodies to isolated C receptors indicated that a common structure for CR 1 is shared with erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils (2, 3) and that CR ~ is restricted to B lymphocytes (4). Because earlier studies had shown that monocytes (6, 7) and neutrophils (8) bound EAC 1 - 3 d, it was thought that these phagocytic ell types expressed a C 3 d-specific receptor that was similar to lymphocyte CR 2. However, it now appears likely that the EAC 1 - 3 d reagents used in these previous studies contained bound C 3 bi and little or no bound C 3 d. Previously, EAC 1 - 3 d were prepared by treatment of EAC 1 - 3 b with purif <b>ied</b> <b>C</b> 3 b inactivator (C 3 bINA) because it was believed that C 3 bINA removed C 3 c from the complexes, leaving only bound C 3 d. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that cleavage of f luid-phase C 3 b with purif <b>ied</b> <b>C</b> 3 bINA (9) resulted in formation of the C 3 bi fragment, and that EAC 1 - 3 b or EC 3 b treated with purif <b>ied</b> <b>C</b> 3 bINA contained only C 3 bi (EAC 1 - 3 bi or EC 3 bi) and no C 3 d (10). Further cleavage of C 3 bi into C 3 c and C 3 d required trypsin (9) o...|$|E

Both herbicides are extracted quantitat ively with supercrit ical 2 % methanol-modif <b>ied</b> <b>C</b> O 2 f rom both a Celite ™ matrix and water via solid phase extraction (SPE) disks. T h e Celite extractions {{are used to}} determine op t imum condit ions for extraction and {{to see if the}} analytes are indeed quantitatively extractable by SFE without the possibility of matrix interferences. Parameters investigated include solid phase trapping material, trap rinse solvent, trap temperature dur ing extract ion, removal of spiking solvent, type of supercrit ical f luid, and min imum extraction t ime. The SFE extracts are analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet absorbance detect ion. Extraction recoveries of 9 7. 2 % (RSD = 7. 8 %) and 93. 6 % (RSD = 5. 5 %) are achieved for sul fometuron methyl and chlorsulfuron, respectively, off of a C 8 S P E disk using 2 % methanol-modif <b>ied</b> <b>C</b> O 2.

40|$|The {{equation}} of one-dimensional {{gradually varied flow}} (GVF) in sustaining and non-sustaining open channels is normalized using the critical depth, <b>y</b> <b>c,</b> and then analytically solved by the direct integration method {{with the use of}} the Gaussian hypergeometric function (GHF). The GHF-based solution so obtained from the <b>y</b> <b>c</b> -based dimensionless GVF equation is more useful and versatile than its counterpart from the GVF equation normalized by the normal depth, y n, because the GHF-based solutions of the <b>y</b> <b>c</b> -based dimensionless GVF equation for the mild (M) and adverse (A) profiles can asymptotically reduce to the <b>y</b> <b>c</b> -based dimensionless horizontal (H) profiles as <b>y</b> <b>c</b> / <b>y</b> n → 0. An in-depth analysis of the <b>y</b> <b>c</b> -based dimensionless profiles expressed in terms of the GHF for GVF in sustaining and adverse wide channels has been conducted to discuss the effects of <b>y</b> <b>c</b> / <b>y</b> n and the hydraulic exponent N on the profiles.

Using a solid GaP sublimation source for phosphorus doping, epitaxial Ge 1 - <b>y</b> <b>C</b> <b>y</b> films were in situ doped on Si(100) substrates during solid source molecular beam epitaxy and we compare their electrical and optical properties with those of epitaxial Ge on Si. Infrared absorption revealed red shifts in the absorption of visible light with increasing P doping for both Ge 1 - <b>y</b> <b>C</b> <b>y</b> and Ge. The index of refraction decreases for Ge 1 - <b>y</b> <b>C</b> <b>y</b> layers compared with Ge. Free carrier absorption increased with increasing phosphorus concentrations, following a wavelength dependence of ~l 3. 1 {{in the region of}} 10 [...] 20 mm for heavily doped material.

40|$|Treatment with 60 yo {{hydrofluoric}} acid (HF) removed {{most of the}} phosphorus and small amounts of mannan, glucan and protein from walls of two non-flocculent strains (N <b>C</b> <b>Y</b> <b>C</b> ~ ~ ~ and NCYCI 004) and two flocculent strains (NCYCIOOS and NCYC I 063) of Saccharornyces cerevisiae. Organisms of all strains showed increased flocculating ability following H F treatment. Flocculation of untreated organisms of NCYCIOOS and N <b>C</b> <b>Y</b> <b>C</b> I O ~ ~, and of HF-treated organisms of all four strains, declined appreciably when they were washed in deionized water, with or without EDTA, and the flocculation was measured in deionized water instead of in 0. 05 M-sodium acetate containing Ca 2 +. Treatment with I,a-epoxypropane also caused {{a decrease in the}} flocculating ability of these organisms. Extracting the lipids from organisms of strains N <b>C</b> <b>Y</b> <b>C</b> ~ ~ ~ and N <b>C</b> <b>Y</b> <b>C</b> I O O ~ had no effect on their flocculating ability, but decreased the flocculating ability of organisms of strains NCYCIOO 5 and N <b>C</b> <b>Y</b> <b>C</b> I O ~ ~. pH-electrophoretic mobility curves of untreated and HF-treated organisms confirmed the loss of wall phosphate by H F treatment, and indicated that HF treatment had little effect on the content of protein carboxyl groups in the outer wall layers. Mannose at 0. 2 2 ~ completely prevented floc formation by organisms of strain N <b>C</b> <b>Y</b> <b>C</b> I O ~ ~; but, even at 0. 33 M, it had very little effect on floc formation by HF-treated organisms of strains ~ c u c 3 6 6 and ~cuc ro 63. Organisms of all four strains bound fluorescein-conjugated concanavalin A to the same extent after treatment with HF as before, but this treatment led to a greatly diminished binding of fluorescein-conjugated antiserum raised against organisms of strain N <b>C</b> <b>Y</b> <b>C</b> ~ ~ ~. The results indicate that phosphodiester linkages in yeast-wall mannan are not involved in bridge formation through Ca 2 + during floc formation and that this arises principally through carboxyl groups...|$|R
