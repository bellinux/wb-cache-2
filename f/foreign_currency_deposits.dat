The gold sales funded a like-for-like purchase of financial instruments in different currencies. Studies performed by HM Treasury had shown that the overall volatility of the UK's reserves could be reduced by 20% from the sale.|$|E

40|$|The debate {{regarding}} {{the usage of}} domestic currency versus dollarizing an economy is still robust in many developing countries. Dollarizing an economy commonly entails dollarizing bank deposits and loans, transacting in dollars and tagging prices {{of goods and services}} in dollar. In Tanzania, commercial banks have the power to open <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>deposit</b> accounts for any account holder, giving them the freedom to hold <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> and pay in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> Due to the strength of <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies</b> over the domestic shilling, investors prefer to hold bank accounts in <b>foreign</b> <b>currencies</b> preferably USD. This paper's main focus is dollarization and currency devaluation; of which are yet unresolved both theoretically and empirically. Using monthly nominal exchange rate data for the study period 2000 - 2014, the author introduced GARCH models {{to examine the relationship between}} dollarization and exchange rate. The Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity models indicate that dollarization does indeed induce currency depreciation as well as exchange rate volatility. Based on the findings and conclusions from other literature, this paper also proposes measures on how the country can prevent or offset the negative impacts of dollarization...|$|R
