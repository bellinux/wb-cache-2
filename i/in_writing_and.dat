5|$|Each team {{selected}} {{a squad of}} up to 15players, and any changes to that squad due to illness or injury had to be requested <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> approved by the ICC's Event Technical Committee. Three such replacements {{were made to the}} squads, with South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies making a change. England entered the tournament with the top-ranked players in both the ICC's batting and bowling rankings, Claire Taylor and Isa Guha respectively, but Australia were commonly lidted in the press as favourites to win the tournament. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, accumulating 324 runs, and her England team-mate Laura Marsh was the most prolific wicket-taker, claiming 16 wickets.|$|E

5|$|Sarsgaard {{was born}} at Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, Illinois, the son of Judy Lea and John Dale Sarsgaard. His father was an Air Force {{engineer}} and later worked for Monsanto and IBM. His surname originates in Denmark, where two of his paternal great-great-grandparents were born. Sarsgaard was raised a Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy. His family moved more than 12 times during his childhood, following his father's job. At the age of 7, Sarsgaard originally {{wanted to become a}} soccer player and took up ballet to help improve his coordination.

5|$|The {{revolution}} {{destroyed a}} colonial administration ruled {{from the other}} side of the world, and dismantled with it the raja, seen by many as obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed within a decade.|$|E
5|$|According to its May 1853 {{advertisement}} in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, {{the institute}} provided instruction {{to the following}} grades during its summer session: fifth grade for $5, fourth grade for $8, third grade for $10, second grade for $12, and first grade (its highest grade) for $15.

5|$|After touring {{with her}} former group Fugees, Hill became {{involved}} in a romantic relationship with Jamaican entrepreneur Rohan Marley, and shortly after, became pregnant with his child. This pregnancy, {{as well as other}} circumstances in her life, inspired Hill to make a solo album. Recording sessions for the album took place from late 1997 to June 1998 mainly at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, as Hill collaborated with a group of musicians known as New Ark <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> producing the songs. Primarily a neo soul album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill incorporates musical styles from R, hip hop, soul, and reggae. Its lyrics touch upon Hill's pregnancy and the turmoil within the Fugees, along with themes of love and God. The album's title was inspired by the film and autobiographical novel The Education of Sonny Carson, and Carter G. Woodson's The Mis-Education of the Negro.|$|E

The number of students who took diagnostic test and observation cards is 70 and 30 students respectively. Descriptive and analytic methods were used to analyze the data. The results showed that the EFL (junior) learners at Islamic University of Gaza, Palestine face various difficulties in learning intonation <b>in</b> <b>written</b> <b>and</b> spoken context. <b>In</b> addition, the students’ awareness of intonation in spoken context and simple intonation pattern was better than their awareness of intonation <b>in</b> <b>written</b> test <b>and</b> complex intonation pattern...|$|R
5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the orphanage}} staff {{who thought that}} Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her legal {{guardian}} in 1936, although she {{was not able to}} take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months, as Doc molested her. After staying with various of her and Grace's relatives and friends in Los Angeles and Compton, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe excelled <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> contributed to the school's newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.|$|E
5|$|In March 1942 the Indies were {{occupied}} by the Empire of Japan. The occupation government captured numerous (mostly Dutch) men and women, both clergy and laymen, and instituted policies that changed how services were held. They forbade the use of Dutch in services and <b>in</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>and</b> seized several church properties; several others, including the presbytery at Gedangan, were protected by the clergy. After two European head pastors, G. Schoonhoff and G. de Quay, were confined, ultimately on 27 August 1943 the ethnic Javanese Soegijapranata took on parish duties {{in addition to his}} work as vicar apostolic. Although he promoted non-compliance with Japanese demands considered damaging to the church, Soegijapranata also endorsed some collaboration. For instance, on 28 February 1944 a Latin-language Mass was delivered at Gedangan by , bishop of Nagasaki.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for {{masculine and feminine}} forms. The expected result would be -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E
5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend any laws, unless in cases of urgent necessity, he could do it with the consent of the Governor-General of India. He didn't have the power of {{creating}} a new office, or granting any salary, gratuity, or allowance, without the sanction of the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders and instructions of the Governor-General in all cases. The Governors could propose to the Governor-General drafts of any laws which they thought expedient, together with their reasons for the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering the reasons. The Governors regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of the Governors were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency. The departure of the Governor from India with intent to return to Europe was deemed to be a resignation from his office. Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> <b>and</b> delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E

Soegijapranata attempted to resist these seizures, at times filling the locations with people to make them unmanageable or indicating that other buildings, such as cinemas, would serve Japanese needs better. When the Japanese attempted to seize Randusari Cathedral, Soegijapranata replied that they could take it only after decapitating him; the Japanese later found another location for their office. He prevented the Japanese from taking Gedangan Presbytery, where he lived, and assigned guardians for schools and other facilities to prevent seizure. These efforts were not always successful, however, and several Church-run institutions were seized, as were church funds.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading habit, and he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was <b>in</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>and</b> he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E
