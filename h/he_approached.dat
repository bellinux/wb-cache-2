5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, <b>he</b> <b>approached</b> the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez.

As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
