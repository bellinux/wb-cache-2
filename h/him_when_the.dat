5|$|Bubbles {{was born}} in early 1983 in an Austin, Texas {{research}} facility that bred primates for animal testing. There are conflicting reports as to how he came into Jackson's possession. Multiple reports state that Jackson had Bubbles bought for <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> chimpanzee was eight months old. The acquisition {{was said to have}} been supervised by Bob Dunn, then one of Hollywood's most famous suppliers and trainers of animals for films, photoshoots and advertisements.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> time came to leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and remained behind, expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of}} his life, and he never remarried.|$|E
5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, {{and came to}} believe in the value of academic training for success as a composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> other members of The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, but he refused.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of the 716th Infantry Division, Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter, was informed at 01:20 of the parachute landings and that the bridges had been captured intact. One of his first actions was to contact Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division. Richter ordered the division to attack the landing areas. While Feuchtinger's tanks were delegated to support the 716th, it was {{also part of the}} German armoured reserve that could not move without orders from the German High Command. All German panzer formations could only be moved on the direct orders of Adolf Hitler, who was sleeping at the time and his staff refused to wake <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment received news of the airborne landings at 01:30, Luck ordered the regiment to their assembly areas north and east of Caen and to wait for further orders.|$|E

5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} and months prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated in the creation of Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a lack of confidence in the military, and thus betrayed <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1770s, Joseph also faced {{important}} diplomatic obstacles in consolidating Habsburg influence in Central Europe. When the British had been Austria's allies, Austria {{could count on}} British support in its wars, but Britain was now allied with Prussia. In the Diplomatic Revolution, the French replaced the British as Austria's ally, but they were fickle, as Joseph discovered when Vergennes extricated Versailles from its obligations. Russia, which also had been an important Austrian ally {{for most of the}} Seven Years' War, sought opportunities for expansion at the expense of its weak neighbors. In 1778, that meant Poland and the Ottoman Empire, but Joseph fully understood the danger of appearing weak in Russia's eyes: Habsburg lands could be carved off easily by the cagey Catherine's diplomatic knife. Still, Frederick of Prussia was the most definite enemy, as he had been throughout the reigns of Theresa and Franz before <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Prussian state's emergence as a player on the European stage had occurred at Habsburg expense, first with the loss of Silesia, and later in the 1750s and 1760s. Joseph sought to unify the different portions of his realm, not the German states as a whole, and to establish Habsburg hegemony in German-speaking central Europe beginning with the partition of Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest {{to be a very}} fast runner. Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top running back, being named on the All-American team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy. After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> war is over. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves many of his platoon, including his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs.

5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, Punk {{defended his}} title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by {{disqualification}} after interference from Big Show. When the night's special guest The Rock– who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble– intervened to save Cena from Big Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel. The following week, Punk justified his actions, explaining {{he was tired}} of people like Cena and Rock overshadowing <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> WWE Champion should be the focus of the company; Punk asserted himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk at SummerSlam where he successfully retained the WWE Championship. In the following weeks, Punk demanded respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart and eventually aligned with Paul Heyman in his feud with Cena. At Night of Champions, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a draw. Punk continued to feud with Cena, despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his Hell in a Cell opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match at Hell in a Cell, and replaced by Ryback. On October 28 at the pay-per-view, Punk, with help from referee Brad Maddox, defeated Ryback in a Hell in a Cell match to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
