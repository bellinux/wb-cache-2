In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen in all my travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E

Evans commented on the possibility of representing Team GB at the London 2012 Summer Olympics: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> then it's something I'd definitely look at doing.

[...] "I’ll say this, I’ve enjoyed each opportunity, but frequently <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> later, 'What previous experiences helped most to be an effective governor?,' that sort of thing. People would always expect me to name something from public life, but probably the experience in business, trying to manage for results, trying to get large numbers of people aligned and headed in a common direction, these were probably the most valuable days I spent." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the press}} conference in Hamburg, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> if Michael, Eve and Lucifer were {{historical}} figures {{of the past and}} I answered that they exist now, for example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan appeared to be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation [...] "work of art" [...] to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was unequivocal.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{was offered}} the part of Dot Cotton {{for a period of}} three months {{initially}} and in her own words, she was brought in [...] "merely to be Nick Cotton's mother because Nick was coming back again".

[...] Alejandro Fernández stated that as the production [...] and recording of his album was nearly over, {{he was told that}} Beyoncé wanted to record a duet with a Latino male for her next album. He stated: [...] "So when they suggested it, I liked the idea. I thought it was spectacular. So we went, I gave her the song and she liked it [...] We recorded it in one day.

[...] At a January 2010 closed-door meeting in the White House with liberal activists, Emanuel called them [...] "fucking retarded" [...] for planning to run TV ads attacking conservative Democrats who didn't support Obama's health-care overhaul. After the remarks were quoted in a front-page story of the Wall Street Journal, and after he was criticized by Sarah Palin, Emanuel apologized to organizations for the mentally handicapped for using the word [...] "retarded." ...|$|E

500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Coulthard agreed with the FIA's decision: [...] "I know {{there will be a}} debate over it but the fact is <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> beforehand and I said that, based on the previous years we've had here, the safest thing is to have a safety-car start". He added that although the safety-car start eliminated overtaking, it also prevented a major accident. Ralf Schumacher also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. However, ITV commentator and former driver Martin Brundle felt that the track was not wet enough for a safety car. Journalist Nigel Roebuck said that the length of time under safety-car conditions was inadequate, and raised the possibility of abandoning standing starts. FIA race director Charlie Whiting consulted Coulthard, the drivers' representative, before making his decision.|$|E
500|$|In 1954 Holloway {{joined the}} Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania. After {{playing at the}} Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company took the {{production}} to New York, where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression. [...] Holloway said of the experience: [...] "Out of the blue <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady and from then on, well, just let's say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age." [...] Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping for Joy. [...] American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E

As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is why I do this. People like you inspire me. You made a believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A.

500|$|As the {{postcard}} effort was reaching its peak, tabloid newspapers {{speculated that the}} Labour Party wanted to put Hewson up for the Irish presidential election of 2004, with the Daily Mirror quoting an unnamed party insider as saying, [...] "She's a mother of four but she has always had world issues at heart and she'd make the perfect candidate." [...] (Labour had succeeded with its candidate Mary Robinson in the 1990 election but came in fourth with Roche in the 1997 election.) Hewson stated {{that she had not}} been approached, and that [...] "It's not a serious proposition. It would obviously be a huge honour if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to take on such a huge task, but for one thing I'm not sure I'm qualified, and for another I've got four small kids to bring up first." [...] She also expressed contentment with incumbent President Mary McAleese staying for another term. She jokingly added that she could not see Bono agreeing to live in a smaller house. Hewson received a media mention two years later as a possible Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate in the 2004 European Parliament elections after John Hume had stood down. [...] The notion of her running for Irish president came up again in 2008 in conjunction with the 2011 election; columnist Fiona Looney wrote in the Daily Mail that while [...] "she is certainly a decent and smart woman", the position was better held by someone with a stronger background and more diplomatic experience. Hewson demurred once more, saying she did not speak the Irish language well enough, this time adding humorously that she could not see her husband being willing to walk behind her at events. The candidate that Labour did put up, Michael D. Higgins, won the post. Notwithstanding this speculation, Hewson generally shies away from political comments in the media.|$|E
500|$|Taare Zameen Par {{received}} several positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha {{suggests that the}} film is [...] "a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> how I liked Taare Zameen Par.
