40|$|Recently, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2 ̆ 2 OECD 2 ̆ 2) {{issued a}} report {{targeting}} 2 ̆ 2 <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> regimes 2 ̆ 2 -preferential, low tax regimes that are primarily tailored to rap into the tax bases of other countries. The report, Towards Global Tax Cooperation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> Practices, (2 ̆ 2 Towards Global Tax Cooperation 2 ̆ 2), identified a list of tax practices the OECD deemed harmful, such as 2 ̆ 2 ring-fencing 2 ̆ 2 (where foreign customers are subject to rules different than those applied to citizens which encourages the establishment of foreign entities with no substantial activities), a lack of transparency, {{and the absence of}} information exchange regarding tax practices. The OECD then released a second report, Framework for a Collective Memnorandum of Understanding on Eliminating <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> Practices (2 ̆ 2 Framework 2 ̆ 2). This report listed the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s objections to the policies of <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> regimes and provided a host of scheduled remedies, which presumably would be backed by the threat of sanctions detailed in Towards Global Tax Cooperation. Not surprisingly, the Commonwealth countries were among those identified as having <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> practices. In January 2001, the OECD met with the Commonwealth countries and other <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> regimes to negotiate a 2 ̆ 2 mutually acceptable 2 ̆ 2 tax policy.

After highlighting the issues at stake and addressing the January negotiations, this Development will consider how two Caribbean countries, the Bahamas and Bermuda, have reacted to the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s proposals.

Yet both have essentially adopted the core principles of the OECD proposals that eventually emerged from the January 2001 negotiations. Next, the essay will discuss the role of the Bush administration in shaping the accepted OECD proposals.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 19902 ̆ 7 s, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{has been very}} active in its {{campaign}} against 2 ̆ 7 <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition 2 ̆ 7. The campaign against <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> and offshore financial centres involved the naming and shaming of some 36 <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> Since then a number of <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> have agreed with the OECD to reform their bank secrecy laws and to become more transparent in their dealings with other countries. To some extent there have been threats of sanctions against <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> {{if they did not}} agree to co-operate but generally most <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> have accepted the views of the OECD.

40|$|The OECD's <b>Harmful</b> <b>Tax</b> Competition of 1998 {{departed}} in both {{tone and}} substance from almost anything the organization had published before. The {{roots of the}} associated project lie mainly in EU concerns that certain forms of intra-union competition were eroding both the corporate and personal income tax bases of member states. But it appeared impossible {{to deal with those}} problems unless policies were also changed in the 40 or so jurisdictions know as <b>tax</b> <b>havens.</b> HTC threatened sanctions against the <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> if they failed to collect and share information upon request about individuals and corporations attempting to evade or avoid income taxes. HTC also set criteria for the legitimacy of claims about corporate location. A firm could claim location in a <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> only if it had substantial activity there. The report created a furor among the <b>tax</b> <b>havens,</b> which complained loudly that they were facing a new form of colonial control by being held accountable for standards they had no role in setting. Over the next several years the corporate element of the project disappeared, and the style of the OECD's approach shifted from confrontation to cooperation. HTC was strongly supported by the Clinton Administration, and summaries of the project's development often stress how much change came with the election of George W. Bush. A careful look at OECD reports, however, reveals that much of the shift in direction occurred before the outcome of the U. S. election in 2000 had been determined. The revised focus on bank secrecy did yield results. Virtually all of the <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> had acceded to the revised OECD demands for transparency and information exchange by 2004. This article looks at the data on <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> liabilities to gauge the impact of the project on tax evasion. It employs the ARIMA technique to investigate both <b>tax</b> <b>haven</b> activity as a whole and the particularly important case of the Cayman Islands. No significant impact can be found probably because investment in the havens remains very easy to disguise and very difficult to detect. This suggests that an effective attack on personal income evasion will require more than the OECD demanded. Automatic information-sharing on the ownership based on an internationally consistent set of identifying numbers over a range of financial instruments holds greater promise for a significant decline {{in the use of the}} <b>havens</b> for <b>tax</b> evasion. ...|$|R
40|$|Hidden {{from the}} public eye {{financial}} capital has been completely reconfigured over {{the past thirty years}} in order to bypass nationally-based tax and regulatory regimes.

The existing global framework for cooperation on tax affairs is totally inadequate to its task, and the political will to tackle this problem is virtually non-existent as governments acquiesce to pressures from financial capital. Whilst poor countries lose an estimated US$ 500 billion annually to dirty money flows, which includes tax avoidance and related capital flight, neo-liberal pressure groups in the United States have been lobbying against the OECD initiative to stem <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition.

The OECD 2 ̆ 7 s <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition project has been actively pursued for the past 12 years and appears to be receiving worldwide acceptance.

Monaco does not apply any tax on income or capital for individuals and Liechtenstein has strict bank secrecy, both aspects {{are supposed to be}} counteracted by similar agreements. The purpose is to investigate whether the entered agreements increases transparency and effective exchange of information in accordance with the OECD´s objectives in the area. Furthermore, is there any regulation in the agreements that can be seen as potentially loopholes to avoid {{the exchange of}} information and if so; may these loopholes be justified in any way? OECD believe that the <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> favorable <b>tax</b> regulation is resulting in <b>harmful</b> <b>tax</b> competition and they identify lack of transparency and lack of effective exchange of information as the main reasons. A model agreement on exchange of information in tax matters has been designed in order to reduce those gaps. Through the Nordic Council of Ministers Sweden sign agreements on exchange of information with previous <b>tax</b> <b>havens</b> in order to provide the Swedish tax authority with relevant information in tax matters. Some of the regulations in the agreements may be seen as potentially loopholes. It is discussed in this thesis whether or not these loopholes may be justified on the basis of some other superior interest. Despite the loopholes, the agreement on exchange of information with previous <b>tax</b> <b>havens,</b> such as Monaco and Liechtenstein, will open up for transparency, ease of state secrecy and contributes to a more efficient effective exchange of information.
