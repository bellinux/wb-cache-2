25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, AI {{research}} was revived by the commercial success of <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> {{a form of}} AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts.

40|$|Over the years, {{one of the}} {{challenges}} of a rule based <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> is the possibility of evolving a compact and consistent knowledge-base with a fewer numbers of rules that are relevant to the application domain, in order to enhance the comprehensibility of the <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, the hybrid of fuzzy rule mining interestingness measures and fuzzy <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> is exploited as a means of solving the problem of unwieldiness and maintenance complication in the rule based <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> This negatively increases the knowledge-base space complexity and reduces rule access rate which impedes system response time.

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> and artificial neural networks.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the applicability of}} metrics collected during routine use to monitor {{the performance of a}} deployed <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> METHODS: Two extensive formal evaluations of the GermWatcher (Washington University School of Medicine) <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> were performed approximately six months apart. Deficiencies noted during the first evaluation were corrected via a series of interim changes to the <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> rules, even though the <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> was in routine use. As part of their daily work routine, infection control nurses reviewed <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> output and changed the output results with which they disagreed. The rate of nurse disagreement with <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> output was used as an indirect or surrogate metric of <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> performance between formal evaluations. The results of the second evaluation were used to validate the disagreement rate as an indirect performance measure. Based on continued monitoring of user feedback, <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> changes incorporated after the second formal evaluation have resulted in additional improvements in performance. RESULTS: The rate of nurse disagreement with GermWatcher output decreased consistently after each change to the program. The second formal evaluation confirmed a marked improvement in the program's performance, justifying the use of the nurses' disagreement rate as an indirect performance metric. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics collected during the routine use of the GermWatcher <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> can be used to monitor the performance of the <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> The impact of improvements to the program can be followed using continuous user feedback without requiring extensive formal evaluations after each modification.
