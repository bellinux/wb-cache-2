5|$|Based on <b>genome</b> <b>sequencing,</b> the Tapanuli {{orangutan}} {{separated from}} other orangutans about 700,000 years ago, {{and the two}} other species diverged about 400,000 years ago. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The ancestors of the Ponginae subfamily split from the main ape line in Africa 16 to 19 million years ago (mya) and spread into Asia.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. <b>Genome</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genes in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete <b>genome</b> <b>sequencing</b> have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first <b>genome</b> <b>sequencing</b> of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} {{a case of}} epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are {{also referred to as}} epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. Genetics is believed {{to play an important role}} in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and <b>genome</b> <b>sequencing</b> studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.|$|E
