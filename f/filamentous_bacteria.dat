5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented <b>filamentous</b> <b>bacteria</b> have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that filamentation is induced as a response of DNA damage (by the mechanisms previously exposed), participating SulA mechanism and additional factors. Furthermore, {{the length of the}} <b>filamentous</b> <b>bacteria</b> could have a stronger attachment to the epithelial cells, with an increased number of adhesins participating in the interaction, making even harder the work for (PMN). The interaction between phagocyte cells and adopting filamentous-shape bacteria provide an advantage to their survival. In this relate, filamentation could be not only a virulence, but also a resistance factor in these bacteria.|$|E

The addition of the <b>filamentous</b> <b>bacterium</b> to the axenic culture of C. marina resulted in the increase of algal cell yield and extension of the growth period. Vitamin B_ in the axenic culture was exhausted for 15 days of incubation, while its concentration increased from 3. 8 to 5. 8 ng/ml in the algal culture with the <b>filamentous</b> <b>bacterium.</b> These findings indicated that vitamin B_ was produced by the <b>filamentous</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{and that it was}} effective for the growth of C. marina. ...|$|R

25|$|The process {{involves}} air or oxygen {{being introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} screened, and primary treated sewage or industrial wastewater (wastewater) combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the organic content of the sewage. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely composed of saprotrophic bacteria but also has an important protozoan flora component mainly composed of amoebae, Spirotrichs, Peritrichs including Vorticellids {{and a range of}} other filter-feeding species. Other important constituents include motile and sedentary Rotifers. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of mucilaginous <b>filamentous</b> <b>bacteria</b> can develop including Sphaerotilus natans which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{responses}} are elicited {{depending on the}} predator and prey combinations because feeding mechanisms differ among the protists. Moreover, the grazing protists also produce the by-products, which directly lead to the morphological plasticity of prey bacteria. For example, the morphological phenotypes of Flectobacillus spp. were evaluated in the presence and absence of the flagellate grazer Orchromonas spp. in a laboratory that has environmental control within a chemostat. Without grazer and with adequate nutrient supply, the Flectobacillus spp. grew mainly in medium-sized rod (4-7 μm), remaining a typical 6.2 μm in length. With the predator, the Flectobacillus spp. size was altered to an average 18.6 μm and it is resistant to grazing. Interestingly, if the bacteria {{are exposed to the}} soluble by-products produced by grazing Orchromonas spp. and pass through a dialysis membrane, the bacterial length can increase to an average 11.4 μm. Filamentation occurs as a direct response to these effectors that are produced by the predator and there is a size preference for grazing that varies for each species of protist. The <b>filamentous</b> <b>bacteria</b> that are larger than 7 μm in length are generally inedible by marine protists. This morphological class is called grazing resistant. Thus, filamentation leads to the prevention of phagocytosis and killing by predator.|$|E
500|$|Many {{bacterial}} species exist {{simply as}} single cells, others associate in characteristic patterns: Neisseria form diploids (pairs), Streptococcus form chains, and Staphylococcus group together in [...] "bunch of grapes" [...] clusters. Bacteria {{can also be}} elongated to form filaments, for example the Actinobacteria. <b>Filamentous</b> <b>bacteria</b> are often surrounded by a sheath that contains many individual cells. Certain types, such as species of the genus Nocardia, even form complex, branched filaments, similar in appearance to fungal mycelia.|$|E

2500|$|Oxidative stress, {{nutrient}} limitation, DNA {{damage and}} antibiotics exposure {{are some of}} stress conditions to which bacteria respond, altering their DNA replication and cell division. <b>Filamentous</b> <b>bacteria</b> have been considered to be over-stressed, sick and dying members of the population. However, the filamentous members of some communities have vital roles in the population´s continued existence, since the filamentous phenotype can confer protection against lethal environments. Filamentous E. coli can be up to 70µm in length and has been identified playing {{an important role in}} pathogenesis in human cystitis. There are different mechanisms identified in some bacteria that are attributable to the development to filamentous forms.|$|E
2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] <b>Filamentous</b> <b>bacteria</b> are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol.|$|E
50|$|Intriguingly, Segmented <b>Filamentous</b> <b>Bacteria</b> {{were found}} to expand in AID-deficient mice, which lack the ability to mount an {{appropriate}} humoral immune response because of impaired somatic hypermutation; parabiotic experiments revealed the importance of IgA in eliminating Segmented <b>Filamentous</b> <b>Bacteria.</b> This {{goes hand in hand}} with an earlier study demonstrating the ability of monocolonization with Segmented <b>Filamentous</b> <b>Bacteria</b> to dramatically increase mucosal IgA levels.
