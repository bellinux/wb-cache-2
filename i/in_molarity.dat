SCGC is an improved way of concreting execution that does not require compaction and is made by complete elimination of ordinary Portland cement content. The parameters studied were superplasticizer (SP) dosage and molarity of NaOH solution. SCGC were synthesized from low calcium fly ash, activated by combinations of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions, and by incorporation of superplasticizer for self compactability.

Major mineral phases in the slag are dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) in γ form, merwinite, periclase and some other phases, all of which are non reactive in the presence of water. The slag was sieved into different fractions using 160 µm, 80 µm, 63 µm and 45 µm sieve and 2. 5 M, 5 M, 7. 5 M and 10 M NaOH was used for the activation. Isothermal conduction calorimetry results have revealed that heat flow and cumulative heat release improve significantly at 80 °C. The compressive strength results show that, at 0 initial stages (3 to 7 days), finer fractions of slag show better strengths whereas at later stages (28 and 90 days) fractions lower than 80 µm, show similar strengths.

In recent years, geopolymeric materials have attracted much more attention because of their excellent mechanical properties, good chemical resistance, low shrinkage, environmentally friendly nature and long-term durability. Fly ash, considered to be a waste substance is an important aluminosilicate source material for geopolymer production since it contains sufficient amounts of reactive alumina and silica. In this experimental study, F type fly ash was activated by 4 M, 8 M and 12 M of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions and the effects of pH on the properties of geopolymeric samples were investigated. All the pastes were cured at 80 °C for 15 hours. The compressive strength tests were carried out at the ages of 7 and 28 days.
