40|$|Steinmanella Crickmay (Bivalvia, Trigonioidea) is an abundantly {{recorded}} genus {{from the}} Tithonian-Barremian of the Neuquén Basin, Argentina. A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (<b>Weaver),</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis (Burckhardt) and <b>S.</b> quintucoensis (<b>Weaver).</b> <b>S.</b> quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank ribs. S. neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae. S. curacoensis has an oval outline, an inflated shell, poorly marked carinae and numerous flank ribs. S. quintucoensis was recorded in all the studied localities and is dominant at Cerrito de la Ventana. S. neuquensis and S. curacoensis were found only in Cerrito de la Ventana and Puerta Curaco. In the latter, S. curacoensis dominates the assemblage, while S. neuquensis is in both localities represented by a few specimens. All species are commonly found in black shales {{as well as in}} calcareous shales, along with other bivalves and ammonoids, and preservation is quite variable, some specimens being highly weathered (particularly in Puerta Curaco) while others remain almost pristine. Some were collected from thin storm-deposited packstones in Cerrito de la Ventana. The studied association represents a stratigraphic link between the Tithonian records of Steinmanella from the Picún Leufú Formation and the Late Valanginian to Hauterivian records from the Agrio Formation.

The {{version of}} record is {{available}} online at: [URL] {{aim of this}} study was to use in vitro nail models to investigate the potential of a novel base formulation (Recura) containing either fluconazole or miconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis in comparison to two commercial comparators (Jublia and a Penlac generic). Initially, a modified Franz cell was used, where sections of human nail served as the barrier through which drug penetrated into an agar-filled chamber infected with dermatophytes. A second study was performed using a novel infected nail model where dermatophytes grew into human nail and adenosine triphosphate levels were used as biological marker for antimicrobial activity. The novel enhancing system Recura increased the permeation of both existing drugs through human nail sections mounted in a modified Franz cell. Furthermore, the infected nail model also confirmed that the system also enhanced the permeation through infected nail resulting in a decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels superior (P ??? 0. 05) to Penlac generic and equivalent (P > 0. 05) to the commercial comparator Jublia. This study demonstrated that with the use of a novel permeation-enhancing formulation base, Recura enhances delivery of miconazole and fluconazole when applied ungually such that the efficacy was equivalent or superior to commercial comparators. Such a topically applied system has the possibility of overcoming the systemic side effects of antifungals when taken orally...|$|R

In fact, the second author previously defined affine self-linking invariants and used them to show that |K| is infinite for every knot in an orientable manifold unless the manifold contains a connected sum factor of S 1 × <b>S</b> 2; the <b>knot</b> K need not be zero-homologous and the manifold {{is not required to}} be compact. We show that when M is orientable, the number |K | is infinite unless K intersects a non-separating sphere at exactly one point, in which case |K | = 2; the existence of a non-separating sphere implies that M contains a connected sum factor of S 1 × <b>S</b> 2. For <b>knots</b> in nonorientable manifolds we show that if |K | is finite, then K is disorienting, or there is an isotopy from the knot to itself which changes the orientation of its normal bundle, or it intersects some embedded S 2 or RP 2 at exactly one point, or it intersects some embedded S 2 at exactly two points {{in such a way that}} a closed curve consisting of an arc in K between the intersection points and an arc in S 2 is disorienting...|$|R

40|$|The WFPC 2 of the HST {{has been}} used to obtain {{high-resolution}} images of NGC 4038 / 4039 that go roughly 3 magnitudes deeper in V than previous observations made during Cycle 2 (- 14 < M_V < - 6). To first order the luminosity function (LF) is a power law, with exponent α = - 2. 12 +/- 0. 04. However, after decoupling the cluster and stellar LFs, which overlap in the range - 9 < M_V < - 6, we find an apparent bend in the young cluster LF at approximately M_V = - 10. 4. The LF has a power law exponent - 2. 6 +/- 0. 2 in the brightward and - 1. 7 +/- 0. 2 in the faintward. The bend corresponds to a mass 10 ^ 5 M_, only slightly lower than the characteristic mass of globular clusters in the Milky Way (2 x 10 ^ 5 M_). The star clusters of the Antennae appear slightly resolved, with median effective radii of 4 +/- 1 pc, similar to or perhaps slightly larger than those of globular clusters in our Galaxy. However, the radial extents of some of the very young clusters (ages < 10 Myr) are much larger than those of old globular clusters. A combination of the UBVI colors, morphology, and GHRS spectra enables us to age-date the clusters in different regions of The Antennae. We find two groups of young star clusters with ages < 20 Myr and 100 Myr, as well as an intermediate-age group (500 Myr) and a handful of old globular clusters from the progenitor galaxies. Age estimates derived from GHRS spectroscopy yield 3 +/- 1 Myr for Knot K (just south of the nucleus of NGC 4038) and 7 +/- 1 Myr for <b>Knot</b> <b>S</b> in the Western Loop, in good agreement with ages derived from the UBVI colors. Effective gas-outflow velocities from <b>Knots</b> <b>S</b> and K are estimated to be about 25 - 30 km/s.
