40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>flux</b> <b>jump</b> instability of the Bean's critical state arising in the flux creep regime in type-II superconductors. We find the <b>flux</b> <b>jump</b> field, B_j, that determines the superconducting state stability criterion. We calculate {{the dependence of}} B_j on the external magnetic field ramp rate, Ḃ_e. We demonstrate that under the conditions typical {{for most of the}} magnetization experiments the slope of the current-voltage curve in the flux creep regime determines the stability of the Bean's critical state, i. e., the value of B_j. We show that a <b>flux</b> <b>jump</b> can be preceded by the magneto-thermal oscillations and find the frequency of these oscillations as a function of Ḃ_e.

The effect of sample history on magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>jumping</b> was studied and it was found to be well accounted for by the available theoretical models. The magnetic field sweep rate strongly influences the <b>flux</b> <b>jumping</b> and this effect was interpreted in terms of the influence of both flux creep and the thermal environment of the sample. Strong flux creep was found in the temperature and magnetic field range where <b>flux</b> <b>jumps</b> occur suggesting a relationship between the two. The heat exchange conditions between the sample and the experimental environment also influence the <b>flux</b> <b>jumping</b> behavior. Both these effects stabilize the sample against flux instabilities, and this stabilizing effect increases with decreasing magnetic field sweep rate.

40|$|A trapped {{magnetic}} field of greater than 3 T has been achieved in a single grain GdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -δ (GdBaCuO) bulk superconductor of diameter 30 mm by employing pulsed field magnetisation (PFM). The magnet system is portable and operates at temperatures between 50 K and 60 K. <b>Flux</b> <b>jump</b> behaviour was observed consistently during magnetisation when the applied pulsed field, Ba, exceeded a critical value (e. g. 3. 78 T at 60 K). A sharp dBa/dt is essential to this phenomenon. This <b>flux</b> <b>jump</b> behaviour enables the magnetic flux to penetrate fully to {{the centre of the}} bulk superconductor, resulting in full magnetization of the sample without requiring an applied field as large as that predicted by the Bean model.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of <b>flux</b> <b>jumps</b> {{in the high}} temperature superconductors is of importance since the occurrence of these jumps may limit the perspectives of the practical use of these materials.

30|$|In {{addition}} to <b>flux</b> <b>jumps,</b> raw pass-through paleomagnetic measurement may also contain spike noises. Different to <b>flux</b> <b>jumps</b> after which magnetic moment level {{does not go}} back to a previous level, spike noise is a sudden change in magnetic moment at a measurement position, after which the magnetic moment level goes back to that prior to the spike noise. At measurement positions with spike noise, measurement values are apparently distinct from the average values of the surrounding measurement positions. <b>Flux</b> <b>jumps</b> and spike noises both significantly affect the resulting paleomagnetic measurement, and measurements containing flux-jumps or spike noises need to be repeated or corrected before any paleomagnetic interpretation or deconvolution can be made (e.g., Oda and Shibuya 1996).

40|$|MRI magnets {{are useful}} medical devices in early {{detection}} and efficient treatment of disease or injury. Because of the significant better performance, MRI magnets are made of superconductors rather than made of copper. Nowadays, there are over 20, 000 superconducting MRI magnets installed worldwide. Most of them are made of NbTi or Nb₃Sn, but they are usually very expensive to purchase or operate. So, my colleagues chose MgB₂ wires to develop low-cost and easy-to-operate MRI units which serve {{to the majority of}} the humanity. Because we have a reliable technology to fabricate superconducting joints with monofilament MgB₂ wire, we decided to build our MgB₂ MRI magnet with monofilament wire instead of multifilament wire. Previously, <b>flux</b> <b>jumping</b> was found to be the main issue with monofilament superconducting wire; we have to demonstrate that <b>flux</b> <b>jumping</b> is not a big issue with monofilament MgB₂ wire before we can build our MRI magnet with it. In this thesis, a series of experiments was designed and carried out to prove that the monofilament MgB₂ wire performs as well as the multifilament MgB₂ wire in MRI magnet applications. Short samples of monofilament MgB₂ wires were tested, and magnetization trace of the short samples showed that <b>flux</b> <b>jumping</b> could be a minor issue with monofilament MgB₂ wire. Three 100 -m sample coils made of multifilament MgB₂ wire, monofilament MgB₂ wire, and monofilament NbTi wire were wound, tested and compared. The results of these tests demonstrated that the monofilament MgB₂ wire has insignificant <b>flux</b> <b>jumping</b> which does not lead to a premature quench.
