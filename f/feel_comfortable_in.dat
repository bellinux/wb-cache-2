5|$|In {{his first}} season with the Black Hawks, 1934â€“35, Morenz played in all 48 games for the team, scoring 8 goals and 34 points, an {{improvement}} over the previous season. The Black Hawks reached the playoffs, though Morenz was held pointless in the two games played. The following season was not as good for Morenz. He did not <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> Chicago, and was being benched, playing fewer minutes than he was used to. After 23 games with the Black Hawks, in which he scored 15 points, Morenz was traded {{for the second time}} in his career; he was sent to the New York Rangers on January 26, 1936, for forward Glen Brydson. Playing 19 games for the Rangers, Morenz scored 2 goals and had another 4 assists for 6 points, giving him 21 points over the season.|$|E

25|$|As {{technology}} {{continues to}} advance, {{more can be}} added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. The companies that design the controllers {{are trying to make}} the controller visually appealing and also <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> the hands of the consumer.|$|E

25|$|Considered {{the most}} {{powerful}} wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard {{in the style of}} Merlin. He almost constantly gives off an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore was the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he often uses humour to make people <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> his presence. As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of cunning and subtlety of mind that allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Tim Stelloh from PopMatters described the album as a [...] "loud, unpretentious, eclectic {{kick in the}} ass". He praised it for being [...] "full of both fear and curiosity, and those emotions were channeled through its production." [...] Dave Hughes, writing in Slant Magazine, stated: [...] "Ten years on, Aquemini is the single strongest aspect {{of one of the}} art form's deepest benches. Snappier and more experimental than the pair's early work, and focused enough to <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> a sprawl, it's the moment when OutKast came fully into itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Westmore {{said that}} he faced several {{challenges}} involving the make-up and masks during the filming of [...] "Caretaker". Because of {{the large number of}} Kazon present in the first episode, he hired additional make-up artists and mold makers to assist with getting all the actors into costume. According to supervising producer David Livingston, the process of applying the Kazon make-up took multiple hours. Since a majority of the scenes involving the Kazon were filmed at the El Mirage Lake, Livingston and the filming crew were assigned to help the actors <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> the heavy make-up and prosthetics despite the high temperatures.|$|E
500|$|Oliver [...] "Ollie" [...] Valentine is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor James Anderson. He {{first appeared in}} the eleventh series episode [...] "Proceed With Caution", broadcast on 9June2009. Oliver was introduced alongside his older sister, Penny (Emma Catherwood), as a Foundation House Officer 1 (F1) on rotation at Holby City Hospital. Series producer Diana Kyle intended their inclusion to have an [...] "instant impact on the wards." [...] Anderson was selected to play Oliver; he spent time with a real F1 doctor and trained with the programme's medical advisors to prepare for the part. It took him around six months to ease into the role, and a further six to <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> it.|$|E
500|$|The {{first week}} of {{recording}} produced [...] "Go", [...] "Blood", [...] "Rats", and [...] "Leash" [...] before the band hit a lull. In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least...

500|$|Misfortune awaited Bolt at {{the next}} major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much {{improved}} since the 2004 Olympics, {{and he saw the}} World Championships as a way to live up to expectations, stating, [...] "I really want to make up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything will fall into place". Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s. Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions. However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final. Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset. His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week. Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006. Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his primary event by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> his sprinting. He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May. After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.|$|E

His self-esteem received an added boost when he was invited to contribute to the quarterly The Edinburgh Review (his contributions, beginning in early 1815, were frequent and regular for some years), the most distinguished periodical on the Whig side of the political fence (its rival The Quarterly Review occupied the Tory side). Writing for so highly respected a publication was considered a major step up from writing for weekly papers, and Hazlitt was proud of this connection.|$|E

[...] Dotmusics Jaime Gill called Ms. Kelly [...] "old-fashioned", writing that [...] "Rowland's big problem {{is that she has}} the lungs but not the voice [...] She can holler like BeyoncÃ©, growl like Kelis or swoon like Aaliyah, but has little to no natural style of her own."
