50|$|Ferritic {{stainless}} steels generally have better engineering properties than austenitic grades, but have reduced corrosion resistance, {{because of the}} lower chromium and nickel content. They are also usually less expensive. Ferritic {{stainless steels}} have a body-centered cubic crystal system and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little nickel, if any, but some types can contain lead. Most compositions include molybdenum; some, aluminium or titanium. Common ferritic grades include 18Cr-2Mo, 26Cr-1Mo, 29Cr-4Mo, and 29Cr-4Mo-2Ni. These alloys can be degraded {{by the presence of}} sigma chromium, an <b>intermetallic</b> <b>phase</b> which can precipitate upon welding.|$|E
50|$|Single-crystal {{superalloys}} (SX or SC superalloys) {{are formed}} as a single crystal using {{a modified version of}} the directional solidification technique, so there are no grain boundaries in the material. The mechanical properties of most other alloys depend on the presence of grain boundaries, but at high temperatures, they would participate in creep and must be replaced by other mechanisms. In many such alloys, islands of an ordered <b>intermetallic</b> <b>phase</b> sit in a matrix of disordered phase, all with the same crystalline lattice. This approximates the dislocation-pinning behavior of grain boundaries, without introducing any amorphous solid into the structure.|$|E

The main emphasis of this review article is on <b>intermetallic</b> <b>phases</b> and their effects on corrosion and mechanical properties.

5000|$|Gamma Prime (γ'): This phase {{constitutes}} the precipitate used {{to strengthen the}} alloy. It is an <b>intermetallic</b> <b>phase</b> based on Ni3(Ti,Al) which have an ordered FCC L12 structure. The γ' phase is coherent with the matrix of the superalloy having a lattice parameter that varies by around 0.5%. Ni (Ti,Al) are ordered systems with Ni atoms at the cube faces and either Al or Ti atoms at the cube edges. As particles of γ' precipitates aggregate, they decrease their energy states by aligning along the <100> directions forming cuboidal structures. This phase has a window of instability between 600 °C and 850 °C, inside of which γ' will transform into the HCP η phase. For applications at temperatures below 650 °C, the γ" [...] phase can be utilized for strengthening.|$|E
50|$|Creep {{resistance}} {{is dependent on}} slowing the speed of dislocation motion within a crystal structure. In modern Ni based superalloys, the γ’-Ni3(Al,Ti) phase present acts {{as a barrier to}} dislocation motion. For this reason, this γ’ <b>intermetallic</b> <b>phase,</b> when present in high volume fractions, drastically increases the strength of these alloys due to its ordered nature and high coherency with the γ matrix. The chemical additions of aluminum and titanium promote the creation of the γ’ phase. The γ’ phase size can be precisely controlled by careful precipitation strengthening heat treatments. Many superalloys are produced using a two-phase heat treatment that creates a dispersion of cuboidal γ’ particles known as the primary phase, with a fine dispersion between these known as secondary γ’. In order to improve the oxidation resistance of these alloys, Al, Cr, B, and Y are added. The Al and Cr form oxide layers that passivate the surface and protect the superalloy from further oxidation while B and Y are used to improve the adhesion of this oxide scale to the substrate. Cr, Fe, Co, Mo and Re all preferentially partition to the γ matrix while Al, Ti, Nb, Ta, and V preferentially partition to the γ’ precipitates and solid solution strengthen the matrix and precipitates respectively. In addition to solid solution strengthening, if grain boundaries are present, certain elements are chosen for grain boundary strengthening. B and Zr tend to segregate to the grain boundaries which reduces the grain boundary energy and results in better grain boundary cohesion and ductility. Another form of grain boundary strengthening is achieved through the addition of C and a carbide former, such as Cr, Mo, W, Nb, Ta, Ti, or Hf, which drives precipitation of carbides at grain boundaries and thereby reduces grain boundary sliding.|$|E

But the 1 % appears as the critical content, when some particles became large enough to operate the nucleation of the brittle fracture.
