5|$|Domestic sheep are {{sometimes}} used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, {{in areas such}} as hypertension and heart failure. Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia. <b>In</b> <b>behavioral</b> sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E
40|$|Preprint / Technische Universität Ilmenau, Institut für Mathematik; 13 - 08 Abstract: We study linear differential-algebraic multi-input multi-output systems {{which are}} not {{necessarily}} regular and investigate the asymptotic stability of the zero dynamics and stabilizability. To this end, the concepts of autonomous zero dynamics, transmission zeros, right-invertibility, stabilizability <b>in</b> the <b>behavioral</b> sense and detectability <b>in</b> the <b>behavioral</b> sense are introduced and algebraic characterizations are derived. It is then proved, for the class of right-invertible systems with autonomous zero dynamics, that asymptotic stability of the zero dynamics is equivalent to three conditions: stabilizability <b>in</b> the <b>behavioral</b> sense, detectability <b>in</b> the <b>behavioral</b> sense, and the condition that all transmission zeros of the system are in the open left complex half-plane. Furthermore, for the same class, it is shown that we can achieve, by a compatible control <b>in</b> the <b>behavioral</b> sense, that the Lyapunov exponent of the interconnected system equals the Lyapunov exponent of the zero dynamics.

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning caused by lead in the body. The brain is the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, inability to have children, and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{second step}} is a Teach/Learn session where the {{instructor}} begins to present information {{based on what}} the participants don't already know. This is usually prefixed with a written statement describing <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> terms the objectives that the participant will complete during the session. The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking questions.|$|E

5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
25|$|The Institute for Behavioral Genetics (IBG) is a {{research}} institute within the Graduate School dedicated to conducting and facilitating research on the genetic and environmental bases of individual differences in behavior. After its founding in 1967 IBG led the resurging interest in genetic influences on behavior. IBG was the first post-world war II research institute dedicated to research <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> genetics. IBG {{remains one of the}} top research facilities for research <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> genetics, including human behavioral genetics, psychiatric genetics, quantitative genetics, statistical genetics, and animal behavioral genetics.|$|E

25|$|Another related {{explanation}} used <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> finance lies in herd behavior, {{the fact}} that investors tend {{to buy or sell}} {{in the direction of the}} market trend. This is sometimes helped by technical analysis that tries precisely to detect those trends and follow them, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.|$|E
25|$|The {{central issue}} <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> finance is {{explaining}} why market participants make irrational systematic errors contrary to assumption of rational market participants. Such errors affect prices and returns, creating market inefficiencies. The study of behavioral finance also investigates how other participants take advantage (arbitrage) of such errors and market inefficiencies.|$|E
25|$|Adaptation {{differs from}} flexibility, acclimatization, and learning. Flexibility {{deals with the}} {{relative}} capacity of an organism to maintain itself in different habitats: its degree of specialization. Acclimatization describes automatic physiological adjustments during life; learning means improvement <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> performance during life. These terms are preferred to adaptation for changes during life which are not inherited by the next generation.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>behavioral</b> ecology, {{polyandry}} is a {{class of}} mating system where one female mates with several males in a breeding season. Polyandry is often compared to the polygyny system based on the cost and benefits incurred by members of each sex. Polygyny is where one male mates with several females in a breeding season (e.g., lions, deer, some primates, and many systems where there is an alpha male).|$|E
25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to mental health treatment, two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient mental health treatment for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps <b>in</b> <b>behavioral</b> health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E
