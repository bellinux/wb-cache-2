40|$|This paper studies three {{different}} frequency controllers {{and their effects}} on the voltage disturbance ride-through capability of a VSC-HVDC supplied industrial system. The idea of implementing <b>frequency</b> <b>controller</b> {{is to improve the}} power quality of industrial plants by slightly decreasing the VSC output voltage frequency since industrial processes are more sensitive to voltage drops than frequency deviations. The first two controllers, frequency controllers I and II, are fixed frequency controllers and the third one, <b>frequency</b> <b>controller</b> III, is a PI <b>frequency</b> <b>controller.</b> In order to compare {{three different}} controllers, a system with a simplified VSC-HVDC and different load types is simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that with <b>frequency</b> <b>controller</b> III, the VSC-HVDC supplied industrial plant can avoid a voltage collapse by decreasing frequency during or after disturbances. Furthermore, with an increase of the converter current limit, the possibility of mitigating voltage dips increases. For frequency controllers I and II, the extent of the disturbance ride-through capability depends on the current limit of the VSC-UVDC. A higher current limit results in a higher ride-through capability. The effect of the dc capacitor on improving the system voltage disturbance tolerance is also investigated during and after disturbances when the VSC-HVDC uses <b>frequency</b> <b>controller</b> I. The system voltage disturbance ride-through capability increases with an increase of the dc capacitance or the current limit...|$|E

40|$|Utilization of windpower is {{considerably}} increasing {{in many countries}} around of the world. However, it produces an unreliable output due {{to the vagaries of}} the wind profile. To solve the problem, wind energy should be supported by local conventional sources. The requirements concerning the reliability and quality of electric energy supply can be most satisfactorily fulfilled when a windfarm is connected to a large electric power system. Then any electric power fluctuations, resulting either from wind turbulence or power demand variation, provoke system frequency variations. They should be damped by applying an appropriate control system of such a large power system. In this paper, the problem of control of a separate electric power system composed of windpower farm and supported by a gas turbine plant or a combined cycle has been investigated. First, the impact of wind turbulence on gas turbine plant control system has been modeled and simulated. This is carried out for different amplitudes and frequencies of wind speed. Next, the structure of gas turbine plant control system and its parameters have been adapted to limit the power and frequency fluctuations resulting from wind turbulence.
