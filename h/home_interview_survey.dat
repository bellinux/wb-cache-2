The aim of this survey is to discover recreational and tourist activity of Scottish residents Main Topics : Variables The Scottish Tourism and Recreation Survey, 1973 consists of three groups of files: the Home Interview files, the Holidays files and the Cordon Survey files. The <b>Home</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>Survey</b> files (SN: 2490) are based on 6938 interviews with 169 questions covering general matters, day trips, outdoor recreation, short stays, additional holidays, Scottish main holidays and theatre. The Holidays files (SN: 2491) amalgamate data from both the <b>Home</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>Survey</b> files and the Cordon Survey files. Each case corresponds to a holiday, including short holidays and winter and early spring holidays for Scottish residents. The Cordon Survey files (SN: 2492) are {{based on interviews with}} holidaymakers as they were leaving Scotland by rail, coach, ferry and plane. Different questionnaires were used at each cordon type, based on a common set of questions. The files consist of direct interview data, self-administered questionnaire data and route map and accommodation diary data...|$|E

The non-workers {{in the present study}} comprise of homemakers and the retirees. Activity and travel details collected using <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> formed the data base for the study. Multinomial logit models are used for analyzing the participation behaviour of non-workers in these activities. Age, travel mode, availability of household vehicles, presence of school going children, day of the week and time of day are some of the variables influencing these choices. The outcome confirms the previous findings on factors affecting non-work participation behaviour of non-workers in these activities. These models have wide applicability in determining the travel behaviour of non-workers and can serve as a major input to travel demand forecast...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} individuals, rather than family solidarities, {{have become the}} primary unit of {{household}} connectivity. Many households do not operate as traditional densely-knit groups but as more sparsely-knit social networks where individuals juggle their somewhat separate agendas and schedules.

40|$|Purpose: Mental {{well-being}} has aroused {{interest in}} Europe {{as an indicator}} of population health. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) was developed in the United Kingdom showing good face validity and has been previously adapted into Spanish. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the validity and reliability of the Spanish version of WEMWBS in the general population. Methods: Cross-sectional <b>home</b> face-to-face <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> with computer-assisted personal interviewing was administered with the 2011 Catalan Health <b>Interview</b> <b>Survey</b> Wave 3, which is representative of the non-institutionalized general population of Catalonia, Spain. A total of 1, 900 participants 15 + years of age were interviewed. The Spanish version of WEMWBS was administered together with socioeconomic and health-related variables, with a hypothesized level of association. Results: Similar to the original, confirmatory factor analysis fits a one-factor model adequately (CFI = 0. 974; TLI = 0. 970; RMSEA = 0. 059; χ 2 = 584. 82; df = 77; p <. 001) and has a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 930; Guttman’s lambda 2 = 0. 932). The WEMWBS discriminated between population groups in all health-related and socioeconomic variables, except in gender (p = 0. 119), with a magnitude similar to that hypothesized. Overall, mental well-being was higher for the general population of Catalonia (average and whole distribution) than that for Scotland general population. Conclusions: The Spanish version of WEMWBS showed good psychometric properties similar to the UK original scale. Whether better mental well-being in Catalonia is due to methodological or substantive cultural, social, or environmental factors should be further researched...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{land use and}} transport characteristics of a strip of urban development located along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island. The strip of land, with an area of 22. 5 sq. km, is 17 km long and has an average width of 1. 3 km. It {{has a population of}} approximately one million and provides over 700, 000 jobs. Despite its small size, it accommodates the CBD, residential districts, shopping complexes as well as most of the civic/institutional facilities that a city needs. Its urban form is linear not by design but by default - the topography of the area has constrained the development from spreading sideways. Surprisingly however, apart from economy in land utilization, it is considered to possess three other good qualities: high accessibility enjoyed by residents; few roads and commercially viable public transport. Its travel characteristics are analyzed, using results of a <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> conducted by the Government in 1992. In addition, various statistics published by the Government and public transport authorities are also used in the analysis. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To examine gender-specific and {{gender-sensitive}} {{factors associated}} with psychological health and morbidity. Design: Face-to-face <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> of random sample of 999 people aged 65 and over living in Britain. Results: A fifth of respondents had symptoms of psychological morbidity. Men with high self-efficacy had over six times the odds of men with lower levels, of scoring as a non-case with the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Women with excellent to good health status had over five times the odds of those in worse health of scoring as a non-case. Self-efficacy and mobility were the strongest independent predictive variables of GHQ score among men; health status and subjective QoL were the strongest, independent predictors among women. Discussion: This paper is unique in examining in detail the independent, gender-specific and gender-sensitive predictors of psychological morbidity in a national random sample of older adults. Optimism, self-efficacy, {{quality of life and}} mobility were gender-specific predictors, and health status was a gender-sensitive predictor of psychological morbidity.

40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} predictors of mortality among a national sample of elderly widowed people 28 years post baseline interview. Design and setting: {{face to face}} <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> across England. Measures: physical, psychological, social, and socio conomic status and circumstances. Results: excess risk of mortality, which had been noted {{up to six months}} post bereavement among males aged 75 +, had disappeared. In contrast to findings up to 13 years post-bereavement, neither psycho-social factors, social ircumstances or social class independently predicted differentials in mortality when analysed up to 28 years post-bereavement. The most significant, independent predictors, up to the 28 -year term, were, as would be expected, male sex, older age, poorer physical functioning, and expressed ‘relief at the death of the spouse’. When the sample was split by duration of widow(er) hood male sex and older age retained significance. Conclusion: the increasing frailty of the sample overall, and reduced statistical power in split-sample analyses, may explain the loss of significance of physical functioning and ‘expressed relief at the death’ in the split-sample results. The psycho-social risk factors for mortality after bereavement reduce over time, although further examination of expressed relief would be worthwhile...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Clustering {{is one of}} {{the useful}} {{unsupervised}} data mining techniques which determine groups in data without labels or classes. Most clustering algorithms behave differently depending on the features of the data set and the initial assumptions for defining groups. Hence, in most applications the clustering scheme requires evaluation and assessment of its validity. In this paper it is proposed to compare different clustering algorithm results with respect to a real world dataset namely Household Interview Survey(HIS) data and make a study of the dependency of clustering criteria on the dataset and assess their suitability. Prior work [4], [5] involved application of data mining techniques including clustering and classification techniques on <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> data and showed their use in extracting previously unknown knowledge. There are a number of widely used algorithms in data mining commonly implemented in commercial and open source software which have been used in the present work. The present paper compares the results of various clustering algorithms on the transportation data and explores their use in this domain. Specifically, EM algorithm is compared with other algorithms using the popular log likelihood criteria for comparison and the problems of these algorithms are identified on the datase...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the factors related to travel mode choices in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area. Changes in population, life style and economy of the Dallas-Fort Worth region {{over the last few}} decades demand a careful re-examination of travel demand tools and methods. The {{purpose of the study was}} to provide an understanding of transportation modal choice in the region. Those demographic variables best predicting the choices were identified. The <b>Home</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>Survey,</b> a set of disaggregate data from the 19 84 North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) Regional Travel Survey, was analyzed using logistic regression. The major findings of the research indicate that about 97 percent of the travelers in the study area used private cars and 3 percent used public transit. Household income and cars-vans were significant explanatory variables. The impact of household income and number of car-vans available upon an individual's decision for travel mode choice were very important. The number of car-vans available in the household, and age of respondents were significant predictors in travel mode. Household members with incomes of $ 30, 000 to $ 39, 000 and those with incomes of at least $ 50, 000 tended to use more private cars than did other income groups. Also, household members with incomes below $ 9, 000 used more public transportation. People reporting a lower preference for cars were younger than 26 years or older than 55 years of age...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} {{the validity and}} reliability of responses to a self-report home safety survey designed {{for use in a}} community-based child injury prevention program. Methods: A cross-sectional study of home-based injury risk factors and safety practices was administered to a random sample of households (n?=? 614) in two rural and remote communities in Queensland, Australia using a Computer Assisted Telephone <b>Interview</b> (CATI) <b>survey.</b> The survey was re-administered during subsequent <b>home</b> <b>interviews</b> with a sub-sample (n?=? 85) of CATI participants. Results: For all self-reported hazards and safety practices, prevalence estimates obtained from the CATI survey were significantly different from those directly observed at the <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> with proportions of homes exposed to hazards between 10 - 21 % under reported at CATI survey and safety practices over-reported at CATI survey by 17 - 24 %. There was no statistically significant difference however between the estimates of prevalence of hazards and safety practices self-reported at CATI and <b>home</b> <b>interview.</b> Validity of the CATI survey was poor with sensitivity of the CATI question ranging from 0 to 71 and specificity from 32 to 97. While the marginal distribution of prevalences of hazard prevalences and safety practices were similar between CATI and <b>home</b> <b>interviews,</b> the low level of response concordance (??=?- 0. 24 to 0. 41) indicates that reliability of the responses to these questions was low. Conclusion: In view of these limitations in the accuracy of CATI risk factor surveys, their use for priority setting and evaluation in community-based injury prevention programs needs to be considered with caution.

Palembang is capital city of South Sumatera Province, which has three Terminals in the border area with surrounding kabupaten (district). Right now the Terminal is not functioned appropriately because many public transport vehicles are loading and unloading passengers outside the Terminal, or on the street nearby the Terminal. On the other hand, the city centre itself has been crowded of private vehicles (car and motor cycle). The current on street parking system has been no longer adequate.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{theoretical and empirical}} issues involved in modeling complex travel patterns. Existing models have the shortcoming of not representing the interdependencies among trip links in trip chains with multiple non-home stops. A theoretical model based on utility theory and explicitly accounting for the trade-offs involved {{in the choice of}} multiple-stop chains is developed. Using this theoretical model, utility maximizing conditions for a household's choice of a daily travel pattern are derived. The optimum travel pattern is described {{in terms of the number}} of chairs (tours) traveled on a given day and in terms of the number of stops (sojourns) made on each of those chains. For a given household, the form of the optimum pattern is a function of the transportation expenditures (time, cost) required to reach potential destinations. Constraints on the conditions of optimality due to the limited and discrete nature of travel pattern alternatives are also considered. Parameters of the general utility function were estimated empirically using actual travel data derived from a <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> taken in Washington, D. C. The multinomial logit model is used to relate utility scores for the alternative travel patterns to choice probabilities. The resulting parameter estimates agree with theoretical expectations and with empirical results obtained in other studies. In order to demonstrate the empirical and theoretical implications of the model, forecasts for various transportation policies (e. g., gasoline price increases, transit fare reductions), as made by this model and by other less complex models, are compared. The results of these comparisons indicate the need for expanding the scope of existing travel forecasting models to explicit considerations of trip chaining behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the association between}} joint complaints and locomotor disability. METHODS [...] During a <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> 1901 men and 3135 women aged 55 years and over (the Rotterdam Study) were asked about joint pain and morning stiffness in the past month, and locomotor disability was assessed by six questions from the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). RESULTS [...] The prevalence of locomotor disability was 24. 5 % for men and 40. 5 % for women. The prevalence of joint pain in men was 0. 7 % for pain in the hips, knees, and feet simultaneously, 3. 7 % for pain at two joint sites, 16. 0 % for pain at one joint site, and 20. 4 % for pain in the hips and/or knees and/or feet (any joint site); the corresponding estimates for women were 1. 9 %, 9. 0 %, 23. 7 %, and 34. 5 %, respectively. The prevalence of generalised morning stiffness was 4. 9 % for men and 10. 4 % for women. The age adjusted odds ratios for locomotor disability in men ranged from 2. 4 of pain at one joint site to 8. 8 of pain at all three joint sites; for women these odds ratios varied between 2. 5 and 5. 7, respectively. The age adjusted odds ratios of generalised morning stiffness were 8. 0 for men and 7. 3 for women. CONCLUSION [...] There is a strong and independent association between locomotor disability and age, joint pain, and generalised morning stiffness in people aged 55 years and over. The odds for locomotor disability increase onefold for every year increase in age, while the presence of generalised morning stiffness is of greater influence than the presence of joint pain...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 28 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 6 - 9 July 2009 "Sustainable Transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Internationally, travel diaries of various forms have served as the principal means of collecting revealed preference travel data. Household interview travel survey experiences in African cities,however, have demonstrated that the collection of travel diary data is problematic for both respondents and interviewers. This paper reports {{on the development of}} a travel diary instrument for use in a planned 24 -hour recall <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> in Cape Town, Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. As part of the development of this survey instrument an experiment was undertaken to assess the appropriateness and feasibility of different travel diary forms. In {{other parts of the world}} travel diaries have taken three main forms: trip-based, activity-based and place-based diaries. Variations of these three basic diary forms include: the recording of trips in either tabular or sequential question format; the prospective or retrospective request for respondent recall; and the use of memory joggers. The paper describes the impact of alternative travel diary forms on respondent burden, trip and trip stage recall rates, interviewer cognition and item recording or nonresponse errors, and respondent cognition and item recording errors. On the basis of the experiment findings, it is concluded that place-based diaries in sequential question format, with associated memory joggers, are likely to yield highest rates of trip recall and lowest rates of measurement error and item non-response in city contexts with respondent populations similar in socio-demographic nature to those in Cape Town and Dar es Salaam.

40|$|Abstract Background Response {{rates in}} surveys have been falling {{over the last}} 20 years, leading {{to the need for}} novel {{approaches}} to enhance recruitment. This study describes strategies used to maximise recruitment to a <b>home</b> <b>interview</b> <b>survey</b> of mothers with young children living in areas of high deprivation. Methods Mothers of two year old children received a letter from their GP inviting them {{to take part in a}} survey on diet. Participants were subsequently recruited by a researcher. The researcher first tried to contact potential participants by telephone, to discuss the study and make an appointment to conduct a home interview. Where telephone numbers for women could not be obtained from GP records, web searches of publicly available databases were conducted. After obtaining correct telephone numbers, up to six attempts were made to establish contact by telephone. If this was unsuccessful, a postal request for telephone contact was made. Where no telephone contact was achieved, the researcher sent up to two appointments by post to conduct a home interview. Results Participating GPs invited 372 women to take part in a home based interview study. GP practices provided telephone numbers for 162 women, of which 134 were valid numbers. The researcher identified a further 187 numbers from electronic directories. Further searches of GP records by practice staff yielded another 38 telephone numbers. Thus, telephone numbers were obtained for 99 % of potential participants. The recruitment rate from telephone contacts was 77 %. Most of the gain was achieved within four calls. For the remaining women, contact by post and home visits resulted in 18 further interviews, corresponding to 35 % of the women not recruited by telephone. The final interview rate was 82 %. This was possible because personal contact was established with 95 % of potential participants. Conclusion This study achieved a high response rate in a hard to reach group. This was mainly achieved by first establishing contact by telephone. The use of multiple sources identified the telephone numbers of almost all the sample. Multiple attempts at telephone contact followed by postal approaches led to a high home interview rate. </p...|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{there is}} a {{research}} tradition that measures fraud against regulations by interviewing eligible individuals using a survey. In these studies the sensitive questions about fraud are posed by using a randomized response method. The paper describes {{the results of a}} Dutch study into the consequences of replacing <b>home</b> <b>interviews</b> by trained interviewers with Internet-delivered <b>interviews</b> in a <b>survey</b> on fraud in the area of disability benefits. Both surveys used computer-assisted self-interviews with randomized response questions. This study has three goals: first to present the research tradition that makes use of randomized response, second to compare the results of <b>home</b> <b>interviews</b> and the Internet survey and finally to introduce an adapted weighted logistic regression method to test the relationship between the probability of fraud and explanatory variables. The results show that there are no systematic differences between modes of interview, either for estimates of the prevalence of fraud or for the identification of associated variables. These outcomes result in the conclusion that the Internet survey is a useful and cost-effective instrument for measuring fraud in a population, and that it is unlikely that replacing <b>home</b> <b>interviews</b> with the Internet survey will result in a significant break with tradition.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the concurrent validity {{of a list}} of chronic conditions used in health <b>interview</b> <b>surveys.</b> The results regarding the prevalence of chronic diseases from three health <b>interview</b> <b>surveys,</b> carried out in The Netherlands during the 1980 s, were compared. In addition, the results for chronic diseases {{of one of these}} health <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> were checked against the medical records of 11 randomly selected general practices. The comparison indicates the prime importance of the wording of the question. The level of agreement between information about chronic conditions provided by patients and by general practice medical records differed widely for the separate disease categories. This was especially true for the reporting of migraine/serious headache, other diseases of the neurological system, diseases of the stomach and intestines and serious consequences of injury. Age, sex, level of education and how long the interviewee was registered as a patient at the practice played a minor role in these differences. When quantifying health differences it is essential to understand the impact of methodological influences, as minor differences in survey methodology have a substantial effect on the prevalence of chronic disease. Moreover, health <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> measure a different health status than general practice morbidity surveys. Neither method is the gold standard for the other. A consensus on instruments and methodological procedures of health <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> at {inter) national level should be sought. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
