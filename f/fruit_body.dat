5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>body,</b> often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding <b>fruit</b> <b>body.</b> Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Dennis McCabe {{studied the}} {{development}} of the <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> using specimens grown in pure culture. Starting out as a hyphal tuft, the fungus grows into a cup shape before eventually closing in completely to create the spherical structure of the mature <b>fruit</b> <b>body.</b> When the fungus is in the cup stage, the exposed hymenium is immature; typically, spores develop after the <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> is fully closed. In some cases, the <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> stops developing at the cup stage while the hymenium continues to mature. This results in a cup-shaped fungus with an exposed layer of basidia bearing normal and mature spores. Limnoperdon incarnatum is a structurally simple fungus, and relatively easy to grow in culture, suggesting it may have potential as a model organism for <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> development in general. Under the experimental conditions used, fruit bodies matured to produce spores about 72 hours after the fungus started growing. The aborted cups resemble the sporocarps of the cyphelloid fungi, but can be distinguished by their orthotrophic spore attachment and the lack of ballistospory (forceful spore discharge). McCabe and Escobar later suggested that the fungus may have evolved the loss of ballistospory by being compensated with the cup-shaped <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> closing at maturity. Halocyphina villosa is another small cup-shaped Basidiomycete fungus that has adapted to a marine environment; in contrast to L.incarnatum, however, it starts out with a closed <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> that later opens up to become cup-shaped.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> remains closed until {{shortly before}} spore discharge; {{dehiscence}} (<b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> opening) {{is caused by}} the pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the <b>fruit</b> <b>body</b> and the outside environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} iPB content on the <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> {{developing}} times were not seen with FMC 239 at 5  % risk (Pr =  0.09), but seen with FMC 245 at 5  % risk (Pr =  0.04). The averages of all <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> developing times for FMC 239 were 27.0 (σ =  5.9). The regression equation for FMC 245 was as follows: (<b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> developing times) =  2.4  × (iPB contents) +  26.2 (r =  0.38, P =  0.04). The effects of iPB contents {{on the wet}} <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights with FMC 239 and 245 were seen at 5  % risk, because the Prs were both 0.01. The regression equation was as follows: (FMC 239 wet <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights) =  12.0  × (iPB contents) +  61.9 (r =  0.45, P =  0.01) and (FMC 245 wet <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights) =  6.3  × (iPB contents) +  74.2 (r =  0.45, P =  0.01). There was no significant correlation between the dried <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights and media iPB contents at 5  % risk with FMC 239 and 245 because the Prs were 0.06 and 0.07, respectively. These {{results showed that the}} iPB addition to the sawdust media made the <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> developing times long. The iPB addition also made the <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> statistically watery, but the actual <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> water contents of FMC 239 and 245 were 89.2  % (σ =  1.5  %) and 89.1  % (σ =  1.4  %), respectively. The iPB suspension included sodium salt as a dispersant; these admixtures might affect the <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> developing times, water contents and so on, but differences in appearance of <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> were not observed. It was thought that the impacts of the iPB addition on <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> cultivation were small, except for the <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> developing times.|$|R

However, the actual K content ranged from 6.1 to 28.5  g/kg. The effect of K content increase on the <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> developing time was not seen, because Pr was 0.25. The average of all <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> developing times was 11.2 (σ =  0.8) days. In contrast, clear decreasing tendencies were seen on the wet <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights and the dried <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights with increasing medium K contents at 1  % risk, and the regression equations were as follows: (wet <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights) = − 1.49  × (K contents) +  87.69 (r = − 0.89, P <  0.01); (dried <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> weights) = − 0.07  × (K contents) +  7.55 (r = − 0.68; P <  0.01).

40|$|BACKGROUND:A major {{challenge}} for evolutionary biology is explaining altruism, {{particularly when it}} involves death of one party and occurs across species. Chimeric <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> of Dictyostelium discoideum and Dictyostelium purpureum develop from formerly independent amoebae, and some die to help others. Here we examine co-aggregation between D. discoideum and D. purpureum, determine its frequency and which party benefits, {{and the extent of}} fair play in contribution to the altruistic caste. RESULTS:We mixed cells from both species in equal proportions, and then we analyzed 198 individual <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies,</b> which always had either a D. discoideum or D. purpureum phenotype (D. discoideum- 98, D. purpureum- 100). Fifty percent of the <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> that looked like D. discoideum and 22 % of the <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> that looked like D. purpureum were chimeric, though the majority of spores in any given <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> belonged to one species (D. discoideum fruiting bodies- 0. 85 +/- 0. 03, D. purpureum fruiting bodies- 0. 94 +/- 0. 02). Clearly, there is species level recognition occurring that keeps the cells mostly separate. The number of <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> produced with the D. discoideum phenotype increased from 225 +/- 32 <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> when D. discoideum was alone to 486 +/- 61 in the mix treatments. However, the number of D. discoideum spores decreased, although not significantly, from 2. 75 e 7 +/- 1. 29 e 7 spores in the controls to 2. 06 e 7 +/- 8. 33 e 6 spores in the mix treatments. D. purpureum <b>fruiting</b> <b>body</b> and spore production decreased from 719 +/- 111 <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> and 5. 81 e 7 +/- 1. 26 e 7 spores in the controls to 394 +/- 111 <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies</b> and 9. 75 e 6 +/- 2. 25 e 6 spores in the mix treatments. CONCLUSION:Both species appear to favor clonality but can cooperate with each other to produce <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies.</b> Cooperating amoebae are able to make larger <b>fruiting</b> <b>bodies,</b> which are advantageous for migration and dispersal, but both species here suffer a cost in producing fewer spores per <b>fruiting</b> <b>body...</b>|$|R
