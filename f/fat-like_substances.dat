50|$|Lipid Metabolism Disorders are {{illnesses}} where trouble {{occurs in}} breaking down or synthesizing fats (or <b>fat-like</b> <b>substances).</b> A {{good deal of}} the time these disorders are hereditary, meaning it's a condition that is passed along from parent to child through their genes. Gaucher's Disease (Type I, Type II, and Type III), Neimann-Pick Disease, Tay-Sachs Disease, and Fabry's Disease are all diseases where those afflicted can have a disorder of their body's lipid metabolism. Rarer diseases concerning a disorder of the lipid metabolism are Sitosterolemia, Wolman's Disease, Refsum's Disease, and Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis.|$|E
40|$|The {{fat content}} {{of milk and}} milk {{products}} was estimated mostly by fast and simple, though often empirical methods, and reference to more absolute standard methods was necessary. Some of these reference methods were studied to obtain a complete picture of the exactitude, repeatibility, utility and limitations of the various methods applied to various products. Special emphasis was laid on the recovery of fat and <b>fat-like</b> <b>substances</b> and on the contamination of the collected fat by non- fatty components and artefacts. The Röse Gottlieb method proved appropriate for most products. For cheese, the Schmid Bondzynski Ratzlaff method was recommended, but for most other products this method or its modifications were unsatisfactory. The Weibull method could not be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Cholesterol is a <b>fat-like</b> <b>substance,</b> {{found in}} the blood stream and also in bodily organs and nerve fibres. While there are {{different}} etiological roles for various types of cholesterol, such as high and low density lipoprotein, {{the large majority of}} descriptive and epidemiological data are available only for total cholesterol levels. Therefore, in this analysis, cholesterol was defined as total serum cholesterol expressed in millimoles per litre of blood (mmol/l) a continuous variable with mean and standard deviation. The primary outcomes assessed were ischaemic heart disease (Global Burden of Disease [GBD] study end-point 107) and non-fatal stroke (end-point 108). Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was chosen on the basis of clear and consistent positive associations observed in cohort studies and evidence of reversibility in clinical trials of cholesterol lowering treatments. Cholesterol is positively associated with ischaemic stroke, but has a qualitatively different association with haemorrhagic stroke. As endpoint...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of education about nutrition and cholesterol on the knowledge level of women. Data obtained from women aged 17 - 50 (n = 48). The model of pretest (education) -post-test was applied at the study. A question form and an assessment test were improved and they were applied as an assessment test before pretest and following a five-week education program it was applied once again as a post-test. There determined a significance between the average scores of pre and post test of the questions taken in the category of data questions of nutrition consumption "saturated fats are effective on the increase of bad-cholesterol" and the one in the category of energy and nutrition components "protein is essential for the growth and repair of body tissues" (p< 0. 01). When we examine the data questions dealing with cholesterol, it is obvious that the questions "cholesterol is a <b>fat-like</b> <b>substance</b> existing in all cells of the body" (p< 0. 05) change significantly depending on their test scores. It was determined that the education given over nutrition and cholesterol brought about a positive change at the knowledge levels of women...|$|R

40|$|Having {{high blood}} {{cholesterol}} puts you {{at risk of}} heart disease, {{the leading cause of}} death in the United States. People with high cholesterol have about twice the risk of heart disease as people with lower levels. Cholesterol is a waxy, <b>fat-like</b> <b>substance.</b> Your body needs some cholesterol, but it can build up on the walls of your arteries and lead to heart disease and stroke when you have too much in your blood. 71 million American adults (33. 5 %) have high low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad, ” cholesterol. 1 Only 1 out of every 3 adults with high LDL cholesterol has the condition under control. 1 Less than half of adults with high LDL cholesterol get treatment. 1 Lowering your cholesterol can reduce your risk of having a heart attack, needing heart bypass surgery or angioplasty, and dying of heart disease. Exercising, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking will help you prevent high cholesterol and reduce your levels. High cholesterol has no symptoms, so many people don’t know that their cholesterol is too high. Your doctor can do a simple blood test to check your levels. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends that adults get their cholesterol checked every five years. Desirable Cholesterol Levels 2 Total cholesterol Less than 200 mg/dL LDL ("bad " cholesterol) Less than 100 mg/dL HDL ("good " cholesterol) 60 mg/dL or higher Triglycerides Less than 150 mg/d...|$|R
40|$|Five common {{freshwater}} algae {{were grown}} in the ten possible two-mcmbcred combina-tions. No two species grew as well in mixed cultures as they did separately. One combi-nation, Haematococcus-Chlamydomonas, was selected for more detailed study. When grown {{together in the same}} container, Haematococcus pluvialis and Chlamydomonas reinhardi were found to be incompatible. The latter invariably dominated the cultures, usually within 3 - 5 days after inoculation. The rate at which Chlamydomonas eliminated Haematococcus was influenced by a number of factors, the most important being light intensity and nitro-gen source. Inh’ibition of IIuematococcus was due to a <b>fat-like</b> extracellular <b>substance</b> that was soluble in alkaline medium, somewhat heat stable, and steam distillable from an acid medium. The inhibitor was produced by Chlamydomonas and libcratcd upon the death of the cells. It is suggcstcd that the inhibitor is probably a long-chain fatty acid or mixture of such acids. Eight long-chain, unbranchcd, saturated, and unsaturated fatty acids of known compo-sition were assayed against six algae. Palmitic was the most toxic saturated acid tested, linoleic the most toxic unsaturated. Haematococcus was the most sensitive alga tcstcd, Chlorellu and Scenedesmus the least scnsitivc. There was a relatively narrow range of con-centrations between those causing no inhibition and complctc inhibition in the case of Haematococcus. The {{results of the present study}} are compared with those from other investigations of algal antibiosis...|$|R
