5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E
5|$|Lynx, a cruel {{agent of}} the {{supercomputer}} FATE, is bent on finding Serge and using his body {{as part of a}} greater plan involving the Frozen Flame. Lynx travels with Harle, a mysterious, playful girl <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a harlequin. Harle was sent by the Dragon God to shadow Lynx and one day steal the Frozen Flame from Chronopolis, a task she painfully fulfills despite being smitten with Serge.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{notes that}} he had gotten high at an Alicia Keys concert. During Michael's anti-drug meeting, he misidentifies hookah as an illegal drug; Toby points {{out the fact that}} it is merely a pipe. Dwight {{notes that he}}'ll have to bring in his bō staff, a long staff weapon used in Okinawa and feudal Japan, to protect the office. Jim later notes that Dwight was <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a member of the disco group the Village People.|$|E

5000|$|When thematically appropriate, some superheroes <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> {{people from}} various professions or subcultures. Zatanna, who {{possesses}} wizard-like powers, <b>dresses</b> <b>like</b> a stage magician, and Ghost Rider, who rides a superpowered motorcycle, dresses in the leather garb of a biker.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Vision" [...] is {{the title}} of a short story by Jonathan Lethem from his {{collection}} Men and Cartoons, in which a character <b>dresses</b> <b>like</b> and claims to be the Vision as a child and then continues to <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> the Vision as an adult.|$|R
5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping {{a bucket of water}} on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} he adopted his famous style of dressing, {{consisting}} of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.|$|E
5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, {{the tower}} was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Justin Casquejo, {{who entered the}} site {{through a hole in}} a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower’s 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

She has a strong brother complex, wishing more than anything to be her brother's wife.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the wake}} of media {{attention}} to the phenomenon, many members of Congress began instituting stricter dress codes for staffers and interns. [...] "They should dress professional, and we demand that," [...] a spokesman for Florida Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart told Rothstein. [...] "They shouldn't <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> they're working a corner. You shouldn't be <b>dressing</b> <b>like</b> Paris Hilton." [...] A year later, Rothstein told the Washington Times the stricter attention to interns' dress was having the desired effect. [...] "I really think the interns are getting smarter because of these programs," [...] she said. [...] "They're coming from college. They don't have the thought process. They're learning they can't <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> that." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Mick Foley faced Ric Flair in a 2-Out-of-3 Falls Match. Foley gained the {{advantage}} after he executed a Double Underhook DDT. Foley {{then began to}} taunt Flair and took out Mr. Socko, a dirty sock puppet, <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> Flair. Foley controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the Figure-Four Leglock, but Flair countered with an inside cradle over Foley to win the first fall. Frustrated, Foley grabbed a trash can from under the ring {{and brought it to}} the ring to hit Flair with it. But, Flair avoided the attacked, as he tripped Foley to apply the Figure-Four Leglock. At the end, Foley got disqualified when he hit Flair with the trash can. The referee awarded Flair the win. After the match, Foley attacked Flair with a barb-wired bat, leaving Flair busted open.|$|E
5|$|James, {{under her}} real name, debuted in WWE on the October 10, 2005 episode of Raw as a face, under the gimmick of WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus' biggest fan. The angle had the two Divas {{competing}} together in tag team matches, with James' character becoming increasingly obsessed with Stratus. The storyline included a Halloween costume contest, in which James was <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> Stratus and helped Stratus retain the Women's Championship in a Fulfill Your Fantasy battle royal at Taboo Tuesday by eliminating herself and Victoria {{at the same}} time. James even began utilizing Stratus' signature finishing moves as her own during matches. James later became the number one contender for the WWE Women's Championship on December 12, by defeating Victoria in a match to determine who would face Stratus at New Year's Revolution. Subsequently, the storyline between James and Stratus developed into a lesbian angle, after James kissed Stratus under a sprig of mistletoe. In the championship match at the pay-per-view, James lost to Stratus.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm tells Adrienne about {{a ritual}} that can {{eradicate}} the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides {{to leave with}} Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, a huge and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne {{walking out of the}} mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having been disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and <b>dressed</b> <b>like</b> a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E
