5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} {{how he was}} motivated to work on music inspired by To the Stars, commenting that he {{was inspired by a}} scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), and The Mad <b>Hatter</b> (1978). The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>hatters</b> {{seemed to}} regard the shakes as an {{inevitable}} {{price to pay for}} their work rather than a readily preventable disease, their employers professed ignorance of the problem. In a 1901 survey of 11 employers of over a thousand <b>hatters</b> in Newark and Orange, the head of the Bureau of Statistics of New Jersey, William Stainsby, found a lack of awareness of any disease peculiar to <b>hatters</b> apart from tuberculosis and rheumatism (though one employer remarked that [...] "work at the trade develops an inordinate craving for strong drink").|$|R

On May 31, 2013, James Bobin began talks to direct the sequel under the working title Alice in Wonderland: Into the Looking Glass.

Several other cast-members from the 2010 film also reprised their roles in the sequel. On November 22, 2013, it was announced that the sequel will be released on May 27, 2016 and that Bobin would direct the film. Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen are featured in the film. On January 21, 2014, the film was again retitled to Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass. The title was later reworked once again to Alice Through the Looking Glass.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} marking {{their debut}} in the series include the manipulative warden of Arkham City, Hugo Strange (Corey Burton), Two-Face (also voiced by Baker), and the Penguin (Nolan North).

5|$|The Joker forces Batman {{into a game}} of {{hide and}} seek, giving him one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries are sent to hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard {{in the head and}} then threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad <b>Hatter,</b> the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. Clutching the statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs back inside and impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from the spear in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad <b>Hatter</b> hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5|$|In the asylum, Batman {{is faced}} with several supervillains; he must defend himself from an enraged Bane (Fred Tatasciore), subdue {{indiscriminate}} serial killer Victor Zsasz (Danny Jacobs), confront the monstrous Killer Croc (Steven Blum), defeat the plant-controlling Poison Ivy (Tasia Valenza), and battle his way through hallucinogen-induced nightmares created by the Scarecrow (Dino Andrade). The Riddler (Wally Wingert) does not physically appear in the game, but communicates with Batman and challenges him to solve riddles placed around the island. Other characters appearing in the game include the asylum's warden Quincy Sharp (also voiced by Kane), Batman's parents Thomas and Martha Wayne (voiced by Conroy and Valenza respectively), and asylum guard Aaron Cash (Duane R Shepard, Sr). The shape-shifting Clayface appears in cameo, taking on the guise of other characters {{as he tries to}} trick the player into releasing him. The Mad <b>Hatter</b> was almost included in the game, but the developers removed him. The body of Ra's al Ghul is in the asylum's morgue and the Ventriloquists dummy, Scarface, appears several times in the story. Several other charactersincluding the Penguin, Jack Ryder, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, Catwoman, and the asylum's founder Amadeus Arkhamare referenced in the game, but do not appear in it.|$|E
