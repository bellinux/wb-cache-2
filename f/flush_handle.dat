40|$|AbstractIn the {{aftermath}} of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST 22 hospital outbreak, we investigated the prevalence of long-term carriage, the efficacy of MRSA decolonization treatment (DT) and the spread of MRSA to households of patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of repeated DT in long-term MRSA carriers. Of 250 index persons (58 HCWs and 192 patients), 102 persons (19 HCWs and 83 patients) and 67 household members agreed to participate. Samples from all 169 persons were taken from the nose, throat, wounds and devices/catheters, and urine samples were additionally taken from index persons. Samples from companion animals (n = 35) were taken from the nostrils and anus. Environmental sites (n = 490) screened were telephone, television remote control, toilet <b>flush</b> <b>handle,</b> favourite chair and skirting board beside the bed. Sixteen (19 %) patients and two household members, but no HCWs, were ST 22 -positive. The throat was the most frequent site of colonization. In a multivariate analysis, chronic disease (p < 0. 001) and pharyngeal carriage (p < 0. 001) were associated with long-term MRSA carriage. MRSA was found in the environments of four long-term carriers. All animals tested were negative. MRSA-positive households were decolonized using nasal mupirocin TID and daily chlorhexidine body and hair wash for 5 days. Pharyngeal MRSA carriers also received fucidic acid (500 mg TID) combined with rifampicin (600 mg BID) or clindamycin (600 mg BID) for 7 days. The home environment was cleaned on days 2 and 5. At the end of follow-up, ten of 16 long-term carriers and the two household contacts were MRSA-negative. In conclusion, decolonization of MRSA carriers is possible, but should include treatment of household members and the environment...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{overview}} of week long making workshop sessions and account of the learning environment as a student led entity in this rural landscape. LT Ranch Project Space {{is located in a}} remote rural area in NE Lithuania. Several events have occurred in recent years, most recently; Summer School 2011. 10 students (from 5 countries) contributed from: UALChelsea MA ISD and UCA-CSA BA. Since 2005, this Space and its infrequent inhabitation has begun to shape the landscape, localness and mischief through inventions of making and stuttering discourse. The clients are students, artists, friends, myself (translator and contextualizer). Duration: between 5 - 7 days. This is a self-sustained environment and collaborative place. Well water, a barn-hotel/house, cooking prep: indoors/cooking on the fire at the dining area, WC without a <b>flush</b> <b>handle.</b> There is phone reception but no internet, a lake fifteen minutes walk away in case the well runs dry or the Soviet electrical infrastructure of the hamlet fails. Problem solving within the everyday rural condition plays a part of the tacit learning. Participants become quickly aware of the fragility of these relationships. Those who choose to travel there are the primary creators of various projects, encouraging the imaginary, testing ideas, filling in a 'lack' (playground, swing, robots etc), dining area. Dialogues occur in several languages, gestures and dialects. The validity of ideas, individual experiences brought to the Space are profoundly relevant and encourages peer-based learning. These ideas evolve {{by the end of the}} first day, providing a taxonomy of materials and processes the project requires, assessment, improvisation, budgeting and sourcing, implementation, siting, celebration (not always in that order). The dissemination of these events is within an on-line archive of images, films, texts, storytelling. Each years plans evolve from the year before, conversations from the meanwhile and feedback from participants. This case study will attempt a dialogue of why this Project Space may be successful through failure and the meanwhile of creating place...|$|E

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Agricultural economics. "December 2011 "Fresh water is a renewable, but finite, and increasingly scarce resource. Strategies to reduce water consumption are becoming ever more important in order to minimize future water shortages. One such approach is to focus upon the publicly supplied sector of water use, which includes households and also large-scale commercial and industrial enterprises such as schools, hospitals, airports, and private firms. If such enterprises were to implement water-saving appliances and fixtures on a large scale, substantial water savings could be realized. One such water-saving appliance is the dual-flush toilet, which uses a high-volume flush for solid waste and a lower-volume flush for liquid waste. This thesis uses the principles of behavioral economics, which studies human behavior and decision-making, in order to determine whether the design of the dual flush mechanism can lead the user to make the incorrect 'choice' and thus waste water. A field experiment performed in the public restrooms of a municipal building in Columbia, Missouri definitively showed {{that in the case of}} one particular model of dual flush toilet, the Sloan Uppercut®, water usage was considerably higher than the manufacturer's projections. This was due to the fact that the default option, pushing the <b>flush</b> <b>handle</b> down, resulted in a large flush. While Sloan predicted a 2 : 1 urination-to-defecation (U/D) flush ratio, the observed ratio during the control period was roughly 1 : 4. The treatment period consisted of adding multiple signs to each stall that instructed users on how to use the toilets correctly; however, even with signs added, the U/D ratio only increased to 2 : 5. The implications of this research are that if water savings are to be fully maximized, the 'real-world' actions of users must be taken into account. These results are of particular relevance in areas where water is especially scarce and/or costly...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether copper incorporated into hospital ward furnishings and equipment can reduce their surface microbial load. Design. A crossover study. Setting. Acute care medical ward with 19 beds {{at a large}} university hospital. Methods. Fourteen types of frequent-touch items made of copper alloy were installed in various locations on an acute care medical ward. These included door handles and push plates, toilet seats and <b>flush</b> <b>handles,</b> grab rails, light switches and pull cord toggles, sockets, overbed tables, dressing trolleys, commodes, taps, and sink fittings. Their surfaces and those of equivalent standard items on the same ward were sampled once weekly for 24 weeks. The copper and standard items were switched over after 12 weeks of sampling to reduce bias in usage patterns. The total aerobic microbial counts {{and the presence of}} indicator microorganisms were determined. Results. Eight of the 14 copper item types had microbial counts on their surfaces that were significantly lower than counts on standard materials. The other 6 copper item types had reduced microbial numbers on their surfaces, compared with microbial counts on standard items, but the reduction did not reach statistical significance. Indicator microorganisms were recovered from both types of surfaces; however, significantly fewer copper surfaces were contaminated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and coliforms, compared with standard surfaces. Conclusions. Copper alloys (greater than or equal to 58 % copper), when incorporated into various hospital furnishings and fittings, reduce the surface microorganisms. The use of copper in combination with optimal infection-prevention strategies may therefore further reduce the risk that patients will acquire infection in healthcare environments...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{hospital}} environment {{plays a role}} in the cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The aim of {{this study}} was to identify potential carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) reservoirs that might be responsible for a NDM- 1 outbreak at a hospital in Portugal. Methods: An environmental investigation was instituted in a Portuguese hospital, after the occurrence of NDM- 1 -producing Providencia stuartii in five patients characterized by whole-genome sequencing. CPE screening was performed in critical infection sites of internal medicine wards and intensive care units where the patients stayed during hospitalization, by using MacConkey agar supplemented with ertapenem. Air samples were also obtained for the same locations. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method according to EUCAST guidelines. PCR and sequencing were applied to detect and identify carbapenemase-encoding genes. PCR-based replicon typing was used to characterize the plasmids. The genetic relationship between CPE was evaluated by PFGE. Results: Sixty-three Gram-negative isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providentia stuartii and Pseudomonas spp.) were obtained from the 91 surface samples collected. A total of 17 NDM- 1 -producers were found: 9 K. pneumoniae and 8 P. stuartii in <b>flush</b> <b>handles,</b> bathroom door handles, dinamap monitors and/or hygiene cars from internal medicine wards. No CPE were obtained from air samples. The five NDM- 1 -producing P. stuartii clinical strains obtained during the outbreak were all genetically indistinguishable from those collected in the hospital environment. Regarding NDM- 1 -producing K. pneumoniae, no clinical cases were described. However, PFGE analysis identified two clusters, one of them indistinguishable, consisting of 7 NDM- 1 -K. pneumoniae producers and 7 K. pneumoniae non-CPE. PCR-based replicon typing revealed the presence of the same plasmid type among NDM- 1 -producers, suggesting horizontal transfer within the hospital surfaces. Conclusion: These results showed the importance of the hospital environment as a potential reservoir and source of CPE. This study also emphasizes the need of early environmental screening to interrupt the transmission of CPE. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5000|$|The Torino was {{developed}} by IKA as an Argentine hybrid of AMC's 1964-'65 Rambler American and Classic with exclusively designed front and rear body panels, bumpers and interior. The central body section is from the Classic, and the engine and trunk compartments are derived from the American. Rooflines came from the American as well, and some later Torino sedans featured the attractive [...] "C" [...] pillar {{that was used in}} 1968-69 U.S. American sedans. The rear coil suspension was borrowed from the Classic, albeit with a four link setup rather than a torque tube. One unique feature is the Torino's front unibody [...] "frame rails" [...] borrowed from the Classic convertible (also used in the 1965-'66 Marlin). They are longer than the American, extending all the way back under the car {{to the front of the}} rear rails. This made for a stiffer chassis, better adapting the car to the rougher road conditions of Argentina at the time. The Torino rode on a slightly longer wheelbase (than the American) by one inch - 2723 mm (107-inch). Although the engines were not obtained from American Motors, the vehicle's basic AMC platform continued throughout its lifetime. As upgrades were incorporated over the years, such as AMC's <b>flush</b> door <b>handles,</b> the Torino became mostly a product of Argentina with few imported parts.|$|R
50|$|Older toilets {{infrequently}} have service ducts {{and often}} in old toilets {{that have been}} modernized, the toilet cistern is hidden in a tiled over purpose-built 'box'. Often old toilets still have high-level cisterns in the service ducts. On the outside, the toilet is <b>flushed</b> by a <b>handle</b> (just like an ordinary low-level cistern toilet) although behind the wall this handle activates a chain. Sometimes a long flushing trough is used to ensure the cistern can be refilled quickly after dual flushes. This trend of hiding cisterns and fittings behind the walls started in the late 1930s in the United States and in the United Kingdom from the 1950s, and by the late 1960s it was unusual for toilet cisterns to be visible in public toilets. In some buildings such as schools, however, a cistern can still be visible, although high-level cisterns had become outdated by the 1970s. Many schools now have low-level cisterns.|$|R
2500|$|For 1972, the Torino was {{redesigned}} using many characteristics {{carried over}} from the previous generation. The 1972 Torino styling emphasized the [...] "long hood short deck" [...] look and had strong elements of coke bottle styling. [...] The Torino line was also revised to {{be made up of}} basic models called [...] "Torino" [...] and more upscale models called [...] "Gran Torinos." [...] The most radical change was a large eggcrate grille in an oval opening on Gran Torinos. Tom McCahill, stated [...] "the gaping grille looks a little like it was patterned after Namu, the killer whale", but also stated that the Torino had [...] "kind of pleasing, no-nonsense styling." [...] Gran Torinos had chrome bezels surrounding the headlamps {{on each side of the}} large oval grille. [...] Base Torinos had a full width argent eggcrate grille that surrounded the headlights. Base Torinos also used a unique hood and front bumper differentiating it from the Gran Torino models. The Torino's front fenders were flared around the wheel opening and the rear quarter panel had strong character line extending to the rear bumper. The windshield had a more rakish 60-degree angle, while the A-pillars and roof were thinner. Even with this changes, structural integrity remained the same as 1971 models. The rear featured a full width bumper that incorporated thin rectangular tail lights into each bumper end. [...] All Torinos had [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation as standard equipment resulting in vent windows vanishing from four-door and station wagon models. [...] The Torino incorporated new safety features for 1972, including new <b>flush</b> mount door <b>handles</b> and side door guard rails.|$|R

For Lancia Zagato went from a buyer of chassis to an official supplier of specially bodied finished cars.First shown to the public at the 1958 Turin Motor Show, the first GTEs were delivered in early 1959.GTE bodywork was more low slung and streamlined than its predecessors'. The car had a continuous waistline, without the previous humps over the rear wheels; the nose was longer, and the under elongated Plexiglas covers the headlights were set deeply into the wings. At the rear the tail lights were partially sunken in and crowned by protrusions in the bodywork.The GTE went through numerous updates.In the Spring 1959 chassis upgraded to third series specifications were phased in. From the autumn newly enacted Italian traffic laws prohibited headlights cover. GTEs for Italy and some export countries had open headlights, and modified bodywork setting them further forward. During 1960 the improved 60 PS engine was adopted. When the Appia Sport was introduced it did not supersede the GTE, but rather some of its features were carried over, such as new headlights and protruding in place of <b>flush</b> pushbutton door <b>handles.</b> The last GTEs were built on a specific 812.03 chassis; the very last example was completed in April 1962.It is estimated that total GTE production amounts to 167 with the earlier 53 PS engine, and 134 with the later 60 PS one.|$|R
