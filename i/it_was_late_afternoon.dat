500|$|Unable to find Bonaparte, Nelson {{turned back}} across the Mediterranean, {{eventually}} reaching Sicily on 19 July. While Nelson was returning westwards, Bonaparte reached Alexandria and stormed the city, capturing the coast and marching his army inland. His fleet, entrusted to Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers, was anchored {{in a line of}} battle in Aboukir Bay. On 1 August, Nelson, who had returned to the Egyptian coast after reports gathered at Coron revealed the French invasion, arrived off Aboukir Bay. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> and the British fleet had no accurate charts of the bay, Nelson ordered an immediate attack on the French [...] Brueys was unprepared, and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as the British split into two divisions and sailed down either side of the French line, capturing all five ships of the vanguard and engaging his 120-gun flagship Orient in the centre. At 21:00, Orient caught fire and exploded, killing most of the crew and ending the main combat. Sporadic fighting continued for the next two days, until all of the French ships had been captured, destroyed or fled. At the Battle of the Nile, eleven French ships of the line and two frigates were eliminated, trapping Bonaparte in Egypt and changing {{the balance of power in}} the Mediterranean.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> at Fort Henry. The ruddy sun {{had already}} sunk behind the wooded hill, {{and the long}} shadows of the trees {{lengthened}} on the green square {{in front of the}} fort.|$|E
5000|$|The play {{is set in}} fog-bound London in 1880 at {{the upper}} middle class home of Jack Manningham and his wife Bella. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> a time which Hamilton notes as being the time [...] "before the feeble dawn of gaslight and tea".|$|R
50|$|Tityrus praises Timetas' {{song and}} {{suggests}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{good enough for the}} capital city. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> now <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and time to take the flocks to the river.|$|R
6000|$|Good-bye to you all. I suppose <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{with you}} and all across the seas. What shall I find over there? I dare not wonder.--Ever yours, ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when he awoke. Slowly {{the fact}} of life came back to him. He glanced about the room. Joe had evidently stolen away after he had dozed off. That was {{considerate}} of Joe, he thought. Then {{he closed his eyes}} and slept again.|$|E
60|$|From Axminster to Combe Regis {{the line}} runs through country as {{attractive}} as any {{that can be}} found in the island, and the train, as if in appreciation of this fact, does not hurry over the journey. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> by the time we reached our destination.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after he}} started his harvest, Beatrice {{returned}} from Toronto. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when she drew near Allenwood. She was tired with the long journey, {{but she did not}} object when Lance made a round which would take them past Harding's farm. He said the longer trail was smoother.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> and, with a sidelong {{glance at}} the setting sun, Magus makes one final decree: they are not to leave the glade. <b>Its</b> {{boundary}} <b>is</b> clearly marked by boulders. Before dematerialising, He slyly remarks the Moon's light should have all the romantic qualities it did on old Earth. Koenig leads his people toward the Eagle, which promptly vanishes. Maya realises <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the victim of atomic dispersal—the ship is still there, but non-cohesive (like powder dissolved in liquid). Verdeschi asks the big question: is Magus really God? While powerful, His motivations seem less than divine...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> {{before the}} galley was seen returning, rowing slowly and heavily.|$|R
60|$|Walter fell almost instantaneously off to sleep, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> {{before he}} woke.|$|R
60|$|The woods {{had become}} quite silent. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> {{and they had}} {{gradually}} wandered {{farther and farther away}} from pretty sylvan Suresness, towards great, anarchic, deathdealing Paris. In this part of the woods the birds had left their homes; the trees, shorn of their lower branches looked like gaunt spectres, raising melancholy heads towards the relentless, silent sky.|$|E
60|$|Moreover, he {{was longer}} at the journey {{than he had}} anticipated. The moment he turned his face homeward, a desire to hurry, an anxiety, a dread {{fastened}} upon him. A presentiment of evil gathered. But, encumbered as he was with heavy traps, he could not travel swiftly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when he topped the last ridge between him and home.|$|E
60|$|Martin Eden {{did not go}} out to {{hunt for}} a job in the morning. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> before he came out of his {{delirium}} and gazed with aching eyes about the room. Mary, one of the tribe of Silva, eight years old, keeping watch, raised a screech at sight of his returning consciousness. Maria hurried into the room from the kitchen. She put her work-calloused hand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> when {{he arrived}} home, and told his sister what he had witnessed.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> the {{following}} <b>afternoon</b> when Soames {{stood in the}} dining-room window gazing gloomily into the Square.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> before John woke. He started up, as {{his eyes}} fell upon Captain Davenant.|$|R
60|$|When {{they came}} to Dermott's house <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and Lough Gara lay down below them, blue, mirror-like, and deserted; and though they had seen, when at a distance, dark figures moving about the door, the house {{appeared}} not less deserted than the Lough. The door stood half open, and Costello knocked upon it again and again, so {{that a number of}} lake gulls flew up out of the grass and circled screaming over his head, but there was no answer.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The sun {{already had}} set; {{but it still}} was too light for lamps. Bridge led the way toward a certain eating-place of which he knew where a man might dine well and from a clean platter for two bits. Billy had been keeping his eyes open for detectives. They had passed no uniformed police--that would be the crucial test, thought he--unless Bridge {{intended}} tipping off headquarters on the quiet and having the pinch made at night after Billy had gone to bed.|$|E
60|$|Blair {{raised his}} crutch {{to knock the}} man down. But Lane intercepted it, and got his friend out of the station. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> with the sun going down over the hill across the {{railroad}} yards. Blair stood a moment bare-headed, with the light on his handsome haggard face. How frail he seemed--too frail of body for the magnificent spirit so flashing in his eyes, so scathing on his bitter lips. Lane bade him good-bye and turned away, with a strange intimation {{that this was the}} last time he would ever see Blair alive.|$|E
60|$|SCENE: A Parlor-Car on the New York Central Railroad. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> in {{the early}} autumn, with a cloudy sunset {{threatening}} rain. The car is unoccupied save by a gentleman, who sits fronting one of the windows, with his feet in another chair; a newspaper lies across his lap; his hat is drawn down over his eyes, and he is apparently asleep. The rear door of the car opens, and the conductor enters with a young lady, heavily veiled, the porter coming after with her wraps and travelling-bags. The lady's air is of mingled anxiety and desperation, with a certain fierceness of movement. She casts a careless glance over the empty chairs.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> when {{he finally}} arrived {{within sight of the}} encampment; but there were no signs of Jim.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> {{when they}} awoke, roused {{by the sound}} of laughter, and of the chatter of many voices.|$|R
60|$|There {{was only}} one way in which such disobedience could end. I saw it plainly enough one afternoon, when, had I been one of the fierce prowlers of the wilderness, the little fellow's history would have stopped short under the paw of Upweekis, the shadowy lynx of the burned lands. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when I came over a ridge, {{following}} a deer path {{on my way to the}} lake, and looked down into a long narrow valley filled with berry bushes, and with a few fire-blasted trees standing here and there to point out the perfect loneliness and desolation of the place.|$|E
60|$|On the day {{following}} {{that when she}} had summoned Eddo to speak with her, Nya sat {{at the mouth of}} the cave. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and already the shadows gathered so quickly that save for her white hair, her little childlike shape, withered now almost to a skeleton, was scarcely visible against the black rock. Walking to and fro in her aimless fashion, as she would do for hours at a time, Rachel accompanied by Noie passed and repassed her, till at length the old woman lifted her head and listened to something which was quite inaudible to their ears. Then she beckoned to Noie, who led Rachel to her.|$|E
60|$|As she promised, so she performed, {{and on the}} Sunday packed off her {{household}} to {{the fair}} that was being held at Abingdon that day, using insistence with the reluctant, and particularly {{with one of her}} women, a Mrs. Oddingsell, who expressed herself strongly against leaving her ladyship alone in that lonely house. At length, however, the last of them was got off, and my lady was left impatiently to await her secret visitor. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when he arrived, accompanied by Nunweek, whom he left to hold the horses under the chestnuts in the avenue. Himself he reached the house across the garden, where the blighting hand of autumn was already at work.|$|E

5000|$|The 22:00 [...] to Manchester Piccadilly {{operated}} by Virgin Trains is internal to the Midland region, so {{it uses the}} Manchester letter H for its destination. As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> service, the two digits {{on the end of}} the headcode <b>are</b> higher. <b>Its</b> headcode <b>is</b> 1H77.|$|R
60|$|The {{park was}} empty. No one was there. By the {{position}} of the sun he could tell <b>it</b> <b>was</b> either early morning or <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> The smell of the flowers and grass, the dampness of the leaves, indicated morning. <b>It</b> had <b>been</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> when the tornado had picked him up. And the sky had been overcast and cloudy.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> after {{discovering}} {{the girl in}} the lazarette, when Jerry again came on deck. Scarcely had Skipper, who had carried him up the steep ladder, dropped him on deck than Jerry made a new discovery--land. He did not see it, but he smelled it. His nose went {{up in the air and}} quested to windward along the wind that brought the message, and he read the air with his nose as a man might read a newspaper--the salt smells of the seashore and of the dank muck of mangrove swamps at low tide, the spicy fragrances of tropic vegetation, and the faint, most faint, acrid tingle of smoke from smudgy fires.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{before one}} of the beasts, irritated by the gnawing of appetite, made a quick, {{growling}} dash at the ape-man. The noise awoke Bukawai. He sat up quickly and watched what went on within the crater. He saw the hungry hyena charge the man, leaping for the unprotected throat. He saw Tarzan reach out and seize the growling animal, and {{then he saw the}} second beast spring for the devil-god's shoulder. There was a mighty heave of the great, smooth-skinned body. Rounded muscles shot into great, tensed piles beneath the brown hide--the ape-man surged forward with all his weight and all his great strength--the bonds parted, and the three were rolling upon the floor of the crater snarling, snapping, and rending.|$|E
60|$|Just {{below me}} a bowlder lifted {{its head and}} {{shoulders}} out of the swirling current. With the canoe line I might easily let myself down to that rock and make sure of my next fish. Getting back would be harder; but salmon are worth some trouble; so I left my rod and started back to camp for the stout rope that lay coiled in the bow of my canoe. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> and I was hurrying along the path, giving chief heed to my feet in the ticklish walking, with the cliff above and the river below, when a loud Hoowuff! brought me up with a shock. There at a turn in the path, not ten yards ahead, stood a huge bear, calling unmistakable halt, and blocking me in as completely as if the mountain had toppled over before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} something," [...] said Fearenside, mysteriously. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon,</b> {{and they were}} in the little beer-shop of Iping Hanger.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{one o'clock}} in the day when Madame Vaillant embarked, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> before Philip {{returned}} to Monsieur Bertram's house.|$|R
