2500|$|... "The {{first place}} <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> foot upon in New England was the Isle of Shoals, being {{islands in the}} sea about two leagues from the main," [...] Levett wrote later. [...] "Upon these islands I neither could see one good timber-tree nor so much good ground as to make a garden. The place {{is found to be}} a good fishing-place for six ships, but more can not be well there, for want of {{convenient}} stage room, as this year's experience hath proved." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to a {{tour with}} Sing it Loud and Take Cover (during September and October 2008), the band {{announced}} their upcoming, sophomore EP So Young, So Insane in September 2008. [...] You, Me, and Everyone We Know {{stated that it}} will be released November 18, 2008, and that the band will work with Joshua Cain of Motion City Soundtrack and Jordan Schmidt to record the album. [...] The band also announced a nationwide tour with Karate High School and <b>I</b> <b>Set</b> <b>My</b> Friends On Fire during November and December 2008. [...] Before the tour started, Liebsch announced that O'Rourke and Sherrill left the band before recording So Young, So Insane.|$|E
2500|$|BBC chief Charlie Smith told The Sun on 11 October 2011 that David Haye had {{informed}} {{him that he would}} not be renewing his boxing licence, thus retiring from the sport. Haye has had a long-standing plan to retire early. After the Harrison fight Haye said his plans to retire before he is 31 had not altered: [...] "I will have achieved what I wanted to achieve – undisputed cruiserweight champion, unify the heavyweight division and then call it a day." [...] In December 2010, during the negotiations to fight Wladimir Klitschko, Haye said if the fight did not happen, [...] "I'll just have to accept that becoming the WBA champion was enough and move on with my life. That'll be 20 years of getting punched in the face, which is a long enough time. <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> goals and achieved them so unifying the titles is the cherry on the cake but if it doesn't happen it wasn't meant to be and I've just got to get on with my life".|$|E
2500|$|But I, though I saw {{and heard}} these things, refused {{to write for}} a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the {{diversity}} of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [...] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!' ...|$|E

2500|$|Many anecdotes of Diogenes {{refer to}} his dog-like behavior, and his praise of a dog's virtues. It {{is not known}} whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet [...] "doggish" [...] and made a virtue of it, or whether he first took up the dog theme himself. When asked why he was called a dog he replied, [...] "I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> teeth in rascals." [...] Diogenes {{believed}} human beings live artificially and hypocritically and {{would do well to}} study the dog. Besides performing natural body functions in public with ease, a dog will eat anything, and make no fuss about where to sleep. Dogs live in the present without anxiety, and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy. In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe. Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Diogenes stated that [...] "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dench {{returned}} to the West End in mid-2009, playing Madame de Montreuil in Yukio Mishima's play Madame de Sade, directed by Michael Grandage {{as part of the}} Donmar season at Wyndham's Theatre. The same year, she appeared in Sally Potter's experimental film Rage, a project that featured 14 actors playing fictional figures in and around the fashion world, giving monologues before a plain backdrop. Attracted {{to the fact that it}} was unlike anything she had done before, Dench welcomed the opportunity to work with Potter. [...] "I like to do something that's not expected, or predictable. I had to learn to smoke a joint, and <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> trousers alight," [...] she said about filming. Her next film was Rob Marshall's musical film Nine, based on Arthur Kopit's book for the 1982 musical of the same name, itself suggested by Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical film 8½. Also starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penélope Cruz, and Sophia Loren, she played Lilli La Fleur, an eccentric but motherly French costume designer, who performs the song [...] "Folies Bergères" [...] in the film. Despite mixed to negative reviews, Nine was nominated for four Academy Awards, and awarded both the Satellite Award for Best Film and Best Cast.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{record of the}} name appears in an August 10, 1622, land charter to Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason, English Royal Navy veterans, who were granted a large tract in present-day Maine that Mason and Gorges [...] "intend to name the Province of Maine". Mason had served with the Royal Navy in the Orkney Islands where the chief island is called Mainland, a {{possible}} name derivation for these English sailors. In 1623, the English naval captain Christopher Levett, exploring the New England coast, wrote: [...] "The first place <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> foote upon in New England was the Isle of Shoals, being Ilands [...] in the sea, above two Leagues from the Mayne." [...] Initially, several tracts {{along the coast of}} New England were referred to as Main or Maine (cf. the Spanish Main). A reconfirmed and enhanced April 3, 1639, charter from England's King Charles I gave Sir Ferdinando Gorges increased powers over his new province and stated that it [...] "shall forever hereafter, be called and named the PROVINCE OR COUNTIE OF MAINE, and not by any other name or names whatsoever..." [...] Maine is the only state whose name has exactly one syllable.|$|E

6000|$|That {{evening at}} the hour of 23 <b>I</b> <b>set</b> up <b>my</b> aerial isochronophone[3] and {{reported}} to his gracious Majesty the Ahkoond as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> do <b>set</b> <b>my</b> bow in the cloud, and {{it shall}} be for a token of a {{covenant}} {{between me and the}} earth.--GENESIS ix. 13.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> teeth. I {{could see}} that the Archduchess was {{watching}} us.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> teeth hard. I {{longed for}} Ray, {{but there were}} no signs of him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> {{teeth and}} turned slowly round. I even took the cup from the tray without {{spilling}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am honoured {{with your}} confidence, Prince, but I still {{fail to see}} how these matters concern me," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>setting</b> <b>my</b> teeth hard.|$|R

6000|$|... "To {{the value}} which <b>I</b> <b>set</b> upon <b>my</b> life you must add my very human jealousy. From such a {{combination}} {{what can you}} hope for?" ...|$|R
60|$|ASHER. Certainly. But {{one thing}} <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> face against {{as a matter}} of principle, I won't {{recognize}} the unions.|$|E
60|$|To {{this will}} and testiment <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> hand and seal on this 20th day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> teeth {{hard and}} looked {{steadily}} {{down at the}} tablecloth. I felt rather than saw that her regard was compassionate.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{information}} I want. At bottom it's sympathy. <b>I</b> had <b>set</b> <b>my</b> {{heart on}} that marriage; the idea did what so few things do--it satisfied the imagination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I love you, Ayala. <b>I</b> have <b>set</b> <b>my</b> heart upon it. You don't {{know how}} well I love you. I have quite {{made up my mind}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say that. I don't {{know that}} I've ever treated anybody {{particularly}} well. But <b>I</b> never <b>set</b> <b>my</b> wits {{to work to}} take my revenge on a woman." ...|$|R
60|$|MARLOW. You wait a bit, {{and see if}} it don't turn up. Suspicion's no {{business}} of ours. <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> mind against it.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned to}} her. <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> hand lightly upon her arm; I let my gaze {{encounter}} the upward glance of her eyes--blue as forget-me-nots.|$|E
60|$|And here <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>my</b> face towards home, For all my pilgrimage is done, Although, methinks, yon blood-red sun Marshals {{the way to}} Holy Rome.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{world has}} narrowed to these dimensions, Arthur,' she rep lied, glancing round the room. 'It is {{well for me}} that <b>I</b> never <b>set</b> <b>my</b> heart upon its hollow vanities.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what I like next best, {{is for a}} poor fellow to {{run away}} with a rich girl. <b>I</b> have <b>set</b> <b>my</b> heart on Rawdon running away with some one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How you say that! Don't {{you know}} <b>I</b> had <b>set</b> <b>my</b> heart on it?" [...] Madame Merle {{asked with a}} great deal of spirit, but still with the {{intonation}} of good-humour.|$|R
