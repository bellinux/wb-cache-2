40|$|Carbon {{is present}} in various forms in the Earth s upper mantle (carbonate- or diamond-bearing mantle xenoliths, {{carbonatite}} magmas, CO 2 emissions from volcanoes [...] .). Moreover, there is enough carbon in chondritic material to stabilize carbonates into the mantles of Mars or Venus {{as well as in}} the Earth. However, the interactions with iron have to be constrained, because Fe is commonly thought to buffer oxygen fugacity into planetary mantles. [1] and [2] show evidences of the stability of clinopyroxene Ca(Mg,Fe) Si 2 O 6 + magnesite (Mg,Fe) CO 3 in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> around 6 GPa (about 180 km). The stability of oxidized forms of carbon (like magnesite) depends on the oxygen fugacity of the system. In the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle,</b> the maximum carbon content is 10000 ppm [3]. The fO 2 parameter varies vertically as a function of pressure, but also laterally because of geodynamic processes like subduction. Thus, carbonates, graphite, diamond, C-rich gases and melts are all stable forms of carbon in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle.</b> [4] show that the fO 2 variations observed in SNC meteorites can be explained by polybaric graphite-CO-CO 2 equilibria in the Martian mantle. [5] inferred from thermodynamic calculations that the stable form of carbon in the source regions of the Martian basalts should be graphite (and/or diamond). After [6], a metasomatizing agent like a CO 2 -rich melt may infiltrate the mantle source of nakhlites. However, according to [7] and [8], the FeO wt% value in the Martian bulk mantle is more than twice that of the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> (KLB- 1 composition by [9]).

The type of flow which is most likely to be involved concerns convection currents. For the past 4 decades, models of mantle convection have made remarkable advancements. Although a large body of evidence regarding the seafloor depth, heat flow, lithospheric strength and forces of slab-pull and swell-push has been obtained, the global seismotectonic stresses in the Earth are yet to be determined.

In the Earth, carbonaceous peridotites and eclogites compositions have been experimentally studied at mantle conditions [1] [2] [3]. [4] showed that the fO 2 variations observed in martian meteorites can be explained by polybaric graphite-CO-CO 2 equilibria in the Martian mantle. Based on thermodynamic calculations [4] and [5] inferred that the stable form of carbon in the source regions of the Martian basalts should be graphite (and/or diamond), and equilibrium with melts would be a source of CO 2 for the martian atmosphere. Considering the high content of iron in the Martian mantle (approx. 18. 0 wt% FeO; [6]), compared to <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> (8. 0 wt% FeO; [7]) Fe/C redox interactions should be studied in more detail...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Generally chondritic {{relative}} abundances {{and high}} absolute abundances {{of the highly}} siderophile elements (HSE: Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au) in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> upper <b>mantle</b> provide strong evidence that these elements {{were added to the}} Earth following the last major interaction between its metallic core and silicate fraction. So called "late accretion" may have added materials comprising as much as 0. 8 % of the total mass of the Earth and possibly a similar proportion of mass to the Moon. We have begun to study the chemical nature of late accreted materials to the Earth - Moon system by examining the HSE contained in lunar impact-melt rocks. The HSE contained in melt rocks were largely added to the Moon during the period of time from the origin of the lunar highlands crust (4. 4 - 4. 5 Ga) {{to the end of the}} late bombardment period (ca. 3. 9 Ga). These materials provide the only direct chemical link to the late accretionary period. The chemical fingerprints of the HSE in late accreted materials may enable us to ascertain under what conditions and where in the solar system the late accreted materials formed. The Os- 187 /Os- 188 ratios (reflecting long-term Re/Os), coupled with ratios of other HSE, can be diagnostic for identifying the nature of the impactor. A critical issue, however, will be deconvolving the exogenous from indigenous components...|$|R

Since measurements of seismic travel-time and shear wave splitting are a key {{means by which the}} structure of the upper mantle can be imaged, {{it is important to understand}} the factors that contribute to variability in elastic properties. Seismic anisotropy associated with lattice preferred orientations of minerals in peridotite is the focus of this study. One way to better understand anisotropy in a convecting upper mantle is to simulate texture evolution based on certain assumptions. Simulations of the development of olivine and orthopyroxene alignment along streamlines of a mantle flow field illustrate how continuously varying strain conditions affect the resulting orientation distribution. There are various uncertainties in rock texture simulations, and the aim here is to investigate how much model assumptions may influence the results. A model of upper mantle flow in the vicinity of an oceanic spreading center is used to illustrate these points. First, we assess how sensitive results are on assumptions of different polycrystal plasticity models, specifically lower bounds and viscoplastic self-consisten...|$|E
40|$|The cubic monosulfide {{series with}} the general formula (Mg,Mn,Ca,Fe) S are common phases in the {{enstatite}} chondrite (EH) and aubrite meteorite groups. In the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle,</b> sulfide minerals are associated with peridotites and eclogites. Study of these sulfide mineral systems is of interest for the mineralogy and petrology of planetary mantles. For example, MgS could occur in the primitive Earth and because it remains a low density phase compared to metal, would stay a separate phase during the core formation process, and thus not segregate to the core. (Mg,Ca,Mn,Fe) S sulphides might thus be important phases even in planetary differentiation processes. The importance of such minerals, and their formation, composition and textural relationships for understanding the genesis of enstatite chondrites and aubrites, has long been recognized. The main objective of this experimental study is to understand the formation and evolution of (Mg,Ca,Mn,Fe) S sulphides, particularly the oldhamite CaS and ningerite MgS, with pressure, temperature but also with redox conditions because EH and aubrites are meteorites that formed under reduced conditions. Piston-cylinder (PC) and multi-anvil (MA) experiments at high pressure (HP) and high temperature (HT) have been performed in order to simulate the evolution of these phases in a small planetary body from a planetesimal (with PC experiments) up to a proto-planet (with MA experiments) ...|$|E
40|$|The highly siderophile {{elements}} (HSE: including Re, Au, Ir, Os, Ru, Pt, Pd, Rh) {{are strongly}} partitioned into metal relative to silicates. In the terrestrial planets these elements {{are concentrated in}} metallic cores. <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> has sufficiently high abundances of the HSE (~ 0. 008 times CI abundances) {{that it has been}} hypothesized approximately 0. 1 - 0. 5 % of the mass of the Earth was added following the last major interaction between the core and mantle [e. g. 1]. The additional material added to the Earth and Moon has been termed a late veneer, and the process has often been termed late accretion [2]. The timing of the dominant late accretionary period of the Earth and Moon is still poorly known. The abundances of HSE in the lunar mantle could provide important constraints on when the late veneer was added. The material that ultimately became the silicate portion of the Moon was likely stripped of most of its HSE prior to and during coalescence of the Moon. Consequently the initial lunar mantle likely had very low concentrations of the HSE. Unlike Earth, the generation of permanent lunar crust by ~ 4. 4 Ga prevented subsequent additions of HSE to the lunar mantle via continued accretion. Thus, if {{a substantial portion of the}} late veneer was added after 4. 4 Ga, the lunar mantle should have retained very low HSE concentrations. Conversely, if the late veneer was mostly added prior to 4. 4 Ga, HSE abundances in the lunar mantle may be roughly similar to abundances in the terrestrial mantle...|$|E

40|$|Basalts {{from the}} Earth, the Moon, Mars, and Vesta are {{strongly}} depleted in elements that prefer {{to reside in}} the metallic state (siderophile elements). Therefore, {{it is believed that}} all these bodies have metallic cores. We do not yet have siderophile element analyses of venusian or mercurian basalts, but we assume that Venus, too, as a terrestrial planet, has a metallic core. For the Earth, Moon, Mercury, and Mars, the moments-of-inertia of these bodies are consistent with metallic cores of various sizes. Because Venus rotates so slowly, {{it may be difficult to}} determine the moment-of-inertia of Venus in order to confirm this assumption. However, despite many possible complexities, it seems likely that most of the major and minor terrestrial planets have experienced some sort of metal/silicate equilibration, and we will use this as a boundary condition. One immediate contrast between the Earth and Moon is the difference in FeO content between lunar and terrestrial basalts. Both bodies presumably formed near 1 AU and formed from the same feeding zone of planetesimals, judging by their oxygen isotopes [13]. If, for example, the Moon formed from the Earth by a giant impact, then this event must have occurred before high-pressure equilibria had the opportunity to deplete the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> in FeO. Alternatively, the bulk silicate Moon may be dominated by material from the impactor. Regardless, it would be useful to know the pressures where FeO incorporation into a metallic core is not of interest. If the Giant Impact hypothesis is correct, this should set an upper limit for the size of the proto-Earth at the time of the impact...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} several hypotheses {{on the origin}} of volatile siderophile elements in the Earth. One hypothesis is that they were added during Earth s accretion and core formation and mobilized into the metallic core [1], others claim multiple stage origin [2], while some hypothesize that volatiles were added after the core already formed [3]. Several volatile siderophile elements are depleted in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> relative to the chondrites, something which continues to puzzle many scientists. This depletion is likely due to a combination of volatility and core formation. The Earth s core is composed of Fe and some lighter constituents, although the abundances of these lighter elements are unknown [4]. Si is one of these potential light elements [5] although few studies have analyzed the effect of Si on metal-silicate partitioning, in particular the volatile elements. As, In, Ge, and Sb are trace volatile siderophile elements which are depleted in the mantle but have yet to be extensively studied. The metal-silicate partition coefficients of these elements will be measured to determine the effect of Si. Partition coefficients depend on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and metal and silicate composition and can constrain the concentrations of volatile, siderophile elements found in the mantle. Reported here are the results from 13 experiments examining the partitioning of As, In, Ge, and Sb between metallic and silicate liquid. These experiments will examine the effect of temperature, and metal-composition (i. e., Si content) on these elements in or-der to gain a greater understanding of the core-mantle separation which occurred during the Earth s early stages. The data can then be applied to the origin of volatile elements in the Earth...|$|E

The Pb isotopic composition is extremely nonradiogenic {{compared with those}} of typical Apollo mare basalts. The Pb-Pb, U-Pb, and Th-Pb ages are concordant at 3. 94 Ga. The U-Pb data from maskelynitized plagioclase does not plot on the internal isochrons defined by other mineral separates, indicating that it was disturbed by a later shock event(s). The U-Th-Pb systematics of Asuka- 31,combined with previous results, suggest a scenario for the early Pb isotope evolution of the Moon. According to the currently popular hypothesis for lunar origin, following a collision between the Earth and another large planetesimal, the Moon was formed mainly from the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> and partially from the other impactor. The primary ^ U/^ Pb (μ) value of the Moon had been increased four to five times that of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> value (∿ 8) by volatilization of Pb during the impact. Further depletion of Pb within the Moon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mantle</b> is believed to have occurred during lunar core formation. The chalcophile behavior of Pb and large partition coefficient of Pb in silicate minerals compared to those of U and Th helped to decrease μ values of early cumulates that formed from the magma ocean and settled in the deep lunar mantle.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{controls}} of temperature, pressure, and silicate melt composition on S solubility in silicate liquids. The solubility of S in FeO-containing silicate melts in equilibrium with metal sulfide increases significantly with increasing temperature but decreases with increasing pressure. The silicate melt structure also exercises a control on S solubility. Increasing the degree of polymerization of the silicate melt structure lowers the S solubility in the silicate liquid. The new set of experimental data is used to expand the model of Mavrogenes and O'Neill(1999) for S solubility in silicate liquids by incorporating {{the influence of the}} silicate melt structure. The expected S solubility in the ascending magma is calculated using the expanded model. Because the negative pressure dependence of S solubility is more influential than the positive temperature dependence, decompression and adiabatic ascent of a formerly S-saturated silicate magma will lead to S undersaturation. A primitive magma that is S-saturated in its source region will, therefore, become S-undersaturated as it ascends to shallower depth. In order to precipitate magmatic sulfides, the magma must first cool and undergo fractional crystallization to reach S saturation. The S content in a metallic liquid that is in equilibrium with a magma ocean that contains approx. 200 ppm <b>S</b> (i. e., <b>Earth's</b> bulk <b>mantle</b> <b>S</b> content) ranges from 5. 5 to 12 wt% S. This range of S values encompasses the amount of S (9 to 12 wt%) that would be present in the outer core if S is the light element.

40|$|A {{stunning}} red sunset or purple sunrise is {{an aesthetic}} treat with a scientific explanation: The colors are {{a direct result}} of the absorption or reflectance of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols, minute particles (either solid or liquid) in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere that occur both naturally and because of human activity. At the beginning or end of the day, the Sun s rays travel farther through the atmosphere to reach an observer s eyes and more green and yellow light is scattered, making the Sun appear red. Sunset and sunrise are especially colorful when the concentration of atmospheric particles is high. This ability of aerosols to absorb and reflect sunlight is not just pretty; it also determines the amount of radiation and heat that reaches the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface, and can profoundly affect climate. In the atmosphere, aerosols are also important as nuclei for the condensation of water droplets and ice crystals. Clouds with fewer aerosols cannot form as many water droplets (called cloud particles), and consequently, do not scatter light well. In this case, more sunlight reaches the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface. When aerosol levels in clouds are high, however, more nucleation points can form small liquid water droplets. These smaller cloud particles can reflect up to 90 percent of visible radiation to space, keeping the heat from ever reaching <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface. The tendency for these particles to absorb or reflect the Sun s energy - called extinction by astronomers - depends on a number of factors, including chemical composition and the humidity and temperature in the surrounding air; because cloud particles are so small, they are affected quickly by minute changes in the atmosphere. Because of this sensitivity, atmospheric scientists study cloud particles to anticipate patterns and shifts in climate. Until recently, NASA s study of atmospheric aerosols and cloud particles has been focused primarily on satellite images, which, while granting large-scale atmospheric analysis, limited scientists ability to acquire detailed information about individual particles. Now, experiments with specialized equipment can be flown on standard jets, making it possible for researchers to monitor and more accurately anticipate changes in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere and weather patterns...|$|R

The extracted data are compared for consistency, and are used with radiation flux data to interpret the ability of the different techniques to infer cloud properties which are important to longwave radiative transfer under broken cloud conditions. 1...|$|R
40|$|Space systems {{interacting}} with the space plasma environment charge to potentials of a few tens of volts positive in interplanetary space or on the lunar surface in daylight, a few hundred volts negative in the dark lunar plasma wake and in some regions of the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> radiation belts, and to multiple kilovolt negative potentials for worst case conditions in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> magnetosphere near geostationary orbit. Good design practices are required to assure that space systems operate successfully in these environments without detrimental effects due to transient currents and insulator failure produced by electrostatic discharges. Cold lunar environments in particular are challenging because detrimental effects of charging are often exacerbated by cold, highly resistive dielectrics which can integrate charge {{for long periods of}} time. We will describe the cold plasma and energetic particle environments relevant to lunar missions responsible for surface and bulk charging of space systems and discuss program requirements under development for assuring that systems operate successfully in these environments...|$|R
40|$|Relativistic {{electrons}} in the Earth's radiation belts are a widely recognized threat to spacecraft because they penetrate lightly shielded vehicle hulls and deep into insulating materials where they accumulate to sufficient levels to produce electrostatic discharges. Strategies {{for evaluating the}} magnitude of the relativistic electron flux environment and its potential for producing ESD events are varied. Simple "rule of thumb" estimates such as the widely used 10 (exp 10) e-/sq cm fluence within 10 hour threshold for the onset of pulsing in dielectric materials provide a quick estimate of when to expect charging issues. More sophisticated strategies based on models of the trapped electron flux within the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> magnetic field provide time dependent estimates of electron flux along spacecraft orbits and orbit integrate electron flux. Finally, measurements of electron flux can be used to demonstrate mean and extreme relativistic electron environments. This presentation will evaluate strategies used to specify energetic electron flux and fluence environments along spacecraft trajectories in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> radiation belts...|$|R
