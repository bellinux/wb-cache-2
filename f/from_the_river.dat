5|$|A {{high-profile}} {{success for}} the company came in the 1960s, again in Egypt. The rising waters of the River Nile (a result {{of the construction of}} the Aswan High Dam) threatened the ancient Abu Simbel temple complex. The entire site was dismantled and reassembled 200 m further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and 65 m higher, at a cost of around US$36 million.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00, the Germans {{began their}} most {{successful}} {{assault on the}} perimeter, attacking the southeastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks. This assault pushed through the defenders' outer lines and threatened to isolate {{the bulk of the}} division <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Strong counterattacks from the mixed defenders and concentrated shellfire from south of the river eventually repelled the Germans.|$|E

5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a trickle. Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E

Pokegama Lake, located 17.5 mi <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river's</b> mouth, gets its name <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ojibwa bakegamaa, meaning [...] "a side-lake (of another body of water)".

5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> at high tide, and also via a reservoir of Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E
