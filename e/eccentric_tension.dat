40|$|In the article, {{the author}} has proven that {{manufacturing}} and installation errors, as well as contact deformations of high strength bolts, if analyzed as part of tensile connections of steel structures, work in <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension.</b> In pursuance of the effective state standards, the analysis of these bolts {{is based on the}} axial tension. The author has analyzed the failure of a steel structure, caused by the fracture of eccentrically loaded bolts made of steel grade XC 42 (France), or C 40 (Germany), that later followed the delayed fracturing pattern. The author provides the findings of the lab tests, whereby the above bolts were tested in the presence of an angle washer. The author has also analyzed the findings of low-temperature tests of bolts in tension. The author demonstrates that the strength of high strength bolts is driven by the material, the structure shape, and the thermal treatment pattern. <b>Eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> tests of bolts have proven that cracks emerge in the areas of maximal concentration of stresses (holes in shafts, etc.) that coincide with the areas where fibers are in tension; cracks tend to follow the delayed fracturing pattern, and their development is accompanied by the deformation-induced metal heating in the fracture area. Therefore, the analysis of high strength bolts shall concentrate on the <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> with account for contact-induced loads, while the tendency to delayed fracturing may be adjusted through the employment of both metallurgical and process techniques...|$|E
40|$|Concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) {{members have}} been used in various kinds of {{construction}} projects. They can be subjected to tension when they are used as chord members in trusses or subjected to combined tension and bending in building columns. However, to date research on the behavior of CFST members under <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> is still limited. This paper thus presents both experimental and numerical investigations on the eccentrically loaded CFST tensile members. The experimental parameters include the eccentricity of the load and the steel ratio of the cross section. The failure modes show that the in-filled concrete works effectively with the steel tube, and the outer tube improves the crack pattern of the concrete. The finite-element (FE) model is also developed and validated by experimental results. The validated FE model is then used to assess the load and moment distributions as well as the load-moment interaction relationship. Finally, the load-carrying capacities of CFST members under <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> are discussed. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

50|$|In <b>eccentric</b> contraction, the <b>tension</b> {{generated}} {{is insufficient}} to overcome the external load on the muscle and the muscle fibers lengthen as they contract. Rather than working to pull a joint {{in the direction of}} the muscle contraction, the muscle acts to decelerate the joint at the end of a movement or otherwise control the repositioning of a load. This can occur involuntarily (e.g., when attempting to move a weight too heavy for the muscle to lift) or voluntarily (e.g., when the muscle is 'smoothing out' a movement). Over the short-term, strength training involving both eccentric and concentric contractions appear to increase muscular strength more than training with concentric contractions alone. However, exercise-induced muscle damage is also greater during lengthening contractions.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design the 2016 {{combustion}} car drivetrain for Global Formula Racing (GFR). The goal of this project was to improve upon the 2015 drivetrain design by reducing complexity, weight, and maintenance time. To reduce complexity the spool was changed to a one piece system and the drivetrain inserts were changed to a simpler design. These changes were able to reduce weight and the complexity of machining by making the designs more simple. The drivetrain mounting system had its complexity reduced by moving to a <b>eccentric</b> chain <b>tensioning</b> design. This was chosen because it reduced the time to adjust the chain and reduced the overall part count of the system. The major issues that occurred during this project {{had to do with}} the manufacturing of the drivetrain mounts. Since there were issues finding sponsors to make the mounts they had to be made in house. This required learning edgecam and the cnc machining process to be able to manufacture them. The machining of the mounts took a tremendous amount of time and this made it difficult for their to be enough time during the manufacturing phase to make two complete sets. The result of this project is a finished and functioning drivetrain for the 2016 combustion car. The car has been through numerous test days and the drivetrain has worked exactly as expected. So far there have been no issues with the performance or maintenance of the system. Next year the designer of the drivetrain should focus on further improvement of the spool design and reducing the manufacturing time of the whole system. Furthermore, a heavy emphasis should be put on finding sponsors with large machining capabilities to help manufacture the drivetrain system...|$|R
30|$|Mechanical bending {{treatment}} {{was employed to}} cause tension wood formation in the stem of the fast-growing yellow poplar. The tension wood induced by mechanical bending had many characteristic features of <b>tension</b> wood, i.e., <b>eccentric</b> growth toward <b>tension</b> wood, increased frequency of fiber cell types, vessels with reduced size, and reduced lignin content in the developed xylem. The significant reduction of the guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units of lignin in the tension wood was clearly visualized in samples that had been subjected to bending for 7 and 14 days when analyzed by lignin histochemical analysis using phloroglucinol-HCl. The syringyl (S) unit in the tension wood lignin was also significantly decreased in the developed xylem of the 14 -day bending treatment sample, as indicated by Mäule’s staining. Expression analysis of several representative genes in the lignin biosynthetic pathway clearly demonstrated that the overall phenylpropanoid pathway toward biosynthesis for both the lignin monomers and the flavonoids was greatly downregulated on bending treatment. In addition, the genes encoding laccases, which {{have been reported to}} be involved in the polymerization of monolignols to produce lignin macromolecules, were significantly downregulated in the tension wood. Despite the very limited sequence information for the genes/enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway in yellow poplar, histochemical staining and expression analysis using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) successfully demonstrated the anatomical and chemical characteristics associated with mechanical bending-induced tension wood formation in the yellow poplar.|$|R

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that muscle {{repetitive}} stress injuries (RSIs) are often related to sport trainings among young participants. As such, understanding the mechanism of RSIs is essential for injury prevention. One potential means would be to identify muscles in risk by applying biomechanical modeling. By capturing 3 D movements of four typical youth sports and building the biomechanical models, the current study has identified several risk factors related to the development of RSIs. The causal factors for RSIs are the muscle over-lengthening, the impact-like (speedy increase) <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> in muscles, imbalance between agonists and antagonists, muscle loading frequency and muscle strength. In general, a large range of motion of joints would lead to over-lengthening of certain small muscles; Limb’s acceleration during power generation could cause imbalance between agonists and antagonists; a quick deceleration of limbs during follow-throughs would induce an impact-like <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> to muscles; and even at low speed, frequent muscle over-lengthening would cause a micro-trauma accumulation which could result in RSIs in long term. Based on the results, the following measures can be applied {{to reduce the risk of}} RSIs during learning/training in youth participants: (1) stretching training of muscles at risk in order to increase lengthening ability; (2) dynamic warming-up for minimizing possible imbalance between agonists and antagonists; (3) limiting practice times of the frequency and duration of movements requiring strength and/or large range of motion to reducing micro-trauma accumulation; and (4) allowing enough repair time for recovery from micro-traumas induced by training (individual training time). Collectively, the results show that biomechanical modeling is a practical tool for predicting injury risk and provides an effective way to establish an optimization strategy to counteract the factors leading to muscle repetitive stress injuries during motor skill learning and training.|$|E

The analysis was done by means of PhotoStress ® method using reflection polariscope and digital video camera. On the notched sample subject to loads by <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> we determined the differences of principal normal stresses in specified point at loads 3 kN, 4. 5 kN, 6 kN, 9 kN and 12 kN.

40|$|This is {{a report}} of {{experiments}} on ankle extensor muscles of human subjects and a parallel series on the medial gastrocnemius of the anaesthetised cat, investigating {{the origin of the}} rise in passive tension after a period of eccentric exercise. Subjects exercised their triceps surae of one leg eccentrically by walking backwards on an inclined, forward-moving treadmill. Concentric exercise required walking forwards on a backwards-moving treadmill. For all subjects the other leg acted as a control. Immediately after both eccentric and concentric exercise there was a significant drop in peak active torque, but only after eccentric exercise was this accompanied by a shift in optimum angle for torque generation and a rise in passive torque. In the eccentrically exercised group some swelling and soreness developed but not until 24 h post-exercise. In the animal experiments the contracting muscle was stretched by 6 mm at 50 mm s− 1 over a length range symmetrical about the optimum length for tension generation. Measurements of passive tension were made before and after the eccentric contractions, using small stretches to a range of muscle lengths, or with large stretches covering the full physiological range. After 150 <b>eccentric</b> contractions, passive <b>tension</b> was significantly elevated over most of the range of lengths. Measurements of work absorption during stretch-release cycles showed significant increases after the contractions. It is suggested that the rise in passive tension in both human and animal muscles after eccentric contractions is the result of development of injury contractures in damaged muscle fibres...|$|R

40|$|Steel fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC) {{is more often}} considered as a profitable re-placement of diffused reinforcement, like welded steel mesh, especially for thin cross section. In this case, fire becomes a crucial condition for design. An experi-mental investigation {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate the benefits in fire resis-tance of steel fibre when structural elements are bent (di Prisco et al. 2003). First of all, four point bending tests were carried out on notched 600 mm long beams with a 150 x 150 mm cross section and a notch/depth ratio equal to 0. 3. Once car-ried out the bending tests, two cylinder specimens were cored from each beam: one was tested in uniaxial compression while the other, once notched, was tested in direct tension. The average uniaxial tension and compression test results are first used as con-stitutive relationships to reproduce the bending tests, neglecting notch effects. A brief description of the experimental set-up used in direct tension is instru-mental to present and discuss the <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> imposed in the specimens by an active control designed to keep the press platens fixed. The measured bending moment was adopted to quantify the heterogeneity degree of SFRC specimens, be-fore and after cracking...|$|E
40|$|The {{bond between}} {{concrete}} and steel is of fundamental importance to deformation characteristics of concrete structures. The phenomenon of force transfer from a steel bar to a surrounding concrete {{has been extensively}} studied from early seventies[1, 2]. Many parameters, such as concrete cover [3], bar spacing, deformation pattern of a bar, bond length, concrete strength and quality, type of loading and so on [4, 6] were taking into account during those investigations. There {{are a lot of}} experimental results, but most of them were obtained from test of very short bond length and relatively large covers. What else, they were mostly from uniaxial tension specimen. Analytical models, connected with those experiments, assume that the local bond stress Wb depends only on the relative local slip ' and is independent of a distance from loading end or from cracked cross section[5]. Experimental investigations were performed on <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> reinforced concrete members of a lengths of more than 50 bar diameter. Such a length allows to arise of several primary cracks and some internal ones. The specimen shape allowed to use electric strain gauges and elastooptical surfaces to observe strain changes along a steel bar. The results proved that uniaxial tension test is not suitable to establish a bond phenomenon of members under bending. Typical relationships between a bond stress and a slip is also not valid.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of two {{different}} strength training methods, (concentric and eccentric) on strength, retention and bilateral transfer. Subjects were 22 male volunteers, aged 16 to 17. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and to exercise the left or right elbow flexor - extensors. Following a preliminary training and safety period the subjects were pre-tested on the four dependent variables static flexion, static extension, dynamic flexion and dynamic extension at multiple angles of 90, 105, 120, and 135 degrees. The groups alternated each week training Monday, Wednesday and Friday while the other group trained Tuesday and Thursday. Both groups performed 3 x 6 RM at a velocity of 7. 2 revolutions per minute. The instrumentation designed by the investigator was used for training and testing. The non-trained arm remained in a standardized position during training and testing. Subjects were assessed for strength at the beginning of a 6 week training program, at the conclusion of training and after a 4 week retention period. Data were analyzed with a four-way split plot ANOVA, t-tests and percentage changes. The statistical index was represented by the higher score of two trials. An alpha level of. 05 was accepted for all statistical procedures. Results showed: (a) strength training methods (concentric and eccentric) improved static and dynamic strength, (b) a significant difference was demonstrated amon^ test angles, (c) specificity between static and dynamic testing procedures was present on a percentage basis, (d) there was a wide range of response among subjects to the exercise regimen, (e) <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> was greater than concentric or isometric tension, (f) neither strength training method was superior to the Other, (g) following 4 weeks of detraining neither training procedure resulted in a significant loss of strength, (h) neither training procedure resulted in a significant transfer of strength and (i) the trained arm was superior to the non-trained arm on the 4 test items...|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} arm {{deceleration}} is {{to slow down}} the throwing arm comfortably, safely to dissipate the excess kinetic energy that has not been transferred to the ball. As such, the remaining kinetic energy would be a dominant cause for an injury (Pappas et al. 1985; Park et al. 2002). The results of current study have indicated that the quick deceleration (6216 °/s ±  218 °/s) occurs during an interval of less than 100  ms following the ball release and produces impact-like (speedy increase), <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension</b> on the latisssimus dorsi (Fig.  3). Even at low intensity, the repetitive impact-like loading has been proved to contribute arm-muscle RSIs among musicians (Shan and Visentin 2003); therefore, this type of loading should be dangerous for pitchers, too. Additional to the impact-like, eccentric loading, the muscle also undergoes its over-lengthening in this phase (130.5  ±  7.1  % of its rest length), 10  % over the critical value of RSIs (Faulkner et al. 1993; Fritz and Stauber 1988; McCully and Faulkner 1985; Stauber et al. 1988). All the conditions—impact-like, high-intensity and eccentric over-lengthening—could work together to amplify the injury risk. Such a load is further intensified among professional players as their deceleration approached up to 7000 °/s (Braun et al. 2009; Feltner and Dapena 1986; Pappas et al. 1985), comparing to 6216 °/s in current study. Collectively, the results suggest that, after ball release, the pectoralis major loses its mechanical advantage; thus, of the two main muscles, the latissimus dorsi is more active than the pectoralis major during the deceleration phase; and the deceleration is mainly achieved by the impact-like, powerful eccentric over-lengthening of the latissimus dorsi, resulting in a highly dangerous loading pattern. In short, the over-lengthened and forceful impact-like eccentric muscle loading should be the cause of latissimus dorsi injury. The injury mechanism would imply that involving stretching/flexibility practice and eccentric loading exercise into regular training programs {{plays an important role in}} the prevention of such an injury. Stretching/flexibility practice would increase muscle lengthening ability and eccentric loading exercise could strengthen muscles against a forceful impact-like eccentric loading.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a project studying the stress analysis of screwed tubular joints using photoelastic and finite element techniques. The aim of the work was to optimise the thread form to be used in large diameter, thin walled, tubular screwed joints which may be used as connections in the tethers of Tension-Leg Platforms. Frozen-stress, photoelastic techniques were used to measure the distributions of thread load and peak fillet stresses around the thread spirals of models with different thread shapes and loaded with different loading modes of axial tension, preload only, preload plus tension and <b>eccentric</b> <b>tension.</b> From detailed photoelastic measurements of the distribution of stress around individual thread fillets {{it was found that the}} fillet stress at any position in the thread spiral is the sum of those due to the stresses in the model wall plus those due to the shear force carried by the thread. Due to the time and cost involved in manufacturing and analysing a sufficient number of Araldite models to carry out a full analysis of the effect of thread parameters on fillet stresses it was decided to use axisymmetric, 8 noded, isoparametric, finite elements. Fillet stress distributions obtained using finite elements and 3 - dimensional photoelasticity were checked for agreement of results for threads of similar shapes before the range of shapes analysed was extended using finite elements. It was found that simple trigonometric functions in terms of the position around the thread fillet accurately described the fillet stress distribution. The effect of changing thread shape on the fillet stresses could also be described by using simple functions of the parameters concerned. Both the trigonometric and parametric functions were different for wall tension and shear force loading, but they could be combined to give the fillet stress distribution in a typical thread loaded with both shear force and wall tension. The accuracy of the equations developed was investigated by comparing the predicted distributions of position and magnitude of peak fillet stresses with those measured in the 3 - dimensional Araldite models. The pitch-average peak fillet stresses were generally within +/- 10 % of each other. Finally, the effect of altering thread parameters was investigated using the equations developed...|$|E
