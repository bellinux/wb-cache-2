2500|$|The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is an agreement, {{among the}} 28 Member {{states of the}} European Union, to {{facilitate}} and maintain {{the stability of the}} Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Based primarily on Articles 121 and 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it consists of fiscal monitoring of members by the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, and the issuing of a yearly recommendation for policy actions to ensure a full compliance with the SGP also in the medium-term. If a Member State breaches the SGP's outlined maximum limit for government deficit and debt, the surveillance and request for corrective action will intensify through the declaration of an <b>Excessive</b> <b>Deficit</b> Procedure (EDP); and if these corrective actions continue to remain absent after multiple warnings, the Member State can ultimately be issued economic sanctions. The pact was outlined by a resolution and two council regulations in July 1997. The first regulation [...] "on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies", known as the [...] "preventive arm", entered into force 1 July 1998.

[...] When the Council, on the basis of Eurostat data, decides that the deficit is excessive, it makes recommendations to the member state concerned and sets a deadline for bringing the deficit back below the reference value. The Council can grant extensions to this deadline if it is found that the country concerned has made good progress in implementing the initial recommendations but has not been able to fully correct its deficit because of an exceptional economic context.

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{government}} deficits and debt {{has been one}} of the most debated issues in recent years. However, very little has been contributed about their dynamics. Yet, the issue of entering into and exiting from <b>excessive</b> <b>deficits</b> will be critical in the European monetary union since the Stability and Growth Pact rules out deficits larger than 3 percent of GDP, except under strictly defined unusual conditions. This paper provides a transition data analysis of the dynamics of public deficits.

It also reveals how the concurrence of some minor changes may produce a major switchover in public finance outcomes.
