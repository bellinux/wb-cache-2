25|$|In the UK and Europe, {{the years}} 1987 to 1989 {{were marked by}} a {{large-scale}} revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 {{became known as the}} Second Summer of Love. Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could often hear songs from the original hippie era <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> out rooms at raves. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. In 1995, The Sekhmet Hypothesis attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, decided to leave the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developing psychedelic parties and music in the Indian island of Goa in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E
2500|$|Hirohito and {{all members}} of the {{imperial}} family implicated in the war such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Asaka, Prince Takeda and Prince Higashikuni were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of Bonner Fellers who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment. Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, [...] "with the full support of MacArthur's headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor" [...] and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime [...] "cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> of the Cold War, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister Nobusuke Kishi."

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the online optimal control strategies for multiple-chiller plants in large buildings with enhanced robustness and cost efficiency, including optimization of chilled water supply temperature set-point, chiller sequencing control, optimal start control and electrical demand limiting control. <b>The</b> <b>chilled</b> water supply temperature set-point optimization aims {{to minimize the}} total energy consumption of chillers and chilled water distribution pumps. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> sequencing control, three schemes are used to enhance its control robustness, including a data fusion scheme for improved reliability of building cooling load measurement, a simplified adaptive model of maximum chiller cooling capacity, and an online sensor fault detection and diagnosis(FDD). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> optimal start control, a model-based strategy is proposed for minimizing <b>the</b> energy consumption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning start period. The model-based optimal start control strategy considers both the recovery ability and the pre-cooling lead time as its optimizing variables. The peak demand limiting control strategy minimizes the monthly electricity bill by predicting a suitable monthly peak demand threshold and restraining the daily peak demand to the threshold. These control strategies are validated using the dynamic simulation of <b>the</b> central <b>chiller</b> plant <b>in</b> a high-rising building in Hong Kong. © All Rights Reserved...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{and light}} and {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) were used to follow time-dependent morphological changes and changes in water status of tulip bulbs (Tulipa gesneriana L., cv. ‘Apeldoorn’) during bulb storage for 12 weeks at 20 °C (non-chilled) or 4 °C (chilled) and after planting. MR images reflecting the water content, the relaxation times T 1 and T 2 (or their reciprocal values, the relaxation rates R 1 and R 2), and the apparent self-diffusion coefficient of water molecules (ADC), were obtained for intact bulbs. After planting, scape elongation and flowering occurred only in chilled bulbs, while elongation in non-chilled bulbs was retarded. Microscopic observations showed different structural components and high heterogeneity of the bulb tissues. MRI revealed the elongation of the flower bud during storage, which was significantly faster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> bulbs. <b>In</b> addition, MRI demonstrated a redistribution of water between different bulb organs, as well as significant differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pattern of this redistribution between <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> and non-chilled bulbs.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{substitution}} of air condensation by water condensation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> of a university building. This building has a surface of about 30, 000 m 2, {{is located in a}} city of the Spanish north coast, and refrigeration is needed for six months a year. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> novelty lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cooling system of the condensation water, since the typical cooling tower {{is not going to be}} considered; instead, the domestic cold water consumed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building would be used to cool <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> condensing water. As the domestic water consumption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building is neither constant nor coincident with the cooling requirements of <b>the</b> <b>chiller,</b> <b>the</b> use of the fire water tank as heat storage was proposed. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is cooled by <b>the</b> water contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire tank and this fire water is then cooled by the domestic water. With this solution, <b>the</b> reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> annual energy consumption of <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is around 18. 6...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} differential of chilled water {{is an important}} factor used for evaluating the performance of a chilled water system. A low delta-T may increase the pumping energy consumption and increase <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> energy consumption. <b>The</b> system studied <b>in</b> this thesis is <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> water system at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW Airport). This system has the problem of low delta-T under low cooling loads. When <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> water flow is much lower than the design conditions at low cooling loads, it may lead to the laminar flow of <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cooling coils. The main objective of this thesis is to explain the heat transfer performance of the cooling coils under low cooling loads. The water side and air side heat transfer coefficients at different water and air flow rates are calculated. The coefficients are used to analyze the heat transfer performance of the cooling coils at conditions ranging from very low loads to design conditions. The effectiveness-number of transfer units (NTU) method is utilized to analyze the cooling coil performance under different flow conditions, which also helps to obtain <b>the</b> cooling coil <b>chilled</b> water {{temperature differential}} under full load and partial load conditions. When the water flow rate drops to 1 ft/s, laminar flow occurs; this further decreases the heat transfer rate on the water side. However, the cooling coil effectiveness increases with the drop of water flow rate, which compensates for the influence of the heat transfer performance under laminar flow conditions. Consequently, <b>the</b> delta-T <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cooling coil decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transitional flow regime but increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laminar flow regime. Results of this thesis show that the laminar flow for <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> water at low flow rate is not the main cause of the low delta-T syndrome <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> water system. Possible causes for the piping strategy of the low delta-T syndrome existing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chilled</b> water system under low flow conditions are studied in this thesis: (1) use of two way control valves; and (2) improper tertiary pump piping strategy...|$|R

The aim of this work was to study the effect of cooling rate on distribution Of Mg 17 Al 12 compound and compositional inhomogeneity in an AZ 91 D magnesium sand-cast plate (200 x 140 x 20 mm(3)). A copper chill block, which was placed at the end of mold cavity, was used to increase the cooling rate during solidification. A sand-cast plate was also produced, where no chill block being mounted at the end of mold cavity. <b>The</b> "with <b>chill</b> block" plate showed a rapid increasing in cooling rate with respect to distance from riser, as compared to <b>the</b> "without <b>chill</b> block" plate where almost no cooling rate fluctuation occurred. The volume fraction of Mg 17 Al 12 (beta phase) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> "without <b>chill</b> block" plate was higher than that in "with <b>chill</b> block" plate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> "without <b>chill</b> block" plate, volume fraction of Mg 17 Al 12 was about 13. 9 vol% (near the riser) to about 19. 3 vol% (close to the end of the plate).
