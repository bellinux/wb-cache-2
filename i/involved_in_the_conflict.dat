5|$|France {{had been}} <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Chad for many years, and 2,000 {{men of the}} Force d'Intervention along with {{helicopters}} and Jaguars were deployed to defend central Chad in 1978, further forces arriving later as part of Opération Tacaud. The Jaguars were engaged in May and June 1978, contributing significantly in halting an offensive by Goukouni Oueddei's FROLINAT forces, who were routed. One aircraft was shot down, but the pilot was recovered by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in June 1950, control of Vice Admiral Arthur D. Struble's U.S. Seventh Fleet was transferred from Radford to Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy, who was serving as Commander, Naval Forces, Far East. Joy's superior was General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of the United Nations Command Korea (UNC). As such, Radford exercised no direct responsibility over forces <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the question, with the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was hoped {{he would be able to}} influence Becket.|$|E

5|$|In ecclesiastical affairs, Hugh {{attended}} the 1163 Council of Tours {{that was held}} by Pope Alexander III. In 1179 he {{attended the}} Lateran Council at Rome. It was {{while he was there}} that he became <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> between the king of Scots and the chapter of St Andrews over the election of the bishop of St Andrews. The king wanted his chaplain, another Hugh, and the chapter wanted John the Scot. The pope ordered Puiset to compel the king to obey, but in 1183 the controversy was solved by a compromise.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether recommendations could be made for colonial troops not serving with British troops was not asked in New Zealand, but in 1881, the question was asked in South Africa. Surgeon John McCrea, {{an officer of the}} South African forces was recommended for gallantry during hostilities which had not been approved by the British Government. He was awarded the Victoria Cross and the principle was established that gallant conduct could be rewarded independently of any political consideration of military operations. More recently, four Australian soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross in Vietnam although Britain was not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E
5|$|International {{reaction}} to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause in the UN, as was the Soviet Union and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The United Nations Security Council became directly <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> establishing a Good Offices Committee to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult. A ceasefire, called for by UNSC resolution 27, was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947. During the military action, on 9 December 1947 Dutch troops killed many civilians {{in the village of}} Rawagede (now Balongsari in Karawang, West Java).|$|E
50|$|Human {{rights groups}} are {{sometimes}} confused with humanitarian organizations and groups representing lobbies focused on specific issue lobbies, while most seek to distinguishing themselves from political movements <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts</b> {{that are often}} causes {{of the human rights}} abuses.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that direct {{involvement}} in workplace conflicts may {{have a significant impact on}} individual well-being. We used survey and interview data from a large nongovernmental organization (NGO) to analyze both the relationships between direct and indirect involvement in workplace conflicts and individual and organizational well-being. Results show that unaddressed conflicts and nonresponsive or conflict-involved managers are problematic because they fuel already existing conflicts, and also pave the way for new ones. If conflicts are not handled at an early enough stage, they seem to “paralyze” the organization and serve as an interlocking mechanism that contributes to hindering the necessary action from management. In our case, one-fifth of the employees were directly <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts,</b> and two-thirds felt that their local working environment had been influenced negatively by <b>the</b> <b>conflicts.</b> <b>The</b> prevalence of mental health problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NGO was almost twice as high as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general Norwegian population, and slightly more than one out of 10 reported reduced work ability. We conclude that individuals directly <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts</b> experience negative health consequences, and that this fact, in combination with organizational issues and a very high share of employees indirectly <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts,</b> affected <b>the</b> well-being of the whole organization...|$|R

5|$|The {{setting of}} the game {{takes place in the}} 24th century when {{humanity}} has discovered interstellar travel through the use of interstellar subspace jump nodes that function {{in the same manner as}} wormholes, allowing it to spread out across the stars and colonise new worlds. Prior to the game beginning, humanity (referred to as Terrans) formed the Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) as the central power of all of their systems' governments and military, and became engaged in a war over systems and resources against the Vasudans of the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire (PVE). By the time the story begins, this war has entered its fourteenth year, as a third species, dubbed Shivans, makes an unprovoked attack on the Terran system of Ross 128. The player, acting as a new Terran pilot in the GTA, is initially <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> with the PVE before the fights focus on the new species' arrival and subsequent assaults.|$|E
5|$|Various {{different}} {{mechanisms for}} commissioning {{the construction of}} war memorials emerged during the inter-war period. In most of the nations <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> the memorials erected in towns and cities were usually commissioned by local community leaders and other civic groups, with relatively little or no central state involvement. Some national organisations emerged, including the British War Memorials Committee and the Canadian War Memorials Fund, but these focused on narrow, limited projects, {{rather than trying to}} coordinate a national response. The local processes and committees could result in multiple memorials being created for the same community or event: the site of Verdun was commemorated by three different memorials, for example, while some British towns saw rival memorials created by competing groups in the community.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{memorials}} {{commemorate the}} events and the casualties of World War I. These war memorials include civic memorials, larger national monuments, war cemeteries, private memorials {{and a range of}} utilitarian designs such as halls and parks, dedicated to remembering those <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict.</b> Huge numbers of memorials were built in the 1920s and 1930s, with around 176,000 erected in France alone. This was a new social phenomenon and marked a major cultural shift in how nations commemorated conflicts. Interest in World War I and its memorials faded after World War II, and did not increase again until the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the renovation of many existing memorials and the opening of new sites. Visitor numbers at many memorials increased significantly, while major national and civic memorials continue to be used for annual ceremonies remembering the war.|$|E
50|$|Resentment at {{increasing}} British and other European involvement <b>in</b> Egypt since <b>the</b> opening of <b>the</b> Suez Canal <b>in</b> 1869 triggered an Egyptian army mutiny that threatened {{the authority of}} the British-backed Khedive of Egypt, Tewfik Pasha. The British military intervention was in response, to protect British interests. Once <b>in</b> Egypt, <b>the</b> British became <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sudan, which Egypt had occupied since the 1820's.|$|R

5|$|Following the 1936 {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of non-intervention in {{the conflict between the}} Spanish government and rebels led by General Franco. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in any way; this became the policy of the government {{for the duration of the}} civil war. The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. Martin Tranmæl, a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels. Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the International Brigades. On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.|$|E
