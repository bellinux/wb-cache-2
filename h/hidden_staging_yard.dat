40|$|ABSTRACT- A {{simulation}} {{model of a}} log transport logistics network was developed. The model could be structured to either share truck capacity {{among a group of}} loggers, or to assign a fixed number of trucks to individual loggers. Another variation of the model allowed the use of a <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> to set out loaded trailers and deliver them to destinations using dedicated shuttle trucks that operated continuously. Pooling trucks among loggers provided more flexibility in dealing with driver shift length constraints, and consequently delivered more wood to mills than did individual ownership. The magnitude of the difference was related to dispatch method. Accounting for logger status when dispatching trucks increased wood volume moved and reduced average trailer waiting times for all loggers. <b>Staging</b> <b>yards</b> were effective in maintainirig delivered volume of wood when severe delays were probable at destination mil!s...|$|R
5000|$|From 1604 on, {{there is}} no record of a {{performance}} of Sejanus His Fall until 1928, when it was put on by William Poel. According to the plays modern editor Philip Ayres, Poel [...] "cut the play by roughly a quarter" [...] to [...] "get away from the literary 1605 published version to the <b>hidden</b> <b>stage</b> play".|$|R
5000|$|A fiddle <b>yard</b> or <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> is a {{collection}} of model railway tracks that are hidden from view and allow trains to be stored and manipulated by the operators. These tracks are used to allow most model railways to be operated in a realistic manner. Whilst it is possible to have a realistic shunting yard in view, its operation is generally unreliable with models.|$|R

Partially completed vehicles were transported by truck from the Body Plant {{to either the}} North Line [...] "M" [...] or the South Line [...] "C" [...] for completion. Upon completion, cars were driven {{off the assembly line}} and under northbound Martin Luther King, Jr.Boulevard bridge. After final inspection, the cars were placed in <b>staging</b> <b>yards</b> to either be shipped by truck or by rail.|$|R

Stage 3 was moved to Stage 4. The Game Boy version of stage 3 also has a <b>hidden</b> <b>stage.</b> This version was also re-released in color as part of the Konami GB Collection Vol. 2.|$|R
50|$|There are twenty-five main {{stages in}} the game, with some {{variation}} possible in how the stages are played. There are also four <b>hidden</b> <b>stages</b> accessible through the main game with an additional stage as an easter egg. The game can be completed without finishing all the stages. There are thirteen different endings to the main game, depending on {{the conduct of the}} player {{during the course of the}} game.|$|R

In 1855, as alternative sources opened to steal market share, the canal reached its peak {{of more than one}} million tons of cargo. After that, coal mined in the Schuylkill Valley supplanted coal supplied by the Lehigh Canal.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{opening of the}} East and West Junction line, the layout at Fenny Compton placed the two {{railways}} side by side, with only a siding connection for exchange of goods wagons between the two. The SMJR line crossed over the GWR by a bridge further south. On 7 March 1960 however a new junction was installed at the station, providing a shorter route for iron ore trains from Banbury to South Wales than the former route by way of Leamington. A new <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> was provided at Honeybourne West Junction.|$|R
50|$|Free-mo can be {{utilized}} easily {{in either a}} club or a group. A club is a formal non-profit organization, while a group is simply a number of like-minded friends or acquaintances. Traditional modular layouts often require a club to own a complex centralized power supply system that includes DC throttles or DCC equipment, large <b>staging</b> <b>yards,</b> a set of four corners to form a closed loop, and a trailer to haul everything. Due to Free-mo's design, however, {{it is easy to}} have an informal group where individual members bring their own modules and Digitrax DCC equipment.|$|R
5000|$|A large {{sub-group}} of such yards {{are known}} as <b>Staging</b> <b>yards,</b> which are yards serving an end destination that is also a collection yard starting car groups for departure. These seemingly incompatible tasks are because the operating or road company and its locomotive drops off empties and picks up full cars waiting departure which have been spotted and assembled by local switch engines. The long haul carrier makes the round trip with a minimal turn around time, and the local switch engine transfers empties to the loading yard when the industries output {{is ready to be}} shipped.|$|R
5000|$|This {{activity}} is duplicated in a Transfer yard, the difference {{being in the}} latter many or several businesses and industries are serviced by the local switcher, {{which is part of}} the yard equipment, and the industry pays a cargo transfer fee to the railroad or yard operating company. In the <b>staging</b> <b>yard,</b> the locomotive is most likely operated by industry (refinery, chemical company or coal mine personnel); and ownership of the yard in both cases is a matter of business, and could be any imaginable combination. Ownership and operation are quite often a matter of leases and interests ...|$|R

The funding for the capital plan will be internally generated based on the Ports Authority’s ability to borrow (in the form of revenue bonds) {{as well as its}} operating revenues. Additionally, the State of South Carolina has committed approximately $700 million in funding for port-related infrastructure projects in the works. These projects include a new dual-rail served container <b>staging</b> <b>yard</b> in North Charleston, a port access road tying the Ports Authority’s new container terminal to I-26, as well as the state share of construction cost ($300 million) of the Charleston Harbor Deepening Project.|$|R
50|$|Super Ball IX {{took place}} at the Watkins Glen International in Watkins Glen, New York on July 1-3, 2011. It was the first concert to take place at Watkins Glen International since Summer Jam at Watkins Glen in 1973. Seven {{official}} sets were played throughout the weekend on the festival's main stage. In addition to the official sets, one additional set featuring ambient, avant-garde music similar to the IT Festival Tower Jam was performed. The set was played late Saturday evening from a partially <b>hidden</b> <b>stage</b> contained in a self-storage building that had been constructed as a piece of the festival's various art installations.|$|R
40|$|Successful {{development}} of a freezing treatment protocol for insect control requires reliable data on the temperature level at the supercooling point observed for the different stages of the targeted insect. The supercooling point was assessed through the monitoring of body temperature of Acanthoscelides obtectus post-embryonic instars. Then, the exposure time inducing complete mortality of individuals of each developmental stage was assessed at constant temperature levels of zero and – 10 °C in a freezing chamber. The feasibility to develop a control method from these results was investigated through experiments in a conventional freezing chamber with 5 -kg batches of French beans infested by a mixed-hidden-stages-population of A. obtectus. The supercooling point temperature of the different larval instars were observed {{in the range from}} (- 16. 1 ± 2. 9) °C to (- 21. 4 ± 2. 7) °C. The one of pupae was measured at (- 18. 1 ± 2. 4) °C and for adults before their emergence at (- 10. 6 ± 3. 3) °C. The complete kill of all <b>hidden</b> <b>stages</b> directly exposed at 0 °C and- 10 °C was observed at 32 d and 24 h exposure time, respectively. With the validation experiment on infested batches of French beans exposed in a freezing chamber to- 22 °C constant temperature, a complete mortality of all stages was achieved after a 50 -h exposure period. The practical conditions for a successful disinfestation of dry beans by temporary freezing after the harvest are discussed.

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} lock-on {{technology}} the game offered. Lucas Thomas of IGN {{said it was}} [...] "a great game on its own", but the lock-on feature completely revamped the overall experience. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer preferred Sonic & Knuckles to Sonic 3, stating {{that he could not}} fully appreciate its predecessor without its [...] "companion piece". Sega Powers review praised the game's harder difficulty in comparison to its predecessor and the new expansion of levels, admitting that the expansion {{would not have been possible}} had Sonic 3 been a single game. Sega Magazines review similarly praised the lock-on technology and the new innovation the unique cartridge offered, adding that Sonic & Knuckles <b>hidden</b> <b>stages</b> and bosses would strongly add to the replay value of the combined title.|$|R
50|$|In the past, traffic {{consisted}} of shipments of: resins, scrap materials, lumber, logs, fertilizer, steel, feed grade grains, and tallow. However, in December 2011, EOG Resources opened an online Sand Processing Plant. Sand now represent over 90% of the shipments, with the railroad hauling an estimated 160,000 tons of sand per month. This {{volume of traffic}} has required a total rebuilding {{of much of the}} trackage as well as construction of new interchange and car <b>staging</b> <b>yards.</b> This new booming mining business, while making the Wisconsin Northern quite profitable, has also killed the railroad's hopes of expanding its trackage rights. Progressive Rail had planned to contract with the state of Wisconsin to operate a 45-mile extension that would have connected the Wisconsin Northern with the Canadian National Railway mainline, however when the CN discovered the booming Wisconsin sand market, they backed out of the sale of the rail line they had attempted to previously abandon.|$|R
5000|$|From {{an early}} <b>stage</b> the <b>yard</b> {{was not used}} at capacity: by the late 1960s road {{competition}} was biting hard into the railways' goods traffic, {{and in particular the}} wagon-load freight that required hump-yards like Tinsley was already declining. The economic malaise and industrial decline of the 1970s exacerbated this. By the 1980s British Rail was closing its remaining wagon-load freight facilities as being uneconomic.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} in Image steganography. Information security is the important research field. Steganography process hides message into cover file and forms a stego file. In image steganography {{there is a need}} of method which will increase the security, reduce the distortion in the stego file and recovers the data without any loss. In the era of multimedia and internet there is need of reducing time for transmission. The proposed approach is combination of compression, data hiding technique and encryption. To make the transmission and storage of digital data faster, lossy compression is used. On the compressed image data hiding is done. The stego image is encrypted using AES to ensure user authentication. If the receiver has encryption key and data hiding key then only he can obtain the secret message. Nodes are selected randomly in data <b>hiding</b> <b>stage.</b> On the randomly selected nodes lossless LSB steganography is used...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} evolvability {{has been put}} forward to {{describe}} the “core mechanism ” of natural and artificial evolution. Recently, studies have revealed {{the influence of the}} environment upon a system’s evolvability. In this contribution, we study the evolvability of a system in various environmental situations. We consider neutrality and variability as two sides of evolvability. The former makes a system tolerant to mutations and provides a <b>hidden</b> <b>staging</b> ground for future phenotypic changes. The latter produces explorative variations yielding phenotypic improvements. Which of the two dominates is influenced by the environment. We adopt two tools for this study of evolvability: i) the rate of adaptive evolution, which captures the observable adaptive variations driven by evolvability; and ii) the variability of individuals, which measures the potential of an individual to vary functionally. We apply these tools to a Linear Genetic Programming system and observe that evolvability is able to exploit its two sides in different environmental situations...|$|R
