5|$|The gross {{underestimation}} of Fighter Command's strength {{issued to}} Luftwaffe units meant the British reaction was {{much stronger than}} expected. During the 24-hour period, Fighter Command flew 927 sorties, slightly fewer than the Germans. Only 41 of these sorties were <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> night, 28 on 17/18 August and 13 on 18/19 August. The remaining 886 sorties were <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> day, a number almost exactly equal to the 861 serviceable Spitfire, Hurricane, Defiant and Gladiator day fighters available to squadrons.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire systems to control aircraft was demonstrated by developing and flight testing a single channel system, which used Apollo hardware, in an F- 8 C test airplane. This {{is the first}} airplane to fly with a digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire system as its primary means of control and with no mechanical reversion capability. The development and flight test of a triplex digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire system, which will serve as an experimental prototype for future operational digital <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> wire systems, are underway...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to its use on the nuclear bomb missions, The Great Artiste was <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> five different crews on 12 training and practice missions. It flew bombing missions against Rota on 4 July, Truk on 8 July, and Marcus on 9 July. It returned to bomb Rota again on 12 and 14 July, and bombed Guguan on 18 and 19 July. It was <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> Albury and crew C-15 on two combat missions, {{one of which was}} aborted, and the other in which it used a pumpkin bomb to attack the railroad yards at Kobe on 24 July. Captain Bob Lewis and crew B-9 flew it to drop a pumpkin bomb on an industrial target in Koriyama on 29 July.|$|E

5|$|The first rescue {{resources}} {{to approach the}} crash site were CCGA volunteer units. These units were mostly privately owned fishing boats that operated out of Peggys Cove, Bayswater, and other harbours on St. Margaret's Bay and the Aspotogan Peninsula. They were soon joined by the dedicated Canadian Coast Guard SAR vessel CCGS Sambro, CH-124 Sea King helicopters <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> Airforce crews from 423 Maritime Helicopter Squadron (MHS) and 406 Maritime Operational Training Squadron (MOTS) out of CFB Shearwater and CH-113 Labrador SAR helicopters <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> the 413 Squadron from CFB Greenwood.|$|E

All early Comets were withdrawn from service for accident inquiries, during which orders from British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Japan Air Lines, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, National Airlines, Pan American World Airways, and Panair do Brasil were cancelled. When the redesigned Comet 4 entered service, it was <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> customers BOAC, Aerolíneas Argentinas, and East African Airways, while the Comet 4B variant was operated by customers BEA and Olympic Airways, and the Comet 4C model was <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> customers Kuwait Airways, Mexicana, Middle East Airlines, Misrair Airlines, and Sudan Airways.|$|E

5|$|Bockscar {{had been}} <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> Sweeney and crew C-15 in three test drop rehearsals of inert Fat Man {{assemblies}} {{in the eight}} {{days leading up to}} the second mission, including the final rehearsal the day before. The Great Artiste, which was the assigned aircraft of the crew with whom Sweeney most often flew, had been designated in preliminary planning to drop the second bomb, but the aircraft had been fitted with observation instruments for the Hiroshima mission. Moving the instrumentation from The Great Artiste to Bockscar would have been a complex and time-consuming process, and when the second atomic bomb mission was moved up from 11 August to 9 August because of adverse weather forecasts, the crews of The Great Artiste and Bockscar instead exchanged aircraft. The result was that the bomb was carried by Bockscar, but <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> the crew C-15 of The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{missions}} were <b>flown</b> <b>by</b> the 509th Composite Group on 20, 23, 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945, {{using the}} bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities.

The Messerschmitt made a wheels-up landing at RAF Penshurst, where Chesters also landed {{a few minutes}} later as he was short of fuel. Chesters dragged the German from his aircraft. Schieverhofer spat in his face, and a fist-fight {{developed}} with both combatants swearing at each other in German. The fight was broken up by the arrival of an ARP Warden, a policeman and a soldier. Chesters was forced to hand back Schieverhofer's Iron Cross, which he had snatched as a souvenir, and instead took the first aid kit from the Messerschmitt. Schieverhofer was taken away from RAF Penshurst as a prisoner of war.|$|E
