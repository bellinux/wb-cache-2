40|$|Background: Oral {{health has}} a {{substantial}} influence on {{quality of life}} and has been linked to general health, yet there is much work required to determine its optimal management. Methods: This discussion paper drew upon government reports, research literature, existing reviews and media releases to discover the challenges and opportunities when incorporating dentistry into primary healthcare. Results: Oral health outcomes have improved over the generations, the <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> <b>service</b> mix has changed, the number of dental clinicians has increased and the workforce mix is changing, possibly leading to a change in perspectives on work-life balance. There is unequal access to dental care alongside a dental workforce maldistribution. Dental care is funded separately to general healthcare and is largely supplied by the private sector. Subsidised dental care has been managed by the states but federal politicians of major political parties are investigating new funding arrangements. Conclusions: The challenges to incorporating dentistry into primary healthcare are great. However, major political parties are interested in oral health. The oral workforce is going through a process of rapid change in practitioner number, type and possibly attitudes, thereby giving an opportunity to modify its delivery systems.

40|$|Practice belief scales among private general dental {{practitioners}} DS Brennan, * AJ Spencer* Background: Practice beliefs have {{been related to}} service rate variation. The aims {{of this study were}} to replicate practice belief scales in Australia and investigate associations with dentist and <b>practice</b> characteristics and <b>services.</b> Method: A random sample of Australian dentists completed mailed questionnaires (response rate 60. 3 per cent). Results: Private general practitioners (n= 345) provided service data from a typical day. Eight practice belief items were recorded on a five-point Likert scale, yielding four factor-based scales. Approximately 85 per cent of responses were on the agreement side of the midpoint for the scales of Information giving and Patient influence, 45 per cent for Preventive orientation and approximately 10 per cent for Controlling active disease rather than developing better preventive advice. Capital city dentists had higher agreement with the Preventive orientation scale, while males and older dentists showed less disagreement with the Controlling active disease item (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis P< 0. 05). Those agreeing with the scales (that is scores ≤ the median) showed (Poisson regression P< 0. 05) : a higher rate of crown and bridge, a rate ratio (RR) of 1. 31, but lower rates of extraction (RR= 0. 76) and prosthodontic services (RR= 0. 64) for the Information giving scale; a higher rate of restorative (RR= 1. 22) and total services per visit (RR= 1. 06) for the Preventive orientation scale; a higher rate of preventive services (RR= 1. 14), but a lower rate of crown and bridge services (0. 78) for the Patient influence scale; and higher rates of crown and bridge (RR= 1. 40) and prosthodontic (RR= 1. 59) but lower rates of periodontic (RR= 0. 60) and extraction services (RR= 0. 62) for the Controlling active disease item. Conclusions: These findings confirm the factor structure of practice beliefs and demonstrate small to moderate associations with variation in service rates.

40|$|In {{this global}} era {{the quality of}} dental service in Indonesia has become {{increasingly}} competitive, which can {{be reflected in the}} increasing number of traditional <b>dental</b> <b>service,</b> private <b>dental</b> <b>practice,</b> public health <b>service,</b> 24 hour health clinic, dental clinic, specialist dental clinic and dental spa. Dentists need to consider an appropriate service method and to determine the patient’s specific target so that they could become a loyal customer. The first important consideration in order to satisfy customer a dentist has to be updated with the latest dentistry development, dental equipment and material, so that he is able to apply the latest dental techniques with sophisticated equipment and materials. The second point is the dental service quality, the dentist meticulousness and carefulness to execute every case. The third point is the best dental service of the dentist and his team, hospitality, punctuality, strategic practice location and interior practice hygiene. The last important point is to determine the patient’s specific target market based on dentist’s competitive skill and local people characteristic. DOI:  10. 14693 /jdi. v 15 i 3. 26 </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Childsmile is a {{national}} oral health improvement programme for Scottish children. Childsmile Practice, a targeted and universal component, aims to promote oral health, and reduce inequalities in oral health and access to <b>dental</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Practice</b> is delivered, in part, by DHSWs who support families to engage with oral health behaviours and <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> attendance. Objectives: This study comprises part of Childsmile's formative evaluation. Designed as a scoping exercise, we aimed to uncover and explore areas of variation in delivery of the role. The findings were used to design in-depth comparative case studies, {{with the purpose of}} learning from within Childsmile, to optimise delivery of the role. Methods: Eight focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews (involving 24 DHSWs and 9 Childsmile Coordinators) explored the delivery process and barriers and facilitators to achieving outcomes. Participants were selected using theoretical sampling. Sessions were recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted. Findings: Substantive variation in the delivery of the role, evident between and within health boards, was attributed to: adaptation at a local level; individual attitudes; engagement from Childsmile stakeholders; and DHSW workload. Key points of variation are where the DHSW is situated and how this influences referral of the 'right child', and the nature of support. DHSWs rely on the 'right child' being referred for support and method of referral may impact on programme outcomes. Supporting families may require intensive behaviour change, the extent to which this {{should be part of the}} role needs to be considered. Barriers to the role include lack of engagement from <b>dental</b> <b>practices</b> and limited DHSW autonomy. Conclusion: Variation in the DHSW role to suit local context is expected and potentially facilitative. The extent to which variation impacts on programme outcomes will be investigated during planned case studies. The role needs further development prior to summative evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Background. The authors {{explore the}} {{importance}} of human values in <b>dental</b> <b>practice,</b> an area often overlooked as we struggle {{to deal with the}} everyday demands of treating patients and managing staff members. Such values are, however, fundamental to the success of any practice; therefore, {{it is important to understand}} their significance. Conclusions. Problems arise in <b>dental</b> <b>practices</b> when gaps develop between the values held by the various players involved (that is, between the entire dental team and patients, the dentist/owner's personal values and business goals, the dentist/owner and staff members, and the <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> and any third-party funding organizations).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to perform an {{estimation}} of the <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> production process. This estimation provides information on the contributions of each input to dental production and the type of returns to scale exhibited by <b>dental</b> <b>practices.</b> Previous studies in this area have presented contradictory results and conclusions concerning input contributions and returns to scale. In addition, these studies have been based on data sets where the individual dentist, not the <b>dental</b> <b>practice,</b> is the unit of observation. The present study uses data collected on a <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> basis and estimates a <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> production function and the reduced form direct cost function, and indirect cost, revenue, and profit functions. ^ Estimation of the production function was performed using both patient visits and gross billings as measures of output. Dentist hours, staff hours, and operatories per practice were the input measures. Staff hours represents the grouping of all non-dentist labor inputs into one category. ^ The estimation results of the <b>dental</b> <b>practice</b> production function found that <b>dental</b> <b>practices</b> exhibit constant returns to scale. A test was performed to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the estimated coefficients of solo and nonsolo practices. The test found no significant differences. This study also found a systematic variation across estimated coefficients when patient visits and gross billings were used as output measures. The coefficient of dentist hours is higher with patient visits as output, while the coefficient of staff hours is always higher with gross billings. The present study presents an explanation for this variation based on the more frequent occurrence of multiple service visits as more staff are employed. These results have implications for public and private policy regarding the organization and use of inputs in the dental production process. ^ Estimation of the reduced forms presented reasonable results only for the direct cost function, which indicated that <b>dental</b> <b>practices</b> exhibit increasing returns to scale. These results are not conclusive, but demonstrate the uncertainty that exists in dental production research and the need for further investigation of alternative methods. ...|$|R
