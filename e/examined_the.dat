This method was amended by The Mental Health Act 1959 which stated a person could be admitted upon the recommendation of a medical practitioner who had <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> person.

5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began {{a series}} of studies of {{globular}} clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> RR Lyrae variables in the clusters (which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E

5|$|Clemuel Ricketts, the {{architect}} of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from the colonial period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.|$|E

5|$|Examination by {{a severe}} weather {{team from the}} Bureau of Meteorology <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> damage in the Bucca and Kolan region and {{recorded}} it as an 'F4' on the Fujita scale.

5|$|Experiments {{conducted}} have <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> metagenomes of eukaryotes; identified Prokaryotes {{and viruses}} inhabiting the lake; provided evidence of virus-mediated horizontal gene transfer and adaptive metabolic or cold protective phenotype alterations, identified microbial nanowire connections between multiple species at the ice-water interface, {{in the water}} column, and in the sediment; and established biomass estimates {{of life in the}} lake ice during the early spring growing season using laser-induced fluorescence emission (L.I.F.E.) imaging techniques.|$|E
5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and <b>examined.</b> <b>The</b> bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E
