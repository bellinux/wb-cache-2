The olive drab U.S. Army Shade 7 cotton canvas [...] "Belt, Individual Equipment" [...] is manufactured to United States military specification MIL-B-40158 and is produced in two sizes: Medium, for waists under 30-inches (FSN 8465-577-4925), and Large, for waists over 30-inches (FSN 8465-577-4924). Earlier production <b>individual</b> <b>equipment</b> belts feature a horizontal canvas weave while later patterns feature a vertical weave. It is secured {{by means of a}} brass hook and loop buckle and has two rows of eyelets along the top and bottom for attaching <b>individual</b> <b>equipment</b> utilizing the M-1910 wire hanger.

50|$|The design effort went slowly, {{due to the}} {{concentration}} on the design and development of items to meet the requirement of the Vietnam War, although developers initiated projects investigating the feasibility of replacing much of the steel and brass hardware with aluminum or plastic items. On 15 March 1967, an Engineering Concept Review was held at Natick Laboratories. The concept approved at the meeting was for an <b>individual</b> <b>equipment</b> belt to be supported by <b>individual</b> <b>equipment</b> suspenders, to which could be attached component items such as small arms ammunition cases, water canteen covers, entrenching tool carriers, field first aid dressing cases, etc. A field pack somewhat larger than the M-1961 cotton canvas duck field pack was proposed which could be attached for carrying either on the <b>individual</b> <b>equipment</b> belt at the small of the back, or on the shoulders attached to the <b>individual</b> <b>equipment</b> belt suspenders, or attached to a detachable field pack frame. The field pack frame with shoulder straps and a removable cargo shelf would be designed to be worn over the <b>individual</b> <b>equipment</b> belt and suspenders. The end result of this meeting was {{the adoption of the}} nylon M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE). The field pack design was rejected in the end and a nylon version of the M-1961 field pack was produced instead along with the nylon Tropical Rucksack (FSN 8465-935-6673).|$|E
