The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> <b>rating</b> for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex.

Methods: A numerical 3 D aorta phantom was designed based on an aorta velocity field obtained by computational fluid mechanics. Motion-distorted 4 D Flow MRI measurements were simulated and several different motion-suppression techniques were evaluated: Gating with fixed acceptance window size, gating with different window sizes in inner and outer kspace, and k-space reordering. Additionally, different spatial resolutions were simulated. Results: Respiratory motion reduced the image quality. All motion-suppression techniques improved the <b>data</b> <b>quality.</b> Flow <b>rate</b> errors of up to 30 % without gating could be reduced to less than 2. 5 % with the most successful motion suppression methods. Weighted gating and gating combined with kspace reordering were advantageous compared with conventional fixed-window gating. Spatial resolutions finer than the amount of accepted motion did not lead to improved results. Conclusion: Respiratory motion affects 4 D Flow MRI data. Several different motion suppression techniques exist that are capable of reducing the errors associated with respiratory motion. Spatial resolutions finer than the degree of accepted respiratory motion do not result in improved <b>data</b> <b>quality.</b> (C) 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

Telephone interviewers are typically instructed to read questions with a proper phrasing and inflection and to read questions at a speech rate of 2 words per second (wps). However, there is no study that examines whether these interviewer voices affect <b>data</b> <b>quality.</b> In this dissertation, I examine how interviewer voice characteristics are associated with <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> in socially desirable, undesirable, and complex questions. ^ Data for this study come from the Work and Leisure Today Survey (NSF SES- 1132015). I examined the first turn that interviewers read a survey question (n= 4, 689). Pitch, intonation, speech rate, and disfluencies are both objectively measured by the Praat program and subjectively evaluated by coders. In addition, coders evaluated five interviewer personality traits (expertise, trustworthiness, reliability, confidence, and easiness to understand) from interviewer voices. I examined four sets of <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> indicators including problematic respondent behaviors, item nonresponse, the directional hypothesis of “more/less is better,” and rounding. ^ Analyses showed both objective and subjective voice characteristics affect data quality; however, the effects are inconsistent across <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> indicators. Interviewers obtain better <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> when they read questions with moderate intonation and disfluencies. The voice characteristic with the largest effect on <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> is speech <b>rate.</b> Interviewers obtain better <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> when they read neutral questions with 2 wps, but read socially undesirable questions more quickly. Results suggest that interviewers should be trained to read questions with moderate intonation and disfluencies. In addition, to maximize <b>data</b> <b>quality,</b> interviewers should read neutral questions with the recommended speech rate of 2 wps, but read socially undesirable questions more quickly. ^ I also found that listeners can perceive interviewers’ personality traits (credibility and easiness to understand) from interviewers’ voices, and these personality traits tend to affect <b>data</b> <b>quality.</b> Credibility affects <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> in sensitive questions while easiness to understand affects <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> in complex questions.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{focus of}} the work {{contained}} in this thesis is missing data treatments in traffic loop detector datasets. This work is motivated {{by the need to}} improve <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> and coverage for performance reporting and system management decisions. Missing data, whether due to hardware malfunction or error detection and removal, is a critical concern in loop detector <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> control in Washington State and elsewhere, and can quickly become the controlling factor in overall <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> as the <b>rate</b> of missingness increases. First, the various causal factors and resulting patterns of missingness in loop detector datasets are discussed with respect to the assumptions underlying common missing data treatments. Next, two multiple imputation methodologies are introduced for loop detector data, which have seen use in a number of fields but have not yet been applied to traffic data. These methods are {{able to take advantage of}} the various spatial correlation structures present in volume and speed data, and can produce reliable imputation even under high rates of missingness and missing entire days and months. The proposed imputation algorithms are demonstrated in different locations, time periods, and missing data patterns, and are shown to be capable of reliably representing the statistical properties of the true data. Aggregation levels, model structure, and limitations of the proposed methods are discussed, and some guidelines for implementation are presented.

40|$|Abstract: MIMO for {{wireless}} communication is an antenna based technology where multiple antennas {{at each end}} are used to minimize the errors, optimize speed and data integrity also it meant for improvement of the efficiency and reliability of a system. Conventional technology which use single antenna at both source and destination results in problems such as fading, cut-off, intermittent reception. To extend coverage area, <b>data</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>quality</b> of service etc. several systems have been come up with goal of low complexity and having high gain. We present here {{a comprehensive review of}} MIMO System Using Transmit Diversity and Relay Selection Algorithm where Transit Diversity technique used to improve the wireless link performance and received signal quality whereas Relay Selection are used for interference suppression. MIMO system enables to increased spectral efficiency and by using MMSE estimator it results in minimization of mean square error...|$|R
40|$|In this work, burst {{oriented}} {{data transmission}} over unknown frequency selective channels is considered. The receiver {{is assumed to}} use multiple antennas {{and the problem of}} estimating the start position of a data packet in the presence of spatially correlated co-channel interference is addressed. Each burst is assumed to contain a known training sequence, and metrics for finding the position of this training sequence are studied. More specifically, we examine the advantages of taking the spatial correlation of the co-channel interference into account, as compared with treating it as spatially white. Simulations and experimental results for transmission of normal GSM bursts in interference limited scenarios are presented. I. INTRODUCTION To meet the increasing demands for higher <b>data</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>quality,</b> coverage and capacity of wireless systems, the use of antenna arrays has been proposed as a way to exploit the spatial dimension more efficiently [1]. Among the possibilities are improved r [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{channels}} regulate {{a variety}} of physiological processes and represent an important class of drug target. Among the many methods of studying ion channel function, patch clamp electrophysiology is considered the gold standard by providing the ultimate precision and flexibility. However, its utility in ion channel drug discovery is impeded by low throughput. Additionally, characterization of endogenous ion channels in primary cells remains technical challenging. In recent years, many automated patch clamp (APC) platforms {{have been developed to}} overcome these challenges, albeit with varying throughput, <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> and success <b>rate.</b> In this study, we utilized SyncroPatch 768 PE, one of the latest generation APC platforms which conducts parallel recording from two- 384 modules with giga-seal <b>data</b> <b>quality,</b> to push these 2 boundaries. By optimizing various cell patching parameters and a two-step voltage protocol, we developed a high throughput APC assay for the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1. 7. By testing a group of Nav 1. 7 reference compounds' IC 50, this assay was proved to be highly consistent with manual patch clamp (R > 0. 9). In a pilot screening of 10, 000 compounds, the success rate, defined by > 500 MΩ seal resistance and > 500 pA peak current, was 79 %. The assay was robust with daily throughput ~ 6, 000 data points and Z' factor 0. 72. Using the same platform, we also successfully recorded endogenous voltage-gated potassium channel Kv 1. 3 in primary T cells. Together, our data suggest that SyncroPatch 768 PE provides a powerful platform for ion channel research and drug discovery...|$|R
