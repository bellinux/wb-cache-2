They formulate the method in a model of survey response and provide an empirical validation based on data from the Health and Retirement Study comparing the alternative estimates to the traditional estimates of differential mortality for the same sample of baseline respondents. They present two applications. First, they document an increase in differential mortality in the U.

50|$|McDaniel had {{determined}} that when facing the target directly, {{most people can}} attain {{a high degree of}} horizontal accuracy when pointing the index finger at the target. Vertical alignment is what requires special training. By developing his favored hip-shooting stance in which the shooter points his body at the target, pivoting on the balls of his feet to get there, either prior to or during the draw, McDaniel minimized the number of movable joints in the body that the subconscious has to control in order to hit the target. To recap, the shooter does not twist his neck, at his waist, knees or ankles; those joints are immobilized, as is his right shoulder, if he is right-handed. By planting his right elbow against his stomach at the same point each time, he establishes a constant reference point from which the subconscious can easily determine the parallax between the direct line-of-sight of the shooter's eyes and his gun barrel. Also, with his elbow planted in his stomach, the shooter has greater leverage for pulling the trigger of a double-action revolver or automatic controllably. The only real variable that the shooter's subconscious now has to deal with is <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> bend to put in his elbow to get the vertical alignment correct for the offset of the gun barrel and the distance to the target.|$|R

5000|$|Double cast-on : A common method, {{in which}} all the loops are made with one yarn, while the other end (the {{dangling}} end from the original slip knot) is used to secure the base of each loop. This method is also called the [...] "knit half-hitch cast on" [...] or the [...] "long-tail cast on." [...] Although popular, this method requires that the knitter estimate the length of the dangling yarn before the stitches are cast on; if the dangling yarn is too short, the knitter will run out of yarn with which to secure the stitches before the full number of stitches have been cast on. In that case, the knitter will have to pull everything out, re-position the slip knot to give a longer tail, and begin anew. Despite this shortcoming, it's a good all-around method for casting on. Another variation for this method is to use two different yarns, one the main yarns that you are using for your project, and the second a piece of contrasting waste yarn. You attach the two with a slip knot, and then using the waste or contrast yarn as your long tail, start your row. This is useful if you need to pick up stitches on your cast on edge in order to knit in the opposite direction. You can also use it decoratively, making the contrast or waste yarn a part of your pattern design. To execute it, you start by <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> yarn you expect your cast-on row to require and pulling out that amount of yarn. Once you have that, put a slip knot on the needle (this is not absolutely necessary, since the first cast-on stitch will create a slip knot for you in the process, but it is generally more secure to start with a slip knot). Hold the needle in your right hand and the yarn in your left, with the long tail pulled around your thumb and hanging in front, and the yarn from ball around your first or second finger, with the ball tail heading toward the back. Once you have that, take the needle under the front of the long tail, picking up a half hitch, then back to the yarn over your finger from the top side of the yarn, pulling the loop through the half hitch you had formed. This cast on can also be done in a purl and a twisted stitch version as well.|$|R

50|$|Estimating the {{economic}} impact of food & beverage tourism is at best, very difficult. First, we would need to find how many travelers there are to an area. Then we would need to interview them to find <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they spend on food and drink while traveling. We could dig deeper and ask them what percentage of their expenditures are for sustenance vs. a unique food or beverage experience. We would also have to factor out expenditures by locals. And how would you account for a visitor's spending on gourmet souvenir items in a grocery store? As you can see, the task is very difficult, and the cost of <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>much</b> travelers are spending on food and beverage experiences can outweigh the findings. The World Food Travel Association (WFTA) provides a formula. Over the years, through the WFTA's own research, secondary research, interviews and conversations, the association has constructed its own impression of the value of food tourism. By itsestimate, visitors spend approximately 25% of their travel budget on food and beverages. The figure can get as high as 35% in expensive destinations, and as low as 15% on more affordable destinations.  Confirmed food lovers also spend a bit more than the average of 25% spent by travelers in general. The association recommends that interested parties conduct more evidence-based research if you require absolute precision. The WFTA is confident that your results will most likely fall in this range. Most governments publish data on total visitor arrivals and expenditures. Take the estimated economic impact of visitors to your area and multiply it by 25%. That is your estimated economic impact of expenditures on the food and beverage sector.|$|R
40|$|Although ‘Super Choice’ {{arrived on}} 1 July, the {{overarching}} goal of superannuation is to constrain choice, says Nicholas Gruen. But {{there is an}} alternative. IN HOMER’S Odyssey, Odysseus, sailing past the Isle of the Sirens, had himself lashed to the mast and his crew’s ears filled with wax. That way {{he could hear the}} song which had lured other sailors to their death and yet live to tell the tale. In embracing self-constraint, Odysseus saved himself. Our super system lashes some of our savings to the mast as we pass our own Isles of the Sirens. Plasma screen or home extension anyone? But pity that generation of twenty and thirty somethings increasingly resentful at the way us forty, fifty and sixty somethings have bid up the housing market. When they’re madly saving their deposit we force them to save another 9 per cent of their earnings and invest it elsewhere! And isn’t it odd that, as even as our leaders exhort us to ‘lifelong learning’ they won’t let us draw on superannuation savings to fund a spell of study. Within the Central Provident Fund - Singapore’s equivalent of our super system - superannuation savings are used to fund both home ownership and education. But where our superannuation system is still underdone, Singapore’s CPF is paternalistic overkill. Against our 9 per cent, Singapore’s compulsory contributions are 40 per cent of earnings - down from 50 per cent two decades ago! We shouldn’t copy Singapore, but its example does suggest that we’ve got ourselves into a bit of a vicious circle. At 9 per cent of earnings, compulsory super still falls well short of meeting our retirement needs. So policy makers are rightly cautious about burdening it with additional tasks to fund. But no one’s falling over themselves to increase compulsory super because in an impatient world with a three year electoral cycle, its costs are immediate for most, and its benefits far away. But a vicious circle is often just a virtuous circle in disguise. Increasing the flexibility in how we use super savings should make it politically easier to expand. And expanding super enables us to fund greater flexibility in the use of super savings. So that’s our way out. First, tight targeting can reduce the drain that greater flexibility has on the super savings pool. We could limit pre-retirement access to super savings for appropriate purposes to some specific figure - say $ 20, 000. Some would reduce savings effort running down their super instead. But offsetting this, super flexibility would bring forward the date on which many bought homes and thus took on the higher savings rates that mortgage repayments often involve. It’s true that many people spend too much on their houses. But there are huge social and economic benefits from expanding home ownership among those of modest means. Home-owners enjoy lower living costs and greater security - fantastic assets in old age. And natural incentives to look after their properties cuts out agents’ inspections and commissions. That’s efficiency. We should keep cranking up compulsory super, which would be relatively painless if done as we used to - a per cent or so every couple of years. But, since progress on this front has stalled along with most other economic reform that doesn’t involve giving money away, we should experiment with smarter alternatives. First, we could require those accessing greater flexibility in the use of their super savings to commit to higher contributions. Second, the new field of ‘behavioural economics’ tells us that in situations of great uncertainty - like <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we should save now to fund a retirement that is several decades away - we look around to see what others do. (Terror of deviating from ‘normality’ is one reason investment managers so rarely outperform the market). As US Bureau of Economic Research economists argued in their aptly titled paper ‘Passive Decisions and Potent Defaults’, (which was picked up recently in Imagining Australia, an excellent book by four young Australians) we can influence savings by influencing people’s conception of what is ‘normal’. That’s easier from government, but it can even be done by an opposition - by simply making increasing your super contributions a talking point. Our leaders could try making it normal for people to salary sacrifice an additional 1 per cent this year, 2 per cent next year and so on until total contributions are - say - 15 per cent of earnings. And there’s something much more powerful than talk - inertia. We can establish a system whereby a progressively increasing portion of our own wages are automatically deducted from our pay-packet and paid into super. You could still elect to contribute less - completing a form declaring you understand what you were doing and electing to reduce your non-compulsory contributions as much as you wanted. But by tilting the burden of inertia and the frame of ‘normality’, we’d trigger a healthy amount of doubt in people’s minds before they unshackled themselves from the mast. If they did end up saving too little, they’d have done so by design rather than default. To the extent these reforms succeed they’d yield a double dividend: solving the problems we face now, while minimising the degree of compulsion required in the future. It’s an idea worthy of the wily Odysseus. • Dr Nicholas Gruen is a visiting fellow at ANU and Melbourne University and CEO of Lateral Economics and Peach Discount Mortgage Broking.

40|$|Egalitarians {{must address}} two questions: i. What {{should there be}} an {{equality}} of, which concerns the currency of the ‘equalisandum’; and ii. How should this thing be allocated to achieve the so-called equal distribution? A plausible initial composite answer to these two questions is that resources should be allocated in accordance with choice, because this way the resulting distribution of the said equalisandum will ‘track responsibility’ — responsibility will be tracked {{in the sense that}} only we will be responsible for the resources that are available to us, since our allocation of resources will be a consequence of our own choices. But the effects of actual choices should not be preserved until the prior effects of luck in constitution and circumstance are first eliminated. For instance, people can choose badly because their choice-making capacity was compromised {{due to a lack of}} intelligence (i. e. due to constitutional bad luck), or because only bad options were open to them (i. e. due to circumstantial bad luck), and under such conditions we are not responsible for our choices. So perhaps a better composite answer to our two questions (from the perspective of tracking responsibility) might be that resources should be allocated so as to reflect people’s choices, but only once those choices have been corrected for the distorting effects of constitutional and circumstantial luck, and on this account choice preservation and luck elimination are two complementary aims of the egalitarian ideal. Nevertheless, it is one thing to say that luck’s effects should be eliminated, but quite another to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> just <b>how</b> <b>much</b> resource redistribution would be required to achieve this outcome, and so it was precisely for this purpose that in 1981 Ronald Dworkin developed the ingenuous hypothetical insurance market argumentative device (HIMAD), which he then used in conjunction with the talent slavery (TS) argument, to arrive at an estimate of the amount of redistribution that would be required to reduce the extent of luck’s effects. However recently Daniel Markovits has cast doubt over Dworkin’s estimates of the amount of redistribution that would be required, by pointing out flaws with his understanding of how the hypothetical insurance market would function. Nevertheless, Markovits patched it up and he used this patched-up version of Dworkin’s HIMAD together with his own version of the TS argument to reach his own conservative estimate of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> redistribution there ought to be in an egalitarian society. Notably though, on Markovits’ account once the HIMAD is patched-up and properly understood, the TS argument will also allegedly show that the two aims of egalitarianism are not necessarily complementary, but rather that they can actually compete with one another. According to his own ‘equal-agent’ egalitarian theory, the aim of choice preservation is more important than the aim of luck elimination, and so he alleges that when the latter aim comes into conflict with the former aim then the latter will need to be sacrificed to ensure that people are not subordinated to one another as agents. I believe that Markovits’ critique of Dworkin is spot on, but I also think that his own positive thesis — and hence his conclusion about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> redistribution there ought to be in an egalitarian society — is flawed. Hence, this paper will begin in Section I by explaining how Dworkin uses the HIMAD and his TS argument to estimate the amount of redistribution that there ought to be in an egalitarian society — this section will be largely expository in content. Markovits’ critique of Dworkin will then be outlined in Section II, as will be his own positive thesis. My critique of Markovits, and my own positive thesis, will then make a fleeting appearance in Section III. Finally, I will conclude by rejecting both Dworkin’s and Markovits’ estimates of the amount of redistribution that there ought to be in an egalitarian society, and by reaffirming the responsibility-tracking egalitarian claim that choice preservation and luck elimination are complementary and not competing egalitarian aims...|$|R
