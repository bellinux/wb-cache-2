5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Hrvatske autoceste along the A3 motorway from January to August 2009 {{was reported to}} comprise the largest proportion of the total toll revenue {{collected by}} the company for the period: 889.8 millionkuna (approximately 121.9 millioneuro). Even though this figure is not further decomposed into the individual sections of motorway, it <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traffic volume data analysis that the largest portion of the toll revenue is collected on the sections between Zagreb and Slavonski Brod, and especially on those sections closest to the Ivanja Reka interchange.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E

25|$|According to John Quigley, however, it <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{context in}} which it was adopted, and from the {{statements}} recounted by the delegates, that Resolution 242 contemplates the Palestine Arab refugees only.|$|E
25|$|Holst {{suffered}} neuritis in {{his right}} arm, which caused him to seek help from several amanuenses in scoring The Planets. This <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> number of different hands apparent in the full score.|$|E

25|$|Stevin printed little {{circles around}} the exponents of the {{different}} powers of one-tenth. That Stevin intended these encircled numerals to denote mere exponents <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that he employed the very same symbol for powers of algebraic quantities. He didn't avoid fractional exponents; only negative exponents don't appear in his work.|$|E
25|$|One {{thing that}} <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{statistics}} is Rathfarnham is aging, with young couples that {{moved into the}} area in the 1960s entering retirement. There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as Templeogue, Tallaght and Firhouse.|$|E

25|$|First we {{prove the}} theorem for the 2-colour case, by {{induction}} on r+s. It <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> definition {{that for all}} n, R(n, 1) = R(1, n) = 1. This starts the induction. We prove that R(r, s) exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis R(r−1, s) and R(r, s−1) exist.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, it <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{course of}} events that when the reports began to arrive about {{the actions of the}} Phalangists in the camps, no proper heed was taken of these reports, the correct {{conclusions}} were not drawn from them, and no energetic and immediate action were taken to restrain the Phalangists and put a stop to their actions.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of Jews, perhaps more than 6000, found refuge in the various {{religious}} properties of Rome, including monasteries and convents; a much smaller number, took refuge in Vatican City itself.

25|$|Many {{inscriptions}} {{consist of}} only a few words (often names) in rote phrases, and many are fragmentary. They provide some evidence for morphology and better evidence for personal and mythological names. Occasionally, marked surface clausal configurations provide some evidence of a more formal, or poetic, register. It <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> subject matter of the records that the language was in use at all levels of society.|$|E
25|$|The Jarmann rifle was {{a remarkably}} {{accurate}} rifle for its time. In 1886, the joint Norwegian-Swedish rifle commission, which had selected the Jarmann, created {{a list of}} the ballistic properties of all the rifles tested. It <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> list, reproduced below, that the Jarmann M1884 was significantly better than the other rifles tested, although in part this must be due to the higher muzzle velocity of the Jarmann.|$|E
25|$|On the fortress-world Jago, Lord-General Van Voytz {{addresses}} the Tanith First personally. He 'asks' the Ghosts to secure an empty stronghold {{to the east}} of Elikon, the central Imperial bastion on the planet.

After six days of marching through Jago's desert-like terrain and enduring dust-storms, the Ghosts reach their objective: Hinzerhaus, dubbed the house {{at the end of the}} world.|$|E

25|$|That {{marriage}} of Edward, Prince of Wales, was in King Edward's mind <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that a}} papal dispensation was received from Pope Nicholas IV ten days after the treaty was signed. Thought to show bad faith on Edward's part, the Papal Bull did not contract a marriage, only permit one should the Scots later agree to it. Edward, like Eric, was now writing of Queen Margaret, anticipating her inauguration and the subsequent marriage to his son.|$|E
25|$|Drawbacks of block {{interleaver}} : As it <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> figure, {{the columns}} are read sequentially, the receiver can interpret single row only after it receives complete message and not before that. Also, the receiver requires {{a considerable amount}} of memory in order to store the received symbols and has to store the complete message. Thus, these factors give rise to two drawbacks, one is the latency and other is the storage (fairly large amount of memory). These drawbacks can be avoided by using the convolutional interleaver described below.|$|E
25|$|The ESA50 claim form, {{together}} {{with any other}} information sent with it by the claimant, will first be read by a qualified healthcare professional employed by the outsourcing firm, who will then decide on whether a face-to-face medical assessment is necessary: some people with severe disabilities can be granted ESA {{based solely on the}} documents supplied, if that <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> paperwork. For this reason, Maximus encourages new claimants to send as much relevant information as possible and give a detailed description of their disability when filling in the claim form.|$|E
