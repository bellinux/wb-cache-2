In Howard Richman's article Man with the plans in the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine of December 2012, Hurdzan explained his golf course design approach in these words: [...] "Form follows function — you'll hear that a lot around here," [...] Hurdzan says. [...] "The form is something that is a direct result of the function it has to serve. That is why I work so closely with superintendents. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> 'How are you going to mow that?' … 'How are you going to rake that?' … 'Are you going to be able to irrigate that?' I try to get a superintendent to think ahead. I don't want to leave them with problems. I want to leave them with solutions. That's why I like to get them involved." ...|$|E
