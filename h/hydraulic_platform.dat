The organ’s pipes are located behind and to the right and left of the chancel and also {{at the back of the}} rear balcony above the entrance to the Sanctuary (32' and chamade).

25|$|The camera {{platforms}} {{included a}} modified Citroën sedan, camera trucks, helicopters and a flying rig constructed by Dick Parker. Parker had built it for model sequences in Strategic Air Command (1955). The rig {{consisted of two}} construction cranes and a hydraulically operated device to tilt and position a model, along with 200ft (61m) of cables. Parker's rig allowed actors to sit inside full-scale models suspended 50ft (15m) above the ground, yet provide safety and realism for staged flying sequences, with the sky realistically in the background. A further <b>hydraulic</b> <b>platform</b> did away with matte shots of aircraft in flight. The platform was large enough to mount an aircraft and Parker or stunt pilots could manipulate its controls for realistic bluescreen sequences. Composite photography was used when scenes called for difficult shots; these were completed at Pinewood Studios. Some shots were created with rudimentary cockpits and noses grafted to an Alouette helicopter. One scene over Paris was staged with small models when Paris refused an overflight. However, {{for the majority of}} flying scenes, full-scale flying aircraft were employed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the capture}} of Lord, the {{remaining}} prisoners agreed that 25 April would be {{the final day of}} the protest. Prison officers entered the prison early in the morning and gradually began to occupy the upper landings. At 10:20 am one of the remaining prisoners, a seventeen-year-old on remand for joyriding, was captured leaving five prisoners remaining on the roof. When prison officers reached the roof they put up a sign similar to the ones used by prisoners throughout the protest, which read [...] "HMP in charge—no visits". At 6:20 pm the remaining five prisoners were removed from the roof in a [...] "cherry picker" [...] <b>hydraulic</b> <b>platform,</b> giving clenched fist salutes to the press and public as they descended. During the course of the 25-day riot, the longest in British penal history, 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners had been injured.|$|E

500|$|During each {{performance}} of the band's subsequent The Wall Tour, a [...] high wall of cardboard bricks was gradually built between the band and audience. Gaps allowed the spectators to view various scenes in the story, as Scarfe's animations were projected onto the completed parts of the wall. Several characters from the story were realised as giant inflatables, including a pig, replete with a crossed hammers logo. The tour opened at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on 7February 1980. [...] One of its more notable elements was the band's {{performance of}} [...] "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse {{in front of the}} wall, Gilmour waited in darkness {{at the top of the}} wall, for his cue. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly illuminate him, astonishing the audience. Gilmour stood on a flight case on casters, held steady by a technician, both precariously balanced atop a tall <b>hydraulic</b> <b>platform.</b> [...] At the end of the concert, the wall was made to collapse, once again revealing the band. Along with the songs in the album, the tour featured an instrumental medley, [...] "The Last Few Bricks", which was played before [...] "Goodbye Cruel World" [...] to allow the construction crew to complete the scenographic wall.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to be filmed, in September 2010. It was mainly filmed on a council estate in Bath, Somerset, while the scenes in the dollhouse were filmed in Dyrham Park. The Bristol estate was chosen because of its [...] "crisp architecture". The country house of Dyrham Park was chosen because of its {{staircase}} and checked flooring. The antiques were stripped out of the building and replaced with [...] "child-like" [...] furniture that was placed to look {{as though it had been}} played with. Several designs of the dolls were made, trying to achieve the desired balance of a normal doll and a scarier, more [...] "crude"-looking one. The actors portraying the dolls were choreographed to move with stiff legs but swing their arms. In the scene in which Alex and the Doctor are in the kitchen they open and close the fridge as they are talking; this was not in the script, but improvised by Smith and Mays on set. Mays was invited to guest-star in the episode, and was drawn to the story because of the family element; he has a young son like George. The scene in which Purcell sinks into the carpet was filmed with actor Andrew Tiernan on a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>platform</b> that lowered him into green-coloured liquid.|$|E
500|$|In November 1974, they {{employed}} {{for the first}} time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named [...] "Algie". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall. The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a [...] high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of [...] "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large <b>hydraulic</b> <b>platform</b> supported both Gilmour and the tech.|$|E

Firefighters said the cause was arson; the second such attack on the building in two days. Much of the main grade A listed building was damaged or destroyed.

40|$|Posture is {{a complex}} sensory-motor {{behavior}} that can {{be influenced by the}} fear of falling (FoF) during environmental changes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the influence of FoF on orthostatic postural control in healthy individuals by a systematic review. Thirteen articles were selected. Some other articles (31 references) were used to contextualize and discuss the topic. Studies in the environment made changes on the environment, in which participants were positioned in high <b>hydraulic</b> <b>platforms</b> at different heights, showed a decrease in the center of pressure in the anteroposterior oscillation where the platform was higher. This change in postural control strategy and the FoF are correlated. It can modulate the activity of the muscle spindle (H-reflex) and probably induce postural freezing phenomenon (anticipated postural anxiety). We can conclude that further studies are needed to understand the physiological mechanisms involved in FoF and its relation to changes in postural control strategy...|$|R
