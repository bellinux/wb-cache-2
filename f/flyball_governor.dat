5000|$|... 1859 The Gardner Governor Company, {{founded by}} Robert Gardner, {{introduces}} the first effective speed controls for steam engines. This innovation, {{known as the}} <b>flyball</b> <b>governor,</b> helped {{pave the way to}} later production of other industrial products such as air compressors. By the turn of the century, the company sold more than 150,000 governors across the United States and Canada.|$|E
50|$|The {{watermill}} {{is located}} {{to the north}} east of the village and stands on the river Glaven whose course was altered to enable construction of the mill on a site able to hold the mill dam without flooding the surrounding area. A watermill was first recorded on this site in the Domesday Book; in the 13th century it was known as Feldmille. The present watermill, built of Norfolk red brick with a pantile roof, stopped working in 1938 and the building is now a private residence. In its working order the watermill had a breastshot 13' x 6' wheel, made entirely out of wood, which powered 4 pairs of stones driven from above and controlled by two sets of <b>flyball</b> <b>governors.</b> Three pairs of French burr stones still remained in 2011, {{along with some of}} the mill machinery, which has been incorporated into the living area of the private residence conversion.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1868 paper [...] "On Governors", James Clerk Maxwell {{was able}} to explain instabilities {{exhibited}} by the <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> using differential equations to describe the control system. This demonstrated the importance and usefulness of mathematical models and methods in understanding complex phenomena, and it signaled the beginning of mathematical control and systems theory. Elements of control theory had appeared earlier but not as dramatically and convincingly as in Maxwell's analysis.|$|E
50|$|In water turbines, {{governors}} {{have been}} used since the mid-19th century to control their speed. A typical system would use a <b>Flyball</b> <b>governor</b> acting directly on the turbine input valve or the wicket gate to control {{the amount of water}} entering the turbine. By 1930, mechanical governors started to use PID controllers for more precise control. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace mechanical governors.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} uses of the conical pendulum was in the <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> (centrifugal governor) invented by James Watt in 1788 which regulated the speed of steam engines during the Steam Age in the 1800s. The playground game tetherball uses a ball attached to a pole by a cord which functions as a conical pendulum, although the pendulum gets shorter as the cord wraps around the pole. Some amusement park rides act as conical pendulums.|$|E
50|$|Controllers combine sensors, logic, and {{actuators}} {{to maintain}} the performance of components of a machine. Perhaps the best known is the <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> for a steam engine. Examples of these devices range from a thermostat that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such the cruise control system in an automobile. The programmable logic controller replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer. Servo motors that accurately position a shaft {{in response to an}} electrical command are the actuators that make robotic systems possible.|$|E
50|$|Control theory made {{significant}} strides {{over the next}} century. New mathematical techniques, as well as advancements in electronic and computer technologies, {{made it possible to}} control significantly more complex dynamical systems than the original <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> could stabilize. New mathematical techniques included developments in optimal control in the 1950s and 1960s followed by progress in stochastic, robust, adaptive, nonlinear, and azid-based control methods in the 1970s and 1980s. Applications of control methodology have helped to make possible space travel and communication satellites, safer and more efficient aircraft, cleaner automobile engines, and cleaner and more efficient chemical processes.|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} system consists of (i) a power source and actuators that generate forces and movement, (ii) {{a system of}} mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement, and (iii) a controller with sensors that compares the output to a performance goal and then directs the actuator input. This {{can be seen in}} Watt's steam engine (see the illustration) in which the power is provided by steam expanding to drive the piston. The walking beam, coupler and crank transform the linear movement of the piston into rotation of the output pulley. Finally, the pulley rotation drives the <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> which controls the valve for the steam input to the piston cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic {{control systems}} were first {{developed}} over {{two thousand years}} ago. The first feedback control device on record {{is thought to be}} the ancient Ktesibios's water clock in Alexandria, Egypt around the third century BCE. It kept time by regulating the water level in a vessel and, therefore, the water flow from that vessel. This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols captured the city in 1258 A.D. A variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply to just entertain. The latter includes the automata, popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again; these automata are examples of open-loop control. Milestones among feedback, or [...] "closed-loop" [...] automatic control devices, include the temperature regulator of a furnace attributed to Drebbel, circa 1620, and the centrifugal <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> used for regulating the speed of steam engines by James Watt in 1788.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative mixing technology for centrifugal microfluidic platforms actuated using {{a specially designed}} <b>flyball</b> <b>governor.</b> The multilayer microfluidic disc was fabricated using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replica molding process with a soft lithography technique. The operational principle {{is based on the}} interaction between the elastic covering membrane and an actuator pin installed on the <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> system. The <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> was used as the transducer to convert the rotary motion into a reciprocating linear motion of the pin pressing against the covering membrane of the mixer chamber. When the rotation speed of the microfluidic disc was periodically altered, the mixing chamber was compressed and released accordingly. In this way, enhanced active mixing can be achieved with much better efficiency in comparison with diffusive mixing...|$|E

After several years of testing different types of windmills, the three blade aeroplane type of propeller {{was found to be}} far superior in power output. By means of a <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> operated, variable pitch speed control, the maximum speed of the propeller was accurately and easily controlled, to prevent excessive speeds in high winds and storms.

40|$|Abstract: A system {{similar to}} bicycle used to spin a {{flywheel}} by human {{power and the}} energy is stored in the flywheel as rotational kinetic energy. Such an energy source is conceptualized as Human Powered Flywheel Motor (HPFM). It can be substituted for electrical motor for transient processes. As the energy is drained continuously from the flywheel the output speed of Flywheel Motor decreases continuously which in turn runs a process unit. An instrumentation system was designed to measure performance of Novel Gearbox for Human Powered Flywheel Motor which maintain the output speed considerably constant using automatic shifting of cluster pinions by means of <b>flyball</b> <b>governor.</b> An attempt is made to develop instrumentation system for measuring rotational speed of various shafts and know the exact time of engagement and disengagement of sliding gear-pinion pairs of novel gearbox...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Some {{three decades}} ago, certain {{computational}} in-telligence methods of reinforcement learning were recognized as implementing an approximation of Bellman’s Dynamic Pro-gramming method, {{which is known}} in the controls community as an important tool for designing optimal control policies for nonlinear plants and sequential decision making. Significant theoretical and practical developments have occurred within this arena, mostly in the past decade, with the methodology now usually referred to as Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP). The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide a retrospective of selected threads of such developments. In addition, a com-mentary is offered concerning present status of ADP, and threads for future research and development within the con-trols field are suggested. I. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND HILE existence of control devices dates back to antiq-uity (call it Phase 1 for the controls field), it may be said Maxwell’s use of differential equations to analyze the dynamics of a <b>flyball</b> <b>governor</b> (ca. 1870) [34] that had been invented by James Watt in 1788 [65] ushered in a new phase for the controls field (call it PHASE 2). Mathematics has played a fundamental role in Phase 2, progressing through Fourier and Laplace transforms, state space methods, stochastic methods, Hilbert space methods, and more recent-ly, algebraic and geometric topological methods. The advent of modern computers with their fantastic evolution the past few decades has also been significant, not only from the im-plementation point of view, but also as a driver and motivator for various mathematical and algorithmic developments as well. An important aspect of the Phase 2 methods, however, is that the controller so designed is placed in service with no associated mechanism for modifying its design in response to context changes, be they in the plant or its environment. This phase includes at least the following well known design me...|$|E
