50|$|After clerking for two federal {{district}} court judges, Marshall was appointed a professor at Mercer University's Walter F. George School of Law in Macon, teaching {{in the areas of}} property, commercial, <b>insurance,</b> <b>creditor's</b> rights, insolvency, reorganization, and small business law. He was minority recruiter and advisor to the Black Law Student Association at Mercer. From 1987 to 1995, he not only taught at Mercer but also developed a commercial litigation and business insolvency consulting practice, and became involved in civic affairs. Among other things, he served as president of Leadership Macon and the Macon Bar Association. He was also chairman of the Macon Housing Authority. It was during this period that Marshall first became active in politics. He co-chaired the 1990 gubernatorial campaign of former U.S. Congressman and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., and then as the current mayor of Atlanta, Andrew Young. Young was defeated in a primary run-off against Zell Miller. Marshall also chaired the successful state senate campaign of Robert Brown, the first African American since reconstruction to be elected to that body from outside the Atlanta metro area.|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{survey data}} for 60, 000 {{households}} from 29 transition economies in 2006 and 2010 {{to explore how}} the use of banking services is related to household characteristics, {{as well as to}} bank ownership, deposit <b>insurance</b> and <b>creditor</b> protection. At the household level we find that the holding of a bank account, a bank card, or a mortgage increases with income and education in most countries and find evidence for an urban-rural gap. The use of banking services is also related to the religion and social integration of a household as well as the gender of the household head. Using the within-country variation between 2006 and 2010, we find that the privatization of state-owned banks and an increase in market share of foreign banks are associated with a stronger use of banking services. Foreign bank ownership is also associated with a higher use of bank services among highincome households and households with formal employment. State ownership, by contrast is hardly associated with more outreach to poorer households. More generous deposit <b>insurance</b> and stronger <b>creditor</b> rights also foster the use of banking services among the urban, rich, better educated and formally employed. ...|$|R
50|$|Chiyoda Life <b>Insurance,</b> a major <b>creditor</b> of the hotel's {{bankrupt}} owner, {{acquired the}} long-abandoned hotel site in 1996 and began {{development of an}} office tower on the site.

Construction of the 158-meter tower was finished in 2002.|$|R
25|$|On 28 June 1996, the Nauru <b>Insurance</b> Company, a <b>creditor</b> of the Fitzroy Football Club, {{appointed}} Michael Brennan {{to administer}} {{the affairs of the}} Fitzroy Football Club to ensure a loan of A$1.25 million was to be repaid. During the 1996 season, there were fears that the club would collapse in mid-season due to its lack of cash. This was averted when the AFL guaranteed funds to Fitzroy to allow the club to continue in the competition for the remainder of 1996.|$|R
50|$|Charnley Davies Ltd {{was one of}} 17 {{insurance}} broking companies which collapsed in 1987 and operated out of Leeds, Wakefield and Hull. Creditors of Charnley Davies alleged that the administrator, Mr AJ Richmond, acted with undue haste in selling the business. He sold the business {{for a total of}} £50,000, plus £7500 for furniture and equipment, allegedly a grossly undervalued price. The creditors argued that they should have been consulted, because they were in the <b>insurance</b> business. The <b>creditors</b> argued the administrators were in breach of Insolvency Act 1986, section 27 because they had been unfairly prejudiced by the administrator's actions (see now Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule B1, para 74, which uses the phrase ‘unfairly harm’).|$|R
40|$|A Hidden Layer Learning Vector Quantization (HLVQ), neural network-learning {{algorithm}} {{is used for}} correcting the outputs of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) for predicting corporate bankruptcy. We call this method HLVQ-C, and it is shown that it outperforms both discriminant analysis and traditional neural networks while significantly reducing type I error, which {{is the type of}} error that has the highest costs for banks. Moreover, our approach gives an estimation of the prediction robustness thus providing a useful measure of credit risk, which is of great interest for banks, <b>insurance</b> companies and <b>creditors</b> in general. We also show that unbalanced samples, containing more financially sound firms than bankrupt firms, place a strong bias on the classifiers thus leading to a deterioration of type I error accuracy. Although many studies have been published on bankruptcy prediction using neural networks or discriminant analysis, they used mainly US or UK samples of very limited size. Our study is based on industrial French firms, uses a data-set of 583 bankrupt firms over the period 1998 - 2000 and tests the effects of different proportions of non-bankrupt firms in the sample. Attention was also given to feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The Fourth Review Under the Extended Arrangement, Financing Assurances Review, and Request for Waiver of Performance Criteria for Serbia and Montenegro are discussed. The agreed tighter fiscal, monetary, and incomes {{policies}} should {{cool off}} wage and credit growth, which are driving {{the demand for}} imports. The bold resumption of structural reforms should over time help increase exports, which remain exceptionally low in reference to GDP.

40|$|Recapitalizing {{banks in}} a {{systemic}} crisis {{is a complex}} medium-term process that requires significant government intervention and careful management at both the strategic and individual bank levels. This paper highlights the range of operational and strategic issues to be addressed and the institutional arrangements needed to foster an effective banking system restructuring and maximize the returns on government investment. The approaches to recapitalization have varied, with countries choosing different mixes of direct capital injections and asset purchase and rehabilitation. The choice of an appropriate mix is critical, to minimize the expected present value of government outlays net of recoveries.
