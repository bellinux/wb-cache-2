500|$|In 2013, Singer {{stated that}} Superman Returns {{was made for}} [...] "Perhaps more of a female audience. It wasn't what it needed to be, I guess." [...] Singer stated {{that he would have}} cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with [...] "the jet {{disaster}} sequence or something. I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don't know what would have helped. Probably nothing. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> again, I would do an origin. I would reboot it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron was {{an atheist}} {{in his early}} teens. When he was 17, {{during the height of}} his career on Growing Pains, he became a born-again Christian. After {{converting}} to Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in Growing Pains. After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire {{to start a new life}} away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years. Prior to the premiere of The Growing Pains Movie in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, [...] "I definitely kind of made an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life", admits Cameron. [...] "I shifted my focus from 100% on the show, to 100% on , and left 0% on the show—and even the friendships that were a part of that show. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back, I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast—like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Kane {{acknowledged}} Finger as [...] "a contributing force" [...] in the character's creation, and wrote, [...] "Now that my long-time {{friend and}} collaborator is gone, I {{must admit that}} Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put {{your name on it}} now. You deserve it.'" [...] Comics historian Ron Goulart has referred to Batman as the [...] "creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger".|$|E

60|$|MURRAY. You bet I do. I'm {{bound to}} go now. It's ridiculous keeping me here when I'm {{as healthy as}} a pig. I caught Stanton in the hall last night and asked him <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "And now I {{have no more}} money!" [...] {{explained}} Christian excitedly. [...] "And yet, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on, I {{should get}} it back again, and more. I wish this was mine." [...] He struck his boot upon the ground, so that the guineas chinked within.|$|E

6000|$|... 'And perhaps I may {{go on to}} {{say that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on board that ship as your {{accepted}} lover, I could do a deal more to make you comfortable, particularly when you land, than just as a mere friend, Miss Melmotte. You can't doubt my heart.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] Mr. Renshaw said.

60|$|This {{stopped the}} discussion. Mr. Bruff {{collected}} his papers, {{looking a little}} exhausted by the demands which our conversation had made on him. I took up my bag-full of precious publications, feeling as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> on talking for hours. We proceeded in silence to Lady Verinder's room.|$|R
60|$|LIZA. Oh! <b>if</b> <b>I</b> only <b>COULD</b> <b>go</b> {{back to my}} flower basket! I {{should be}} {{independent}} of both you and father and all the world! Why did you take my independence from me? Why did I give it up? I'm a slave now, for all my fine clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like trapsin' round," [...] said he, [...] "from {{place to}} place, and never did. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to some one spot {{and stay there}} with the child, {{while the rest of}} you made trips, I'd be satisfied, but I don't like keepin' on the steady go." ...|$|E

60|$|A day or {{two later}} Mrs. Strickland sent me round a note asking <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and see her that evening after dinner. I found her alone. Her black dress, simple to austerity, {{suggested}} her bereaved condition, and I was innocently astonished that notwithstanding a real emotion {{she was able to}} dress the part she had to play according to her notions of seemliness.|$|E
50|$|The {{conditional}} mood is {{used for}} such expressions as se mi povus, mi irus (<b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> would <b>go)</b> and se mi estus vi, mi irus (<b>if</b> <b>I</b> were you, I'd go).|$|R

6000|$|... "You can {{do things}} a {{thousand}} times more useful, Sally. I don't pretend to compare {{with you in the}} useful arts, and I am only a bungler in ornamental ones. Sally, I feel like a useless little creature. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> round as you can, and do business, and make bargains, and push ahead in the world, I should feel that I was good for something; but somehow I can't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{tried to}} go to sleep there," [...] he said, and I could swear his lips trembled. [...] "I've {{tried to go}} to sleep there, often and often.

6000|$|It {{was half}} an hour {{afterwards}} that Mrs. Cliff said: [...] "Well, Edna, I will go with you.

That would be a joy that nothing else on this earth could give me." ...|$|E

60|$|With those words, she {{shouldered}} her doll; {{and walked}} off. The last I saw of her, she was descending the stairs as a workman descends a ladder, {{on her way}} to the garden--and from the garden (the first time the gate was opened) to the hills. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> out with her light heart, I would have joined Jicks.|$|R
60|$|However, I {{went to bed}} {{and slept}} on it. Next morning I {{determined}} to set out for Southampton {{on a tour of}} inquiry to all the steamboat agencies. <b>If</b> that failed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on to Plymouth.|$|R
