5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E

500|$|Domestic {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive. Folha de S.Paulos deemed it [...] "a portrait of hell in motion," [...] "painted with such passion, competence and integrity" [...] {{which makes it}} [...] "both a torment and a pleasure." [...] The newspaper commented that all Bodanzky's choices are [...] "unerring", that the documentary tone [...] "amplifies the incisiveness of history" [...] and the natural dialogue, and that [...] "the absence of proselytism facilitates the entry of the viewer in the universe of characters." [...] Ivan Claudio of IstoÉ Gente praised all of the cast, including the extras whose [...] "wandering like zombies in the courtyards of the asylum ... contribute to the realistic climate of the film." [...] He, however, highlighted Santoro, stating that the joint effort of the cast would be meaningless without his performance. Similar comments on the cast were woven by Veja magazine, which also commended [...] "the feeling of terror." [...] Santoro and Camilo, {{as well as the}} other patient actors, were praised by Marcelo Forlani of Omelete who said, [...] "It's hard to believe that the actors <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> really crazy." [...] Forlani praised the photography and the sound editing as factors that differentiate it from other films. Furthermore, O Estado de S. Paulo dubed it [...] "the best Brazilian film since retomada." ...|$|E

In many cases, hazardous materials must be removed prior to disposing of the wreck.

2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get out of my house you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E
