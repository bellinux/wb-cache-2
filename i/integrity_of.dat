40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} whether the <b>integrity</b> (completeness) <b>of</b> pulmonary fissures affects pulmonary function {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Materials and Methods A dataset consisting of 573 CT exams acquired on different subjects was collected from a COPD study. According to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria, these subjects (examinations) were classified into five different subgroups, namely non-COPD (222 subjects), GOLD-I (83 subjects), GOLD-II (141 subjects), GOLD-III (63 subjects), and GOLD-IV (64 subjects), in terms of disease severity. An available computer tool was used to aid in an objective and efficient quantification <b>of</b> fissure <b>integrity.</b> The correlations between fissure integrity, and pulmonary functions (e. g., FEV 1, and FEV 1 /FVC) and COPD severity were assessed using Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients, respectively. Results For the five sub-groups ranging from non-COPD to GOLD-IV, the average <b>integrities</b> <b>of</b> the right oblique fissure (ROF) were 81. 8 %, 82. 4 %, 81. 8 %, 82. 8 %, and 80. 2 %, respectively; the average <b>integrities</b> <b>of</b> the right horizontal fissure (RHF) were 62. 6 %, 61. 8 %, 62. 1 %, 62. 2 %, and 62. 3 %, respectively; the average <b>integrities</b> <b>of</b> the left oblique fissure (LOF) were 82. 0 %, 83. 2 %, 81. 7 %, 82. 0 %, and 78. 4 %, respectively; and the average <b>integrities</b> <b>of</b> all fissures in the entire lung were 78. 0 %, 78. 6 %, 78. 1 %, 78. 5 %, and 76. 4 %, respectively. Their Pearson correlation coefficients with FEV 1 and FE 1 /FVC range from 0. 027 to 0. 248 with p values larger than 0. 05. Their Spearman correlation coefficients with COPD severity except GOLD-IV range from − 0. 013 to − 0. 073 with p values larger than 0. 08. Conclusion There is no significant difference in fissure integrity for patients with different levels of disease severity, suggesting that the development of COPD does not change the completeness of pulmonary fissures and incomplete fissures alone may not contribute to the collateral ventilation...|$|R

More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September.

These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages.

40|$|The {{notion of}} `integrity' remains {{relatively}} unexplored {{in the social}} psychological literature, despite it being central to some important theoretical perspectives (notably, self-affirmation theory).

5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E
