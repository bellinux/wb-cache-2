[...] Although Kane himself was a second-generation Un-Man, his compassion for all the freaks of Aberrance—natural and enhanced—has made him a kind of latter-day saint {{in the eyes of the}} oppressed gaffs. That gaffs believe that Kane will return to avenge the hostile takeover of Aberrance by Cranius and the other original Un-Men. Over the course of the first five-issue story arc, it is revealed that Damien Kane is still alive—more or less—having mutated into an <b>endomorphic</b> mass of [...] "Kaneflesh," [...] a living and apparently sentient organism that Cranius has trapped and locked away in a hidden laboratory behind his office. Cranius has been secretly using the Kaneflesh—which has remarkable regenerative properties—to create the radical body modifications of his next-generation Un-Men, including Niko's winged enhancements. Unknown to Cranius, however, the Kaneflesh transplantations (Cranius calls the cellular extract [...] "Compound K") have given Damien Kane limited telepathic control of these new Un-Men. In the course of the story arc, Kilcrop discovers that the captive Kane has been telepathically directing Cranius's next-generation Un-Men to murder the original Un-Men who seized control of Aberrance. This is Kane's vengeance for Cranius's subversion of the original utopian vision of a freak's sanctuary. The Kaneflesh escapes from Cranius's lab and attacks Cranius on the rooftop of the Un-Men corporate headquarters. Kilcrop destroys the angry creature, saving Cranius in the process. At the end of the story arc, Cranius hints to Kilcrop that the federal agent has a deeper connection to the Un-Men than he now realizes. Kilcrop is baffled by this suggestion, and, like readers of this comic, he will have to wait for a future issue for that mystery to be resolved.|$|E

[Methods] The somatotypes of 23 elite boxing athletes and 23 nonathletes were measured with the Heath-Carter method. The subjects were divided into four weight divisions as follows: lightweight, light middleweight, middleweight, and heavyweight class. [Results] The <b>endomorphic</b> compo-nent values of the boxing athletes were lower than those of the nonathletes. However, the mesomorphic component values of the boxing athletes were higher than those of the nonathletes. There was no significant difference in the ec-tomorphic component between the two groups. The higher weight divisions tended to have higher values of height, weight, and BMI than the lower weight divisions. The higher weight divisions also tended to have higher values for the <b>endomorphic</b> and mesomorphic components and a lower value for the ectomorphic component than the lower weight divisions. The group of nonathletes consisted of eight endomorphs, four mesomorphs, six ectomorphs, and five central types. Among the boxing athletes, there were 16 mesomorphic, four ectomorphic, and two central types and one <b>endomorphic</b> type.

Players were categorized according to playing position (i. e., role) as middle blockers (n= 28), opposite hitters (n= 41), passer-hitters (n= 54), setters (n= 30), and liberos (n= 28). Within each position, players were divided into a more successful group and a less successful group according to team ranking in the latest regional championship and player quality within the team. Height and body mass, somatotype by the Heath-Carter method, and four tests of lower body power, speed, agility and upper body power (i. e., dependent variables) were assessed. Players in different positions differed significantly in height and all three somatotype components, but no significant differences were found in body mass, body mass index or measured physical performance variables. Players of different performance level differed significantly in both anthropometric and physical performance variables. Generally, middle blockers were taller, more ectomorphic, less mesomorphic and <b>endomorphic,</b> whereas liberos were shorter, less ectomorphic, more mesomorphic and <b>endomorphic</b> than players in other positions.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{whether there is an}} association between a player's physique and injuries incurred while playing rugby football. METHODS: A cohort study was carried out involving all senior rugby clubs in the Scottish Borders during the 1993 - 1994 rugby season. Somatotype estimates were determined for 1152 (95 %) of the 1216 eligible players. Body mass index (BMI), chest to waist ratio, and the ponderal index (PI) were used to classify players' physique as <b>endomorphic</b> (obese), mesomorphic (muscular), and ectomorphic (linear). RESULTS: A strong association was found between physique and age (chi 2 test: chi 2 = 317. 2, df = 10, P < 0. 0001). More younger players were ectomorphs. Older players were more often <b>endomorphic.</b> The physiques of forwards and backs were significantly different (chi 2 test: chi 2 = 58. 6, df = 2, P < 0. 0001), with forwards being of a heavier build than three-quarters, even after adjustment for age. <b>Endomorphic</b> players were more likely than ectomorphs to be injured in a match after adjustment for age (age-adjusted mean BMI for players who were injured in a match was 25. 4 compared with 24. 6 for players who were not injured in a match, P < 0. 0001; adjusted chest to waist ratio means were 1. 136 and 1. 125 respectively, P = 0. 0307; adjusted PI means were 0. 414 and 0. 417 respectively, P = 0. 0056). Increased risk of injury may occur when players play out of position, since one fifth of all injuries occurred in this circumstance. CONCLUSIONS: Further research needs to be conducted using a more objective method of measuring somatotype on a further cohort of players so that the risk of injury for different body types can be examined more closely and related to other potential confounding factors. The level of increased risk for individuals playing out of their usual playing position needs to be established with a greater degree of certainty...|$|E

Somatotype was estimated by the Heath-Carter anthropometric method. Results: significant differences were found in all the variables of the somatotype during the periods studied (p < 0. 01), except for height (p = 0. 176) and humeral breadth in women (p = 0. 067). Important distinctions were also found in the <b>endomorphic,</b> mesomorphic and ectomorphic components (p < 0. 01). Men measurements registered remarkable differences in all the variables (p < 0. 01), with the exception of weight (p = 0. 156), calf breadth (p = 0. 906) and arm breadth in contraction (p = 0. 284). Measurement results of <b>endomorphic</b> (p< 0. 01), ectomorphic (p < 0. 01) and mesomorfic components (p < 0. 05) revealed considerable differences. During the period 1984 - 1985, men classified as balanced mesomorph 2. 7 - 4. 8 - 3. 1 which switched to mesomorph-endomorph 3. 8 - 4. 3 - 2. 5 in the period 2009 - 2010. And the population of women in the 1984 - 1985 period is classified as mesomorph-endomorph 4. 2 - 4. 7 - 2. 1 and changes to a mesomorphic-endomorph biotype 6. 6 - 4. 1 - 1. 3 in the 2009 - 2010. Conclusions: the somatotype of the adolescent population, especially women in Valparaiso, Chile has changed to a predominant <b>endomorphic</b> biotype, and its mesomorphic component has decreased.

The present study was conducted on a sample of 280 healthy Sardinians (134 men and 146 women) of age 60 – 89 years, subdivided into three age classes (60 – 69 years; 70 – 79 years; and 80 – 89 years). Somatotypes were computed according to Carter and Heath (Somatotyping—Development and Applications. Cambridge,England:CambridgeUniversityPress; 1990). The results showa dominance of the endo- and mesomorphic components in the elderly subjects, with less development of ectomorphy than in younger individuals. In a comparison with other populations, our sample shows strong development of endomorphy and especially of mesomorphy, while ectomorphy values are generally low. Age-related variations are significant in both sexes and consist in a progressive reduction of the <b>endomorphic</b> component, particularly in the 80 – 89 -year class (endomorphy in the three age classes: 6. 4, 6. 1, and 5. 3 inmen; 8. 1, 7. 8, and 6. 8 in women).

The aim {{of the study was to}} compare anthropometrical variables in male and female judoka from Spanish National Teams. Material and Methods: Eighty-seven national level Spanish judoka from all seven weight categories took part in this study: females (n = 46) ??? cadet (n = 16), junior (n = 12) and senior (n = 18); males (n = 44) ??? cadet (n = 18), junior (n = 15) and senior (n = 8). Body mass, height, skinfold thickness, circumferences and breadth anthropometric measurements were carried out. Somatotype components, body mass index, body fat and muscle mass were also estimated. A two way (gender and age groups) analysis of variance and Tukey test were used to compare groups. Results: (1) males were heavier, taller, had lower body fat and higher muscle mass absolute and relative values, circumferences and bone diameters, lower <b>endomorphic</b> and higher mesomorphic components than females; (2) for skinfold thickness males presented lower values in limbs??? sites than females, but no difference was found in trunk skinfold thicknesses; (3) few differences were found among age categories, with cadets presenting smaller flexed arm circumference and humerus epicondyle bone breadth compared to junior and seniors, and lower absolute muscle mass compared to seniors; (4) tendency for reducing sexual dimorphism in some anthropological dimensions and in <b>endomorphic</b> and mesomorphic components was observed across age categories.

Somatotypes were determined using Heath-Carter’s method. <b>Endomorphic,</b> mesomorphic and ectomorphic components were calculated by computer on the basis of formulas. In order to determine differences in the body composition and anthropometric data of the subjects playing in different positions, a one-way analysis of variance was employed. The results show that on average the wings differ the most from the other player groups in terms of their morphological body characteristics. The values of their body height, body mass and the quantity of subcutaneous fat are statistically significantly lower than those of players in the other groups. Goalkeepers are relatively tall, with high values of body mass and low values of transversal measures. Their skin folds are the most pronounced among all groups on average and their share of subcutaneous fat in total body mass is the highest. Consequently, their <b>endomorphic</b> component of the somatotype is pronounced. Pivots and back players are becoming increasingly similar in terms of their morphological body characteristics. Pivots maintain greater robustness, have a higher quantity of muscle mass as well as more pronounced transversal measures and a mesomorphic component of the somatotype. The results of our study confirm that groups of handball players occupying different positions differ amongst themselves in terms of many measurements. This is a result of specific requirements of handball play which are to be fulfilled by players...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between energy value and nutrients intake {{and the body}} shape and size parameters (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences) has become an interesting research area for nutritionists and dieticians. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the {{relationship between}} the body shape and size parameters (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences), somatotype (according to the Rohrer (RI) index) and energy value and nutrients intake of women. The study was conducted in 2014 and 2016 on 148 female volunteers aged 57 - 88 from the Mazovian and Lublin province (Poland). Sample selection was targeted at elderly people with different body types. The exclusion criteria were: multi-organ failure, cancer and disability. Then among the subjects, a survey was conducted, that included demographic data, lifestyle, health status and vitamins and minerals supplements use. Food intake has been assessed using a 3 -day dietary food records. The somatotype was determined using the RI with the Curtis key, classifying the subjects as ectomorphic (n= 30), mesomorphic (n= 31) and <b>endomorphic</b> (n= 87). The somatotype was significantly related to place of residence, physical activity, waist and hip circumference, WHR and BMI index, total protein intake, animal protein intake, vitamin E intake (p≤ 0. 05) and to fat, phosphorus and thiamine intake (p≤ 0. 1). The obtained results showed that the place of residence, physical activity, chronic diseases, the use of specialized diet, body weight fluctuations, BMI and WHR were different depending on the somatotype in the examined group of women. <b>Endomorphic</b> subjects had significantly greater waist and hip circumference and diastolic blood pressure compared to the other somatotypes. The somatotype had only a significant effect on total protein, animal protein and vitamin E intake, and ectomorphic elderly women may be particularly susceptible to nutrient deficiencies. Due to the risk of macronutrient, vitamin and mineral deficiencies in the diets of the examined women, it seems necessary to educate this group as well as caregivers and doctors in the area of nutrition adapted to the needs of the elderly...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyse the {{somatotype}} and body composition characteristics of female basketball players and {{to demonstrate the}} changes between different category levels. For this purpose 37 female basketball players were subjected from Et-Balik Sports Club representing 4 different categories. 11 anthropometric measurements; body weight, height, humerus and femur bicondylar breadth, biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and thigh skinfold thickness, biceps and thigh circumference data were collected according to the International Biological Programme (IBP) and International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK). The {{mean age of the}} subjects were 13. 84 + 4. 34 (year) where weight 55. 4 + 15. 7 (kg) and height 162. 2 + 11. 6 (cm). Study results showed gradual increase tendency in body fat pattern through categories. Subsequently body somatotypes were differed between categories as well. As a general tendency the somatotype characteristics of the subjects were found to be <b>endomorphic</b> mesomorph...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} associations among body dissatisfaction, behaviors, feelings, and beliefs {{related to the}} body - and somatotypical profile. The sample included 142 undergraduate female students (21. 81 ± 3 years) who underwent to assessment of Body Mass Index and somatotype, according to the World Health Organization and Heath-Carter protocols, respectively. To assess body image the following instruments were applied: Body Shape Questionnaire, Body Attitudes Questionnaire, Body Image Avoidance Questionnaire, Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Scale, Self-Subject Silhouettes To the analysis data we proceeded to {{multivariate analysis of variance}} (MANOVA one-way). As the main result, we find that body dissatisfaction, body avoidance and negative attitudes about appearance components are linked to each other and they are influenced by body profiles with mesomorphic and <b>endomorphic</b> predominance. We conclude that the somatotype profile can be an important predictor of changes in body image and is indicated for tracking risk groups...|$|E
