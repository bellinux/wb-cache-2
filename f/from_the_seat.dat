5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W.

5|$|In 1760, Pombal {{arranged}} for Dom Pedro {{to marry the}} king's unstable daughter Maria, the heiress to the throne. Pombal encouraged the couple {{to live with their}} children in the unfinished palace at Queluz, away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of government. It had always been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their principal home before Maria's accession. Further enlargements were made to reflect the palace's elevation from country retreat to royal palace. However, Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and, as a ruling monarch, she did not have time to while away her hours in the country. Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious matters.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha {{gains in}} the north were undone because of the {{contradictory}} policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in {{the family of the}} Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. Raghunathrao was ousted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort.|$|E

5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down and away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and {{made it possible to}} fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E

25|$|Rosh Hashanah. Because {{of holiday}} {{restrictions}} on travel, messengers {{could not even}} leave {{the seat of the}} Sanhedrin until the holiday was over.

25|$|In 1953, the WD-45 was introduced, {{replacing}} the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the drawbar at the Nebraska Tests. This was {{almost double the}} horsepower of the WD. A new Allis chalmers designed Snap- Coupler hitch was used. It allowed the operator to hook up to an implement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> of the tractor. A Buda diesel-powered WD-45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D-series in 1957.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiplash}} injury from {{an automobile}} accident is called a cervical acceleration–deceleration injury. Cadaver {{studies have shown that}} as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a kyphosis while the upper cervical spine maintains its lordosis. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, {{an attempt}} was mounted to {{intercept}} two Cuban FAR MiG-23MLs. Captain Arthur Piercy's F1CZ was damaged by either an AA-7 Apex or AA-8 Aphid AAM fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft's drag chute and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy {{was able to}} recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy's ejection seat to fire; he failed to separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and suffered major spinal injuries.|$|E

25|$|Seat-edge {{pressure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> on {{an airplane}} on the popliteal area may contribute to vessel wall damage as well as venous stasis. Coagulation activation may result from an interaction between cabin conditions (such as hypobaric hypoxia) and individual risk factors {{for the formation of}} blood clots. Studies of the pathophysiologic mechanisms for the increased risk of Venous thrombosis embolism or VTE after long-distance travel have not produced consistent results, but venous stasis appears to play a major role; other factors specific to air travel may increase coagulation activation, particularly in passengers with individual risk factors for VTE.|$|E
25|$|The {{ejection}} seat was the Raketstol 37 (literally; Rocket chair 37) {{and was the}} last Saab designed seat in service. A derivative of the Saab 105 trainer seat, the seat was optimized for low altitude, high speed ejections. Once activated by the pilot via triggers built into the armrests (on twin-seat models, the occupant of the forward cockpit position is able to initiate the ejection of both seats), the ejection sequence is automated, including {{the removal of the}} canopy; {{in the event of a}} malfunction, a reserve trigger can be activated. A combined parachute and seat harness is used, which features a barometric interlock to appropriately release the occupant and harness <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> during the ejection sequence, a manual override handle is also provided for this function.|$|E
25|$|As 2005 began, Rosselló {{became a}} Senator for the Arecibo {{district}} after Senator Víctor Loubriel resigned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> to which he'd been elected, effectively gaining a seat {{for which he}} did not run. Thus started a struggle between Senate President Kenneth McClintock and Rosselló for control of the Senate Presidency. The dispute ended in a stalemate as McClintock refused to leave the position, a stance respected by the PDP minority senators and five other NPP senators. This led to the expulsion from the party of McClintock as well as two of the NPP senators who backed him, a matter which led McClintock to file suit in San Juan Superior Court, winning the case, which was confirmed by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court in a 5-1 ruling. The infighting ended when Rosselló was defeated in the 2008 primary and when McClintock co-chaired Sen. Hillary Clinton's successful Democratic primary campaign and helped lead her to a record-setting 68-32% victory in the waning days of her bid for the Democratic nomination.|$|E

500|$|On {{the fifth}} day after the Persian arrival at Thermopylae and {{the first day of}} the battle, Xerxes finally {{resolved}} to attack the Greeks. First, he ordered 5,000 archers to fire a barrage of arrows, but they were ineffective; they fired from at least 100 yards away, according to modern day scholars, and the Greeks' bronze shields and helmets deflected the arrows. After that, Xerxes sent a force of 10,000 Medes and Cissians to take the defenders prisoner and bring them before him. The Persians soon launched a frontal assault, in waves of around 10,000 men, on the Greek position. The Greeks fought in front of the Phocian wall, at the narrowest part of the pass, which enabled them to use as few soldiers as possible. Details of the tactics are scant; Diodorus says, [...] "the men stood shoulder to shoulder", and the Greeks were [...] "superior in valor and in the great size of their shields." [...] This probably describes the standard Greek phalanx, in which the men formed a wall of overlapping shields and layered spear points protruding out from the sides of the shields, which would have been highly effective as long as it spanned the width of the pass. The weaker shields, and shorter spears and swords of the Persians prevented them from effectively engaging the Greek hoplites. Herodotus says that the units for each city were kept together; units were rotated in and out of the battle to prevent fatigue, which implies the Greeks had more men than necessary to block the pass. The Greeks killed so many Medes that Xerxes is said to have stood up three times <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> from which he was watching the battle. According to Ctesias, the first wave was [...] "cut to ribbons", with only two or three Spartans killed in return.|$|E
