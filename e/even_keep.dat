Exercise time for each prisoner was synchronized so no two prisoners {{next to each}} other would be out at the same time. Prisoners were allowed to garden and <b>even</b> <b>keep</b> pets in their exercise yards. When a prisoner left his cell, an accompanying guard would wrap a hood over his head to prevent him from being recognized by other prisoners.|$|E
25|$|During the 1997–98 NBA season, the Timberwolves and Garnett {{agreed on}} a six-year {{contract}} extension that was worth an unparalleled $126 million. The contract was considered a risky move and many analysts speculated that the deal would {{make it impossible for}} the Wolves to sign new players or <b>even</b> <b>keep</b> their own. The enormous size of Garnett's contract was considered, by numerous sports writers, a major cause of labor tensions between players and owners that led to a lockout which shortened the 1998–99 NBA season. Despite the furor over his new contract, Garnett continued to improve, averaging 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.7 steals per game. Again, he was an All-Star, and the Timberwolves finished with their first winning record in franchise history (45–37 for the season). For the second consecutive year, the young Timberwolves bowed out of the playoffs in the first round, this time losing 3–2 to the Seattle SuperSonics and superstar point guard Gary Payton. The two wins against the Sonics marked the Wolves' first-ever playoff game wins. The off-season started poorly for the Timberwolves though as 20-point per game scorer Tom Gugliotta left for the Phoenix Suns.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of this largesse and government intervention eventually put Louis in severe financial straits. His entrusting of his finances to former manager Mike Jacobs haunted him. After the $500,000 IRS tax bill was assessed, with interest accumulating every year, {{the need for}} cash precipitated Louis's post-retirement comeback. Even though his comeback earned him significant purses, the incremental tax rate {{in place at the}} time (90%) meant that these boxing proceeds did not <b>even</b> <b>keep</b> pace with interest on Louis's tax debt. As a result, {{by the end of the}} 1950s, he owed over $1 million in taxes and interest. In 1953, when Louis's mother died, the IRS appropriated the $667 she had willed to Louis. To bring in money, Louis engaged in numerous activities outside the ring. He appeared on various quiz shows, and an old Army buddy, Ash Resnick, gave Louis a job greeting tourists to the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, where Resnick was an executive. For income, Louis even became a professional wrestler. He made his professional wrestling debut on March 16, 1956 in Washington, D.C., defeating Cowboy Rocky Lee. After defeating Lee in a few matches, Louis discovered he had a heart ailment and retired from wrestling competition. However, he continued as a wrestling referee until 1972.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} as an American envoy to France, Benjamin Franklin, {{publisher}} of the old English proverb [...] "Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise", anonymously published a letter suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight. This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not <b>even</b> <b>keep</b> precise schedules. However, this soon changed as rail transport and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.|$|E

2500|$|Kastner's {{critics also}} argue that he promised the SS not to warn Hungarian Jews to avoid {{jeopardizing}} negotiations to save the Jews who escaped on the Kastner train. In 1960, an interview with Eichmann, made by the Dutch Nazi journalist Willem Sassen in Argentina, was published in Life Magazine. Eichmann said that Kastner [...] "agreed {{to help keep the}} Jews from resisting deportation—and <b>even</b> <b>keep</b> order in the collection camps—if I would close my eyes and let a few hundred or a few thousand young Jews emigrate to Palestine. It was a good bargain". Rudolf Vrba wrote, [...] "Kastner paid for those 1,684 lives with his silence".|$|E
2500|$|Terrell, like John Henry Baker, {{a quarter}} of a century earlier, promised to work to abolish the [...] "useless" [...] office. And she managed to do so in her {{four-year}} term, for Terrell was the only woman elections commissioner, the only Republican elections commissioner, and the last of the three elected commissioners in Louisiana history. A political commentator, Alan Ehrenhalt, hailed Terrell's steps to abolish the office, which he dubbed the [...] "most ridiculous elective office in the history of state government." [...] The commissioner of elections did not <b>even</b> <b>keep</b> the tabulation of election returns: that function remains within the duties of the secretary of state, which operates a website with returns dating from 1987 and partial tabulations between 1983 and 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Moreton {{appears to}} be quite clever in {{tackling}} this issue. He starts asking for a state surveillance of the soldiers' quarters (to be maintained even after the war), with [...] "surveyors that should call at the quarters of every soldier or sailor at a limited hour, {{to see if they}} are there or no, and register them at home or absent accordingly; absence to be penal", and then he progressively moves into employing them in his own project. To keep the streets free of highway robbers and footpads he proposes that soldiers on horses and on foot might be employed to patrol the streets and the surroundings of the city, and also to keep records of the convoys leaving and arriving. The additional wage for the performance of this service might <b>even</b> <b>keep</b> them from starting a criminal career.|$|E

Initially, he denied making the statement, but later changed his story in a VH1 Behind the Music special on Pantera, claiming that the comment had been lighthearted and made off the record.
