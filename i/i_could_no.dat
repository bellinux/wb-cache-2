"I had to {{find myself}} another {{flagship}} because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer exercise command from one which was shot to pieces...A torpedo boat was called alongside and we changed under heavy fire... drove my torpedoboat hoping to find an advantageous moment to board one of [...] These 1½ hours that I spent in a hail of shell and splinters aboard the torpedoboat I shall not be likely to forget." ...|$|E
500|$|After the loss, {{there were}} calls for Playford {{to be offered}} the post of Governor of South Australia or Governor-General of Australia, but nothing came of that. Playford {{continued}} to lead the LCL opposition for a further {{one and a half}} years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, Steele Hall, a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the Playmander still in place. Contrary to perceptions, Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor, and he did not publicly hint at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot; there was speculation that the former premier may have been one of those who abstained from the vote. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that [...] "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... I found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... I decided I couldn't take it any longer".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all of that stuff - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> get <b>no</b> {{farther than}} that. He cut me short there, without ceremony.|$|R

2500|$|He {{found the}} drug to {{be a boon to}} his creativity: “y pen glanced {{presently}} like lightning in the effort to keep neck and neck with my ideas,” he writes at one point, although, “t last, thought ran with such terrific speed that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer write at all.” ...|$|E

I {{meant that}} the Communist Party and the whole {{communist}} movement was changing its character, and in 1945, when I was kicked out, the parting of the ways had come, and if I hadn't been kicked out I {{would have had the}} difficult task of disengaging myself from a movement that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer agree with and no longer help." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 24, 2011, Jobs {{announced}} his resignation as Apple's CEO, {{writing to the}} board, [...] "I have always said if there ever came a day when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I {{would be the first}} to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come." [...] Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO. Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.|$|E
60|$|I did not know, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see <b>no</b> earthly {{reason for}} such feeling.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> add <b>no</b> more. My voice faltered, my eyes {{moistened}} {{in spite}} of me.|$|R
60|$|I had {{no answer}} to that. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say <b>no</b> more than I had said already.|$|R
2500|$|Lewis later {{revealed}} that her departure from Syco had come after [...] "several years" [...] of consideration. She {{also stated that}} when she expressed her desire to part with the label, she was threatened with the public being told {{that she had been}} dropped instead of parting amicably. However, further creative differences in relation to her fifth studio album finally caused Lewis to leave the label. Of her departure, she stated, [...] "I was asked to make a record {{that would not have been}} true to myself. By all means as an artist in this climate, I was thankful to even get the chance to make another record. But I cannot make music that does not speak to my soul, and as scary as it seemed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer compromise myself, and so I decided to leave".|$|E
2500|$|... “I tied {{a string}} (tied to the wire) to Smoky's collar {{and ran to}} the other end of the culvert [...] [...] [...] (Smoky) made a few steps in and then ran back. [...] `Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again. [...] When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up and she looked over her {{shoulder}} as much as to say `what's holding us up there?' [...] The string loosened from the snag and she came on again. [...] By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer see her. [...] I called and pleaded, not knowing for certain whether she was coming or not. [...] At last, about 20 feet away, I saw two little amber eyes and heard a faint whimpering sound [...] [...] [...] at 15 feet away, she broke into a run. [...] We were so happy at Smoky's success that we patted and praised her for a full five minutes.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> more {{believe it}} of her than I could have {{believed}} it of myself.|$|E
60|$|Since <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make <b>no</b> more of her, I was fain to {{be content}} with this.|$|R
60|$|She looked up, and {{our eyes}} met. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> detect <b>no</b> trace of {{forgiveness}} in hers.|$|R
60|$|Try as <b>I</b> might, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get <b>no</b> {{more than}} that out of our stupid young housemaid.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned a}} little {{away from the}} man while these {{thoughts}} engaged me; for, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> more refrain from tears than he.|$|E
60|$|Then I was confused, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer {{deny the}} truth, {{and not having}} one word to say, I sighed from my heart.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could not}} equivocate with this woman, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> more lie to her sorrow {{than to the}} Judgment. Why had I not {{foreseen}} her question? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> do <b>no</b> {{more than}} stare at him. It {{seemed as if}} my mind were {{stricken}} numb.|$|R
60|$|I {{was so much}} {{surprised}} at this, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find <b>no</b> voice to answer, but stood staring.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> make <b>no</b> {{reply to}} these words, which fell on me like whip-strokes; {{and looking at}} the other faces, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see <b>no</b> sympathy in them for me; as they looked at her--their mother--and listened to her words, the {{expression}} they wore was love and devotion to her only, reminding me a little of the angel faces on Guide's canvas of the [...] "Coronation of the Virgin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} if courage is needed," [...] Kit replied, forcing a smile. [...] "It looks as if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer meddle with politics." ...|$|E

60|$|Then for {{the first}} time I {{realized}} how nearly I had been overcome. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer stand, and swooning, sank in a heap to the ground.|$|E
60|$|I {{paused at}} the same moment, feeling that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> venture <b>no</b> further without the risk of {{offending}} him.|$|R
60|$|At last, after a minnit or two, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> contane <b>no</b> longer, {{and bust}} {{out in a}} horse laff.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get {{a chance}} at him," [...] I muttered, for even in this solemn moment <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{cultivate}} <b>no</b> Christian spirit towards Imbozwi.|$|R
6000|$|Ferd. Did I not love, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> more endure [...] This undeserved captivity, than I [...] Could wish to gain my freedom, {{with the}} loss [...] Of you.|$|E
