2500|$|The union {{adopted a}} number of {{policies}} early on which were, at the time, considered militant and/or leftist (even communist). Although initially the union had a no-strike policy, it soon rescinded this {{in favor of the}} right of public employees to walk off the job. It proposed a collective bargaining law for federal public employees modeled on the National Labor Relations Act, and in 1949 began supporting legislation (the Rhodes-Johnston bill) which would implement such a system. Founded at the end of World War II, the union promoted policies designed to minimize the impact of <b>economic</b> <b>conversion</b> on women, African Americans, and other minorities. It also adopted a resolution applauding the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, which nearly led to an investigation of the union by the Civil Service Commission. These won the union significant support from leftists in the entertainment industry. [...] Actor and singer Paul Robeson and classical pianist Ray Lev both played concerts which benefitted the union, and novelists Dashiell Hammett, Howard Fast, and others spoke at union rallies about being persecuted for their leftist political beliefs. The union, in turn, helped its allies. Secretary-Treasurer Ewart Guinier managed Henry A. Wallace's 1948 presidential campaign in New York City.|$|E

50|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>conversion,</b> defence conversion, or arms conversion, is a technical, {{economic}} and political process for moving from military to civilian markets. <b>Economic</b> <b>conversion</b> takes place on several levels and {{can be applied to}} different organizations. In terms of levels (roughly corresponding to geographic scales), conversion can take place at the level of new innovation projects, divisions within multi-divisional firms, companies, and national economies. In terms of objects, conversion can govern workers (i.e. retraining), firms (in terms of workers, capital, facilities and real estate) and land (in terms of real estate). Some of these scales obviously overlap. Organizations that can be converted include defense firms, military bases, and defense laboratories.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} {{risks associated}} with the transition from planned to market economies in {{the countries of the}} FSU are the subject of the contribution. There are severe problems of conversion for the oversized military establishment and its related industries. Their solution demands significant financial resources which may only be generated from the sale of weapons and of military and dual use technology. At the same time, the competition on the world s weapon markets tends to reduce the revenue from sales, calling for even more weapons to de sold and, accelerating arms proliferation to regions with high conflict potential. Thus, for the transition period it is recommended a limited and controlled conversion and the establishment of protected weapon markets for the FSU under international supervision. To this end, new organizational forms of international cooperation must be developed. Transition, Stability, Russia, <b>Economic,</b> Military, <b>Conversion...</b>|$|R
