The ICs, from Fairchild Semiconductor, were implemented using resistor-transistor logic (RTL) in a flat-pack.

25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and <b>diode</b> <b>logic</b> for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of recent papers we {{demonstrated}} that coupled electromechanical effects can lead to pronounced contributions in band structure calculations of low dimensional semiconductor nanostructures LDSNs such as quantum dots QDs, wires, and even wells. Some such effects are essentially nonlinear. Both strain and piezoelectric effects {{have been used as}} tuning parameters for the optical response of LDSNs in photonics, band gap engineering, and other applications. However, the influence of spin orbit effects in presence of external magnetic field on single and vertically coupled QD has been largely neglected in the literature. The electron spin splitting terms which are coupled to the magnetic field through the Pauli spin matrix in these QDs become important in the design of optoelectronic devices as well as in tailoring properties of QDs in other applications areas. At the same time, single and vertically stacked QDs are coupled with electromagnetic and mechanical fields which become increasingly important in many applications of LDSN-based systems, in particular, where spin splitting energy is important. These externally applied electric and magnetic fields as well as the separation between the vertically coupled QDs can be used as tuning parameters. Indeed, as electromagnetic and elastic effects are often significant in LDSNs, it is reasonable to expect that the externally applied magnetic fields oriented along a direction perpendicular to the plane of two-dimensional electron gas in the QDs may also be used as a tuning parameter in the application of light emitting <b>diodes,</b> <b>logic</b> devices, for example, OR gates, AND gates and others. In this paper, by using the fully coupled model of electroelasticity, we analyze the influence of these effects on optoelectronic properties of QDs.

40|$|Soft {{structures}} with rationally designed architectures {{capable of}} large, nonlinear deformation present opportunities for unprecedented, highly tunable devices and machines. However, the highly dissipative nature of soft materials intrinsically limits or prevents certain functions, {{such as the}} propagation of mechanical signals. Here we present an architected soft system composed of elastomeric bistable beam elements connected by elastomeric linear springs. The dissipative nature of the polymer readily damps linear waves, preventing propagation of any mechanical signal beyond a short distance, as expected. However, the unique architecture of the system enables propagation of stable, nonlinear solitary transition waves with constant, controllable velocity and pulse geometry over arbitrary distances. Because the high damping of the material removes all other linear, small-amplitude excitations, the desired pulse propagates with high fidelity and controllability.

A large number of synthetic methods such as solvothermal, hydrothermal [5, 6] and sonochemical process [7], microwave heating [8] and solution-based chemical methods [9] provide effective routes to prepare semiconductor nanoparticles. For nanoparticles prepared by solution-based chemical methods, a capping agent, which adsorbs on to the nanoparticle surface, is generally added both to control the size of the nanoparticles and to prevent agglomeration of the synthesized particles. These adsorbents have been shown to alter the electronic structure of the nanoparticles [10, 11].|$|R
50|$|Scientist also {{devised a}} large number of {{nanowire}} compositions with controlled length, diameter, doping, and surface structure by using vapor and solution phase strategies. These oriented single crystals are being used in semiconductor nanowire devices such as <b>diodes,</b> transistors, <b>logic</b> circuits, lasers and sensors. Since nanowires have one dimensional structure meaning large surface to volume ratio, the diffusion resistance decreases. In addition, their efficiency in electron transport which is due to the quantum confinement effect, make their electrical properties be influenced by minor perturbation. Therefore, use of these nanowires in nanosensor elements increases the sensitivity in electrode response. As mentioned above, one dimensionality and chemical flexibility of the semiconductor nanowires make them applicable in nanolasers. Peidong Yang and his co-workers have done some research on room-temperature ultraviolet nanowire nanolasers in which the significant properties of these nanolasers have been mentioned.

5000|$|During the 1960s {{the use of}} tunnel diodes in logic {{circuits}} was an active research topic. When compared to transistor logic gates of the time, the tunnel diode offered much higher speeds. Unlike other diode types, the tunnel diode offered the possibility of amplification of signals at each stage. The operating principles of a tunnel <b>diode</b> <b>logic</b> rely on biasing of the tunnel diode and supply of current from inputs over a threshold current, to switch the diode between two states. Consequently, tunnel <b>diode</b> <b>logic</b> circuits required a means to reset the diode after each logical operation. A simple tunnel diode gate offered little isolation between inputs and outputs and had low fan in and fan out.
