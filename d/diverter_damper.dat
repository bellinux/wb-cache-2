40|$|The heat {{recovery}} boiler system uses {{the heat of}} the flue gas from the gas turbine exhaust to produce steam for the steam turbine and to heat up the main condensate which is collected in the feedwater tank. The gas turbine exhaust gas first flows horizontally through an exhaust gas diffuser, the <b>diverter</b> <b>damper</b> and the exhaust gas duct. After being deflected at the boiler inlet, the exhaust gas flows through the vertical part of the boiler which houses the heating surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Performance analysis, {{optimization}} {{and environmental}} load assessment of an absorption system requires accurate but simplified models. The {{objective of the}} present study is to develop such models based on non-dimensional parameters (part load ratio, part-load factor and <b>diverter</b> <b>damper</b> position) and ordinary least squares. Since for the case study, the hourly, daily and monthly load demands data are available, the method of averaging over eight years is considered. The models are developed for a system comprised of two heat recovery steam generators and two steam absorption chillers. It was observed that the proposed method is effective in providing better picture of the relationships between the supplied heat and the amount of energy recovered by each subsystem. The maximum cooling load experienced by the two chillers was about 2392 RT, which is 4. 32 % lower than the design capacity. The steam generators were found operating at part load ratio of about 0. 41 only. Both chillers deteriorated in performance within the study period. This was confirmed by the part load ratio of 0. 8 and steam consumption higher than that required for a new chiller. A generalized model was also identified for the two chillers with the correlation coefficient (R 2), chi-square (χ 2) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) equals to 0. 9996, 1. 9765 e- 5 and 0. 0044, respectively. The model was found accurate for cooling water temperatures in the range of 29 to 32 °C...|$|E
