5|$|Helmholtz <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> the {{oscillation}} decayed {{but he had}} not <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> {{it occurred}} in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{over the}} WWE United States Championship began when Booker T, Orlando Jordan, and Christian each <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> {{they thought they}} {{deserved}} a title match against the champion, Chris Benoit. Theodore Long, SmackDown!'s on-screen general manager/authority figure, then announced that Benoit could choose who he wanted to face for the title. After Jordan won a standard wrestling match between three wrestlers, also involving Booker and Christian, Benoit {{decided that he would}} face all three men in a match between the four at No Mercy.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Carlo, {{the remains}} of De Mauro were buried under a bridge over the Oreto river near Palermo. However, the police, after a search, did not find the body. The pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia later <b>explained</b> <b>why.</b> He had been ordered by Bontade in 1977 or 1978 to dig up several bodies at the bridge and {{dissolve}} them in acid. According to the new testimony of the pentito Naimo, De Mauro {{was taken to a}} terrain in Pallavicino neighbourhood in Palermo where the Mafia boss Francesco Madonia owned a chicken farm. He was killed there and dumped in a pit.|$|E
50|$|The {{strengths}} of the polar gating hypothesis are that it <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> conductivity requires a critical thickness of four unit cells of LaAlO3 and that it <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> conductivity requires the SrTiO3 to be TiO2-terminated. The polar gating hypothesis also <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> alloying the LaAlO3 increases the critical thickness for conductivity.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{philosophers}} (one being John Broome) view normative {{reasons as}} the same as [...] "explanations of ought facts". Just as explanatory reasons <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> some descriptive fact obtains (or came to obtain), normative reasons on this view <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> some normative facts obtain, i.e., they <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> some state of affairs ought to come to obtain (e.g., why someone should act or why some event ought to take place).|$|R
50|$|The {{essential}} {{problem is}} that tools <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> firm A performs better than firm B {{at a point in}} time are unlikely to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> firm B is growing its performance more rapidly than firm A.|$|R
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal {{standard}} referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most common}} {{radiation}} sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma radiation, but {{large amounts of}} alpha particles which do not penetrate even {{a sheet of paper}} or the epidermis of human skin, and is therefore invisible to normal radiation detectors. This <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing radiation which can cause radiation damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon. Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.|$|E
5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
5000|$|Content theory <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> {{human needs}} change with time. Content theory {{includes}} {{the work of}} David McClelland, Abraham Maslow and other psychologists as they attempted to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> human needs change, but not how they change.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not clear}} how the ridge formed. One {{difficulty}} is to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.|$|R
5000|$|Rosenthal is {{currently}} working on function of mental states' being conscious, which he argues is minimal, and on <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> mental states do ever occur consciously if little utility results from their being conscious. He argues that the factors that <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> qualitative states, such as perceptions, often occur consciously are different from the considerations that <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> thoughts and other intentional states often occur consciously. He gave this talk, 'Consciousness and its Function' at the Online Consciousness Conference ...|$|R
5|$|After the FBI {{finds out}} that they believe Michael {{is going to try}} and break Sara out of prison they contact Mahone. Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them {{credible}} information that leads to proof of Michael's plans. Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone. Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage. Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> he sacrificed himself for Sara.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E

25|$|Chronic {{symptoms}} from an {{autoimmune reaction}} could <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> some symptoms persist {{even after the}} spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever, but its wider application is controversial.|$|R

40|$|Two {{years ago}} four paediatricians and an ethicist {{submitted}} to the BMJ a case study as an ethical debate which the BMJ decided not to publish because the authors had not obtained {{the consent of the}} patient’s parents for publication. The authors submitted it elsewhere, and the article was published last year. Here the authors <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they think the BMJ should have published despite the lack of consent; the editor of the journal that did publish the case study <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> he did so (doi: 10. 1136 /bmj. a 1233); and two members of the BMJ’s ethics committee <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they recommended not to publish it (doi: 10. 1136 /bmj. a 1232). An accompanying editorial <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> English law would now not allow the BMJ to publish it without consent, even if we thought it reasonable to do so...|$|R
25|$|This {{discussion}} {{is not a}} full explanation of Benford's law, because we have not <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> we so often come across data-sets that, when plotted as a probability distribution of the logarithm of the variable, are relatively uniform over several orders of magnitude.|$|E

25|$|Nigerian AAIB {{examined}} both engines' {{fuel system}} components.

These fractures caused fuel leak which <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> the engines went unresponsive even when the crew applied throttle movements on the lever.|$|E
25|$|In 1843, James Joule {{experimentally}} {{found the}} mechanical equivalent of heat. In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving {{the use of}} a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of conservation of energy and <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> heat can do work.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{maintaining}} with Aristotle, Montesquieu, {{and others}} that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure {{the rule of the}} best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished the US and determined its mores and values also <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> the US masses held elites in such contempt.|$|E
