Nine villages in Mae Hong Son province were selected for the present study (three villages for control and three villages each for <b>insecticide</b> <b>spray).</b> The residual spray of Bifenthrin (25 mg/m 2) showed greater adulticiding effects on An. minimus s. l. population than Deltamethrin (20 mg/m 2). In Bifenthrin treated villages, a clear decrease in biting density of An. minimus s. l. was found in human bait collection as well as animal bait collection after the <b>insecticide</b> <b>spray.</b> In all of the three villages, the average density after <b>insecticide</b> <b>spray</b> was significantly lower than that observed before the spray. The effects of Deltamethrin on An. minimus s. l. density was found only in one village out of the three treated villages. A significant decrease in parous rate after <b>insecticide</b> <b>spray</b> was found in all the villages sprayed with Bifenthrin, whereas no significant changes were observed in control villages. The average parous rate in the villages treated with Deltamethrin became significantly higher after the <b>insecticide</b> <b>spray.</b> These results clearly suggested that the residual spray of Bifenthrin (25 mg/m 2) was more effective than Deltamethrin (20 mg/m 2) ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the association between residential insecticide use during pregnancy and infancy, and the development of children. Study subjects were participants in the INMA (Environment and Childhood) Project, a Spanish multicenter birth cohort study. Prenatal and postnatal use of indoor insecticides and other variables were obtained from personal interview during pregnancy and infancy. Mental and psychomotor development was assessed around 14 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The associations were analyzed by linear regression models. 54 % of women used indoor insecticides at home during pregnancy and 47 % postnatally. 34 % of women used <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> and 33 % used plug-in devices during pregnancy. During infancy, the percentage of women who used <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> decreased (22 %), but the use of plug-in devices was similar to the prenatal period (32 %).

40|$|<b>Insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> {{registered}} {{for the control}} of maize stem borers are all intended for whorl application. Chemical control of these pests is complicated by their cryptic feeding habit inside plant whorls. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether addition of the organosilicone adjuvant, Break-Thru S 240, to <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> would result in improved stem borer control. In one experiment the position of stem borer feeding damage inside plant whorls was quantified to have a standard for comparison and evaluation of the effective distances of downwards movement of spray applications into whorls. The distance of movement of spray applications at five adjuvant rates (50, 100, 200, 400 & 600 ml ha- 1) into whorl leaves was determined. A colorant was added to spray applications to facilitate measuring the distances of downwards movement of water into each whorl leaf. A 14 % increase in downwards movement of sprays into the target zone was observed with addition of the adjuvant.

40|$|A {{two year}} study was {{conducted}} from 2000 - 2002 {{to evaluate the use}} of overhead sprinkler irrigation for suppressing thrips populations in romaine lettuce. Specifically we looked at how the duration and frequency of sprinkler irrigation use reduced adult and larval populations following various irrigation applications employed specifically for thrips suppression. We also evaluated combinations of <b>insecticide</b> <b>spray</b> regimes, used in association with sprinkler irrigation runs, for suppressing thrips populations in both fall and spring seasons. The results of the study demonstrated that overhead sprinkler irrigation has the ability to suppress thrips populations in romaine lettuce. At best, we experienced about 50 % population reduction using only sprinkler irrigation compared with the untreated control during these trials. Sprinkler ruins of durations of > 4 hrs and more than 4 cm of water appeared to provide the minimal necessary for suppression. Furthermore, sprinkle runs of 2 or 3 times weekly appeared to provide the most consistent suppression. In contrast, <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> consistently provided > 80 % suppression and provided higher yielding and better quality lettuce than sprinklers. The use of sprinkler irrigation, in addition to <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> did not significantly improve thrips suppression or yields.

50|$|Two {{trials in}} Northern Nigeria {{combined}} multiple rounds of MDA and <b>insecticide</b> <b>spraying.</b> The first trial, in Kankiya, included 11 rounds of MDA combined with 8 rounds of DDT indoor spraying. The study {{was based on}} computer-aided models that showed that MDA could eradicate malaria {{in the study area}} if combined with an appropriate ‘insecticide attack’. Following MDAs, parasite prevalence dropped from 19% to 1%. The investigators did not consider this a success because parasite prevalence increased again after the interventions were stopped. Entomological indices also showed only a temporary reduction in transmission, which was completely reversed after the control measures ceased. Because the investigators felt that the failure of the trial to interrupt transmission was due to operational inadequacies, they recommended a much larger and more sophisticated evaluation of <b>insecticide</b> <b>spraying</b> combined with MDA. This recommendation helped to launch the Garki project, also in Northern Nigeria, in 1969. In the Garki project, all 164 study villages in the catchment area were sprayed with propoxur, a residual insecticide. In addition, in 60 villages, MDA with sulfalene / pyrimethamine was given at 10-week intervals for two years. In two small village clusters, house spraying was supplemented with larvicide and MDA every two weeks. With biweekly MDA, parasite prevalence fell to 1% in the dry season and to 5% in the rainy season. MDA given every 10 weeks resulted in a parasite prevalence of 2% in the dry season and 28% in the rainy season. Transmission was not interrupted with either MDA regime. The authors concluded that spraying of residual insecticides and MDA did not result in a sustainable interruption of malaria transmission.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a mosquito netting to protect cabbages, Brassica oleracea L., against pests {{was investigated in}} field trials in Benin, West Africa. A polyester net covered the plants at night by using a wood armature. The net was removed during the day to prevent overheating and excessive shade, both problems of insect-proof screens used under tropical conditions. The number of all lepidopteran larvae with netting protection and foliar <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> was {{significantly lower than the}} unprotected control. The number of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), was significantly lower with netting protection compared with foliar <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays</b> and control. Netting treated with deltamethrin gave total protection of young plants against the aphid Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach). At harvest, the number of marketable cabbages protected with untreated netting was significantly higher compared with the production with foliar <b>insecticide</b> <b>sprays.</b> The protection of cabbages with netting can be an economically viable method. Considering the price of cabbages on local markets (US$ 1 / unit), the net returns per 100 m(2) were US$ 247 by using netting, US$ 149 by using insecticides, and US$ 117 for controls. The net returns for using netting are based on replacing the netting each crop cycle. But netting can be reused several times, depending upon conditions, increasing the profit margin. The netting protection may be an alternative to the growing unsustainable practices of vegetable cropping in peri-urban areas of tropical countries...|$|R
