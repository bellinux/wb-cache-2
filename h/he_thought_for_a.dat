2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{design for}} the film was handled by Martín Hernández, {{who has worked on}} all the director's feature films. The {{production}} sound his team was given was [...] "surprisingly perfect and clean", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. [...] "Normally Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds.' The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on Birdman because here, everything is flowing." [...] Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task since the camera was nearly always moving. Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order [...] "to have distance, and closeness and resonance" [...] the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as [...] "crazy". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hernández said <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film in general, that the narrative created by sound [...] "provokes more 'explosions'" [...] than that created by images, and that in Birdman [...] "Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Pleasant extinction," [...] said Graham. [...] "Yet--." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. [...] "There is {{that other}} thing--the Crowd, the great mass of poor men. Will that die out? That will not die out. And it suffers, its {{suffering}} is a force that even you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|He felt so {{overwhelmed}} by despair that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant of {{putting an end}} to his life. 'Can I survive my misfortunes?' he cried. 'I fancied I had come to an end of my troubles, and now they are worse than ever. What will become of me? Never can I discover the place where this monster will hide Rosalie.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was really}} like her sister <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> {{impressed}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment by the soft brilliancy of her smile. Her fingers rested upon his.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{had never}} asked himself, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment before replying.|$|E
60|$|John laughed quietly. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, then beckoned to the {{hovering}} waiter.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. [...] "Can you {{remember}} any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?" [...] he asked, {{looking at her}} across the table.|$|E
60|$|They laughed {{over his}} voracity, and he promised {{it should be}} held in check as to the point which <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment might be worked so {{effectively}} into the play.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, he {{said that}} the Walwyn {{property}} had been sequestered, but no one had yet purchased it, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fair sum, it might be redeemed for the family.|$|R
60|$|The agent stated his {{willingness}} to supply land of whatever sort Jimmy needed, but <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ambitious young man, the proper investment was a city building lot. In fact, he {{had a number of}} useful lots on a first-class frontage. Jimmy studied the map and remarked that the town had not got there yet. The agent declared the town would get there soon, and to wait until the streets were graded and prices went up was a fool's plan. Jimmy stated he would not speculate; if the price were suitable, he might buy land in the Kelshope valley on the other map.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{more the}} man was bewildered. This time, however, it was bewilderment of a {{different}} sort. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment steadfastly. Who was there who could have betrayed him? ...|$|E
6000|$|So <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{and then}} he said, [...] "I must really give it up. I cannot tell, {{for the life of}} me, why a man has two eyes. Do you know?" ...|$|E
60|$|Douglas hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment of}} De Quincey's Ann {{wandering}} {{out of the}} mists to cross the bridge with weary footsteps, and turned towards the girl with a courtesy which was almost tenderness.|$|E
60|$|When {{the officer}} {{had seen him}} to the porch, he returned, and again {{unlocking}} and unbarring {{the door of the}} cell, set it wide open, informing its inmate that he was at liberty to walk in the adjacent yard, if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> proper, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour.|$|R
50|$|Raousset-Boulbon {{arrived in}} San Francisco and felt deeply disillusioned after not {{receiving}} the treatment <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> was deserved <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Count.|$|R
6000|$|... "Command us, Gospodar!" [...] {{they said}} simply, {{as they stood}} to attention. [...] "Shall {{we go to the}} head of the ravine road and there take hiding?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> perhaps <b>a</b> minute, whilst we all stood as silent as [...] images. I could hear our hearts beating. Then he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{wait and}} I'll {{tell you all}} about it--maybe." [...] And then Spouter stopped short, struck by a sudden idea. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds and then his face broke into a broad smile.|$|E
6000|$|The father read {{it with an}} {{ejaculation}} of 'Thank God,' {{the aunt}} answered with a cry of horror, so that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment she had supposed he said 'dropped him into the sea,' and repeated 'Liverpool Workhouse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> space, {{and then}} removed his boot {{and sat with}} it on his knee. [...] "Of course!... all that he said was wrong--quite wrong. Right is right and {{cheating}} is cheating, whatever you say about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum! I didn't think o' that," [...] mused old Grisley. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> hard <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, pursing up {{his lips}} and {{twisting}} his beadlike eyes first one way and then another. [...] "Supposin' I was to say right now that I'd keep the mortgage? What would you do about it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On 11 January 1999, Grøsfjeld sent Rosa {{an e-mail}} {{containing}} his <b>thoughts</b> <b>he</b> had <b>for</b> <b>a</b> potential sequel to <b>A</b> Christmas <b>for</b> Shacktown: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{stopped and}} <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, with closed eyes and {{wrinkled}} forehead. She was watching him, studying him intently, when {{his blue eyes}} opened with a snap and his face suddenly brightened.|$|R
6000|$|... "The rascal!" [...] howled Josiah Crabtree. [...] "Oh, {{wait till}} I {{get my hands}} on him! But I must get the teeth first." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. [...] "Fenwick, find Snuggers and send him to me at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute or}} two before he {{answered}} her. Perhaps the man would be more impressed if the message came to him through his wife. [...] "If {{you think that he}} will not be annoyed with you, you may do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't have a {{face like}} that," [...] {{proceeded}} the child, with {{a good deal of}} earnestness, [...] "not if you gave me a million dollars." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, then corrected himself. [...] "Two million dollars!" [...] he added.|$|E
60|$|Fergus was, for the moment, {{completely}} overwhelmed. <b>He</b> {{had never}} <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment that the}} estate would ever be restored, and the sudden news, following that of his promotion, completely overwhelmed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{health is}} delicate," [...] said Lady Montfort; [...] "had {{it not been}} for his devotion to Lord Roehampton, I know <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of {{travelling}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] said Moody Spurgeon. Moody Spurgeon {{had never}} been so carried away by his {{feelings}} before, and he blushed uncomfortably every time <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> about it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seven of you, eh?" [...] was the teacher's sour comment. [...] "A fine {{piece of}} business, truly." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. [...] "Come with me, all of you, and we'll see what {{damage has been}} done down in the office." ...|$|E
60|$|The limpid air {{softened}} his heart; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment that}} if he could wander aimlessly with Mary, gossiping without purpose, they might end by understanding one another. The sun, the wild flowers, the inconstant breeze, might help to create a new feeling.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, then {{remembered a}} deep hollow {{which he had}} {{encountered}} but a short while before. Gazing around, {{to make certain that}} nobody was watching him, he picked up the unconscious lad and stalked off with the form, back into the jungle and up a small hill.|$|E
5000|$|In there, he knew, {{there would}} be warmth and good company. The {{fortunate}} officers with prize money to spend; the incredibly fortunate officers who had found themselves appointments in the peacetime navy - {{they would be in}} there yarning and taking wine with each other.

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> {{about it}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little while {{with a highly}} {{agreeable}} and whimsical expression of face, then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner, [...] "You know what a child I am. Why surprised?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> it over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, {{and as he}} {{had watched}} {{carefully}} from the hedge every motion of the old witch, and listened to her words, he believed he could repeat exactly {{what she had said}} and done.|$|R
