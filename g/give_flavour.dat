During this time, the extensive regional stocks of pilchards were processed at salting plants in Cornwall, and then shipped to the Roman Catholic countries of France and Spain. From there, there were either consumed locally or traded directly to Italy - still the primary market for salt pilchards today - where they were used in rustic dishes to <b>give</b> <b>flavour</b> to the staple diet of pasta or polenta.

40|$|These {{lecture notes}} were {{inspired}} mainly by two seminal {{books on the}} topic by Holger Wendland [14] and by Gregory E. Fasshauer [6]. The first presents more theoretical aspects while the second provides also useful Matlab functions for understanding better the theory and all the applictions discussed. The notes have then been used during a short teaching-visit of the author to the University of Antwerp, for the Erasmus Teaching Staff Mobility. People interested on radial basis functions, can refer to the wide literature available that, especially {{in the last two}} decades, has grown very fast. The popularity of radial basis functions can be understood by means of the following ”parallelism”. In many cooking recepies the parsley is used to <b>give</b> <b>flavour</b> and colour to dishes. Radial basis functions can be considered as a mathematical parsley since they have been used in all mathematical problems requiring a powerful, i. e. efficient and stable, approximation tool. These four lectures were thoughts for students without a strong background on func-tional analysis, so in the presentation of the topics I deliberately avoid, when possible, to introduce functional analysis concepts. This is a great lack, but I hope that the people who will use these notes will be not too critical towards me...|$|E
40|$|Agents are {{entities}} who {{perceive their}} environment and who perform actions. For instance in role playing video games, ennemies are agents who perceive {{some part of}} the virtual world and who can attack or launch a sortilege. Another example may concern robot assistance for disabled people: the robot perceives obstacles of the world and can alert humans or help them. Here, we try to give formal tools to model knowledge reasoning about the perception of their environment and about actions based, on modal logic. First, we give combine the standard epistemic modal logic with perception constructions of the form (agent a sees agent b). We give a semantics in terms of position and orientation of the agents in the space that can be a line (Lineland) or a plane (Flatland). Concerning Lineland, we provide a complete axiomatization and an optimal procedure for model-checking and satisfiability problem. Concerning Flatland, we show that both model-checking and satisfiability problem are decidable but the exact complexities and the axiomatization remain open problems. Thus, the logics of Lineland and Flatland are completely a new approach: their syntax is epistemic but their semantics concern spatial reasoning. Secondly, we study on the logic of agency ''see-to-it-that'' STIT made up of construction of the form [J]A standing for ''the coalition of agents J sees to it that A''. Our interest is motivated: STIT is strictly more expressive that standard modal logic for agency like Coalition Logic CL or Alternating-time Temporal Logic ATL. In CL or ATL the ''de re'' and ''de dicto'' problem is quite difficult and technical whereas if we combine STIT-operators with epistemic operators, we can solve it in a natural way. However this strong expressivity has a prize: the general version of STIT is undecidable. That is why we focus on some syntactic fragments of STIT: either we restrict the allowed coalitions J in constructions [J]A or we restrict the nesting of modal STIT-operators. We provide axiomatizations and complexity results. Finally, we <b>give</b> <b>flavour</b> to epistemic modal logic by adding STIT-operators. The logic STIT is suitable to express counterfactual statements like ''agent a could have choosen an action such that A have been true''. Thus we show how to model counterfactual emotions like regret, rejoicing, disappointment and elation in this framework. We also model epistemic games by adapting the logic STIT by giving explicitely names of actions in the language. In this framework, we can model the notion of rational agents but other kind of behaviour like altruism etc., Nash equilibrium and iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies. Dans le domaine des jeux vidéos par exemple, surtout des jeux de rôles, les personnages virtuels perçoivent un environnement, en tirent des connaissances puis effectuent des actions selon leur besoin. De même en robotique, un robot perçoit son environnement à l'aide de capteurs/caméras, établit une base de connaissances et effectuent des mouvements etc. La description des comportements de ces agents virtuels et leurs raisonnements peut s'effectuer à l'aide d'un langage logique. Dans cette thèse, on se propose de modéliser les trois aspects ''voir'', ''savoir'' et ''faire'' et leurs interactions à l'aide de la logique modale. Dans une première partie, on modélise des agents dans un espace géométrique puis on définit une relation épistémique qui tient compte des positions et du regard des agents. Dans une seconde partie, on revisite la logique des actions ''STIT'' (see-to-it-that ou ''faire en sorte que'') qui permet de faire la différence entre les principes ''de re'' et ''de dicto'', contrairement à d'autres logiques modales des actions. Dans une troisième partie, on s'intéresse à modéliser quelques aspects de la théorie des jeux dans une variante de la logique ''STIT'' ainsi que des émotions contre-factuelles comme le regret. Tout au long de cette thèse, on s'efforcera de s'intéresser aux aspects logiques comme les complétudes des axiomatisations et la complexité du problème de satisfiabilité d'une formule logique. L'intégration des trois concepts ''voir'', ''savoir'' et ''faire'' dans une et une seule logique est évoquée en conclusion et reste une question ouverte...|$|E
