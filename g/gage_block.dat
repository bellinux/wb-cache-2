40|$|The target {{fabrication}} {{group at}} Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory develops various {{high energy density}} physics targets, which are used to study the interaction of materials when shot with high energy lasers. These targets consist of {{many different types of}} materials glued together including low density foams, plastics, and metals. To verify models, the physicists need to know the exact thickness of the targets and target components to [plus-minus] 1. 0 [mu]m. The target components are typically 3 - 5 mm in diameter and 200 - 300 [mu]m thick and may have features such as moguls or two-dimensional sine waves machined onto them. As of yet, no commercial thickness measuring machine exists on the market capable of measuring thicknesses to [plus-minus] 1. 0 [mu]m. To solve this problem, an absolute thickness measuring machine was developed that uses a precision air-bearing XY stage to scan a target between two confocal displacement lasers that measure the profile of each side of the target. A NIST traceable <b>gage</b> <b>block</b> of known thickness is used to calculate the thickness of the target. This paper describes the design and qualification of the absolute thickness measuring machine. It focuses on the error budget and tests performed to qualify the machine. Without compensation factors, the absolute thickness measuring machine was able to measure the thickness of a <b>gage</b> <b>block</b> to 0. 5 [mu]m. by Darcy K. Kelly. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Scanning {{tunnelling}} microscope (STM) {{was used}} to image microindentations made on a <b>gage</b> <b>block</b> using a Vickers indenter. The morphology of the indentations shows that the boundary is not sharply defined and therefore accurate STM-based microhardness measurements need image analysis methods for measuring either the indentation area or a parameter well correlated with the geometry of the indentation. Two methods have been investigated. The first method estimate {{the level of the}} undisturbed surface of the tested material before the indentation is made, and the indentation area is subsequently calculated as the intersection between the average of the block surface and the indentation itself. The second method uses a filling algorithm to calculate the ratio between volume and surface of the indentation and the border is obtained from the maximum of this ratio. A factorial analysis was used on a set of experimental data to evaluate the contributions (individual and combined) of several STM imaging parameters to the measurement uncertainty...|$|E

In the {{world coordinate system}}, xw, yw, and zw axes are parallel to the ridges of the combined target, respectively, and laser plane is defined as Zw = 0. The target is fixed on a one-dimensional mobile platform, and the laser beam should be adjusted {{to make sure that it}} is perpendicular to the combined target and parallel to owyw. Then, the target moves at an interval of 10 mm along owxw direction, which is parallel to the laser plane. Several stripe points at different positions are acquired when moving the target. At this time, the coordinate xw of the points on the laser plane is changed, but the coordinate yw keeps invariant. The number of the stripe points is decided by the size of the gauge block in owyw direction. That means the smaller the size of the <b>gage</b> <b>block</b> is, the more stripe points there is in a fixed field range.

40|$|Lapping is a {{finishing}} process extensively {{used in the}} engineering world for those parts that require a finefinish surface such as <b>gage</b> <b>blocks</b> or flats for checking production parts. Nowadays, there are severalmachines in which single-face, double-face or rotating lapping processes can be carried out. Generally, allthese machines use a rigid bearing system for supporting the lap shaft and a flexible coupling to connect thatshaft to the motor. Therefore, their vibrations can affect the surface finishing of parts to be lapped. One wayto reduce that effect and greatly improve the surface quality is to use an air bearing. The present work isaimed at investigating the lapping parameters when using an air bearing system. For comparison purposes,tests using a conventional rigid system were also conducted. Results show vibrations have a negative effecton flatness and roughness, reason for which lapping can take longer time to reach the same results obtainedwith an air bearing system...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{dimensional}} metrology has undergone some generational changes. Looking back in history, manufacturing functional products without metrology {{was just a}} trial and error procedure, so {{only a small number}} of simple products were produced. First, with the implementation of simple <b>gage</b> <b>blocks</b> the construction of complex buildings such as the pyramids were possible. Later, during the industrial revolution requirements for mass production increased, so simple 2 -point measurements were no longer sufficient to ensure mating ability and interchangeability of more and more intricate compo-nents. Systems for geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) have been introduced, which enable the geometrical description of complex product properties, and also measurement instruments were developed further from simple manual measurement instruments to high-resolution multi-sensor coordinate measuring machines, which combine tactile, optical and x-ray-tomographic measurement principles. Currently, another paradigm shift is imminent: Conformance proving is changing from pure-ly geometry oriented measurements to function oriented virtually testing. By modeling and simulating the function of a component it is possible to evaluate the functional ability of a component based on dimensional measurement data. This leads to an unambiguous product specification, a better process understanding, a verification result based directly on function-oriented parameters instead of indirectly function related dimensional parameters and so to a more veridic prediction of functional ability. Key words: {{dimensional metrology}}, function-oriented parameters, GD&...|$|R

40|$|There {{are growing}} demands to {{characterize}} the stability of assemblies of optical components for ultrahigh-precision instruments. In this paper we demonstrate how absolute length measurements by interferometry {{can be applied to}} measure the thermal and dimensional stability of connections. In order to enable investigation of common joining techniques, including wringing, screwing, and gluing, as well as specialized, inorganic joining techniques such as silicatic bonding, thin-film soldering, and solderjet bumping, representative connections were fabricated. By using <b>gage</b> <b>blocks</b> or prismatic bodies as joining parts, parallelism and flatness were provided which are needed for precision interferometric length measurements. The stability of connection elements used in ultrahigh-precision instruments was investigated longitudinally and laterally to the connection interface, and also mutual tilting of the parts was detected by analysis of the phase topographies. The measurements have an accuracy level of about 1 nm, and the traditional wringing method was also considered as a reference joining technique. The long-term behavior was studied within a period of about 1 year under constant temperature. Further, the thermal dilatation and the reaction of connections to thermal stress were measured. Results show that screwed connections do not exhibit a significant drift of length or orientation. They also did not show response to temperature variations of +/- 10 degrees C. This is different for adhesive connections, where dimensional changes of up to 100 nm were observed. The specimens produced by using thin-film soldering as well as silicatic bonding revealed stability of length better than 5 nm per year and angular stability within +/- 0. 1 arcsec. Furthermore, these specimens were shown to be insensitive to a temporary temperature variation in a range from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. This situation is slightly different for the sample connections produced by solderjet bumping, which show a positive length change of similar to 25 nm and a tilt of +/- 1 arcsec. These observations can be explained by creeping of the relatively large solder bumps that bridge a gap of about 100 mu m between the connected mirror plates. The thermal expansion of the connections shows a strong correlation with the "layer thickness"...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Baseplate {{micromotion}} of {{the reverse}} shoulder glenoid component {{can lead to}} implant loosening. We hypothesized that a remotely positioned displacement gage measures elastic deformation of the system rather than actual micromotion at the implant/bone interface. METHODS: Reverse glenoid components were implanted into polyurethane blocks of 3 different densities. A 700 N compressive load was maintained and a vertical 700 N shear load was applied for 1000 cycles. In addition to the typical gage measurement, a digital image analysis of micromotion at the implant/block interface using high resolution cameras was performed. The measurements were validated on human specimens. A finite element model was implemented to study the isolated effect of block deformation on baseplate displacements. FINDINGS: With the gage, typically reported micromotions were measured. Two orders of magnitude lower micromotions were detected using interface image-based analysis. The finite element simulation showed that elastic deformation alone can cause micromotion magnitudes as measured with displacement <b>gages.</b> Polyurethane <b>blocks</b> of 20 and 15 lbs per cubic foot density best reproduced micromotions as measured on human specimens. INTERPRETATION: We found considerably less relative micromotion at the implant/bone interface than previously assumed. Gage measurements quantify elastic deformation and not true interface micromotion. High resolution digital imaging at the implant/bone interface is strongly recommended for an accurate assessment of reverse glenoid component micromotion. Tests should further adopt 20 or 15 pcf bone test surrogates. Further studies are required to identify the failure modes encountered in vivo, and a corresponding in vitro testing methodology can then be developed. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
