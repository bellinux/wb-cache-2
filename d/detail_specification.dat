40|$|Adaptive Cruise Control {{systems have}} been {{developed}} and introduced into the consumer market for over a decade. Among these systems, fully-adaptive ones are required to adapt their behaviour not only to traffic conditions but also to drivers' preferences and attitudes, {{as well as to}} the way such preferences change for the same driver in different driving sessions. This would ideally lead towards a system where an on-board electronic control unit can be asked by the driver to calibrate its own parameters while he/she manually drives for a few minutes (learning mode). After calibration, the control unit switches to the running mode where the learned driving style is applied. The learning mode can be activated by any driver of the car, for any driving session and each time he/she wishes to change the current driving behaviour of the cruise control system. The modelling framework which we propose to implement comprises four layers (sampler, profiler, tutor, performer). The sampler is responsible for human likeness and can be calibrated while in learning mode. Then, while in running mode, it works together with the other modelling layers to implement the logic. This paper presents the overall framework, with particular emphasis on the sampler and the profiler that are explained in full mathematical <b>detail.</b> <b>Specification</b> and calibration of the proposed framework are supported by the observed data, collected by means of an instrumented vehicle. The data are also used to assess the proposed framework, confirming human-like and fully-adaptive characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Constraint-based feature {{modeling}} is {{a promising}} approach for object modeling. By giving the system responsibility {{for maintaining the}} various relationships among different features, the user is freed from the tedious and error prone task of maintaining these relationships by hand, {{making it easier to}} build and maintain complex feature model. However, one of the major drawbacks in current feature modeling approaches is that the modeling space coverage does not include sculptured object class. Also, feature semantics maintenance is largely ignored in many modeling systems. This thesis presents a framework of Unified Constraint-Based Feature Modeling Scheme (UCFM) for sculptured objects, which is a three levels hierarchical structure: The first level defined the modeling coverage of the UCFM schema, which is application specific. The second level defined the constituent object classes and constraint classes for the application. Different types of constraints and their specification are presented. The third level gives the <b>detail</b> <b>specification</b> of each object class. The feature semantics - attributes and validity conditions (depicted by constraints) are fully captured in the UCFM schema. The conformity of feature semantics is kept throughout the modeling process by employing a validity maintenance mechanism to prevent undesirable operations. A neutral, open standard and platform independent language called Feature Markup Language is proposed to give a textual representation of the UCFM scheme. It is an application of Extensible Markup Language (XML). The declarations of FML are presented and their adequacy for representing UCFM scheme is discussed...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time GaAs high {{electron}} mobility transistors, i. e. Siemens low noise microwave HEMTs types CFY 66 and CFY 67, had to be formally space-qualified. An extensive evaluation- and qualification program corresponding to ESA/SCC Specifications was performed. After assembling in hermetically sealed microwave packages excellent D. C. and R. F. behaviour was shown, exhibiting narrow performance distributions. All evaluation and qualification tests were passed, i. e. package-, radiation- and ESD-tests and constructional analysis and especially the endurance tests: High temperature storage tests of up to T_s_t= 275 C/ 1000 h and high temperature bias test up to T_c_h= 225 C/ 4000 h. In total approximately 1. 000. 000 device-hours were reached, and extraordinary stable device performance was noticed. The manufacturer evaluation, especially the audit of wafer-fabrication, assembling and device characterization areas, by DARA and ESA was performed without objections. The components received the ESA/SCC <b>Detail</b> <b>Specification</b> No. s 5613 / 002 and 5613 / 004. The program was successfull, the official ESA Certificate of Qualification was issued on 15. 4. 94, the component types have been correspondingly included in the ESA/SCC Qualified Parts List. For {{the first time}} word-wide GaAs HEMTs proved to be formally qualified for space-applications. For the European, especially the German space industries easy access to these undispensible components follows. First space procurements have already been performed, furthermore, the chip version of the CFY 66 was chosen for the base-line design of the ASAR antenna of the ENVISAT program. (orig.)

40|$|The {{control of}} the noise and {{vibration}} generated by an automobile {{is referred to as}} Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) engineering. It involves identifying the design detail required to reduce the noise and vibration inside the passenger compartment of the vehicle to levels that are acceptable to the customer. It also involves delivering an engine or a powertrain sound character that is both pleasing to the customer and that suits the character of the vehicle. Tuning the sound generated by a vehicle to deliver a particular character is referred to as Sound Quality Engineering. This document summarizes the work of the EngD research programme that was aimed at developing a structured process for engineering the Powertrain Sound Quality of an automobile. The need for developing a Sound Quality Engineering Process at Jaguar Cars was identified through a review of customer evaluations of the sound in Jaguar's vehicles and those of its competitors. This review established that Jaguar's existing vehicles were trailing the leading competition in terms of the delivery of Powertrain Sound Quality. The reason for this shortfall was that the NVH Department at Jaguar did not have a focus on delivering the customer requirements. Without this focus there was no means of using the customer level requirements, for Sound Quality to drive the vehicle design process. The EngD research programme resulted in the formulation and implementation of a Sound Quality Engineering Process at Jaguar Cars that addressed this need. The first part of the research programme involved developing a means of quantifying the differences in the subjective Sound Quality character perceived by the customer. It was established that the subjective nature of the Powertrain Sound Quality could be represented by two underlying dimensions; a measure of the degree of Refinement and a measure of degree of Powerfulness. An assessment technique was developed that enabled the subjective Sound Quality character for a given vehicle to be quantified through its location within a 2 -Dimensional Sound Quality Space, the axes of which were defined by each of the two underlying dimensions of Sound Quality. This 2 - Dimensional Sound Quality Space provided the means of quantifying the differences in the Sound Quality characters for all of the vehicles competing in the luxury vehicle sectors. It was applied to define subjective Sound Quality targets for all of the new vehicle programmes at Jaguar Cars. These targets identified the required improvements to each of the two underlying dimensions of Sound Quality needed to address the shortfalls in Jaguar Cars' existing vehicles. The second part of the research programme involved identifying the key acoustic features within the sound signatures of Jaguar's vehicles that were responsible for determining the differences in subjective perception between these vehicles and their competitors. The changes to these key acoustic features were related to the required improvements to each of the two dimensions of Sound Quality that were established from the subjective target setting process. The final part of the research programme involved developing techniques that linked these key acoustic features to the noise sources and paths that were responsible for generating them. Through this link it was possible to establish the changes to these noise sources and paths that were necessary to deliver the required changes to the key acoustic features. In this way the required improvements to each of the two underlying dimensions of Sound Quality were used to define the vehicle design specification at the concept stage of the vehicle development programme and consequently drive the vehicle design process. The ability to link the subjective customer level requirements for Sound Quality to the design <b>detail</b> <b>specification</b> has overcome the previously identified shortfall within the NVH development process at Jaguar Cars. The techniques developed during the EngD research programme were formulated into a Sound Quality Engineering Process. Although the process was developed for Jaguar Cars the findings from the research and the techniques developed have since been applied by the different brands within the Ford Motor Company. Within Jaguar Cars the process has been implemented across all of the new vehicle programmes. It has directly resulted in significantly improved Sound Quality characters in the new vehicles that have been recently introduced to the luxury vehicle market.
