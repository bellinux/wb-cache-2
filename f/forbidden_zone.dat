25|$|Many of {{the ghost}} towns in mineral-rich Africa are former mining towns. Shortly {{after the start}} of the 1908 diamond rush in German South-West Africa, now known as Namibia, the German Imperial {{government}} claimed sole mining rights by creating the Sperrgebiet (<b>forbidden</b> <b>zone),</b> effectively criminalizing new settlement. The small mining towns of this area, among them Pomona, Elizabeth Bay and Kolmanskop, were exempt from this ban, but the denial of new land claims soon rendered all of them ghost towns.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to present an optimum model for route location considering access to all the main points of the roads, passing compulsory points and having the minimum total cost. It is assumed in this research that the involved areas are level or rolling. The major capability of such models is predicting protected areas in an optimal corridor route location. In this paper, after describing the fulfilled studies in the field of road alignment, two mathematical models for alignment in level areas are presented. In the first model the <b>forbidden</b> <b>zones</b> are not considered, but in the second model the <b>forbidden</b> <b>zones</b> are prevented from being passed through by modeling these zones in a circular shape. In this research the mathematical non-linear programming has been used for modeling...|$|R
25|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton brought in Danny Elfman, who had {{previously}} composed the music for <b>Forbidden</b> <b>Zone.</b> He relished the opportunity to compose an orchestral score rather than a pop score and wanted to it to be taken {{as the work of}} a composer rather than the dabbling of a pop musician. Elfman already had the main title theme written before he signed on. At the time, Elfman was the lead singer of Oingo Boingo, but the working relationship between Burton and Elfman would overshadow his performing life and continue for most of Burton's films.|$|E

The series follows Caesar's grandson and heir Alexander as he struggles to govern ape civilization. The comic's success led Malibu to publish five four-issue spin-off miniseries: Ape City, Planet of the Apes: Urchak's Folly, the Alien Nation crossover Ape Nation, Planet of the Apes: Blood of the Apes, and Planet of the Apes: The <b>Forbidden</b> <b>Zone.</b> Malibu also published two one-shots: A Day on the Planet of the Apes and Planet prequel Planet of the Apes: Sins of the Fathers; a trade paperback collecting the first four issues of the main series, titled Monkey Planet; and reissues of stories from Marvel's earlier Apes series.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal scheduling of hydropower plants in a hydrothermal interconnected system. This problem, of outmost importance for large-scale power systems {{with a high}} proportion of hydraulic generation, requires {{a detailed description of the}} so-called hydro unit production function. In our model, we relate the amount of generated hydropower to nonlinear tailrace levels; we also take into account hydraulic losses, turbine-generator efficiencies, as well as multiple 0 - 1 states associated with <b>forbidden</b> operation <b>zones.</b> <b>Forbidden</b> <b>zones</b> are crucial to avoid nasty phenomena such as mechanical vibrations in the turbine, cavitation, and low efficiency levels. The minimization of operating costs subject to such detailed constraints results in a large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. By means of Lagrangian Relaxation, the original problem is split into a sequence of smaller and easy-to-solve subproblems, coordinated by a dual master program. In order to deal better with the combinatorial aspect introduced by the <b>forbidden</b> <b>zones,</b> we derive three different decomposition strategies, applicable to various configurations of hydro plants (with few or many units, which can be identical or different). We use a Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm to solve nonlinear subproblems. We assess our approach on a real-life hydroelectric configuration extracted from the south sub region of the Brazilian hydrothermal power system...|$|R

Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, [...] "I didn't have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn't know what I was doing. I needed reining in." [...] During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method for designing optimal and feasible control strategies for time-variant dynamical processes. The key {{point of the}} presented idea lies in utilizing a flow graph structure for representing pertinent properties of the autonomous dynamics of a given dynamical process in a time-and-state space, which is composed of certain elementary segments. The structure {{is referred to as}} a time-and-state space toolgraph. In the procedure, each segment of the temporary state space is assigned a node of the time-and-state space toolgraph. The flow values are proportional to the cost of driving the operational point of the dynamical process between the centers of adjacent segments. Any of the discrete optimization algorithms can be applied to search for a cheapest path connecting the initial and terminal points of the sought optimal piecewise-linear trajectory of the operational points in the considered time-and-state space. Additional assumptions or restrictions concerning arbitrary <b>forbidden</b> <b>zones</b> for the operational points can be easily taken into account. In such cases the nodes representing the segments partially or entirely belonging to the finite <b>forbidden</b> <b>zones</b> are deposed from the toolgraph structure...|$|R

2500|$|A {{tribunal}} {{to determine}} Taylor's origins is convened {{by the president}} of the Assembly (James Whitmore), Dr. Zaius, and Maximus (Woodrow Parfrey). Dr. Honorious (James Daly) is the prosecutor. Taylor mentions his two comrades at this time. The court then produces Landon, who has been subjected to a lobotomy that has rendered him catatonic and unable to speak. [...] After the tribunal, Dr. Zaius privately threatens to castrate and lobotomize Taylor if he does not tell the truth about where he came from. With help from Zira's socially rebellious nephew Lucius (Lou Wagner), Zira and Cornelius free Taylor and Nova and take them to the <b>Forbidden</b> <b>Zone,</b> a taboo region outside Ape City that has been ruled out of bounds for centuries by Ape Law. A year earlier, Cornelius led an expedition into the <b>Forbidden</b> <b>Zone</b> that found a cave containing artifacts of an earlier non-simian (and believed to be human) civilization.
