5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal).

5|$|What is {{considered}} the first scholarly <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Leges appeared in 1827 by George Philips, who did not reproduce the entire text in his Englische Reichsund Rechtsgeschichte, but did provide a couple of extracts along with a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources {{of the work and}} a description of the work. In 1840, the Record Commission published an edition of the text that had been edited by Richard Price and Benjamin Thorpe. The next major production of the Leges was Felix Liebermann who produced three volumes of Gesetze der Angelsachsen between 1903 and 1916, with the Leges being one of the legal treatises being reproduced in the Gesetze. A modern translation, with the original Latin text on pages facing the translation, was published in 1972 by the Clarendon Press and edited by L. J. Downer, and includes updated commentary and manuscript information.|$|E
5|$|Without any <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merits, 5-4, the Court {{held that}} the {{indictment}} stated offenses under § 1782 and that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have convicted Burton.

5|$|After the {{presentation}} and <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many proposals, a governmental commission {{was set up}} on 15 October 1910. It included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (painter), João Chagas (journalist), Abel Botelho (writer) and two military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla. This commission ultimately chose the red-and-green of the Portuguese Republican Party, delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons, which disguised the political significance behind the choice, as these had been the colours present on the banners of the rebellious during the republican insurrection of 31 January 1891, in Porto, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in Lisbon.|$|E

5|$|Between 1841 and 1846, he {{published}} Beniowski, {{considered by some}} his best lyrical poetry. Starting as {{a story of a}} historical figure, it developed into a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poet's own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem Beniowski and the drama Ksiądz Marek (Father Mark). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.|$|E
5|$|<b>Discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disorganized {{attachment}} style sometimes includes {{this style}} {{under the rubric}} of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that will take the individual ever further from the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood. Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.|$|E
