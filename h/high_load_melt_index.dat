40|$|Nylon 11 (PA 11) /clay nanocomposites {{have been}} {{prepared}} by melt-blending, followed by melt-extrusion through a capillary. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the exfoliated clay morphology is dominant for low nanofiller content, while the intercalated one is prevailing for <b>high</b> filler <b>loading.</b> <b>Melt</b> rheological properties of PA 11 nanocomposites have been studied in both linear and nonlinear viscoelastic response regions. In the linear regime, the nanocomposites exhibit much higher storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G'') values than neat PA 11. The values of G' and G'' increase steadily with clay loading at low concentrations, while the G' and G'' for the sample with 5 wt % clay show an inverse dependence and lie between the modulus values of the samples with 1 and 2 wt % of clay. This is attributed to the alignment/orientation of nanoclay platelets in the intercalated nanocomposite induced by capillary extrusion. In the nonlinear regime, the nanocomposites show increased shear viscosities {{when compared with the}} neat resin. The dependence of the shear viscosity on clay loading has analogous trend to that of G' and G''.
