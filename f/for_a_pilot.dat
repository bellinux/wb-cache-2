Its scripts were picked up by NBC in January 2011 and two months afterwards, principal photography for the episode commenced in Chicago, Illinois, where it occurred over a period of nine days.

5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean.

The leftover crews, some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours considered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced crews and the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E

Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.|$|E

5|$|Winckel {{was born}} on 3 November 1912 in Muntok, Bangka Island, {{in what was then}} the Dutch East Indies.

He stayed with his grandparents while studying, and three years later became a seaman first class for the merchant marine. He specialised in navigation. In 1931, when he was aged nineteen, Winckel started working as a quartermaster on the freighter Pallau, which sailed between the Netherlands and Java. After his work on the ship he went to the island of Borneo to work on oil rigs.

Winckel joined the Air Force in 1935 and became a pilot at age 23. Between 1935 and 1942 he flew transports across the Dutch East Indies, mainly in Lockheed Lodestars.|$|E
