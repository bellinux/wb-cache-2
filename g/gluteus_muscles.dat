50|$|Modern human hip joints {{are larger}} than in quadrupedal ancestral species to better support the greater amount of body weight passing through them, as well as having a shorter, broader shape. This {{alteration}} in shape brought the vertebral column closer to the hip joint, providing a stable base for support of the trunk while walking upright. Also, because bipedal walking requires humans to balance on a relatively unstable ball and socket joint, {{the placement of the}} vertebral column closer to the hip joint allows humans to invest less muscular effort in balancing. Change {{in the shape of the}} hip may have led to the decrease in the degree of hip extension, an energy efficient adaptation. The ilium changed from a long and narrow shape to a short and broad one and the walls of the pelvis modernized to face laterally. These combined changes provide increased area for the <b>gluteus</b> <b>muscles</b> to attach; this helps to stabilize the torso while standing on one leg. The sacrum has also become more broad, increasing the diameter of the birth canal and making birthing easier. In order to provide more surface for ligaments to attach to help support the abdominal viscera during erect posture, the Ischia spines became more prominent and shifted towards the middle of the body.|$|E

There were 18 bilateral cases, totaling 278 hips. All the patients had osteoarthritis and had undergone non-cemented total hip arthroplasty (metal-metal or metal-polyethylene) between October 2004 and December 2007. A minimally invasive anterolateral access route was used, measuring 7 to 10 cm in length, according to body weight and the size of the femoral head. The patients were assessed clinically regarding age, sex and presence of the Trendelenburg sign, and radiologically regarding acetabular and femoral positioning. Results: The acetabular inclination was between 30 ° and 40 ° in 78 patients, between 41 ° and 50 ° in 189 patients, and 51 ° or over in 11 patients. On anteroposterior radiographs to study femoral positioning, the positioning was central in 209 cases, 41 presented valgus deviation and 28 presented varus deviation. On lateral views, 173 were central, 67 anterior and 38 posterior. The mean duration of the procedure was 63 minutes. Regarding complications, there were five cases of infection, three of deep vein thrombosis, two of hip dislocation, 80 of lengthening of the lower limbs and five of shortening of the operated limb. The Trendelenburg sign was present in four cases, of which one showed superior gluteal nerve injury. Conclusion: The minimally invasive anterolateral access route made it possible to perform total hip arthroplasty without compromising the positioning of the implants, thereby maintaining the integrity of the <b>gluteus</b> <b>muscles...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Lipid storage {{myopathy}} (LSM) is {{a genetically}} heterogeneous group with variable clinical phenotypes. Late-onset multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD) {{is a rather}} common form of LSM in China. Diagnosis and clinical management of it remain challenging, especially without robust muscle biopsy result and genetic detection. As the noninvasion and convenience, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a helpful assistant, diagnostic tool for neuromuscular disorders. However, the disease-specific MRI patterns of muscle involved and its diagnostic value in late-onset MADD have not been systematic analyzed. Methods: We assessed the MRI pattern and fat infiltration degree of the lower limb muscles in 28 late-onset MADD patients, combined with detailed clinical features and gene spectrum. Fat infiltration degree of the thigh muscle was scored while that of gluteus was described as obvious or not. Associated muscular atrophy was defined as obvious muscle bulk reduction. Results: The mean scores were significantly different among the anterior, medial, and posterior thigh muscle groups. The mean of fat infiltration scores on posterior thigh muscle group {{was significantly higher than}} either anterior or medial thigh muscle group (P < 0. 001). Moreover, the mean score on medial thigh muscle group was significantly higher than that of anterior thigh muscle group (P < 0. 01). About half of the patients displayed fat infiltration and atrophy in <b>gluteus</b> <b>muscles.</b> Of 28 patients, 12 exhibited atrophy in medial and/or posterior thigh muscle groups, especially in posterior thigh muscle group.

Conclusions: Late-onset MADD patients show a typical muscular imaging pattern of fat infiltration and atrophy on anterior, posterior, and medial thigh muscle groups, with major involvement of posterior thigh muscle group and <b>gluteus</b> <b>muscles</b> and a sparing involvement of anterior thigh compartment.

40|$|Purpose This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} limited and strenuous physical exercise on [18 F]methylcholine uptake in muscle. Methods Ten consecutive patients participated, three of whom had strict bed rest, three were allowed to walk around and four performed strenuous single arm exercise by lifting a 7. 5 -kg weight. [18 F]Methylcholine uptake was measured in the biceps and <b>gluteus</b> <b>muscles</b> on both sides. Results Strenuous exercise resulted in a 202 % increase in [18 F]methylcholine uptake in the activated biceps muscle {{as well as a}} 112 % increase in muscle groups used to retain body position. This resulted in asymmetrical images that were visually less easy to interpret. In walking patients there was a more limited increase in biceps (45 %) and gluteus (74 %) muscle uptake, without visually recognizable differences. Conclusion Strenuous exercise may result in a considerable increase in [18 F]methylcholine uptake in muscle and should be avoided prior to imaging. Strict bed rest {{does not seem to be}} required.

The volitional exercise group completed 3 sets of 10 quadruped hip extensions on each leg, 5 times per week, for 6 weeks. Subjects were tested at the beginning, mid-point, and end of the study. Isometric strength of the gluteal muscles was tested using a Chatillon CSD 200 Dynamometer; endurance was measured using a hip bridge movement. The stimulation group had a 15 % increase in gluteal strength compared to only a 9 % increase of gluteal strength in the volitional exercise group. Gluteal endurance increased by 29 % in the stimulation group compared to 26 % in the volitional exercise group.

No clinical method currently exists for measuring internal tissue deformations; so design and selection of wheelchair cushions are based mostly on meas-uring sitting pressures.

We specifically compared muscle, superficial fat, and effective (muscle and fat together) tissue deformations while subjects (n = 10) sat on four cushions (two viscoelastic and two foam) and directly on a rigid support. Deformations were maximal in muscle tissue (mean ~ 70 %), twice more the amount than in fat (~ 30 %). Effective soft-tissue deformations were ~ 50 % to ~ 60 %. Although cushions mildly reduced muscle deformations {{in the order of}} 10 %, theoretically, our interpretation suggests that this deformation level adds safe sitting time.

A total of 218 college athletes who did not have lower back pain participated in the study. The range of motion (ROM) of the trunk, hip, and ankle joints was measured and a tightness test in the hip joint was performed to assess flexibility. The peak torque of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction in hip extension and hip abduction was measured in order to assess isometric muscle strength. One month after the assessments, the onset of lower back pain was investigated. The subjects were divided into two groups: subjects with onset of lower back pain (LBP, n = 19) and without it (n-LBP, n = 198). The results showed that the laterality of the internal and external rotation ROM of the hip joint was significantly higher in the LBP group than in the n-LBP group (p < 0. 05). The peak torque of the hip abduction was significantly lower in the LBP group compared with the n-LBP group. It is possible that the onset of lower back pain was caused by the laterality of the hip rotation ROM and weakness of the gluteus medius muscle...|$|E

This motion was caused by a combination of ramping up along the seat back and the straightening of the thoracic kyphosis.
