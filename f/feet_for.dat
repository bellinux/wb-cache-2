5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or <b>feet</b> <b>for</b> propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E

5|$|The female {{relies on}} her hind <b>feet</b> <b>for</b> digging. She may {{accumulate}} so much sand and mud {{on her feet}} that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates the area with her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the <b>feet</b> <b>for</b> females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Hammond console organs {{come with}} a wooden pedalboard played with the <b>feet,</b> <b>for</b> bass notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the bottom note a low C and the top note a middle C two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on {{traditional}} 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven notes were seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note American Guild of Organists (AGO) pedalboards {{going up to the}} G above middle C as the top note. The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features. Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.|$|E

5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both <b>feet</b> <b>for</b> long periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The Augustus {{opened in}} 2005 with 949 rooms, which were {{designed}} for more upscale luxury and service than {{the other parts of}} the resort. It is accessed through a private small lobby separate from the main Caesars' entrance. The rooms feature 9-foot ceilings with hotel chambers beginning at about , and going up to 2470 square <b>feet</b> <b>for</b> the largest suites. All feature spa tubs and televisions in the bathrooms. One of the highlights of the space is that the rooms view the Garden of the Gods pool area. On {{the second floor of the}} tower is a spa containing Roman baths of hot, cold and lukewarm pools; relaxing chaise longues sculpted of stone, which are underwater in the heated pool; and 51 separate therapy rooms. This tower, along with the Octavius Tower, forms a part of the 'Laurel Collection', Caesars boutique experience on the property. It features private elevator banks and exclusive Laurel Collection key cards.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind <b>feet</b> <b>for</b> digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E

5|$|Pursuit diving exerts greater {{pressures}} (both evolutionary and physiological) on seabirds, but {{the reward}} {{is a greater}} area in which to feed than is available to surface feeders. Propulsion underwater can be provided by wings (as used by penguins, auks, diving petrels and some other species of petrel) or feet (as used by cormorants, grebes, loons and several types of fish-eating ducks). Wing-propelled divers are generally faster than foot-propelled divers. In both cases, the use of wings or <b>feet</b> <b>for</b> diving has limited their utility in other situations: loons and grebes walk with extreme difficulty (if at all), penguins cannot fly, and auks have sacrificed flight efficiency in favour of underwater diving. For example, the razorbill (an Atlantic auk) requires 64% more energy to fly than a petrel of equivalent size. Many shearwaters are intermediate between the two, having longer wings than typical wing-propelled divers but heavier wing loadings than the other surface-feeding procellariids, leaving them capable of diving to considerable depths while still being efficient long-distance travellers. The deepest diving exhibited by shearwaters {{is found in the}} short-tailed shearwater, which has been recorded diving below 70m. Some albatross species are also capable of limited diving, with light-mantled sooty albatrosses holding the record at 12m. Of all the wing-propelled pursuit divers, the most efficient in the air are the albatrosses, and they are also the poorest divers. This is the dominant guild in polar and subpolar environments, as it is energetically inefficient in warmer waters. With their poor flying ability, many wing-propelled pursuit divers are more limited in their foraging range than other guilds, especially during the breeding season when hungry chicks need regular feeding.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare <b>feet.</b> <b>For</b> other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E
