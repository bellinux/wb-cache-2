During the ceremony he is pelted with red paint but immediately <b>identifies</b> <b>with</b> the demonstrators and becomes a central figure in the counter-culture movement. He resigns the chancellorship after a year, to run a commune for dissident youth. By late 1969, he has been drawn into a more sinister cult, led by the young mystic Scorpio Murtlock, which gradually overwhelms his life and independence.

40|$|Clinical {{diagnostics}} {{of chronic}} polymicrobial infections, {{such as those}} found in chronic wounds, represent a diagnostic challenge for both culture and molecular methods. In the current retrospective study, the results of aerobic bacterial cultures and culture-free bacterial identification using DNA analyses were compared. A total of 168 chronic wounds were studied. The majority of bacteria <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> culture testing were also <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> molecular testing, {{but the majority of}} bacteria <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> the molecular testing were not <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> culture testing. Seventeen (17) different bacterial taxa were <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> culture, and 338 different bacterial taxa were <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> molecular testing. This study demonstrates the increased sensitivity that molecular microbial identification can have over culture methodologies, and previous studies suggest that molecular bacterial identification can improve the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic wounds...|$|R
