5|$|Bell {{assembled}} the Stanley Professionals in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any <b>games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> negative publicity received by Chicago due the Black Sox Scandal. He joined John Heisman's staff at Penn {{as an assistant}} coach in 1920, and Bell would remain there for several years. At Penn, he was well regarded as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities. At least as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing and frequenting Saratoga Race Course, where he counted as friends Tim Mara, Art Rooney, and George Preston Marshall. In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by Lud Wray, a fellow assistant coach. Bell's resignation was accommodated {{prior to the start of}} the 1929 season.|$|E

Choosha qualified via a wildcard and replaced long-distance runner Tonny Wamulwa who withdrew before the opening of the <b>Games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> injuries sustained in a road traffic accident on 9 July. Swimmers Zane Jordan and Jade Ashleigh Howard qualified for the Games via a universality place awarded by FINA as their best times of 59.33 and one minute and 1.24 seconds were not within the standard entry time.

5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing <b>games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Kanons influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on Kanon who thought that.|$|E
5|$|Three Olympiads had to {{pass without}} {{a celebration of the}} <b>Games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> war: the 1916 Games were {{cancelled}} because of World War I, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The Russo-Georgian War between Georgia and Russia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both President Bush and Prime Minister Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president Hu Jintao. When Nino Salukvadze of Georgia won the bronze medal in the 10metre air pistol competition, she stood on the medal podium with Natalia Paderina, a Russian shooter who had won the silver. In what became a much-publicised event from the Beijing Games, Salukvadze and Paderina embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended.|$|E
50|$|On September 28, 2008, Smith {{was fined}} $50,000 and {{suspended}} one <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a helmet-to-helmet collision with Anquan Boldin of the Arizona Cardinals, which caused Boldin to be hospitalized.|$|R
5000|$|Woody Hayes {{came into}} his first Rose Bowl tied for the {{national}} championship with PCC champion UCLA. However, #2 UCLA was locked out <b>of</b> the <b>game</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "no-repeat" [...] rule.|$|R
25|$|Before the game, the Bruins held a 6–1 {{record on}} the Bulldogs. The game was a public safety {{appreciation}} <b>game.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> a knee injury, Fresno State's top defense lineman Jon Monga did not play.|$|R
5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 <b>games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E
5|$|In two instances, the equestrian {{portion of}} the Olympics has been held in a {{different}} location {{from the rest of}} the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies. This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 <b>Games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier. The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and having to go through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also had the benefit of having better facilities, including a top equine hospital and one of only a few equine drug-testing labs in the world.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, Victoria Police {{said they}} were {{reluctant}} to cover Melbourne Victory <b>games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> behaviour by fans that they claimed was unacceptable. Problems included violence, anti-social behaviour and the lighting of flares.|$|E

50|$|The strike-shortened 1982 NFL season did {{not include}} a Bears-Packers <b>game.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this, it is not the longest {{continuous}} rivalry. That goes to the Lions-Packers, who have played at least twice each season since 1932.|$|R
25|$|St. Maelruain died in 792 and {{was buried}} in Tallaght. The {{influence}} of the monastery continued after his death, as can {{be judged by the}} fact that, in 806, the monks of Tallaght were able to prevent the holding of the Tailteann <b>Games,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> some infringement of their rights.|$|E
25|$|During {{his sophomore}} season Howard was {{selected}} to second-team All-ACC. He missed a few <b>games</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the flu, playing in 29 games and starting 28.

Howard earned third-team All-ACC and second team NABC All-District while trailing Darius Songaila in team scoring with 13.9 points per game during his junior season.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, the NFL Network {{broadcast}} its {{game between}} the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers to theaters in New York City, Boston and Los Angeles using {{state of the art}} 3-D technology. The viewings, which were limited to NFL and consumer electronics executives, served as a test for future use of 3D in NFL television <b>games.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> a technical glitch, the first half was not shown.|$|E
