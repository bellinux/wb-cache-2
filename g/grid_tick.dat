The post-batholithic rocks of the Volcanic Hills are composed of a thin veneer of basal conglomerates of the Split Mountain Formation that are overlain by olivine basalts of the Alverson Canyon Formation. Interflow sediments and mudflows are capped by an upper basalt flow. Basaltic and andesitic dikes cut all previous units. The volcanic rocks are unconformably overlain by the fine sands and muds of the Palm Springs Formation and the conglomerates of the Canebrake Conglomerate. A terrace deposit unconformably caps the section. Recent uplift has allowed the older sediment to be incised by the modern drainage. Several generations of faulting {{have occurred in the}} Volcanic Hills. Middle Alverson faulting has fractured the lower flows and localized the later intrusions along these zones of weakness. Post-Palm Springs-Canebrake faulting has formed most of the present landforms. Recent faulting is present with fault traces uncovered by modern alluvium. Volcanic rocks of similar composition and stratigraphic position are found seven miles to the south at Jacumba.

The Alverson Formation is exposed in several locations along the western margin of the Salton Trough from the Mexican-U. S. border north to the Fish Creek Mountains. These early-mid Miocene volcanic rocks and associated alluvial sediments may record the initial rifting and extension of the northern proto-Gulf of California. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the nature and relationship between the scattered volcanic sequences in order to better understand their origin. Samples were collected from Painted Gorge, Fossil Canyon, and Butaca Canyon in the southeastern Coyote Mountains, from northern Red Rock Canyon in the Fish Creek Mountains, and from Superstition Mountain. The samples were analyzed using x-ray fluorescence to determine major and trace element characteristics. Na 2 O was analyzed by atomic absorption techniques. Detailed petrographic study of the samples was also performed. The petrographic and geochemical study of these volcanic flows allows delineation of separate alkalic and tholeiitic sequences. Alkali olivine basalt flows occur in Superstition Mountain and in Fossil and Butaca Canyons. These flows are older than 16 m. y. and are chemically distinct in that they have high K 2 O/Na 2 O ratios (> 1) and extremely high concentrations of K, Ba, Sr, and Rb. They are generally low-alumina basalts and have higher TiO 2 concentration than the tholeiites. Olivine tholeiites occur in Painted Gorge and northern Red Rock Canyon. They are generally younger than 16 m. y. Chemically, the tholeiites have much lower TiO 2, K 2 O, Ba, and Rb and generally higher K/Rb ratios than the alkali basalts. The tholeiites are generally high-alumina. The volcanic sequences of the Alverson Formation within the Salton Trough reflect the initiation of basaltic volcanism that accompanied the extensional tectonics related to the conversion from oblique subduction to transform motion along the western margin of the North American plate during Miocene time in Southern California. The differing chemistry and petrology of the alkali and tholeiite volcanic series from the Alverson Formation suggest separate depths of basalt genesis for the two sequences. The nepheline-normative alkali olivine basalts probably resulted from partial melting and magma segregation at mantle depths between 35 - 70 km. The tholeiitic basalts may have resulted from partial melting and magma segregation in the upper mantle at depths of about 30 km, giving rise to high-alumina basalts. The compositional change of the magmas from alkali olivine to high-alumina olivine tholeiite suggests a decreasing depth to the zone of magma generation with time. This records an increasing geothermal gradient related to the onset of continental rifting within the Salton Trough region of the proto-Gulf of California beginning 21 m. y. ago. The extremely high concentration of K, Rb, Sr, Ba, and SiO 2 was partially caused by the contamination of these basalts that occurred as the flows rose through rifting continental crust...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a model which {{accommodates}} {{the assumption of}} a continuous efficient price with the inherent properties of ultra-high-frequency transaction data (price discreteness, irregular temporal spacing, diurnal patterns [...] .). Our approach consists in designing a stochastic mechanism for deriving the transaction prices from the latent efficient price. The main idea behind the model is that, if a transaction occurs at some value on the <b>tick</b> <b>grid</b> and leads to a price change, then the efficient price has been close enough to this value shortly before the transaction. We call uncertainty zones the bands around the mid-tick grid where the efficient price is {{too far from the}} <b>tick</b> <b>grid</b> to trigger a price change. In our setting, the width of these uncertainty zones quantifies the aversion to price changes of the market participants. Furthermore, this model enables us to derive approximated values of the efficient price at some random times, which is particularly useful for building statistical procedures. Convincing results are obtained through a simulation study {{and the use of the}} model over 10 representative stocks. Copyright The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

Title of map on Plate I: Geologic mapBibliography: pages 152 - 161 The study area lies in the Yuha desert near the western margin of the Salton Trough structural province and is centered on the northern extension of the Laguna Salada fault zone. The focus of this study is an analysis of the interrelationship between different phases of late Cenozoic structural development and their relationship with the Elsinore and southern Laguna Salada faults which trend towards the study area from the northwest and southeast, respectively. The northern Laguna Salada fault is not comprised of a single break in this area. Rather, the geometry of dextral faulting is complicated and represented by both left-stepping and right-stepping strands, not all of which have been active synchronously. Within {{the southern part of the}} field area, the Laguna Salada fault apparently steps left across Lucy Ridge producing a broad area of elevated topography. Just north of the border, the present activity steps right to the Sunrise Butte strand and then steps left again at Yuha Basin to become the Elsinore fault. Older strands are also present and indicate that the complexity of stepping patterns has changed with time. Field mapping identified an area dominated by a northeast structural grain which is rotated clockwise near the Laguna Salada fault. Excellent exposures of detachment-related, normal faults in progressive stages of development were found. A pervasive tectonic fabric of the rocks also attest to the regional extension. Structural analyses indicate the strata has undergone two deformational events resulting in superposed folds. The first-order folding is about a northeast trending axis whereas the second-order folding is about a west-northwest trending axis. Field data, kinematic indicators and the structural analyses support the following interpretation of the deformational events. The first event is related to extension in a northeast-southwest direction. This extension produced northeast trending folds, detachment-related faults, tilted homoclinal fault blocks and a pervasive low-angle tectonic fabric. The second, less pronounced, event was due primarily to wrench-related stresses associated with the present Laguna Salada fault zone. The wrench deformation produced west-northwest trending folds, associated faulting and horizontal rotation of blocks. The magnitude of this rotation is directly proportional to the proximity of the wrench fault. The deformation associated with both events involve the basement rock, the Pliocene Imperial Formation and the Pleistocene Palm Spring Formation indicating the youngest documented evidence of detachment faulting in the Salton Trough region. The Salton Trough and other subsidiary basins, such as the Laguna Salada basin, are postulated to be the source of the regional extension experienced in this area. This idea is also suggested by gravity trends. Therefore, the study area is important as it provides an excellent opportunity to study the complex stress interactions, in particular extensional deformation, generated in oblique pull-apart systems...|$|R

Dashed line represents half-interval contours. Datum is mean sea level. One hundred twenty-seven species of Upper Cretaceous Foraminiferida were recovered from a sandstone-siltstone sequence in Letterbox Canyon southeast of Carlsbad, San Diego County, California. This rich fauna offers a new evaluation to the Campanian-Maestrichtian boundary in the sedimentary rocks of the Southern California Coastal Plain. These Upper Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are temporarily assigned to the Rosario Formation of Baja California, Mexico. In Letterbox Canyon, they lie nonconformably on the Lower Cretaceous Green Valley Tonalite of the crystalline basement complex and are overlain unconformably by the sandstones of the Eocene Delmar Formation. Two distinct faunules are established from the Rosario beds. The Frondicularia goldfussi faunule which is late Campanian in age, and the Nodosarella gracillima faunule which is early Maestrichtian. The Nodosarella gracillima faunule is correlated with the Globotruncana fornicata-Globotruncana tricarinata assemblagezone of the Navesink Formation of the New Jersey coastal plain. It is also correlated with the uppermost beds of the Navarro group from the Gulf coastal area and with formations from Australia, Tunisia, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad B. W. I.

Cretaceous time. They are typically composed of mildly metamorphosed volcanic, volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks that crop out in a N-S trending belt from San Diego to Riverside, California. The objectives of this thesis were to outline and define the geochemical character of the Santiago Peak Volcanics, deduce the tectonic environment of this ancient island-arc system from the stratigraphic, geochemical and petrographic relationships, and to constrain the polarity and orientation of the paleo- subduction zone. XRF analyses of major and selected trace elements for the basaltic and andesitic flows show that the ancient island arc {{can be divided into}} a calc-alkaline series and a tholeiitic series. The calc-alkaline rocks are exposed in the northern portion of the volcanic belt and the tholeiitic rocks are found in the south. Geochemical plots, such as FeO*/MgO-SiO 2, FeO*/MgO-FeO*, AFM and Zr-Ti-Sr diagrams, were used to distinguish between the two suites of rocks. These trends are similar to those in both the Japanese and Aleutian arc systems. The Japanese arc exhibits an across-arc change from tholeiitic rocks nearest the trench to calc-alkaline rocks toward the continent whereas the Aleutian arc shows a trend from tholeiitic to calc-alkaline nature along strike of the arc. Whether the variation in chemistry is an across-arc or an along-arc trend, the conclusion is the same. The subduction zone was located parallel to the rocks of tholeiitic character and must have dipped to the northeast under the present-day exposures of the Santiago Peak Volcanics...|$|R

With high grade uranium deposits diminishing and demands for uranium increasing, the abundant low grade vein deposits of Nevada look more promising. Anomalously radioactive areas occur in the Cretaceous quartz monzonite (Toquima pluton) one mile east of Round Mountain, Nevada. A scintillometer grid was correlated with geologic variables noted in an approximate twelve square mile area. Thin sections, colorimetric uranium assays, auto radiographs, and a micro-probe were used to identify and correlate radioactive mineralization. Surface and Subsurface workings were studied for weathering variations. Primary radioactive accessory minerals apatite and zircon were nonsystematic in their occurrence throughout the area studied, but were always in greater abundance in anomalous zones. Radioactive monazite and allanite (?) occurred in trace amounts only in anomalous zones. All four minerals occur either disseminated or associated with opaque/mafic clusters of brookite and dravite. Anomalous radioactivity is due primarily to autunite, a secondary uranium bearing mineral. It occurs intersticially and within sericitized potassium feldspars. Sericitization of potassium feldspars is greatest within fault and shear zones; however, autunite is not necessarily an indicator of a primary uranium deposit. Hydrogeochemical studies indicate autunite precipitates in water with a very low carbonate and sulfate content (approximately 0. 2 meq/l.); therefore, autunite mineralization is caused by local hydrogeochemical conditions and not by an exceptionally high uranium content. The Toquima pluton appears to be a typical quartz monzonite averaging 1. 9 - 4 ppm uranium. Background radiation averages 70 c. p. s [...] Fault and shear zones range from a low of 35 ppm U 308 to a high of 6, 100 ppm U 308. An average granite averages 4 ppm U 308.

Except for minor differences, the design {{is essentially the same}} for Universal Transverse Mercator grids, Universal Polar Stereographic grids, and nonstandard grids. The maps usually show <b>grid</b> lines and <b>ticks,</b> their values, <b>grid</b> letters, and notes in the margin identifying the grid and the grid zone designation. Variations in the specifications for particular types of products at 1 : 1, 000, 000 scale exist. The individual product specifications must be followed. A typical treatment is shown in figure 34. 8 - 2 THE MAJOR GRID. 8 - 2. 1 The major grid is shown by full lines at 100, 000 -unit intervals, intersected by ticks at 10, 000 -unit intervals. Where a grid line coincides with a neatline of the map, the grid line and its intersecting ticks are omitted. However, the neatline is labeled in the margin with the values for tho grid line. 8 - 2. 2 Grid values appear outside the neatline on all four sides of the sheet, labeling each grid line. They may also label only the first grid line in each direction from the southwest corner. Except for the values labeling the first grid line in each direction from the southwest corner of the sheet, the last four digits (0000) of the values are omitted. The values are shown in two sizes of type, with the larger size being used for the principal digits...|$|R
40|$|The Windowed Observation of Relative Motion, WORM, {{program is}} {{primarily}} {{intended for the}} generation of simple X-Y plots from data created by other programs. It allows the user to label, zoom, and change the scale of various plots. Three dimensional contour and line plots are provided, although with more limited capabilities. The input data can be in binary or ASCII format, although all data {{must be in the}} same format. A great deal of control over the details of the plot is provided, such as <b>gridding,</b> size of <b>tick</b> marks, colors, log/semilog capability, time tagging, and multiple and phase plane plots. Many color and monochrome graphics terminals and hard copy printer/plotters are supported. The WORM executive commands, menu selections and macro files can be used to develop plots and tabular data, query the WORM Help library, retrieve data from input files, and invoke VAX DCL commands. WORM generated plots are displayed on local graphics terminals and can be copied using standard hard copy capabilities. Some of the graphics features of WORM include: zooming and dezooming various portions of the plot; plot documentation including curve labeling and function listing; multiple curves on the same plot; windowing of multiple plots and insets of the same plot; displaying a specific on a curve; and spinning the curve left, right, up, and down. WORM is written in PASCAL for interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX computer operating under VMS 4. 7 with a virtual memory requirement of approximately 392 K of 8 bit bytes. It uses the QPLOT device independent graphics library included with WORM. It was developed in 1988...|$|R
