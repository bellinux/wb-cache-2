25|$|For example, {{consider}} the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort. This solves {{the problem of}} sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time.|$|E
25|$|That is, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> NP, {{the class}} of nondeterministic {{polynomial}} time problems, can be contained in the non-uniform polynomial time complexity class P/poly, then this assumption implies {{the collapse of the}} polynomial hierarchy at its second level. Such a collapse is believed unlikely, so the theorem is generally viewed by complexity theorists as evidence for the nonexistence of polynomial size circuits for SAT or for other NP-complete problems. A proof that such circuits do not exist would imply that P ≠ NP. As P/poly contains all problems solvable in randomized polynomial time (Adleman's theorem), the Karp–Lipton theorem is also evidence that the use of randomization does not lead to polynomial time algorithms for NP-complete problems.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} claim, {{that while}} acceptance of Jordanes {{at face value}} may be too naive, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes says that the Goths originated in Scandinavia 1490 BC. Austrian historian Herwig Wolfram, believes {{that there might be}} a kernel of truth in that claim, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> a clan of the Gutae left Scandinavia long before the establishment of the Amali in the leadership of the Goths. This clan might have contributed to the ethnogenesis of the Gutones in east Pomerania (see Wielbark culture). Another example is the name of the king Cniva which David S. Potter thinks is genuine because, since it doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.|$|E

25|$|Sumati Shatakam, {{which is}} a neeti ("moral"), {{is one of the}} most famous Telugu Shatakams. Shatakam is {{composed}} of more than a 100 padyalu (poems). According to many literary critics Sumati Shatakam was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu (Telugu: బద్దెన భూపాల) (CE 1220–1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi, and a pupil of Tikkana. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the Sumati Shatakam was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and the Sarveswara Satakam of Yathavakkula Annamayya. The Sumatee Shatakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as C. P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|In his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash {{proposed}} two {{interpretations of}} his equilibrium concept, {{with the objective}} of showing how equilibrium points ``(...) can be connected with observable phenomenon. One interpretation is rationalistic: <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> players are rational, know the full structure of the game, the game is played just once, and there is just one Nash equilibrium, then players will play according to that equilibrium. This idea was formalized by Aumann, R. and A. Brandenburger, 1995, ``Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium, Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly know, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players. In this case, the conjectures need only be mutually known).|$|E
