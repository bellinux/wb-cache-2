These solutions can be superposed to create more complex flows satisfying a variety of boundary conditions. These flows correspond closely to real-life flows over the whole of fluid mechanics; in addition, many valuable insights arise when considering the deviation (often slight) between an observed flow and the corresponding potential flow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>vortex</b> models (FVM) and Lagrangian {{particle}} vortex methods (LPVM) {{are both}} active {{areas of research}} that seek to increase modelling accuracy by accounting {{for more of the}} three-dimensional and unsteady flow effects than either BEM or RANS. FVM is similar to lifting line theory in that it assumes that the wind turbine rotor is shedding either a continuous vortex filament from the blade tips (and often the root), or a continuous vortex sheet from the blades' trailing edges. LPVM can use a variety of methods to introduce vorticity into the wake. Biot-Savart summation is used to determine the induced flow field of these wake vorticies' circulations, allowing for better approximations of the local flow over the rotor blades. These methods have largely confirmed much of the applicability of BEM and shed insight into the structure of wind turbine wakes. FVM has limitations due to its origin in potential flow theory, such as not explicitly modelling model viscous behavior (without semi-empirical core models), though LPVM is a fully viscous method. LPVM is more computationally intensive than either FVM or RANS, and FVM still relies on blade element theory for the blade forces.|$|E

50|$|BEM {{is widely}} used due to its {{simplicity}} and overall accuracy, but its originating assumptions limit its use when the rotor disk is yawed, or when other non-axisymmetric effects (like the rotor wake) influence the flow. Limited success at improving predictive accuracy has been made using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and other similar three-dimensional models such as <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> methods. These are very computationally intensive simulations to perform for several reasons. First, the solver must accurately model the far-field flow conditions, which can extend several rotor diameters up- and down-stream and include atmospheric boundary layer turbulence, {{while at the same}} time resolving the small-scale boundary-layer flow conditions at the blades' surface (necessary to capture blade stall). In addition, many CFD solvers have difficulty meshing parts that move and deform, such as the rotor blades. Finally, there are many dynamic flow phenomena that are not easily modelled by RANS, such as dynamic stall and tower shadow. Due to the computational complexity, it is not currently practical to use these advanced methods for wind turbine design, though research continues in these and other areas related to helicopter and wind turbine aerodynamics.|$|E

Experimental results show that the mass transfer performance of unbaffled systems is mainly affected by specific power consumption. Among the stirrer geometries investigated a simple PBT was found to provide the most interesting oxygen transfer performance in the sub-critical regime, and can therefore be regarded as a particularly suitable stirrer for shear sensitive cultures. As regards the super-critical regime, unbaffled tanks are found to provide a performance comparable with that of the standard (baffled) bioreactors, hence resulting in a viable alternative also for fermentations involving robust cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{axial forces}} in a propeller-rudder {{interactive}} system working in uniform flow are theoretically studied: 	In a steady linear method the propeller is represented by bound and <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> systems, the rudder by vortex and source filaments and the rudder wake by <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> filaments. A lifting-line analysis method predicts the propeller characteristics. A vortex lattice method determines the rudder vortex strengths. Comparisons of the axial forces with systematic experiments show a qualitative agreement. 	A thick rudder located in the accelerating flow just behind a propeller experiences a pressure drag. It is shown that this drag is an internal force which is counterbalanced by part of the increased propeller thrust. Due to the tangential velocities in the propeller slipstream a rudder thrust is created. The rudder in the test cases recovers 39 % of the rotational energy, transforms 14 % into radial energy and leaves 26 % behind. The remaining 21 % should in principle have transformed into axial energy but is missing according to the linear method. The drawback of the linear method is that the boundary conditions at the <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> system of the propeller are not satisfied. A semi-nonlinear method is developed where the boundary condition that the static pressure is the same on {{the two sides of}} the <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> sheet of a simplified propeller is fulfilled. As a result the strength-density variations of the propeller <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> sheet due to the rudder disturbance are taken into account. The rudder thrust computed by the method is 4 % lower than that given by a corresponding linear method for a propeller at C T = 1. 1. A nonlinear method is developed where also the boundary conditions of zero normal velocity at the propeller <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> sheet is satisfied, resulting in a deformed slipstream. A smaller, improved rudder thrust is obtained. For a propeller at C T = 1. 1, the rudder thrust is 8 % lower than that obtained by a corresponding linear method; For another propeller at C T = 3. 0, the rudder thrust is 21 % lower than that obtained by a linear method. </UL...|$|E

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{information}} exists on the breakdown of incompressible streamwise vortices. Less is known about vortex breakdown at high speeds. An interesting example of supersonic vortex breakdown is the breakdown induced by the interaction of vortices with shock waves. The flow in supersonic engine inlets and over high-speed delta wings constitute technologically important examples of this phenomenon, which is termed 'shock-induced vortex breakdown'. In this report, we propose a model to predict the onset of shock-induced vortex breakdown. The proposed model has no adjustable constants, and is compared to both experiment and computation. The model is then extended to consider two other problems: the breakdown of a <b>free</b> compressible <b>vortex,</b> and <b>free</b> incompressible <b>vortex</b> breakdown. The same breakdown criterion is used in all three problems to predict the onset of breakdown.

Its applicability in these cases is not yet fully verified. In this paper, {{the validity of the}} assumptions of quasi-steady state and annuli independence of the blade element momentum theory for unsteady, radially varied, axi-symmetric load cases is investigated. Firstly, a free wake model that combines a vortex ring model with a semi-infinite cylindrical vortex tube was developed and applied to an actuator disc in three load cases: (i) steady uniform and radially varied, (ii) two types of unsteady uniform load and (iii) unsteady radially varied load. Results from the three cases were compared with Momentum Theory and also with two widely used engineering dynamic inflow models—the Pitt-Peters and the Øye for the unsteady load cases.

The objectives of this study were to explore the behaviour of the <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> in three dimensions, with a particular focus on the distortions caused to the vortex by the presence of a solid boundary, or wall. Threedimensional numerical simulations and experimentally obtained schlieren photographs reveal significant distortion and bending of the <b>free</b> <b>vortex</b> in regions near the boundary of the flow domain, so as to meet it at a right angle. Experimentation was performed in a shock tube for incident shock Mach numbers of 1. 32, 1. 42, and 1. 65, with four test models, two incorporating straight diffraction edges, and two incorporating curved diffracting edges.
