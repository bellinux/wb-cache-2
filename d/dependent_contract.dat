40|$|Theme: Soft Computing Techniques for Advanced Manufacturing and Service SystemsIn this paper, {{we first}} study the {{performance}} of a supply chain consisting of one retailer and one supplier. The supplier sets the price scheme of some goods and the retailer then decides the order level and sells the goods in the market. Specifically, a quadratic cost function is assumed here to approximate the U-shape cost curve commonly observed in industries. Two kinds of contracts offered by the supplier are investigated, namely wholesale price contract and quantity <b>dependent</b> <b>contract.</b> Wholesale price is fixed under the first contract but varies depending on order level under the second one. We show that certain wholesale price contract successfully induces the retailer to order at a level such that supply chain profit is maximized, but extra cost in implementation may occur due to supplier's disagreement on this price. Given this, we propose an efficiency measure to show to what extent the wholesale price contract helps to increase supply chain profit. For quantity <b>dependent</b> <b>contract,</b> we show that it can coordinate the supply chain and leads to a proportional division of supply chain profit. We then generalize the analysis to cover the case of multiple retailers and single supplier where similar results are also obtained. published_or_final_versionThe 40 th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, (CIE 2010), Hyogo, Japan, 25 - 28 July 2010.

40|$|Behavioral {{software}} contracts supplement interface {{information with}} logical assertions. A rigorous enforcement of contracts provides useful feedback to developers if it signals contract violations {{as soon as}} they occur and if it assigns blame to violators with precise explanations. Correct blame assignment gets programmers started with the debugging process and can significantly decrease the time needed to discover and fix bugs. Sadly the literature on contracts lacks a framework for making statements about the correctness of blame assignment and for validating such statements. This paper fills the gap and uses the framework to demonstrate how one of the proposed semantics for higher-order contracts satisfies this criteria and another semantics occasionally assigns blame to the wrong module. Concretely, the paper applies the framework to the lax enforcement of dependent higher-order contracts and the picky one. A higher-order <b>dependent</b> <b>contract</b> specifies constraints for the domain and range of higher-order functions and also relates arguments and results in auxiliary assertions. The picky semantics ensures that the use of arguments in the auxiliary assertion satisfies the domain contracts and the lax one does not. While the picky semantics discovers more contract violations than the lax one, it occasionally blames the wrong module. Hence the paper also introduces a third semantics, dubbed indy, which fixes the problems of the picky semantics without giving up its advantages...|$|E

40|$|Contracts are {{a popular}} {{mechanism}} for enhancing the interface of components. In {{the world of}} first-order functions, programmers embrace contracts because they write them in a familiar language and easily understand them {{as a pair of}} a precondition and a post-condition. In a higher-order world, contracts offer the same expressiveness to programmers but their meaning subtly differs from the familiar first-order notion. For instance, it is unclear what the behavior of <b>dependent</b> <b>contracts</b> for higher-order functions or of contracts for mutable data should be. As a consequence, it is difficult to design monitoring systems for such higher-order worlds. In response to this problem, this dissertation investigates complete monitors, a formal framework for deciding if a contract system is correct. The intuition behind the framework is that a correct contract system should: • mediate the exchange of values between contracted components • and blame correctly in case of contract violations...|$|R
40|$|In Italy {{over the}} last decade non-typical labour {{contracts}} have been increasingly used. Among them, much {{attention has been paid to}} the so-called "collaborazione coordinata e continuativa" (co. co. co.) contracts. These contracts may provide a buffer to entrants, displaced or retiring workers, i. e. they can complement standard open-ended <b>dependent</b> <b>contracts</b> during career transition phases. However, if they become a substitute for standard contracts in every phase of the working career, then a segment of workers at-risk-ofsocial-exclusion could emerge. Hence, it becomes crucial to analyse the careers of co. co. co. workers. Our first goal is to learn if, within the "co. co. co. world", a group of at-risk workers actually exists; then, we will try to shed some light upon those workers' careers. We use a dataset unique to Italian labour research, the Work Histories Italian Panel (WHIP). It is a longitudinal random sample of individuals drawn from the social security administration (INPS) archive; through WHIP the co. co. co. archive ("Gestione Separata") can be linked to other archives (e. g. the private sector dependent workers' archive) and can be observed for the longest time span available for this type of data at the moment, i. e. from the birth of the "Gestione Separata" (1996) to 1999. It becomes apparent that two different groups of individuals contribute to the "Gestione Separata": highly skilled individuals, who enjoy a good position in the labour market (managers and professionals) and the ones we call "parasubordinati strictu sensu". "Parasubordinati" are young, receive lower annual wages and most of them are women and/or low-skilled. The brevity of the available time series (only one year for "parasubordinati strictu sensu") reduces the longitudinal analysis to the very short run. We observe a very gradual inflow into the "Gestione Separata" of the 1999 stock of "parasubordinati strictu sensu". The estimated probability to switch to a <b>dependent</b> labour <b>contract</b> seems to be higher for younger, low-paid individuals, particularly if they move geographically. Finally, and predominately for women, the co. co. co. contract seems like an alternative to a part-time job. ...|$|R

40|$|Since Findler and Felleisen {{introduced}} higher-order contracts, many variants {{have been}} proposed. Broadly, these {{fall into two}} groups: some follow Findler and Felleisen in using latent contracts, purely dynamic checks that are transparent to the type system; others use manifest contracts, where refinement types record the most recent check that {{has been applied to}} each value. These two approaches are commonly assumed to be equivalent-different ways of implementing the same idea, one retaining a simple type system, and the other providing more static information. Our goal is to formalize and clarify this folklore understanding. Our work extends that of Gronski and Flanagan, who defined a latent calculus lambdac and a manifest calculus lambdah, gave a translation phi from lambdac to lambdah, and proved that, if a lambdac term reduces to a constant, then so does its phiimage. We enrich their account with a translation psi from lambdah to lambdac and prove an analogous theorem. We then generalize the whole framework to <b>dependent</b> <b>contracts,</b> whose predicates can mention free variables. This extension is both pragmatically crucial, supporting a much more interesting range of contracts, and theoretically challenging. We define dependent versions of lambdah and two dialects (“lax” and “picky”) of lambdac, establish type soundness-a substantial result in itself, for lambdah-and extend phi and psi accordingly. Surprisingly, the intuition that the latent and manifest systems are equivalent now breaks down: the extended translations preserve behavior in one direction but, in the other, sometimes yield terms that blame more...|$|R

Poultry is the first ani-mal industry to industrialize and its model of contract farming has been emulated by other animal industries.

Asymmetrical power relationships shift waste management responsibilities to growers {{in a number of}} ways. This paper details maneuvers poultry integrators use to avoid environmental risk and transfer it to their contract growers. Corporations "pass the cluck " when they shift responsibility for achieving regulatory compliance to the farmer who then must seek technical and financial assistance from public agencies. Poul-try integrators "dodge pullets " when they retain ownership of live animals, but dead birds become the fanner's property and disposal problem.
