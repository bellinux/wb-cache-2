40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} increased aid flows from industrial to developing countries on growth in transferr ing and recipient countries. One key variable in the analysis is the ter ms of trade which links the analysis to the classic transfer debate. Th e analysis is centered around policy simulations with a small, structuralist general equilibrium model of North-South interactions. Simulation exercises for a doubling of official development assistan ce up to the DAC target of 0. 7 percent of the GNP of the industrialized countries show the great sensitivity of the global adjustment proces ses {{to the way in}} which these transfers are <b>financed.</b> <b>The</b> model results suggest that deficit financing under monetary constraints may trigge r a global recession and a secondary burden falls on the recipient countries in the form of a strong decline in their terms of trade. Tax-financing or <b>financing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> transfer through budget cuts can help to avoid the global recessionary effects and recipients may gai n from <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> transfer. Evidently, <b>the</b> global economic environment an d macroeconomic policies in the industrialized countries are an import ant component in determining <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>aid</b> to developing countries.

40|$|This {{research}} has been performed to assess {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and how much each donor is getting involved in Official Development Aid (ODA) contribution. My sources for data are the World Bank, FRED from St. Louis Fed and OECD databases. Using Excel statistical tools, I have got empirical ratios that show the level of MDG compliance. In addition, I estimate an econometric model to understand the determinants of ODA and obtain a measure of political will in each country. This study finds that most of OECD countries haven’t kept their aid promises. Their governments tend to prioritize other expenditures over ODA pledges. The report shows which countries have already reached the traditionally accepted 0, 7 % target (ODA provided as percentage of GNI). I argue that most of them haven’t done so {{due to the lack of}} political will towards <b>aid</b> contribution. <b>The</b> results of the estimate model also indicate that neither the economic situation nor the political party in power have to do with the commitment default. Finally, I recommend an alternative design of ODA agenda along three guidelines. First, budget adjustments for the coming years in order to <b>finance</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> gap. Second, ODA redefinition in order to avoid aid inflation. Third, require an ODA target in accordance with the economic situation of each country.

Currently the number of applicants applying for financial aid has increased leading to challenges of errors and bias in the selection and award process due to overwhelming data which becomes too complex for the committees to analyse. This has led to some more deserving students not receiving <b>the</b> financial <b>aid</b> due to inaccuracies.
