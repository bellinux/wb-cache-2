In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> only those who have gone had schools named after them.

Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean.

She suggested the idea to her brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla, who began co-writing the track with her and Selena y Los Dinos backup vocalist Pete Astudillo. [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] was recorded at a studio in San Antonio, Texas.

Brandon Flowers of the American rock band The Killers has revealed his admiration for Morrissey on several occasions and admits that his interest for writing songs about murder such as [...] "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine" [...] and [...] "Midnight Show" [...] traces back to Morrissey singing about loving [...] "the romance of crime" [...] in the song [...] "Sister I'm a Poet".

2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, [...] "I think {{there has to be a}} difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got to have the kind of relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, [...] "you’ll see a couple of things you haven’t seen in a while".|$|E

2500|$|Raging Bull {{came about}} when De Niro read the [...] {{on the set}} of The Godfather Part II. Although {{disappointed}} by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese {{on the set of}} Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in the hope that he would consider the project. Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to sit in the director's chair, claiming {{he had no idea what}} Raging Bull was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, [...] "A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp."

[...] The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said [...] "the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. After nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be [...] "an allegory for whatever you do in life”, which for him paralleled moviemaking, “you make movies, you’re in the ring each time.” ...|$|E
