500|$|... "No Debes Jugar" [...] is an uptempo Mexican cumbia {{song with}} {{influences}} of Rock en Español. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics who praised its originality and mixing of music genres. [...] "No Debes Jugar" [...] received a [...] "Song of the Year" [...] nomination from the 1994 Tejano Music Awards and the 1994 Lo Nuestro Awards. The song has been covered by Mexican American singer Jennifer Peña, Puerto Rican salsa singer La India, Mexican contestant Érika Alcocer Luna, and Mexican band Banda El <b>Grullo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Blue Roan is true roan {{on a black}} coat. The mane, tail, head, {{and legs}} remain black, while the body takes on a grayish or bluish appearance. Blue roans are {{sometimes}} mistaken for grays or <b>grullos.</b> However, Grays fade with age, while roans do not; and <b>grullos</b> are blue duns and possess dun markings but not intermingled white hairs.|$|R

500|$|The Heck {{horse is}} a horse breed that is claimed to {{resemble}} the tarpan (Equus ferus ferus), an extinct wild equine. [...] The breed {{was created by the}} German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck in an attempt to breed back the tarpan. Although unsuccessful at creating a genetic copy of the extinct species, they developed a breed with <b>grullo</b> coloration and primitive markings. After the Nazi invasion of Poland, they were introduced to the Białowieża Forest, where a small herd still survives. Heck horses were subsequently exported to the United States, where a breed association was created in the 1960s.|$|E
500|$|Heck {{horses are}} dun or <b>grullo</b> (a dun variant) in color, with no white markings. The breed has {{primitive}} markings, including a dorsal stripe and horizontal striping on the legs. Heck horses generally stand between [...] tall. [...] The head is large, the withers low, and {{the legs and}} hindquarters strong. The hooves are strong, often not needing shoeing. [...] The gait of the Heck horse is high stepping, which makes them comfortable to ride and which is considered attractive while being driven. The breed is described as being calm, friendly, curious and intelligent, although very independent. The physical description of tarpans was very similar - strong, approximately the same height, and with the same coloration and primitive markings.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the genes}} {{underlying}} tobiano, dominant white, frame overo spotting and the Leopard complex {{common to the}} Appaloosa, the champagne gene {{does not affect the}} location of pigment-producing cells in the skin. Nor does the champagne gene remove all pigment from the skin and hair, as in albinism. Instead, the champagne gene produces traits known as hypomelanism, or dilution. Champagne is not associated with any health defects. Other dilution genes in horses include the Cream gene, Dun gene, Pearl gene and Silver dapple gene. Horses affected by these genes can sometimes be confused with champagnes, but champagnes are genetically distinct. Champagnes are not palominos, buckskins, or <b>grullos,</b> nor does the word champagne indicate that a horse is a shiny or light shade of another coat color.|$|R
5000|$|Smoky black foals {{must always}} {{have at least}} one parent with the cream dilute gene and at least one parent that carries the [...] "E" [...] {{extension}} gene associated with black coloring. This could occur one of two ways: A foal could have a smoky black parent or a buckskin parent carrying both genes within a single horse. A smoky black could also be produced by breeding one horse with only the cream dilution, such as a palomino, to a bay or black horse carrying only the extension gene, but no cream dilution. As foals, smoky blacks are typically quite silvery, and may be mistaken for <b>grullos,</b> especially when born with primitive countershading. Smoky black foals are sometimes born with reddish tufts of hair in their ears. However, both traits are also seen in many true black foals as well.|$|R
500|$|Sorraia are {{generally}} dun or a dun variation called <b>grullo.</b> [...] Dun coloring includes primitive markings {{such as a}} black dorsal stripe, black tipped ears, horizontal striping on the legs and a dark muzzle area. [...] The dark muzzle area {{is in contrast to}} some other dun-colored horse breeds, who have light-colored muzzle areas and underbellies, possibly due to the presence of pangare genetics. Sorraia horses have bi-colored manes and tails with lighter colored hairs that fringe the outside of the longer growing black hair. This is a characteristic shared with other predominantly dun-colored breeds, such as the Fjord horse. [...] Purebred Sorraia occasionally have white markings, although they are rare and undesired by the breed's studbook.|$|E
500|$|Dominican salsa singer Jose Alberto [...] "El Canario" [...] {{covered the}} {{song for the}} tribute album Familia RMM Recordando a Selena (1996). Mexican mariachi group Banda El <b>Grullo</b> {{recorded}} the track for their album 30 Números 1 en Banda. Mexican group Liberación recorded the song for the tribute album Mexico Recuerda a Selena (2005). Mexican singer Gerardo Williams covered the song for his album Nuevas Voces de América. Mexican pop singer Paulina Rubio performed and recorded [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] for the live televised tribute concert Selena ¡VIVE! in April 2005. Michael Clark of the Houston Chronicle wrote that Rubio used her [...] "sex appeal" [...] while performing the song. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News called Rubio's version a [...] "techno/hip-hop number". Rubio performed [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] once more during her tour in Texas that same year.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{is known}} that the Sorraia {{developed}} {{in the southern part of}} the Iberian peninsula, the breed was isolated and unknown to science until the 20th century. [...] Despite the lack of documentation, attempts have been made to reconstruct its history. Paleolithic parietal art images in the region depict equines with a distinct likeness to the Sorraia, with similar zebra-like markings. Analysis of mtDNA has been performed on Mustangs in the western United States that show similar mtDNA patterns between some Mustangs and the Sorraia breed. Spanish conquistadors took Iberian horses, some of whom closely resembled the modern-day Sorraia, to the Americas in their conquests, probably as pack animals. [...] Similarities between the Sorraia and several North and South American breeds are shown in the dun and <b>grullo</b> coloring and various physical characteristics. This evidence suggests that the Sorraia, their ancestors, or other horses with similar features, may have had a long history in the Iberian region and a role in the creation of American breeds.|$|E
500|$|The Florida Cracker Horse is {{also known}} as the Chickasaw Pony, Seminole Pony, Prairie Pony, Florida Horse, Florida Cow Pony and Grass Gut. The modern breed retains the size of its Spanish ancestors, {{standing}} [...] high and weighing [...] They are found mainly in bay, black and gray, although <b>grullo,</b> dun and chestnut are also seen. Roan and pinto colors are occasionally found. They have straight or slightly concave profiles, strong backs and sloping croups. They are known for their speed and agility and excel at trail and endurance riding, and are also used extensively as stock horses. They are sometimes seen in Western riding sports such as working cow horse, team roping and team penning. The Florida Cracker is a gaited horse, with the breed association recognizing two gaits, the running walk and amble, in addition to the regular walk, trot, canter and gallop. The single-footed ambling gait is known as the [...] "coon rack" [...] by some breed enthusiasts. The foundation genetics of the breed are the same as many others developed from Spanish stock in North and South America, including the Paso Fino, Peruvian Paso and Criollo. The Cracker horse is very similar in type and genetics to the Carolina Marsh Tacky and the Banker horse, both Spanish-style breeds from the eastern United States, but DNA testing has proven that these are separate breeds.|$|E
500|$|The Marsh Tacky {{generally}} {{stands between}} [...] high, although the acceptable range is between [...] high. Today, the breed {{comes in a}} wide variety of colors, including dun, bay, roan, chestnut, black and <b>grullo.</b> Historically, multi-colored patterns such as pinto were found, but they were not selected for when breeding, and today are not seen. The colors today are consistent with those of other Colonial Spanish horses. The profile of the breed's head is usually flat or somewhat concave, becoming slightly convex from the nasal region to the top of the muzzle. The forehead is wide and the eyes set well apart. The breed typically has a slight ewe neck, and the neck is attached low on the chest compared to many other breeds. The withers are pronounced, the back short and strong, and the croup steeply angled. The chest is deep but narrow and the shoulder long and angled. The legs have long, tapering muscling, with in general no feathering on the lower legs. The Marsh Tacky exhibits a four-beat ambling gait, most similar to the marcha batida of the Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador, another breed with Spanish heritage, although also compared to the fox trot of the Missouri Fox Trotter. However, the Marsh Tacky's gait shows a period of quadrupedal support where all four feet are planted and diagonal foot pairings, whereas the Fox Trotter shows tripedal support and the Mangalarga Marchador lacks the diagonal foot pairings.|$|E
500|$|The Pryor Mountain Mustang {{has a very}} {{specific}} conformation type. The breed generally stands [...] high, {{with an average of}} [...] The horses weigh [...] on the range, and more if raised in captivity. They exhibit a wide range of solid colors, including bay, black, chestnut, dun, <b>grullo,</b> and blue or red roan. Buckskin coloring is rare but does occur, and pinto coloring can be minimally expressed. [...] The dun-colored horses on the range exhibit primitive markings such as dorsal stripes, transverse stripes across the withers, and horizontal [...] "zebra" [...] stripes {{on the back of the}} forelegs. The Pryor Mountains horse's body is heavy, with strong bones. Manes and tails tend to be long, and the horse's winter coat is very heavy and often curly. The head is convex (sometimes called a [...] "Roman nose) or straight, with wide-set eyes, hooked ears, and a broad forehead that tapers well to the muzzle. The front teeth meet evenly, the upper lip is usually longer than the lower, and the nostrils are small and crescent shaped. The neck is medium in length, and most of the animals have only five lumbar vertebrae (an anatomical feature common in primitive horses)—although some have a fifth and sixth vertebrae which are fused. The horse's shoulders are long and sloping, the withers are prominent, and chests are medium to narrow in width. The croup is generally sloped, and tail-set is low. The hooves are large and very hard.|$|E
2500|$|Blue dun or <b>grullo</b> (also grulla, mouse dun) {{coloring}} {{is created}} by the dun gene acting on a black base coat, [...] is a coat color with a bluish cast and darker points. Unlike blue roans, grullos are solid color and appear bluish due to low amounts of pigment in each hair, not interspersed white hairs. Like other dun coat colors, grullos have dark or black primitive markings, always including a stripe down the back.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, two tarpan subtypes {{have been}} proposed, the forest tarpan and steppe tarpan, {{although}} {{there seem to}} be only minor differences in type. The general view is that there was only one subspecies, the tarpan, Equus ferus ferus. The last individual, which died in captivity in 1909, was between [...] tall at the shoulders, had a thick falling mane, a <b>grullo</b> coat colour, dark legs, and primitive markings, including a dorsal stripe and shoulder stripes.|$|E
2500|$|The dun {{coat and}} {{attendant}} primitive or [...] "dun factor" [...] markings reflect the wild type coat and are observed in all equine species. Cave paintings depict horses as being dun {{and with the}} primitive markings. The last remaining true wild horse, Przewalski's horse, is also dun-colored with primitive markings. So, too, are horse breeds such as the Konik and the Heck horse, [...] "bred back" [...] to resemble the now-extinct tarpan, {{many of which are}} <b>grullo</b> or mouse dun in color.|$|E
2500|$|Quarter Horses come {{in nearly}} all colors. [...] The most common color is sorrel, a {{brownish}} red, part of the color group called chestnut by most other breed registries. [...] Other recognized colors include bay, black, brown, buckskin, palomino, gray, dun, red dun, <b>grullo</b> (also occasionally referred to as blue dun), red roan, blue roan, bay roan, perlino, cremello, and white. [...] In the past, spotted color patterns were excluded, but now {{with the advent of}} DNA testing to verify parentage, the registry accepts all colors as long as both parents are registered.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1930s, several {{attempts}} were made to develop horses that looked like tarpans through selective breeding, called [...] "breeding back" [...] by advocates. The breeds that resulted included the Heck horse, the Hegardt or Stroebel's horse, and a derivation of the Konik breed, all of which have a primitive appearance, particularly in having the <b>grullo</b> coat color. [...] Some of these horses are now commercially promoted as [...] "tarpans". [...] However, those who study the history of the ancient wild horse assert that the word [...] "tarpan" [...] only describes the true wild horse.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} genotypes have been {{identified}} within European wild horses from the Pleistocene and Holocene; their coat color genes including those creating bay, black and leopard complex {{are known to be}} present in the wild horse population in Europe and were depicted in cave paintings of wild horses [...] during the Pleistocene. The dun gene, a dilution gene seen in Przewalski's horse that also creates the <b>grullo</b> or [...] "blue dun" [...] coat, seen in the Konik has genetic markers identified in modern horses, but has not yet been studied in European wild horses. It is considered likely that at least some wild horses had a dun coat.|$|E
2500|$|The Pryor Mountains feral horse {{conforms}} {{to a very}} specific type. [...] The animal is generally [...] high, {{with an average of}} [...] The horses weigh [...] on the range, and more if raised in captivity. The animals exhibit a wide range of solid colors, including bay, black, chestnut, dun, <b>grullo,</b> and blue or red roan. Buckskin coloring is rare but does occur, and pinto coloring can be minimally expressed. However, the majority of colors are dun or <b>grullo.</b> Nearly all the horses on the range exhibit primitive markings such as dorsal stripes, transverse stripes across the withers, and horizontal [...] "zebra" [...] stripes {{on the back of the}} forelegs.

The hooves are ample and very hard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of European wild horses is reconstructed with genetic, osteologic and historic data. One genetic {{study suggests that}} bay was the predominant color in European wild horses. During the Mesolithic, a gene coding a black coat color appeared on the Iberian peninsula. This color spread east but was less common than bay in the investigated sample and never reached Siberia. [...] Bay in combination with dun results in the [...] "bay dun" [...] color seen in Przewalski's horses, black with dun creates the <b>grullo</b> coat. A loss of dun dilution may have been advantageous in more forested western European landscapes, as dark colors were a better camouflage in forests. Pangaré or [...] "mealy" [...] coloration, a characteristic of other wild equines, might have been present {{in at least some}} tarpans, as historic accounts report a light-colored belly. It is also likely that European wild horses had primitive markings, consisting of stripes on the shoulders, legs and spine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Grullo</b> or grulla is a {{color of}} {{horses in the}} dun family, {{characterized}} by tan-gray or mouse-colored hairs on the body, often with shoulder and dorsal stripes and black barring on the lower legs. In this coloration, each individual hair is mouse-colored, unlike a roan, which is composed of a mixture of dark and light hairs. The several shades of <b>grullo</b> are informally referred to {{with a variety of}} terms, including black dun, blue dun, slate <b>grullo,</b> silver <b>grullo,</b> silver dun, or lobo dun. In the Icelandic horse, the <b>grullo</b> color is called gray dun, in the Highland pony it is called mouse dun, and in the Norwegian Fjord horse, grå or gråblakk (literally, [...] "gray dun").|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} equine coat color genetics, {{all of these}} shades {{are based on the}} dun gene acting as a {{dilution}} gene over the black gene. Because the <b>grullo</b> color is not due to the gray gene, a <b>grullo</b> horse remains the same basic color from birth, though some minor shade variation may occur from summer to winter coats. If a <b>grullo</b> also carries the gray gene, it will be born a mouse tan-gray shade, but then lighten and eventually develop a white hair coat with age. Because black is less common in general than bay or chestnut, <b>grullo</b> is likewise less common than red duns or bay (classic or zebra) duns. For example, only 0.7% of quarter horses registered each year with the AQHA are <b>grullo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Grullo: <b>Grullo</b> is {{the action}} of the dun gene on black. Typically, <b>grullo</b> coats have cool slate hues as opposed to warm orange-brown tones. Furthermore, grullos have dun {{characteristics}} such as bold dorsal stripes and leg bars.|$|E
