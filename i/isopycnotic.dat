40|$|The {{occurrence}} of somatic pairing {{from the early}} spermatogonial prophase to metaphase I was studied in Exorista sorbillans. The constitutive heterochromatic centromeres of homologous chromosomes abutted with each other. The C+ heterochromatic sex chromosomes exhibited their own behavioural pattern which differed from that of autosomes during all the stages of spermatogenesis. The sex chromosomes X and Y which appeared as a single heteropycnotic mass during early prophase dissociated themselves into two different entities at mid-prophase and became single <b>isopycnotic</b> masses by late prophase. At spermatogonial metaphase and metaphase I the X and Y chromosomes appeared again as two different entitites. The small X chromosome was always associated with the long arm of the Y chromosome...|$|E
