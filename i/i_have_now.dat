25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> is indeed S.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} few days the representatives of the German Government and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have been engaged in conversations, the primary purpose of which has been to prepare the way for the holding of a general conference {{on the subject of the}} {{limitation}} of naval armaments. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> much pleasure in notifying your Excellency of the formal acceptance by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of the proposal of the German Government discussed at those conversations that the future strength of the German navy in relation to the aggregate naval strength of the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should be in the proportion of 35:100. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom regard this proposal as a contribution of the greatest importance to the cause of future naval limitation. They further believe that the agreement which they have now reached with the German government, and which they regard as a permanent and definite agreement as from to-day between the two Governments, will facilitate the conclusion of a general agreement on the subject of naval limitation between all the naval Powers of the world.|$|E

500|$|Throughout her life, Emma Smith {{frequently}} {{denied that}} her husband had ever taken additional wives. Emma said that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to Smith by Mormons was when she read about it in Orson Pratt's periodical The Seer in 1853. Emma campaigned publicly against polygamy, and was the main signatory of a petition in 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Smith was connected with polygamy. As president of the Ladies' Relief Society, Emma authorized publishing a certificate in the same year denouncing polygamy, and denying her husband as its creator or participant. Even on her deathbed, Emma denied Joseph's involvement with polygamy, stating, [...] "No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now,</b> or ever had any knowledge of... He had no other wife but me; nor did he to my knowledge ever have".|$|E
500|$|According to Rolling Stone, {{the album}} {{contains}} [...] "raspy braggadocio and sexy rhymes" [...] which complement Queen's raspy vocals. It alternates between reggaetón and hip hop as Queen experiments with Caribbean music, R, pop, electronica, funk, dancehall and acoustic ballads: [...] "I really think this album {{is for people}} to really just sit down and listen to it". She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful. Although Queen said the album has its share of [...] "battles against men", she wants it to demonstrate that she is a well–rounded artist. Describing the songs, she said [...] " [...] {{are always going to be}} real because they are feelings that people have...The hits that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now,</b> the girls love them because they are real.

The rising cost of VH-71 program contrasted poorly with President Barack Obama's stance on curbing government spending; during a White House gathering in February 2009 President Obama commented that the procurement process had [...] "gone amok {{and we are going}} to have to fix it." [...] He additionally stated that [...] "The helicopter <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> seems perfectly adequate to me." [...] In March 2009 the projected total cost for the planned 28 VH-71s was over $13billion. [...] On 6 April 2009 the proposed Defense budget announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates had not included funding for the VH-71. [...] On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Navy announced that the contract was officially canceled, and that remaining funds were to be reinvested in upgrades to the existing fleet of VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters. [...] Nine VH-71s had been completed at time of the cancellation.|$|E
500|$|In 1913 he {{spearhead}} {{the founding}} of The Ozark Trails Association (OTA) to promote the building and education of quality highway design, but not actually building or funding them. At first, he was only interested in bringing people to Monte Ne, he stated: [...] "My Personal interest in the Ozark Trails is that they all lead to Monte Ne" [...] However, {{he seems to have}} taken on a more egalitarian opinion of the Ozark Trails as time went on because he later said: [...] "My inclination runs toward doing something of a progressive nature that will promote the collective good, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> concentrated all that inclination on carrying out a system of roads known as the Ozark Trails." [...] The Ozark Trails Association became Harvey's most successful endeavor. Interest in the project spread, and membership swelled to 7,000 delegates from states as far away as New Mexico. The group built large obelisks, listing the names of the benefactors, along the routes and trails that it sponsored. He even ran for Congress on a platform of building a national highway system, but lost to John W. Tillman who had strong support in Washington County.|$|E

[...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> is that we can do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the urging}} of his supporters, Miller never {{personally}} set an exact date for the expected Second Advent.

After formal introduction, Braunersreuther handed the governor this ultimatum from Captain Glass: [...] "Sir: In reply to your communication of this date <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now,</b> in compliance with the orders of my government, to demand the immediate surrender of the defenses of the Island of Guam, with arms of all kinds, all officials and persons in the military service of Spain now in this island.

On 8 February 1929, she died in a fall from their hotel suite window. The original police report said her death was a suicide, but this was later changed to 'vertigo victim' {{at the request of}} her husband's staff. On the subject of his marriages, Fokker wrote, [...] "I have always understood airplanes much better than women. I had more love affairs in my life, and they ended just like the first one, really, because I thought there was nothing that could be more important than my airplanes... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> learned, by bitter experience, that one must give a little too; in love one has to use one's brain just as much as in business, and perhaps even more".|$|E

He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain {{that he had not}} dared to write the emperors directly. The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: [...] "There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now.</b> The hope has become a reality." [...] Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.|$|E
2500|$|During that time, Coleridge {{became a}} friend of Charles Lamb. Unlike Lamb, Coleridge did not have family in London to spend his {{vacation}} with, which caused the young Coleridge strain. Over the nine years that he attended the school, he only returned home 3 or 4 times. He experienced loneliness throughout the time until two of his brothers, Luke and George, came to London. He wrote many letters to his brothers, but only one to his mother during his time in London. Luke was important to Coleridge and Luke's moving to Devon affected the schoolboy. Coleridge made other friends, including Charles Le Grice, but this could not keep Coleridge from missing Luke, to whom Coleridge would write often. [...] In one letter, Coleridge wrote: [...] "Legrice, and I, are very polite, very civil, and very cold. So that I doubly lament your absence, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> no one, to whom I can open my heart in full confidence." ...|$|E

While he was there he saw {{performances}} by the leading French actors, Sarah Bernhardt in La Tosca, and Lucien Guitry in Les affaires sont les affaires, which inspired him {{with a passion for}} the theatre. His parents were unimpressed by his ambition to become an actor; he was sent into the family business, the long-established wholesale grocery firm Joseph Travers & Sons Ltd, of which his father was a director. He found commercial life tedious and incomprehensible: [...] "I had no more idea {{what it was all about}} then than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> and vice versa." [...] He served first at the firm's head office in Cannon Street in the City of London, which was dominated by dauntingly-bearded Victorian patriarchs. From there, to his and the patriarchs' relief, he was soon transferred to the company's offices in Singapore and then Malacca.|$|E
