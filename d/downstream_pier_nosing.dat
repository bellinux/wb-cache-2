40|$|An {{investigation}} of local scour at pier groups {{has been conducted}} {{with the aim of}} developing design recommendations and scour depth prediction equations for the bridge pier groups. A comprehensive series of steady uniform flow experiments was performed on groups of 2, 3, 4, and 6 model piers. All tests were conducted under clear-water scour conditions. Parameters governing local scour depth around bridge piers include: flow characteristics, sediment properties, and pier size and shape. The effects of these parameters on the maximum local scour depth for a single pier (D s), have been thoroughly investigated in the past. However, when design criteria developed for single piers are applied directly to pier groups, this approach ignores the following important group effects: (1) sheltering, (2) reinforcement, and (3) horse-shoe vortex (HSV) compression. Furthermore, the group effects will alter with changes in pier spacing, S, and flow angle of attack, β. This study, which investigates the local scouring process for the aforementioned groups of model bridge piers, and presents design relationships for predicting the corresponding maximum local scour depths, is an attempt to address this limitation in current design practice. Initially the local scour was examined for five different single pier diameters (0. 0127 m, 0. 018 m, 0. 025 m, 0. 033 m and 0. 05 m). Having established single pier relationships, groups of 2, 3, 4, and 6 equally spaced piers were examined, while altering alignment to the flow and separation distances. For piers in line with the flow direction, <b>downstream</b> <b>piers</b> are sheltered by the upstream ones resulting in reducing scour depth around <b>downstream</b> <b>piers.</b> This effect diminishes with the increasing β if there is only one row of piers i. e., 2 and 3 pier groups. In the case of 2 rows of piers aligned to the flow direction (i. e., 4 - and 6 -pier groups), there is a specific range of β in which <b>downstream</b> <b>piers</b> are exposed to the flow. As β increases, depending on pier spacing, the piers of one row may shelter the <b>downstream</b> <b>piers</b> of the other row. The reinforcement effect is significant only for small ratios of pier spacing/ pier diameter (S/d) when β< 100. In these ranges of S/d and β, the front piers are scoured more than that of a single pier. Moreover, the score depth of <b>downstream</b> <b>piers,</b> which are less than that of a single pier, increases with increasing S/d. The compressed (HSV) arms affect the local scour depth significantly if piers are staggered and S/d < 5. In this range of S/d, the HSV arms are intensified, resulting in a deeper scour hole. However, this effect also becomes insignificant with increasing S/d. The data obtained for each pier group were analysed, using a multiple regression model, to develop local scour depth prediction equations for the front, middle, and rear piers. The regression model includes two important dimensionless parameters (β and S/d) associated with group effects, as regressors. The proposed prediction equations estimated the observed data and similar-type published data reasonably well, within marginal errors. From a general practical view-point, the number of prediction equations was reduced to two equations for all pier groups: one for the front piers and the second one for the <b>downstream</b> <b>piers</b> (i. e. combined middle and rear piers) ...|$|R

The piles may be subjected to unplanned bending stresses, from lateral loads and hydrodynamic forces. The knowledge related to the time taken by different piers to achieve a certain scour depth is limited. In this study experiments were conducted using wooden pier models in the re-circulating glass sided tilting flume of 12, 5 m length, 300 mm width and 450 mm deep. In all three tests water depth, discharge, and mean approach flow velocity in the channel were kept constant. The flume was filled with cohessionless bed material (artificial sand) average grain diameter of 0. 203 mm to a uniform thickness. The scour depths observed from experiments were 30 mm, 16 mm and 14 mm in square, cylindrical and round <b>nosed</b> <b>piers</b> respectively. It was observed that, it takes more time for the cylindrical and round <b>nosed</b> <b>piers</b> to achieve scour depth of 22. 2 mm and 20 mm respectively as estimated by Breusers and Raudkivi 1991.

40|$|INDOT is {{considering}} {{the deployment of}} fixed scour-monitoring instrumentation {{as part of a}} systematic response to the problem of scour around bridge piers. Fixed-in-place automated scour-monitoring devices measure the depth of scour at the point where they are installed. Unless they are installed at the location where maximum scour occurs, their readings may give a misleading estimate of scour potential. This raises a number of technical issues concerning their effective deployment and the interpretation of the collected data, which should be resolved in order to maximize the benefits to INDOT from using these monitoring devices. These include the location of maximum scour under different pier configurations and hydraulic conditions, as well as possible effects due to pier skewness and exposed footings. This report describes laboratory experiments that were performed to study these issues for various flow conditions and pier configurations. The experiments were conducted in a straight channel of rectangular cross-section located in the Hydromechanics Laboratory at Purdue University. The pier geometry was the same in all experiments, and was chosen to be similar to that of a prototype pier (in the US 52 bridge over the Wabash River), though exact scaling was not attempted. Both single and double (i. e., one upstream and one <b>downstream)</b> <b>piers</b> were studied. In general, for piers that were not skewed with respect to the flow, the location of maximum scour was as expected found in the immediate vicinity of the upstream nose of the up-stream pier. Nevertheless, even with relatively small skewness, for flow angle of attack {{less than or equal to}} 10 °, the location of maximum scour may actually move downstream, either to the side of the pier or even away from the more upstream <b>pier</b> towards the <b>downstream</b> <b>pier</b> in the double-pier arrangement. Measurements at the nose of the upstream pier may therefore grossly underestimate scour in downstream regions if even slight skewness occurs during floods. Experiments also indicated that, under clear-water conditions, an exposed footing may actually serve to arrest the deepening of the scour hole. Under the live-bed high-transport conditions more likely to prevail in Indiana streams, the experimental results suggest that this may be more questionable...|$|R

The primary {{objective of this}} research was to document run timing and describe the distribution of smolts at the dam. The study occurred from April 2 to June 15, 1984. Four transducers were deployed at the bases of <b>pier</b> <b>noses</b> at Turbines 3, 5, 7, and 9 and aimed up to 24 º into the forebay. They were sampled once every hour, 24 hours per day, for 75 days. An index of fish passage was reported daily to the Water Budget Center in Portland, Oregon. This index was computed as follows. For each 24 -h period, separate fish passage rates (number/time) at each of the four sampling locations were estimated by dividing the sum of the 2 ̆ 7 weighted 2 ̆ 7 fish detections by total sample time. These four values then were averaged to produce the daily index (number/day/location). The first substantial increase in fish passage occurred on April 25, 1984 due to the chinook released from the Winthrop hatchery on April 23. During May, run timing was fairly uniform except for peaks on May 2, 14, 18, and 22. The unexpected peak in run size that occurred from May 29 to June 2 could have been caused by juvenile mountain whitefish. Although the proportion of each species varied, chinook passage probably peaked in late April, and steelhead in {{the first two weeks of}} May; sockeye passage was variable throughout the study. The data indicated that most downstream migrants were distributed high in the water column and toward the western end of the dam.

The civil works of the intake facility will be comprised of a 133. 45 m wide diversion weir, with two overflow spillways and six gated sluice channels; a four bay intake structure with sediment excluder; and, a fish bypass facility. Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) evaluated the initial design of the Due intake and spillway facilities using a 1 : 35 Froude-scaled physical model for river discharges ranging from the intake design discharge of 57. 2 m 3 /s to the 1000 -year flood of 2, 339 m 3 /s. The testing in the physical model revealed some deficiencies {{in the performance of}} the initial design of the spillway stilling basins and some opportunities to reduce construction costs. Modifications to the initial design were proposed and evaluated in the model during the design optimization testing phase. The final recommended modifications included: adding a new stilling basin wall separating one of the overflow spillways from adjacent sluice channels; reducing the length of the stilling basin; decreasing the height and thickness of the stilling basin walls; and modifying <b>pier</b> <b>noses</b> to reduce flow disturbances. Furthermore, a sluice gate operation guideline was developed in order to maintain sufficient energy dissipation within the stilling basins for the range of river discharges covered in the study.

Fine sand was used in the model to simulate the reservoir deposits such that qualitative observations of the sediment flushing could be made. Accordingly, a sluice gate operating guideline was developed to maximize the sediment flushing from the reservoir.

There are three existing power generating units, each of which is fed by an 18 -ft-diameter penstock. Provisions have been made for an additional unit to be installed in the near future. Water is taken from Mayfield Lake, conveyed through a 37 -ft-diameter tunnel, and discharged into a forebay. There are four intake structures, one for each penstock, at the downstream end of the forebay. Presently, the operation is hampered at high loading conditions. It is generally believed that unstable hydraulic conditions in the forebay are the cause of the present poor operating conditions. Strong vortices at the intakes have been observed in the field. The flow in the forebay is rough and turbulent. There are large shock waves at the <b>pier</b> <b>noses,</b> causing the water surface to fluctuate and become higher at units 42 and 43 and lower at unit 44. It is planned to add the fourth unit in the immediate future. Because an additional unit would mean an increased flow requirement, it is probable that the problems stated above would worsen. For this reason, a model study has been conducted to assess the problems for the expanded operation and find means of alleviating them. A 1 : 36 scale model was constructed and tested. After calibration, the model satisfactorily reproduced the existing flow conditions. The model indicated an increase in flow distortion and in water surface instability for the planned expansion. Air-entraining vortices were observed for all flows tested without modification of the existing facilities. On the basis of the experiments with various alternatives, the following schemes are recommended to provide good flow conditions: (a) two 18 -ft-wide submerged guide vanes to be installed near the tunnel portal to redistribute the flow and improve the water surface profile and (b) a V-shaped vortex suppressor to be installed at each intake bay to eliminate the air-entraining vortices.

Sediment transport is strongly influenced by the horseshoe vortex that develops immediately upstream of the pier. The horseshoe vortex excavates the sediment bed originating a scour hole. As the sediments are suspended in the flow, they travel downstream and eventually sediment in regions of lower turbulence. Experiments were conducted in a 0. 4 m wide and 16. 7 m long flume. The test section consisted of a vertical rectangular <b>pier</b> with round <b>nose</b> shapes, 4 cm wide and 8 cm long. The pier was mounted vertically in a box, 10 cm deep and 1. 8 m long, filled in with uniform sand with a mean diameter of 0. 376 Â mm. For comparison purposes, the flow around the pier in case of a rigid flat bed with the same roughness was also studied. The flow rate was controlled by a gate valve and measured by an electromagnetic flow meter (ABB, model IDE 41 F). Water depth was controlled by a sluice gate at the downstream extremity of the flume. Measurements were made using two-component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). The light source was an Argon-ion Laser (Spectra-Physics, Model 177 -G 0232) and the optical system was a Dantec 60 X 41 FiberFlow, combined with an 85 mm probe together with a beam expander and 500 mm front lens, used in forward scatter mode.

40|$|Introduction: Bridges are {{certainly}} {{one of the most important}} structures but costly service elements in a transport system. The bridges are very required to access the damaged areas in emergency situations such as floods and earthquakes. Scour around the foundations of bridge piers exposed to the flowing water than can destroy the bridge itself is a subject of major concern. Flow pattern is known as responsible for all changes in stream bed. Any obstacle in the channel can form new flow patterns causing additional shear stress exerted on the bed than the equilibrium condition of the absence of the obstacle. Appropriate shaping of flow pattern and proper selecting of pier geometry and the location of bridge piers can be one of the proper methods in reduction of scour amount which is the main subject of the present study. Materials and Methods: Inclined bridge group pier is a type of bridges with modern geometry based on development in building technology of structures. Many of these bridges have been built all around the world and the 8 th bridge built crossing the Karun River in Ahvaz is a sample of the Iranian ones considered in this research. Hydrodynamic behavior of flow is investigated around the inclined bridge group pier settled on foundation using the FLOW- 3 D numerical model. Inclined bridge group pier investigated in this study, includes two rectangular piers which are 2. 5 cm long and 3. 5 cm wide and set in an angle of 28 degree on rectangular foundation which is 16 cm long and 10 cm wide and installed in three different foundation levels namely at, above and below the bed levels. The physical model of prototype pier considered in this study was constructed to the scale of 1 : 190 of the Ahvaz 8 th bridge. In order to verify the accuracy of the numerical model, velocity data obtained from image processing technique were used. Results and Discussion: Due to non- linearity and interactions between various phenomena involved, flow pattern around the piers group is entirely different than that for a single pier and consequently the outcomes of the flow pattern around single pier cannot be generalized to the pier group. At all levels of foundation setting, longitudinal component of flow velocity increases surrounding the first pier. The increase in the area and its extension towards downstream is caused by the constriction the flow due to the pier and area rotating of the wake vortex in <b>downstream.</b> When the <b>pier</b> foundation is set at the stream bed, the bed rotating flows extend to a distance between the two piers from near the bed up to the middle of flow depth while in upstream of the second pier and near water surface, the stream lines become parallel to the bed. The comparison of the results of the changes in bed shear stress in the situations of foundation setting in different levels showed that the maximum shear stress occurred when the foundation level is at the bed level and the maximum shear stress exerted on the bed decreases by factors of 17...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} the free surface flow and clear water scour around an elongated vertical pier. Measurements were made using two-component Laser Doppler Anemometry, {{with the main}} objective of studying the turbulent sediment transport around elongated piers. The flow around a circular pier {{has been the subject}} of a large number of studies (e. g. Dargahi (1989), Graf (1998) Roulund et al. (2005)). When the pier is mounted on a sediment bed, the tri-dimensional flow field around the pier interacts with the bed of sediments (either cohesive or cohesionless) and originates clear water scour. The flow around a pier is characterized by the existence of a horseshoe vortex in front of the pier, which is responsible for the evolution of the scour process. The scour hole increases both in depth and in extension towards upstream, while the horseshoe vortex continues to excavate the sediment slope. As the sediments are suspended in the flow, they travel downstream and eventually fall and sediment in regions of lower turbulence. The scour cavity dimensions increase both upstream and downstream, until equilibrium is achieved. This phenomenon is usually studied by means of mathematical modelling (Kirkil et al. 2008, Kirkil et al. 2009), due to the experimental complexity of the scour process. The experimental work concerning initial conditions (Roulund et al., 2005), i. e. prior to scour cavities developing, can however provide adequate validation of models. Experiments were conducted in a 0. 4 m wide and 16. 7 m long flume, and the test section was installed approximately 9. 7 m downstream the beginning of the flume. The test section consisted of a rectangular vertical <b>pier</b> with round <b>nose</b> shapes. The <b>pier</b> was 4 cm wide and 8 cm long. Two alternative experimental configurations were studied: (i) the flow over a flat bottom and (ii) the flow over a sediment bed. In case (i) the pier was mounted in an acrylic plate 1. 8 m long, were a layer of uniform sand with 0. 376 mm mean diameter was glued, in order to reproduce the natural roughness of a river stream. In case (ii) the pier was mounted in a box, 10 cm deep and 1. 8 m long, filled in with uniform sand with a mean diameter of 0. 376 mm. The flow was controlled by a gate valve and measured by an electromagnetic flow meter (ABB, model IDE 41 F). Water depth was controlled by a sluice gate at the downstream extremity of the flume. The light source was an Argon-ion Laser (Spectra-Physics, Model 177 -G 0232) and the optical system was a Dantec 60 X 41 FiberFlow, including a 40 MHz frequency shifter and colour separation, combined with an 85 mm probe together with a beam expander and 500 mm front lens. A colour separator (55 X 35) split the collected light into 2 wavelengths before reaching the corresponding photomultipliers (Dantec 57 Ã 18). LDA data processing and acquisition was performed using BSA F 60 Flow analyser (Dantec). Simultaneous measurements of longitudinal (horizontal) and vertical velocities were made using the overlapped coincidence method. The flow was studied for water depths of 5 and 15 cm and mean horizontal approach velocities equal to 0. 17 and 0. 25 ms- 1. Measurements of horizontal and vertical velocities in the vicinity of an elongated pier show the strong interaction between the structure and the flow. In case (i) the flow decelerates as it approaches the pier, and is defected towards the bottom. In the wake of the pier there is a reverse flow until one <b>pier</b> diameter <b>downstream,</b> and then the flow starts to accelerate, as the influence of the pier disappears. In free surface flows Reynolds stresses usually present negative values, but in the present case, as the flow approaches the pier, Reynolds stresses become positive and increase. In case (ii) a similar flow pattern was found, but smaller turbulence intensities were measured...|$|R
