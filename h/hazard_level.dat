The United States Geological Survey maintains a hazard zone mapping of the island done on a one to nine scale, with the most dangerous areas corresponding the smallest numbers. Based on this classification Mauna Loa's continuously active summit caldera and rift zones have been given a level one designation.

40|$|Traditional {{performance}}-based design (PBD) {{that has}} a single performance level has been widely researched by changing section sizes of structural members or material properties to resist single <b>hazard</b> <b>levels.</b> However, this approach has limitations in terms of achieving performance and alternative design options for the owner. To overcome these limitations of the traditional PBD method, a multi-performance-based control design (MPBCD) methodology is newly proposed. The MPBCD integrates a decentralized semi-active control algorithm with semi-active smart damping devices and an advanced multi-objective optimization method. The multi-objective optimization is used to achieve various sets of performance-based control designs. The control designs satisfy multiple performance <b>levels</b> under multiple <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> without changing cross-section sizes or material properties of structural members. This MPBCD provides multiple sets of control designs (i. e., control device layouts with control design variables) to minimize design costs and maximize control effectiveness. The multiple sets of designs offer optimal performance-based control design covering {{a broad range of}} <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> with various performance levels. This numerical study uses an advanced decentralized semi-active controller and large-scale 200 -kN magnetorheological (MR) dampers installed in a nine-story moment-resisting frame (MRF) building. From the multi-objective optimization technique, multiple layouts of control devices and controller parameters for multiple performance <b>levels</b> under multiple <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> are investigated...|$|R

30|$|The inter-storey drift {{limitations}} are meaningful reference values for structural seismic performance evaluation. This paper presents an analytical {{investigation into the}} seismic performance of multi-storey cross-laminated timber (CLT) structures to obtain the drift limitations under different earthquake <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> reasonably. The Pinching 4 model was used to simulate the nonlinear mechanical behavior of three types of connections used in CLT structures, and a numerical model was further developed to capture the lateral load-resisting properties of CLT shear walls. Moreover, three benchmark multi-storey CLT apartment buildings were designed using the Equivalent Static Force Procedure according to National Building Code of Canada (NBCC), and simplified structural models were developed for these buildings. Depending on the results from numerous time-history dynamic analyses, the empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the maximum inter-storey drifts were constructed for the three benchmark buildings. The probability of non-exceedance (PNE) of inter-storey drift thresholds under different earthquake <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> was proposed and validated. It is recommended that for low-rise CLT buildings within three stories, values of 0.30 %, 0.75 %, and 1.40 % {{can be considered as}} the drift limitations for frequent, medium, and rare seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively. For mid-rise or high-rise buildings without three stories, 0.25 %, 0.70 %, and 1.30 % can be considered as drift limitations.|$|R

The focus on element-at-risk, common to earlier BAER determinations of potential debris flow risk, proved difficult to accomplish quickly and left the possibility of overlooking locations with significant risk during evaluation of areas burned by large fires.

With the <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> defined, any elements-at-risk from debris flow occurrence can be readily identified and their risk determined.

An approach for evaluating reinforced concrete crographics. structural frame systems subjected to seismic forces under the framework of performance-based design methodology was developed. The method integrates the design criteria according to the proposed 1997 NEHRP Recommended Provisions for Seismic Regulation for New Buildings & Other Structures (BSSC 1997), structural limit states, pushover analyses, various seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>levels,</b> non-linear time history dynamic analyses and structural fragility curves. Three performance levels (or limit states) consisting of immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention according to FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) were considered. Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to model the variability of strength and stiffness involved in estimating the structural limit state capacities. Three different <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> representing standard frequent event (50 % probability of exceedance in 50 years), design basis event (10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) and maximum considered event (2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) according to FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) were used. The probabilistic nature of earthquakes was simulated by using 25 different records of measured time histories, from previous seismic events and scaled to various response spectra intensities (<b>hazard</b> <b>levels).</b> Inter-story was used as an indicative parameter for evaluating structural performance in form of structural fragility curves for the three limit states. The fragility curves developed in this study correlate the conditional probability of exceedance of the three structural performance limit states (BSSC 1997) to the three different seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>levels</b> prescribed by the FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) and FEMA- 274 (ATC l 997 b).

Nonlinear incremental dynamic analyses are then performed for two representative models of a typical steel frame with a concrete shear wall, using independent suites of acceleration time histories that are selected based on the target epsilons. Structural limit states are defined on each incremental dynamic analysis curve, and the corresponding damage measures are estimated.
