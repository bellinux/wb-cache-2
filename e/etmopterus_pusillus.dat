Shirai and Tachikawa found that the species group comprises the smooth lanternshark (E. pusillus) and a hitherto unrecognized second species, which they named E. bigelowi in honor of Henry B. Bigelow (who, along with William C. Schroeder and Stewart Springer, first {{described the}} blurred lanternshark in 1955, but did not see it as being separate from E. pusillus). The E. pusillus species group is distinguished from other lanternsharks in having truncate (ending in a flat crown as though the tip were cut off), irregularly arranged dermal denticles. This species may also be referred to as the smooth lanternshark or the blurred smooth lanternshark.|$|E

40|$|Etmoplerus spinax and <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>pusillus</b> are {{captured}} {{in large quantities}} in some deep-water fisheries along the Portuguesc coast and are always discarded. Specimens were collected from February 2003 to May 2004 from deep-water fisheries and classified as mature or immature. Maturity ogives were fitted and size at first maturity estimated for each sex of each of each species. Both species are late maturing, with the maturity size varying between 75 % and 87 % of the maximum observed sizes, depending on species and sex. For both species, females tended to mature at and grow to larger sizes than males. The late maturation of these deep-water shark species make these populations extremely vulnerable to increasing fishing mortality...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{survey was}} carried out in October - November of 2000, in the Cape Verde archipelago, by the R/V ARQUIPÃ‰LAGO. The main objective was to determine the species composition and relative abundance of the demersal fish resources living in the waters of the Cape Verde archipelago. A list of fishes caught with bottom longline during the survey is presented in this document, along with information about the area, depth limits and the relative abundance of the species in the catches. Ninety-seven different species from 49 families were identified from 20 long-line sets. To our knowledge, the following 12 species were recorded for the first time from the waters of Cape Verde islands: Etmopterus princeps, <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>pusillus,</b> Gymnothorax maderensis, Myroconger compressus, Laemonema robustum, Beryx splendens, Scorpaena elongata, Serranus atricauda, Taractes rubescens, Taracthichthys longipinnis, Pagrus africanus and Cathidermis sufflamen.

40|$|In Portugal, elasmobranch {{landings}} {{have decreased}} substantially in recent years. In this work, elasmobranch catches in experimental hake near bottom semi pelagic longlines (1997 and 1998) {{were compared with}} those of experimental trammel nets (2000). In the hake semi pelagic longline fishery, 7 elasmobranch species represented 33. 4 % (2185 specimens) of the total fish captures. The most abundant species were Galeus melastomus (63. 3 %), <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>pusillus</b> (21. 7 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (14. 2 %). Most of these elasmobranchs (68. 3 % in total) were discarded. In the trammel net fishery, 16 different elasmobranch species represented 4. 3 % (597 specimens) of total fish catches and the most important species were Raja undulata (43. 6 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (10. 2 %). The majority of the elasmobranchs caught with this gear had commercial value, and only 5. 4 % were discarded. In both fisheries, intra-specific catch rates varied with depth. Length frequency distributions for the only species with relatively high catches in both fisheries, the small-spotted catshark, showed that in general, trammel nets catch large...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{provides}} the first {{description of the}} feeding ecology of the smooth lanternshark <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>pusillus</b> based on stomach contents of specimens caught as bycatch in the Algarve (southern Portugal) with bottom trawling and bottom longline. The diet of E. pusillus consists mainly of fish (dry weight (% W) = 87. 1 %; frequency of occurrence (%FO) = 28. 6 %; number (%N) = 30. 3 %), crustaceans (%W= 7. 7 %; %FO= 36. 7 %; %N= 3. 4 %) and cephalopods (%W= 4. 7 %; %FO= 11. 3 %; %N= 11. 1 %). The diet did not vary between sexes. Ontogenic changes were detected: crustaceans decreased in importance as the sharks increased in size and fish became dominant in the diet of adults. Combining two fishing methods provided broad information on the diet of E. pusillus, as bottom trawling caught smaller specimens and longlines caught larger individuals. E. pusillus feeds mainly on non-commercial species, and therefore does not compete directly with commercial fisheries. Finally, E. pusillus feeds {{in various parts of}} the water column and thus it can access a wide range of prey; however, this also means that it can be caught by both gears, making it more vulnerable in terms of conservation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Etmopterus</b> <b>pusillus</b> is a {{deep water}} lantern shark with a {{widespread}} global distribution that is caught in large quantities in some areas, but is usually discarded due to the low commercial value. In this work, the population biology was studied and life history parameters determined {{for the first time}} in this species. Age was estimated from sections of the second dorsal spine and validated by marginal increment analysis. Males attained a maximum age of 13 years, while 17 -year-old females were found. Several growth models were fitted and compared for both size and weight at age data, showing that even though this is a small sized species, it has a relatively slow growth rate. This species matures late and at a relatively large size: at 86. 81 % and 79. 40 % of the maximum observed sizes and at 58. 02 % and 54. 40 % of the maximum observed ages for males and females, respectively. It has a low fecundity, with a mean ovarian fecundity of 10. 44 oocytes per reproductive cycle. The estimated parameters indicate that this species has a vulnerable life cycle, typical of deep water squalid sharks. Given the high fishing pressures that it is suffering in the NE Atlantic, the smooth lantern shark may be in danger of severe declines in the near future. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A 2 -year {{study of}} the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) semi-pelagic ("pedra-bola) {{longline}} fishery {{was carried out in}} the Algarve (southern Portugal). This fishery takes place on the continental slope at 200 - 700 m depths. using monofilament longlines that are lifted off the bottom at regular intervals by glass balls. Hook selectivity trials were carried out with four hook sizes (SIAPAL brand numbers 10, 9, 7 and 5) from March to August 1997 and May to August 1998. At least 32 species of fish and invertebrates were caught, with hake dominating the catch (41 and 45 % of the catch in numbers), followed by Galeus melastomus (23 and 19 %), Micromesistius poutassou (10 and 7 %), Benthodesmus elongatus (8 and 5 %), <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>pusillus</b> (6 and 9 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (5 and 4 %). Apart from the hake, and some species of commercial value such as G. melastomus (only the large individuals), Ray's bream (Brama brama, 1. 4 and 4 %), silver scabbard fish (Lepidopus caudatus. 1 and 2. 5 %), swordfish (Xiphins gladius, < 1 %), wreckfish (Polyprion americanus, < 1 %). conger eel (Conger conger. < 1 %), and bluemouth rockfish (Helicolenus dactylopterus, < 1 %) - most of the other species are discarded, used as bait in traps or consumed by the fishermen. Catch rates (number of fish per 100 hooks) for hake and for all species combined decreased significantly with hook size. Hake catch size frequency distributions for the different hook sizes in 1997 and 1998 were highly overlapped, with the four different hooks catching a wide range of sizes. Although catch size frequency distributions for the different sized hooks were not significantly different in 1997, hake caught in 1998 were characterised by smaller sizes and size ranges.

40|$|Deep water {{sharks are}} {{commonly}} caught as by-catch of longlines targeting bony fishes and trawlers targeting crustaceans {{in deep water}} off the southern Portuguese coast. Due to low or no commercial value, these species are {{most of the times}} discarded at sea, with only the larger specimens of some species commercialized at very low prices. In this study we present size distributions, maturity distributions, and sex ratios of 2, 138 specimens belonging to four different species, namely the lantern sharks <b>Etmopterus</b> <b>pusillus</b> and Etmopterus spinax and the catsharks Galeus melastomus and Galeus atlanticus, caught with these two gears. Trawls generally caught smaller-sized specimens, in a wider length range than longlines. Trawls caught mostly immature specimens of all species, namely 83. 7 % immature of E. pusillus, 84. 3 % of E. spinax, 89. 5 % of G. melastomus, and 95. 5 % of G. atlanticus, while longlines caught mostly immature E. pusillus (69. 2 %) and G. melastomus (78. 6 %) and mostly mature E. spinax (88. 2 %) and G. atlanticus (87. 2 %). Trawls tended to catch more males than females of all species except E. spinax, while longlines caught more females than males of E. spinax and G. melastomus and more males than females of the other two species. The main conclusion of this work is that trawls are catching smaller-sized and mostly immature specimens when compared to longlines, meaning that they are probably having a more detrimental effect on these shark populations. The data presented here have significant implications for the conservation of these shark populations since sizes, sexes, and the immature and mature components of the populations are being affected differently by these two fishing gears...|$|E
