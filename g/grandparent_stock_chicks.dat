40|$|ABSTRACT Five genotypes for rate of {{feathering}} in broilers [K/K,K/k+, and k+/k+ {{in males}} and K/W, k+IW in females) were produced from matings of <b>grandparent</b> <b>stocks</b> {{of a common}} genetic background. Genotypes were compared for differences in growth and feed conversion. Means among the male genotypic groups differed significantly (P<. 05) for body weight, weight gain, and feed conversion; differences were generally {{in favor of the}} slower feathering genotypes. Female genotypic groups did not differ significantly from each other but were significantly below males in performance. Subjective feather scores differed significantly (P<. 05), according to feathering genotypes. Sexes and diets contributed to differences in performance. Diets did not interact with genotypes.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{efficiency in}} the <b>grandparent</b> <b>stock</b> and the parent stock of geese was monitored in the thesis. In {{terms of the}} <b>grandparent</b> <b>stock,</b> there were found out better values in year 2012 than in year 2013. In 2012, there was a better egg fertilization of 4. 61 % (the average was 49. 65 %) and hatchability of the put eggs better of 3. 83 % (the average was 39. 01 %). The hatchability of the fertilized eggs was almost the same in both years. It has the same value of 78. 63 %. Best results were proved in strains 1, 3 and 4. Worst values were proved in the strain number 41. The chosen indicators of geese of four ponds were monitored in the parent stock. The average fertilization of eggs was 58. 26 %; significantly higher value was proved in case of the Jakulský pond (72. 34 %). The average hatchability of the put eggs reached 46. 46 %; the highest value was also proved on the Jakulský pond (56. 22 %). The other ponds have balanced results. The hatchability of the fertilized eggs reached the average value of 79. 10 %, the highest value was proved on the Lomský pond (84. 45 %); the second place {{is represented by the}} Velebil pond (79. 42 %). The geese bred on the Lomský pond had eggs with the lowest fertilization, but with the highest percent of hatchability of the fertilized eggs. In case of geese bred on the Velebil pond, there was an increase of the monitored indicators in year 2013 than in 2012. In contrast, the Byňovský pond, the Jakulský pond and the Lomský pond showed an increase of the monitored indicators in 2012. There was a smaller difference of egg fertilization in geese of the Jakulský and the Lomský pond. There was a smaller difference of hatchability indicators of either put or fertilized eggs in geese bred on the Byňovský and the Jakulský pond...|$|R
40|$|Four hundred day-old male {{hatchling}} chicks {{were obtained}} from the female line of Lohmman <b>grandparent</b> <b>stock</b> farms and fed rations supplemented with different levels (0 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, 1. 0 %) of dried garlic powder. Each treatment consists of 5 pens. Feed and water were provided as ad libitum throughout the experimental period. Production parameters measured were body weight, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio. Final body weight and feed conversion ratio were not affected (P> 0. 05) by garlic supplementation. However, feed consumption was the lowest (P 0. 05) by garlic supplementation. All meat quality parameters measured were not affected (P> 0. 05) by garlic powder supplementation (cooking loss percentage, shear force, lightness, redness and yellowness), except for juiciness percentage and pH, which were the lowest (P< 0. 05) at 1. 0 % and 0. 25 %, respectively. As a conclusion, this study shows that garlic at a 0. 5 % level might be of beneficial effect on intestinal morphymetry parameters, as well as on production parameters...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000258325900001 International audienceBehavioural {{development}} is a complex phenomenon involving interactions between genetic constraints and environmental influences. One of the most potent environmental influences during the ontogeny of the behavioural characteristics of young is played by mothers. In particular, mammalian mothers modulate the social competences of their young, influencing all their future social life. Here, we investigated {{the influence of the}} social characteristics of adoptive mother birds (Coturnix coturnix japonica) on the social motivation (origin of every social relationship) of the young they reared. We characterized the social behaviour of standard <b>stock</b> <b>chicks</b> reared by female quail, genetically selected either for low (LSR) or high (HSR) levels of social reinstatement (index of treadmill behaviour which combined the tendency to run towards conspecifics with the tendency to move away from them), to investigate epigenetic transmission of social motivation. Our results show that HSR and LSR adoptive mothers partially transmitted their social characteristics to their young: chicks reared by HSR females presented higher levels of social motivation than chicks reared by LSR females. This maternal influence appeared much clearer in young males than in young females. Our study reveals that, as in mammals, bird mothers influence epigenetically the development of the social behaviour of their young...|$|R

As not much is known about the presence of these strains in the whole production pyramid, the epidemiology of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in the Dutch broiler production pyramid was examined. Cloacal swabs of <b>Grandparent</b> <b>stock</b> (GPS) birds (one-/two-days (breed A and B), 18 and 31 weeks old (breed A)), one-day old Parent stock birds (breed A and B) and broiler chickens of increasing age (breed A) were selectively cultured to detect ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates. ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were found at all levels in the broiler production pyramid in both broiler breeds examined. Prevalence was already relatively high at the top of the broiler production pyramid. At broiler farms ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli were still present in the environment of the poultry house after cleaning and disinfection. Feed samples taken in the poultry house also became contaminated with ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli after one or more production weeks. The prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-positive birds at broiler farms increased within the first week from 0 - 24 % to 96 - 100 % independent of the use of antibiotics and stayed 100 % until slaughter. In GPS breed A, prevalence at 2 days, 18 weeks and 31 weeks stayed below 50 % except when beta-lactam antibiotics were administered. In that case prevalence increased to 100 %. Interventions minimizing ESBL/AmpC contamination in broilers should focus on preventing horizontal and vertical spread, especially in relation to broiler production farms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBefore {{the year}} 2000, Mycoplasma synoviae was mainly {{associated}} with subclinical respiratory infections in broilers {{and was considered}} to have low clinical and economical impact in the Netherlands. Due to the occurrence of M. synoviae arthritis and amyloid arthropathy, and eggshell apex abnormalities added to the increasing demand for M. synoviae free poultry this has changed. Therefore, a cross-sectional seroprevalence study {{was carried out in}} a twelve month period during 2005 and 2006. Ten blood samples per farm were used as M. synoviae was expected to spread quickly except for grandparent and layer breeder stock where 24 - 60 blood samples per house derived from a voluntary M. synoviae monitoring programme were used. Sera were tested by means of Rapid Plate Agglutination (RPA) test (agglutination at dilution " 1 : 8 was considered positive). The farms sampled out of the national total were: broiler grandparent 53 / 53, broiler parent rearing 34 / 150, broiler parent 114 / 300, broiler 185 / 800, layer grandparent 13 / 13, layer parent 40 / 50, layer 173 / 1250 and meat turkey 50 / 75.

40|$|Although {{symmetrical}} polyarticular amyloidosis {{has been}} described extensively in brown layers, spontaneous unilateral amyloid arthropathy has not been described previously in chickens. Birds from nine flocks of broiler parent stock (PS) had unilateral lameness associated with severe swelling of the left hock joint and the caudal aspect of the metatarsus. Gross pathology was restricted to the left hock joint and the left digital flexor tendons in almost all cases, suggesting an association with administration of Marek's disease vaccine. Amyloid deposits were found in 83 % (25 / 30) of affected joints by histological examination of Congo red stained sections. Systemic amyloidosis, involving mainly the liver and spleen, was found in 59 % (10 / 17) of birds. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from joints in 77 % (23 / 30) of cases and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the joint in one case (1 / 30). Thirty-five E. faecalis isolates from joints, tendons and blood samples from birds in five affected PS flocks were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to separate genomic fragments after digestion with Sma I. All but one isolate had identical or closely related restriction endonuclease digestion (RED) patterns that were very similar to a known arthropathic and amyloidogenic E. faecalis isolate. A further 30 E. faecalis isolates from seven <b>grandparent</b> <b>stock</b> (GPS) flocks and two isolates from two unaffected PS flocks of the same genetic background were analysed by PFGE. Among these isolates, 11 originating from four GPS flocks had RED patterns identical to or {{closely related to the}} reference amyloid-inducing strain. Moreover, one E. faecalis isolate from amyloidotic joints of brown layers housed in California, USA was included in the analysis and appeared to be identical to the reference strain. This study showed that the E. faecalis isolates involved in these outbreaks of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders belonged to the same clone as that responsible for outbreaks in brown layers...|$|R
