Depending on the level, it can be a huge inconvenience for traffic safety, driving comfort, and overall pavement life-cycle. Rutting may be classified into three basic types: one-dimensional or vertical compaction, lateral flow or plastic movement, and mechanical deformation. As an addition to Superpave mixture volumetric design three, so called, simple performance tests (SPT) were recommended. Each of these tests in conduced in uniaxial or triaxial compression of cylindrical specimens. They cover the determination of dynamic modulus, repeated load permanent <b>deformation</b> <b>test</b> (flow number), and static load permanent <b>deformation</b> <b>test</b> (flow time).

40|$|As no {{limiting}} {{values are}} available for in situ deformability of horizontal soil layers such deformation was investigated in this research project. New test apparatus was developed to perform large-scale <b>deformation</b> <b>tests</b> on 0. 6 m high barrier models with a diameter of 4. 2 m. The test apparatus is known as 'The Darmstadt Simulator for Large-Scale <b>Deformation</b> <b>Tests</b> on Horizontal Soil Layers'. The {{main part of the}} support construction consists of cylindrical rubber cushions filled with water, concentrically arranged so that three independent ring encirclings are formed. By removing water from the rings the model is deformed vertically. Downward movement can be produced in a highly controlled way by means of hydraulically operating cushions to simulate subsidence and deformation. The lowering of its support leads to a radius of curvature in the model, at subsidence velocity 4 mm per day in the centre of the support construction. The model is made from 16 t of material, compacted in 5 cm lifts. A 0. 6 m deep water layer is maintained on its top and the onset of damage due to excessive deformation is indicated by appearance of water at its lower edge, measured by TDR probes and tensiometers in the support/drainage layer immediately below. Due to this definition of damage, special care is taken to prevent water from by-passing the barrier model down the inside wall of the <b>test</b> apparatus. Three <b>deformation</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out, two on Hessen silt, a low plasticity material and one on medium plastic Hessen clay. Sudden increases of water content in the support/drainage layer on reaching radii of curvature between 70 m to 40 m indicated the onset of deformation failure in the Hessen silt soil layers. However, on dismantling the models cracks could not be observed visually. For the Hessen clay the maximum <b>deformation</b> of the <b>test</b> apparatus, corresponding to a radius of curvature of 6 m, does not cause any leakage. The serviceability of the model using Hessen clay is still available under those subsidence conditions. (orig.)

It is shown that methane hydrate exhibits strain hardening only if the hydrate is confined to a certain finite cross-sectional area that is normal to the compression direction. For normal ice, it does not present strain hardening under the same conditions. We show that hydrate guest methane molecules exhibit no long-distance diffusion when confined to a finite-size area. They appear to serve as non-deformable units that prevent hydrate structure failure, and thus are responsible for the strain-hardening phenomenon...|$|E

A transition layer mainly composed of Mg, Fe and O elements is formed between Fe thin film and ZK 60 substrate.

40|$|Strong (sample 402) {{and weak}} (sample 401) hard wheat flour were {{selected}} and their physicochemical property changes were investigated as functions of mixing, resting and heating, {{especially in the}} aspects of rheological behavior, molecular mobility measured by NMR relaxation properties, and microstructure obtained by cry-SEM. Small <b>deformation</b> <b>tests</b> during heating agreed well with NMR relaxation times. During gelatinization, G* rapidly increased and phase angle decreased, which was correlated with the changes in three different components of T 2 signal intensities and decreasing water mobility measured by NMR relaxation times. The onset temperature {{of the increase in}} G* and the decreasing rate of phase angle were different according to mixing time. Lower water mobility in the longer mixed dough, as indicated by shorter NMR relaxation times, was related to slower onset of gelatinization, which made the phase angle decrease more slowly during gelatinization. Small <b>deformation</b> <b>tests</b> showed that, during the initial resting period, G* and phase angle decreased for undermixed dough, whereas overmixed dough showed opposite trends. The G* for optimally mixed dough was stable during resting. This was more obvious for sample 402. The large <b>deformation</b> <b>tests</b> (stress growth curve) more clearly showed the differences among optimal, under and overmixed dough, and between strong and weak flour. The optimally mixed dough showed the highest peak stress and strain at the peak for both samples, and sample 402, compared to sample 401, showed much higher peak stress and stable strain at the peak during resting, suggesting that the stability of the strain at the peak, as well as the absolute value of the peak stress and the strain at the peak must be considered to evaluate the strength and the optimum mixing time of hard wheat flour dough. The initial stress in the stress growth curve had similar trends as G* in small deformation. Decreased water mobility during resting, as indicated by decreasing NMR relaxation times, was possibly attributed to increasing molecular interactions caused by prolonged hydration, which may be related to an increase in soluble compounds observed by cryo-SEM. ...|$|R
