40|$|Micro-X-ray fluorescence, MXRF, has {{significant}} potential for trace elemental analysis {{when combined with}} proper specimen preparation. The combination of preconcentration with localized spatially resolved excitation offers increased sensitivity for both aqueous solutions and solid matrices. An additional attractive feature of MXRF is the small specimen size required. Present studies are directed towards the application of this method to trace elemental analysis. Specimen preparation can greatly affect detection limits, accuracy, precision, and background interference. Thus, three specimen preparation methods for selected SRMs will be examined: micro-pellet, slurry, and dried spot.

50|$|For {{deconvolution}} to be effective, {{all variables}} in the image scene and capturing device need to be modeled, <b>including</b> <b>aperture,</b> focal length, distance to subject, lens, and media refractive indices and geometries. Applying deconvolution successfully to general-purpose camera images is usually not feasible, because the geometries of the scene are not set. However, deconvolution is applied in reality to microscopy and astronomical imaging, where the value of gained sharpness is high, imaging devices and the relative subject positions are both well defined, and the imaging devices would cost {{a great deal more}} to optimize to improve sharpness physically. In cases where a stable, well-defined aberration is present, such as the lens defect in early Hubble Space Telescope images, deconvolution is an especially effective technique.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tutorial {{review of the}} aberration-sensitivity characteristic of unstable-cavity geometries. The general formulation of the set of aberration-sensitivity coefficients for an unstable cavity is provided, and the geometric approximation of their behavior is fully developed. The influence of the diffractive formation of the transverse-mode field distribution on the aberration sensitivity is considered in detail, and the interrelationship between this sensitivity measure and the diffractive transverse-mode discrimination of the cavity is described. The theory is developed for both standing-wave and traveling-wave (ring) cavities. Methods of modifying the aberra-tion-sensitivity behavior for a given unstable-cavity geometry are also considered; these <b>include</b> <b>aperture</b> apodiza-tion, intracavity spatial filtering, and intracavity beam rotation. Finally, the application of an intracavity adaptive-optic system {{for the purpose of}} transverse-mode control in the presence of uncontrollable intracavity aberration sources is considered from both the geometric and the diffractive theories. 1...|$|R
