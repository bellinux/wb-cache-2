25|$|Dolphin meat is {{dense and}} such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat {{is located in a}} layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either {{horseradish}} or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut <b>into</b> <b>bite-size</b> cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver.|$|E

50|$|Though {{the methods}} of cooking cassava vary from region to region, the main method is simply frying it. After {{the skin of the}} root is removed, the flesh is {{sectioned}} <b>into</b> small <b>bite-size</b> chunks that can then be soaked in water to aid in frying. The chunks are fried and then served, sometimes with a chili-salt mixture. This fried cassava is a very common street food as it is relatively cheap to buy, easy to prepare and good to eat. The same applies to another very common roadside method where the cassava is lightly boiled and cut into straight pieces about 8 - 10 in long. These pieces are then roasted over charcoal grills, served hot by splitting through the middle and applying the chili-salt mixture.|$|R

The exhibition {{took place at}} two UCA campuses and at The National Archives. It featured a panel exhibition that sat beside the objects, including a small sculpture, glass work, a wedding dress and documentation of my 'In Our Minds' dance performance. Everyday People is a choreography project directed by Sally Marie (Sweetshop Revolution) and produced by Rachel Palmer from The Dance Movement The project was awarded £ 15 k from Arts Council England and took 6 people, unconnected from the dance world {{through the process of}} developing an idea, devising a dance and presenting it to an audience. Sally Marie facilitated each novice choreographer over a period of seven weeks to translate their ideas to 4 professional dancers, before assisting them in developing these <b>into</b> six <b>bite-size</b> dances which were presented at Farnham Maltings on Sunday 21 st August 2016. My choreography for Everyday People explores themes of mental health and impact on family through using movement and gesture. Visiting the archive for background research revealed common themes to the personal stories that I had witnessed in my family and allowed me to give permission to myself to make the work; it provided an authentic rationale...|$|R

50|$|During {{a dinner}} or luncheon invitation, the oldest man, most senior family member, or the honored host, {{has the right}} to {{initiate}} the meal, followed {{by the rest of the}} family and guests to help themselves to the dishes. Indonesian meals are commonly eaten with the combination of a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left hand to push the food onto the spoon. Knife however, is absent from dining table, thus most of the ingredients such as vegetables and meat are already cut <b>into</b> <b>bite-size</b> pieces prior to cooking.|$|E
50|$|Konro is an Indonesian rib soup {{originating}} {{with the}} Makassarese and Buginese of South Sulawesi. Usually this soup {{was made with}} ribs, such as spareribs or beef as main ingredient.

The spicy and strong-tasting soup is made from a mixture of rich spices, which includes coriander, keluwak (Pangium edule); a fruit that gives it its blackish color, also small amount of nutmeg, turmeric, galangal, cinnamon, tamarind, lemongrass, clove, and salam (Indonesian bayleaf).|$|E

50|$|One {{example of}} laddu is Motichoor Ka Ladoo. It is a sweet food {{in states like}} Bihar, made from roasted gram flour flakes which are sweetened, mixed with almonds, rolled into a batter which is then cast into mini balls and fried in ghee. Every mini ball called 'boondi' has enough sugar that melts like a fresh sweet. The mini balls are then {{combined}} with aromatic spices and then formed <b>into</b> <b>bite-size</b> spheres, which are called Motichoor Ka Ladoo. When bit, the mini balls distribute over the tongue for a burst of flavors throughout the mouth. Other examples include Tirupati Laddu so popular that over a million Laddu are distributed every week from a single temple of Lord Venkateswara.|$|E
5000|$|The {{meal was}} {{originally}} developed by sailors who were often at sea for weeks, and even months, where few fresh ingredients {{were able to}} withstand such lengthy trips. Therefore, long-lasting foods were a necessity, and fish and brewis became the crew's favorite. The idea that sailors called the hardtack or sea biscuit brewis (pronounced 'brews') because of their practice of bruising or breaking up the bread <b>into</b> <b>bite-size</b> pieces is likely part of a contemporary legend, {{and it has been}} argued more convincingly that the word [...] "brewis" [...] dates back to Middle English, originally referred to bread soaked in fat or dripping and is cognate with brose. A variant of brewis is found in Wales.|$|E
5000|$|Cha mongkut (จ่ามงกุฎ, [...] ) {{is a name}} {{of one of the}} {{traditional}} Thai desserts. It is similar to kalamae and is made of rice flour and glutinous flour mixed with green bean flour, and is stirred with coconut milk and sugar until it becomes sticky; it is typically sprinkled with chopped roasted peanuts on top or stuffed with melon seeds (The old traditional recipe uses pieces of fried flour that are as small as rice grains, which take a longer time to prepare.). Traditionally, they are cut it <b>into</b> <b>bite-size</b> pieces and wrapped with banana leaf. Moreover, the aromatic scents of the dessert are given by fresh flowers such as Kesidang, Ylang-Ylang, Damask rose, and Jasmine with boiled water, which is used to squeeze coconut milk. Cha mongkut is easy to keep and {{does not need to be}} stored in a refrigerator.|$|E
50|$|Indonesian {{meals are}} {{commonly}} eaten with {{the combination of}} a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left hand (to push the food onto the spoon). Unlike European dining custom, knife however, is absent from dining table, thus most of the ingredients such as vegetables and meat are already cut <b>into</b> <b>bite-size</b> pieces prior of cooking. Although, {{in many parts of the}} country, such as West Java and West Sumatra, it is also common to eat with one's bare hands. In restaurants or households that commonly use bare hands to eat, such as seafood food stalls, traditional Sundanese and Minangkabau restaurants, or East Javanese pecel lele (fried catfish with sambal) and ayam goreng (fried chicken) food stalls, kobokan is usually served along with the food. Kobokan is a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent, this bowl of water is not intended for consumption, rather it is used to wash one's hand before and after eating. Eating with chopsticks is generally only found in food stalls or restaurants serving Indonesian adaptations of Chinese cuisine, such as bakmie or mie ayam (chicken noodle) with pangsit (wonton), mie goreng (fried noodles), and kwetiau goreng (fried flat rice noodles).|$|E
5000|$|In South East Asia, {{the term}} [...] "yong tau foo" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} a dish instead of the stuffed tofu item exclusively. It is {{a variation of the}} above Hakka cuisine as cooked by other dialect groups. The dish can contain a varied selection of food items, including young tau foo, fish balls, crab sticks, bitter melons, cuttlefish, lettuce, ladies fingers, as well as chilis, and various forms of fresh produce, seafood and meats common in Chinese cuisine. Vegetables such as bitter melon and chilis are usually filled with surimi. The foods are then sliced <b>into</b> <b>bite-size</b> pieces, cooked briefly in boiling broth and then served either in the broth as soup or with the broth in a separate bowl. The dish is eaten with chopsticks and a soup spoon and can be eaten by itself or served with a bowl of steamed rice, noodles or rice vermicelli. Another variation of this dish would be to serve it with laksa gravy or curry sauce. Essential accompaniments are a spicy, vinegary chili sauce, originally made with red fermented bean curd and distantly similar in taste to Sriracha sauce, and a distinctive brown sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce for dipping.|$|E
