These coating compositions are useful as a top coat varnish for leather, wood & rubber.Castor wax can also be added to beeswax for encaustic painting.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the cell}} {{membrane}} {{is not able}} to pass current (except in ion channels), it acts as an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor.</b> Subjecting membranes to a high-voltage electric field results in their temporary breakdown, resulting in pores that are large enough to allow macromolecules (such as DNA) to enter or leave the cell.|$|E
50|$|Malcolm C. Smith, {{a control}} {{engineering}} {{professor at the}} University of Cambridge, first introduced inerters in a 2002 paper. Smith extended the analogy between electrical and mechanical networks (the mobility analogy). He observed that the analogy was incomplete, since it was missing a mechanical device playing the same role as an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor.</b> It was found {{that it is possible}} to construct such a device using gears.|$|E
5000|$|A motor {{capacitor}}, {{such as a}} {{start capacitor}} or run capacitor (including a dual run capacitor) is an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor</b> that alters the current {{to one or more}} windings of a single phase AC induction motor to create a rotating magnetic field. There are two common types of motor capacitors, run capacitors and start capacitors. The units of capacitance are labeled in microfarads (µF).

50|$|The energy {{dissipated}} {{within a}} medium as sound travels through it {{is analogous to}} the energy dissipated in electrical resistors or that dissipated in mechanical dampers for mechanical motion transmission systems. All three are equivalent to the resistive part of a system of resistive and reactive elements. The resistive elements dissipate energy (irreversibly into heat) and the reactive elements store and release energy (reversibly, neglecting small losses). The reactive parts of an acoustic medium are determined by its bulk modulus and its density, analogous to respectively an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor</b> and an electrical inductor, and analogous to, respectively, a mechanical spring attached to a mass.|$|E
5000|$|While Maxwell Dillon, an {{electrical}} engineer and lineman, was repairing a power line, a freak lightning accident caused a mutagenic change that transformed him into a living <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor.</b> His powers were initially weak, so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from Stark Industries to charge himself. During this time, he was approached by Magneto, who considered him a potential recruit for his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, claiming that Dillon's power rivaled his own, but Dillon refused. The following day, Dillon was confronted by a small-time thug from whom he had been borrowing {{money to pay for}} the machinery he had needed. When the thug drew a gun on him because he had not paid back the money yet, he responded by shooting a blast of lightning through the thug's chest—the first time Dillon ever killed anybody. Soon taking the name [...] "Electro", he turned to a life of a professional criminal, his first victim being J. Jonah Jameson. Electro broke into the Daily Bugle Building and stole from Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During their first ever confrontation, Spider-Man was nearly killed after touching the electrically charged villain. Spider-Man eventually used a fire hose to short-circuit Electro while wearing rubber gloves to protect himself.|$|E
50|$|The model {{dubbed the}} 'electric double layer' was first {{introduced}} by Hermann von Helmholtz. It assumes that a solution is only composed of electrolytes, no reactions occur near the electrode which could transfer electrons, {{and that the only}} Van der Waals interactions are present between the ions in solution and the electrode. These interactions arise only due to the charge density associated with the electrode which arises from either an excess or deficiency of electrons at the electrode's surface. To maintain electrical neutrality the charge of the electrode will be balanced by a redistribution of ions close to its surface. The attracted ions thus form a layer balancing the electrode's charge. The closest distance an ion can come to the electrode will be limited to the radius of the ion plus a single solvation sphere around an individual ion. Overall, two layers of charge and a potential drop from the electrode {{to the edge of the}} outer layer (outer Helmholtz Plane) are observed.Given the above description, the Helmholtz model is equivalent in nature to an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor</b> with two separated plates of charge, for which a linear potential drop is observed at increasing distance from the plates. The Helmholtz model, while a good foundation for the description of the interface does not take into account several important factors: diffusion/mixing in solution, the possibility of adsorption on to the surface and the interaction between solvent dipole moments and the electrode.|$|E
50|$|A charged bank of <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitors</b> is {{switched}} {{onto the}} anode. The gas within the reaction chamber breaks {{down and a}} rapidly rising electric current flows across the backwall electrical insulator, axisymmetrically, as depicted by the path (labeled 1) as shown in Fig. 1. The axisymmetric sheath of plasma current lifts off the insulator due to {{the interaction of the}} current with its own magnetic field (Lorentz force). The plasma sheath is accelerated axially, to position 2, and then to position 3, ending the axial phase of the device.|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} a solid {{material}} can deform when stimulated by electricity originated in the late- 18 th century with observations of ruptures in overcharged Leyden jars, the first <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitors.</b> In 1776, Italian scientist Alessandro Volta mentioned in a letter that Italian experimenter Felice Fontana had noted volume changes in the Leyden jar upon electrification, an observation that launched a new field of investigation—“deformable” materials affected by electricity.

40|$|Research is {{reported}} to identify polycarbonate (PC) film characteristics and fabrication procedures which extend the reliable performance range of PC capacitors to 125 C without derating, and establish quality control techniques and transfer technology to US PC film manufacturers. The approach chosen to solve these problems was to develop techniques for fabricating biaxially oriented (BX) 2 microns or thinner PC film with a low dissipation factor up to 140 C; isotropic dimensional stability; high crystallinity; and high voltage breakdown strength. The PC film structure and morphology was then correlated to thermal and <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor</b> behavior.

40|$|Based {{on results}} from a field survey campaign, this paper {{describes}} three new developments which have been integrated to provide for a comprehensive basis {{for the evaluation of}} overheating risk in offices. Firstly, a set of logistic regression equations have been derived to predict the probability of office occupants ’ adaptation of personal and environmental characteristics. Secondly, empirical adaptive increments (offsets in comfort temperature) have been derived for each of these modes of adaptation. Thirdly, these adaptive increments are used to derive adapted degree-days of overheating stimuli for input to a new model to predict overheating risk. Based on analogy between the charging and discharging of humans’ tolerance to overheating stimuli and that of charge in an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor,</b> this analytical model uses empirical coefficients to tune its (dis) charging time constants to a given population and situation.

40|$|Electrical cell {{signaling}} requires adjustment of ion channel, receptor, or transporter function {{in response to}} changes in membrane potential. For the majority of such membrane proteins, the molecular details of voltage sensing remain insufficiently understood. Here, we present a molecular dynamics simulation-based method to determine the underlying charge movement across the membrane—the gating charge—by measuring <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor</b> properties of membrane-embedded proteins. We illustrate the approach by calculating the charge transfer upon membrane insertion of the HIV gp 41 fusion peptide, and validate the method on two prototypical voltage-dependent proteins, the Kv 1. 2 K+ channel and the voltage sensor of the Ciona intestinalis voltage-sensitive phosphatase, against experimental data. We then use the gating charge analysis to study how the T 1 domain modifies voltage sensing in Kv 1. 2 channels and to investigate the voltage dependence of the initial binding of two Na+ ions in Na+-coupled glutamate transporters. Our simulation approach quantifies various mechanisms of voltage sensing, enables direct comparison with experiments, and supports mechanistic interpretation of voltage sensitivity by fractional amino acid contribution...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} cuticular {{structures on}} the abdomen of the Oriental hornet (Vespa orientalis, Vespinae, Hymenoptera) {{in the region}} of the yellow stripes. A cross section in this region reveals the cuticle to resemble a notebook with more than 30 pages, the topmost pages (analogous to layers) being the thicker (up to 5 mu m or more in thickness) while the ones underneath are gradually thinner. The exterior of the cuticle displays pores which are dispersed at distances of 10 - 50 mu m apart. These pores are actually cuticular depressions which frequently possess eaves on their cephalic side whose internal diameter is 1 - 3 mu m near the surface but further down, {{in the region of}} the yellow pigment and the hypocuticle, this internal diameter broadens to about 20 - 30 mu m. These pores thus extend from the exocuticle down to the hypocuticle. In the spaces between the pores in the endocuticular region there are sinuses. Within these sinuses granules of yellow pigment are located. As for the pores, each of them represents the external outlet of a canal that is perpendicular to the cuticle. The canal walls are composed of the same layers making up the cuticle. Structurally, the canal encasing the pore resembles an upside down arrow. This arrow extends to about 35 - 40 mu m in depth and is narrow and hollow in its upper part-the shaft-for about 1 - 3 mu m, broadens into the shape of an onion in its lower head part (some 20 - 30 mu m in diameter). Down to its tip it becomes slightly sharpened to close at the hypocuticle by forming a concentric, dome shape structure that terminates in a nipple-shaped protuberance. Permeating through all layers of the cuticle are hemolymph, nerve fibers and tracheae. The parallel lamellae associated in the cuticle give the impression of an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The present article discusses the structure of the cuticle as a photovoltaic system in which the endocuticle-lamellar layer and yellow pigment serves as a solar cell linked to an <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The manner whereby light energy and heat are collected, converted into electric energy, accumulated, transformed and used by the hornet is discussed.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{evidence}} from animal studies, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are considered potentially carcinogenic to humans. However, the results of studies in human populations exposed to PCBs have been inconsistent. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort analysis (1957 - 1986) comparing the mortality of 3, 588 <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitor</b> manufacturing workers with known exposure to PCBs with age-, sex-, and calendar time-specific mortality rates for all whites in the United States. Proportional hazards modeling was also performed to examine the association between cumulative PCB exposure and site-specific cancer mortality. All-cause mortality (192 deaths ob-served, 283. 3 expected) and total cancer mortality (54 deaths observed, 63. 7 expected) were lower than expected.

The average estimated cumulative dose for the cases of brain cancer (22. 9 units) was greater than for other workers (12. 9 units), but the 95 % confidence intervals around this difference were broad.

A pneumatic battery allows energy to be stored chemically in a Hydrogen Peroxide (H 2 O 2) solution and released when the solution decomposes, producing oxygen gas. This decomposition is sped up {{with the aid of}} a platinum catalyst. A mechanical negative feedback system regulates the exposure of the catalyst, allowing the battery to generate a user specified pressure at its outlet.
