5|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare {{features}} team-based and deathmatch-based multiplayer modes {{on various}} maps. Each mode has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete. Players can call in UAV reconnaissance scans, air strikes, and attack helicopters, when they achieve three-, five-, and seven-enemy kill streaks respectively. A game ends when either a team or player {{has reached a}} predefined number of points, or the allotted time expires {{in which case the}} team or player with the most points wins. If the points are even when the time expires, Sudden Death mode is activated <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> re-spawning and the team who either has the last man standing, or achieves the objective first are the winners. If the player is in either of the two matches, then there is an Overtime match, in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> claim for any sum of money.|$|E

Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition {{have the potential}} to be [...] "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.|$|R

5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and wealth that the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even {{in the case of}} accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

25|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} (or slash and burn) is {{a system}} in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years. Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.|$|E
