40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The study {{reported}} in this thesis investigated the influences on the choice of support activities by a total population of 14 <b>itinerant</b> <b>teachers</b> who work with 59 students who are deaf and hard of hearing in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The support activities of the <b>itinerant</b> <b>teachers</b> were surveyed and compared with student files that documented the learning and development needs of their individual students, without exclusions. It was found that direct teaching formed {{the majority of the}} support activities, which were primarily focused on the students’ assessed and documented needs in regard to the development of skills in language, listening, and literacy. The teachers generally used combinations of explicit skill-based teaching, and teaching that integrated listening, speech, and language goals with the class curriculum and with the interests of their students. The provision of conversation was strongly supported by the <b>itinerant</b> <b>teachers,</b> as was the need for consultation and collaboration with the class teachers. Interviews and written comments were used to explore influences, other than student needs, on the support activities. Those influences included a strong collegial team structure, the availability of a program to teach auditory skills, and the requirements for consultation and reviews from legislation and schools. Individual education plans and summative tests were not found to be significant influences, but there was a consistent use of informal language progress monitoring to inform teaching activities. The findings were consistent across (a) a variety of school settings, including students with varied communication needs and those with additional disabilities, and (b) across a range of <b>itinerant</b> <b>teachers</b> who came from a variety of backgrounds. The results support the critical role of <b>itinerant</b> <b>teachers</b> in supporting language development by both explicit teaching and indirect activities...|$|R

Collis and Stephen Potter gave up their hopes in him. By 1933 he had abandoned his wife and children and he did not re-establish contact with his daughter until decades later. He became an <b>itinerant</b> <b>teacher</b> of drama and, latterly, a minor civil servant and something of a recluse. Towards the end of his life, he became a lodger in a house near Weymouth where he was 'discovered' by art student Edward Chaney. The latter encouraged him to complete his novel and eventually got it published. In September 2008 Chaney and Jane Mosse unveiled Guernsey's first Blue Plaque on Edwards's father's house on the island.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the individual power of teachers as subordinates in elementary schools. It focused on the informal social structure in "good" elementary schools and the roles played by principals, teachers who held formal governance positions, <b>itinerant</b> <b>teachers,</b> and participants in the district's career ladder pilot program. Roles sampled were (1) providers of moral support, (2) sources of teaching expertise, (3) dispensers of procedural information, and (4) those able to "get things done" in the school. Peer and principal dependency data were also collected. Teachers and principals in five elementary schools in a single school district were sampled twice in a two year period. Findings were: (1) Although "good" principals received high total scores for providing resources to the faculty, there were instances when individual teachers scored as high or higher than the principal. (2) Faculty and principals depended on providers of moral support more than they depended {{on any of the}} traditionally power-producing roles. (3) Teachers depended on peers mostly for moral support, less for teaching expertise and "getting things done," and least for information. Teachers depended on the principal for moral support and information, less for "getting things done," and least for teaching expertise. (4) Full-time classroom teachers and specialists were most active in the social structure. Part-time <b>teachers,</b> <b>itinerant</b> <b>teachers,</b> and special services personnel, such as psychologists, speech/language pathologists, etc., were not key participants. Some full-time teachers, such as fine arts, physical education, and self-contained special education teachers were less active.
