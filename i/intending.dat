40|$|How do {{developers}} and designers {{of a new}} technology make sense of <b>intended</b> users? The critical groundwork for user-centred technology development begins not by involving actual users' exposure to the technological artefact but much earlier, with designers' and developers' vision of future users. Thus, anticipating <b>intended</b> users is critical to technology uptake. We conceptualise the anticipation of <b>intended</b> users {{as a form of}} prospective sensemaking in technology development. Employing a narrative analytical approach and drawing on four key communities in the development of Grid computing, we reconstruct how each community anticipated the <b>intended</b> Grid user. Based on our findings, we conceptualise user anticipation in Terms of two key dimensions, namely the <b>intended</b> possibility to inscribe user needs into the technological artefact as well as the <b>intended</b> scope of the application domain. In turn, these dimensions allow us to develop an initial typology of <b>intended</b> user concepts that in turn might provide a key building block towards a generic typology of <b>intended</b> users...|$|R

Díaz named the Colorado River Rio del Tizon ("Firebrand River") after seeing a practice used by the local natives for warming themselves. The name Tizon lasted for the next 200 years, while the name Rio Colorado ("Red River") was first applied to a tributary of the Gila River, possibly the Verde River, circa 1720. The first known map to label the main stem as the Colorado was drawn by French cartographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin in 1743.|$|E
