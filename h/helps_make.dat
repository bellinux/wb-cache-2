The subdued morning and evening light <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E

Thus, {{by the end of}} the 19th century, , Emmanuel Carvallo, and Francis Whipple had showed with rigid-body dynamics that some safety bicycles could actually balance themselves if moving at the right speed. Bourlet won the Prix Fourneyron, and Whipple won the Cambridge University Smith Prize.

25|$|Properties {{within a}} {{historic}} district fall {{into one of}} two types of property: contributing and non-contributing. A contributing property, such as a 19th-century mansion, <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> a historic district historic, while a non-contributing property, such as a modern medical clinic, does not. The contributing properties are key to a historic district's historic associations, historic architectural qualities, or archaeological qualities. A property can change from contributing to non-contributing and vice versa if significant alterations take place.|$|E
25|$|Jacksonville's {{location}} on the St. Johns River and the Atlantic Ocean proved providential {{in the growth of}} the city and its industry. Jacksonville has a sizable deepwater port, which <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> it a leading port in the U.S. for automobile imports, as well as the leading transportation and distribution hub in the state. However, the strength of the city's economy lies in its broad diversification. While the area once had many thriving dairies such as Gustafson's Farm and Skinner Dairy, this aspect of the economy has declined over time. The area's economy is balanced among distribution, financial services, biomedical technology, consumer goods, information services, manufacturing, insurance and other industries.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} {{is a part}} of {{the male}} reproductive system that <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams. It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. The prostate contains many small glands which make about 20% of the fluid constituting semen. In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands mutate into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|E

500|$|Earthsuit {{music was}} {{primarily}} rock, but also possessed strong hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental elements. Their sound had sometimes {{been compared to}} The Police, while Meany's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: [...] "Each {{one of us is}} really into {{a lot of different things}} ... it <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> our sound because you can hear all kinds of things". Live performances were characterized by [...] sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit's style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and The Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} Myst games, the visuals and interactivity of Revelation were {{singled out as}} the strongest features. Reviewers praised the use of subtle animations to bring the scenery to life; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin stated that the additions [...] "truly <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> each scene in the game seem like {{more than just a}} panoramic picture, and instead it feels like a real place". Jack Wall's score and the sound design were consistently praised. The addition of the in-game camera and notes system was also positively received. PC Zone proclaimed that although {{it would have been easy}} for the developers to lose heart after the disappointing , Ubisoft had instead produced [...] "one of the most polished games" [...] the reviewer, Paul Presley, had ever come across.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were highlighted}} positively. Kasavin {{was impressed with}} the amount of lighting and motion blur effects, and noted that the [...] "excellent character animation <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> the guns feel as powerful as they look." [...] Bryn Williams of GameSpy considered the graphics as a [...] "stunning look at what the 360 hardware is capable of", but also admitted that the animation [...] "is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness". IGN credited the attractive gun models, explosions, and sprawling vistas, but felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily look too shiny. The game's audio was said to feature [...] "heavy-hitting weapon effects [...] fantastic, moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms".|$|E
500|$|Robert Fulford in the Toronto-based {{magazine}} Maclean's, {{noted that}} [...] "the characteristic which makes Fleming appear so silly also <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> him so popular: his moral simplicity. When we read James Bond we know whose side we are on, {{why we are}} on that side and why we are certain to win. In the real world {{that is no longer}} possible." [...] Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times, noted that Bond's mission [...] "is aimed at restoring Britain's pre-World War II place among the powers of the world. And on that subject, above all others, Ian Fleming's novels are endlessly, bitterly eloquent." [...] The Boston Globes Mary Castle opined that the agent's trip was [...] "Bond's latest and grimmest mission", which she called [...] "Escapism in the Grand Manner".|$|E
500|$|Padukone {{had five}} film {{releases}} in 2010. Her first role was in Vijay Lalwani's psychological thriller Karthik Calling Karthik, where Padukone was {{cast as the}} supportive girlfriend of a depressed man (played by Farhan Akhtar) who goes {{through a series of}} changes after receiving mysterious phone calls every morning. Derek Elley of Variety found the film to be [...] "thinly plotted" [...] but added that [...] "the uncomplicated ingenuousness of Padukone... <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> the tall tale convincing." [...] Commercially, the film performed poorly. Her most economically profitable film that year was Sajid Khan's -grossing comedy film Housefull in which she featured alongside an ensemble cast including Akshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh, Lara Dutta, Arjun Rampal, Jiah Khan, and Boman Irani. Raja Sen described the film as a [...] "festival of bad acting" [...] and attributed Padukone's poor performance to her [...] "plasticky expressions." ...|$|E

[...] He further expressed that David Yates [...] "transmutes [...] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle." [...] Another review was released {{on the same day}} from Evening Standard, who rated the film 4 out of 5 and stated [...] "Millions of children, parents, and those who should know better won't need reminding what a Horcrux is– and director David Yates does not let them down. In fact, in some ways, he <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> up for the shortcomings of the final book." [...] The Daily Express remarked that the film showcases [...] "a terrifying showdown that easily equals Lord of the Rings or Star Wars in terms of a dramatic and memorable battle between good and evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said [...] "the stately 'Just Like Heaven' [...] is {{remarkable}} and <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> the album [...] {{one of the}} group's very best". Ned Raggett, also of Allmusic, wrote that the song was [...] "instantly memorable, [...] sparkling with rough energy [...] it's a perfect showcase for Robert Smith's ear for wistful, romantic numbers. His main guitar line, a descending, gently chiming melody, contrasts perfectly against the fuzzier mix of the rhythm guitars, while Simon Gallup's bass and Boris Williams' strong, immediate drums make for a great introduction to the track." [...] Barry Walsh of Slant magazine said the Cure [...] "...is {{at the top of}} its game [...] on the simply stellar 'Just Like Heaven'. Glistening descending guitar lines, Gallup's throbbing bass line, and Williams' authoritative thumping frame a typically lovelorn Smith lyric, with the end result being one of the Cure's finest singles, and perhaps one of the best pop singles of the late '80s." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that <b>helps</b> <b>make</b> the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E
