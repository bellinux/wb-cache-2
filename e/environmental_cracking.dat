40|$|The <b>environmental</b> stress <b>cracking</b> {{resistance}} of halloysite nanoclay-polyester nanocomposites was investigated using fracture mechanics approach. The incorporation of halloysite nanoclay {{was found to}} improve the <b>environmental</b> stress <b>cracking</b> {{resistance of}} the nano-composites. The storage modulus of nano-composites measured by dynamic mechanical analysis increased remarkably {{as a function of}} halloysite nanoclay content. At 0. 7 wt% nanoclay, the Tg improved from 72 °C to 76 °C. The fracture toughness increased up to 33 % and time to failure improved 155 % with the addition of 0. 7 wt% of halloysite nanoclay. The maximum microhardness was found 119 % higher for the same nano-filler concentration compared to monolithic polyester. The reinforcement with 1 wt% showed lower fracture toughness due to agglomerations of nanoclay which act as flaws. The presence of agglomerates weakened the bond between nano-particles and matrix hence reduces the <b>environmental</b> stress <b>cracking</b> resistance by halloysite nanoclay reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|OAK-B 135 This ID {{belongs to}} an IWO {{and is being}} {{released}} out of the system. The Program manager Rebecca Richardson has confirmed that all reports have been received. The objective of the proposed research is to develop the scientific basis for {{a new class of}} radiation-resistant materials. Two approaches will be evaluated to develop damage resistant materials far superior to current stainless steels: (1) lattice perturbation to catalyze defect recombination within the early stages of cascade formation and defect migration and (2) controlled manipulation of the aggregate defect ensemble through the deliberate introduction of dynamic metastable microstructures. The intrinsic ability of the host matrix to resist displacement damage survival will be optimized in first concept. This approach (Task 1) explores baseline atomic displacement and recovery processes as affected by major and minor alloy constituents selected for the dual purpose of <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking</b> resistance as well as interactions with point defects. Inert oversized solutes known to improve corrosion behavior will be used to create vacancy/interstitial traps and promote defect recombination. Dynamic metastable microstructures tailored to resist damage accumulation will be investigated and optimized in the second concept (Task 2). Unique intermetallic second phases with inherent instabilities under irradiation will be used to create a dynamic microstructure resistant to radiation hardening, swelling and embrittlement. A key aspect of designing this dynamic microstructure will be to ensure the complex, radiation-induced changes do not promote <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking.</b> The underlying radiation materials science for these two approaches is being explored using charged particle irradiations. Radiation damage resistance will be established by isolating the effect of each approach on defect microstructure, grain boundary microchemistries and matrix hardening. The dose dependence of these radiation-induced material changes will be used to identify promising alloys and initial microstructure that effectively delay or eliminate detrimental microstructural and microchemical evolution. <b>Environmental</b> <b>cracking</b> response is being established on non-irradiated alloys with thermomechanical treatments to simulate radiation microstructures and by tests on proton-irradiated specimens. The ultimate goal for these alloys will be resistance to <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking,</b> swelling and embrittlement during the high radiation exposures (> 150 dpa) planned for advanced reactors...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of a damage-resistant alloy based on Hf solute additions to a low-carbon 316 SS is {{the highlight of the}} Phase II research. This damage resistance is supported by characterization of radiation-induced microstructures and microchemistries along with measurements of <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking.</b> The addition of Hf to a low-carbon 316 SS reduced the detrimental impact of radiation by changing the distribution of Hf. Pt additions reduced the impact of radiation on grain boundary segregation but did not alter its effect on microstructural damage development or cracking. Because cracking susceptibility is associated with several material characteristics, separate effect experiments exploring strength effects using non-irradiated stainless steels were conducted. These crack growth tests suggest that irradiation strength by itself can promote <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking.</b> The second concept for developing damage resistant alloys is the use of metastable precipitates to stabilize the microstructure during irradiation. Three alloys have been tailored for evaluation of precipitate stability influences on damage evolution. The first alloy is a Ni-base alloy (alloy 718) that has been characterized at low neutron irradiation doses but has not been characterized at high irradiation doses. The other two alloys are Fe-base alloys (PH 17 - 7 and PH 17 - 4) that have similar precipitate structures as alloy 718 but is more practical in nuclear structures because of the lower Ni content and hence lesser transmutation to He...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{environment}} of HTHP and high H 2 S, the sour gas enters into the annulus {{as a result of}} various factors, leading to annulus pressure and inducing the risk of the stress corrosion cracking in the oil string or the upper casing. To solve the problem, {{the environment}}al fracture toughness of C 110 high strength casing steel was tested in the NACE A solution and the wellbore protection fluid in simulated conditions in the CORTEST pressure testing system and homemade HTHP autoclave using NACE DCB method in this paper. Wellbore protection fluid is a corrosion inhibitor for steel in oil pipe and annulus. The results indicate that the environmental fracture toughness KISSC of C 110 casing steel is 22. 78 MPa•m 1 / 2, showing strong <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking</b> sensitivity in the standard NACE A solution. In the wellbore protection fluid under the simulated down hole conditions, where the partial pressure of H 2 S is 1 MPa, the partial pressure of CO 2 is 0. 6 MPa, the total pressure is 48 Mpa and the temperature is 110 °C, it has good resistance to stress corrosion cracking.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fracture}} mechanics approach provides {{insight into the}} phenomenon of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and helps to develop guidance for avoiding or controlling SCC. Since stress corrosion cracks are brittle by their nature and often occur at stresses well below yield, linear elastic {{fracture mechanics}} (LEFM) is normally used to study SCC. In certain cases however, the conditions are such that the LEFM approach appears not appropriate and elastic-plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) methods are used instead. Besides the J integral approach, parameters which {{are linked to the}} crack geometry like the crack tip opening angle (CTOA) and the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) are used. The latter appears as a good representative of the crack tip strain rate which would be ideal parameter for correlating environmental crack extension, since it controls the kinetics of the <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking</b> processes at the crack tip.

Time-to-failure experiments were performed on smooth bar tensile specimens in a hot, concentrated, mixed-salt solution chosen to simulate concentrated Yucca Mountain water. Smooth tensile specimens were individually loaded by the internal pressure of a 55 -liter autoclave, where the applied stress varied with the individual specimen gauge cross section. The effects of material, applied stress, welding, surface finish, shot peening, cold work, crevicing, and aging treatment were investigated for Alloy 22, Titanium Grade 7, and 316 NG stainless steel. Testing of multiple specimens allowed statistical differences among material conditions to be determined. Sensitized 304 SS specimens were included in the test matrix to provide benchmark data.

40|$|The {{influence}} of thermomechanical treatment on the {{stress corrosion cracking}} behavior of AA 7075 aluminum alloy forgings was examined in 3. 5 % NaCl solution by varying the extent of thermomechanical working imparted {{to each of the}} conditions. The results show that inadequate working during billet processing resulted in inferior corrosion and mechanical properties. However, more working with intermediate pre-heating stages also led to precipitation of coarse particles resulting in lowering of mechanical properties marginally and a significant reduction in the general/pitting corrosion resistance. The results obtained in the present study indicate that optimum working with controlled pre-heating levels is needed during forging to achieve the desired properties. It is also demonstrated that AA 7075 in the over aged condition does not show any <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibility in spite of the microstructural variations in terms of size and volume fraction of the precipitates. However, the above microstructural variations definitely affected the pitting corrosion and mechanical properties significantly and hence a strict control over the working and pre-heating stages during billet processing is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Radiation-induced {{segregation}} (RIS) is {{the spatial}} redistribution of elements at defect sinks such as grain boundaries and free surfaces during irradiation. This phenomenon {{has been studied}} {{in a wide variety}} of alloys and has been linked to irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) of nuclear reactor core components. Therefore, accurate determination of the grain boundary composition is important in understanding its effects on <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking.</b> Radiation-induced segregation profiles are routinely measured by scanning-transmission electron microscopy using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Because of the narrow width of the segregation profile (typically less than 10 -nm full width at half-maximum), the accuracy of grain boundary concentration measurements using STEM/EDS depends on the characteristics of the analyzing instrument, specifically, the excited volume in which x-rays are generated. This excited volume is determined by both electron beam diameter and the primary electron beam energy. Increasing the primary beam energy in STEM/EDS produces greater measured grain boundary segregation, as the reduced electron beam broadening a smaller excited volume. In this work, the effect of beam broadening is assessed on segregation measurements in a 304 L stainless steel sample irradiated with 3. 2 MeV protons at 400 C to doses of 3. 0 and 0. 1 dpa. The STEM/EDS measurements are also compared to measurements made using AES...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} acceptance of DCB test pieces for fracture toughness determinations, many investigators are now interested in modifying the basic design {{to suit their}} own requirements. The arms are no longer parallel but contoured or for simplicity of manufacture, tapered so that a constant crack extension force R or stress intensity factor K is available under constant applied loads for a certain range of crack length. This particular design is very often employed in studies of <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking</b> and of standard fracture toughness testing of materials. However, experiments have shown that if not properly designed, the test piece may fail catastrophically under either monotonic increasing load or displacement. Further, the crack length over which K or R is invariant may be too short for experimental use-fulness; and added to this, the crack may veer out of the arms during propagation. Since relatively little {{work has been done}} on cracking stabil ity in these tapered DCB specimens, we have, in the present note, attempted to illustrate some of the results we have found for this par-ticular problem. Consider a tapered DCB specimen of constant thickness t, with equal and opposite forces X applied at a distance e from the apex. (See inset in Figure i.) A crack of length 0 < a < W was considered to spread from the apex and along the center line.

40|$|The stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) behavior of AA 2219 aluminum alloy in the as-welded (AW) and repair-welded (RW) conditions was examined and {{compared with that of}} the base metal (BM) in 3. 5 wt pct NaCl solution using the slow strain rate technique (SSRT). The reduction in ductility was used as a parameter to evaluate the SCC susceptibility of both BM and welded joints. The results show that the ductility ratio (epsilon (NaCl) /(epsilon (air))) of the BM was close to one (0. 97) and reduced to 0. 9 for the AW joint. This value further reduced to 0. 77 after carrying out one repair welding operation. However, the RW specimen exhibited higher ductility than the single-weld specimens even in 3. 5 wt pct NaCl solution. SSRT results obtained using pre-exposed samples followed by post-test metallographic observations clearly showed localized pitting corrosion along the partially melted zone (PMZ), signifying that the reduction in ductility ratio of both the AW and RW joints was more due to mechanical overload failure, caused by the localized corrosion and a consequent reduction in specimen thickness, than due to SCC. Also, the RW joint exhibited higher ductility than the AW joint both in air and the environment, although SCC index (SI) for the former is lower than that of the latter. Fractographic examination of the failed samples, in general, revealed a typical ductile cracking morphology for all the base and welded joints, indicating the good <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking</b> resistance of this alloy. Microstructural examination and polarization tests further demonstrate grain boundary melting along the PMZ, and that provided the necessary electrochemical condition for the preferential cracking on that zone of the weldment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the residual stress and its effects on thermoplastic bonding to metals. Thermoplastic adhesives have the potential to become important in bonding various materials. Residual stresses can occur in a thermoplastic bonded system due to the deferential material properties between adherend and adhesive such as thermal expansion and viscoelastic property. ^ In bonding a thermoplastic to metal, residual stresses in the thermoplastic adhesive are generated during cooling down the thermoplastic-metal joint. An initial slow cooling (∼ 4. 5 °C/minute) to ∼ 210 °C followed by a fast cooling (∼ 30 °C/second) of PEEK, a semi-crystalline polymer, resulted in a ∼ 52 % increase in residual stress compared to a cycle with only fast cooling. For PEI, an amorphous polymer, fast cooling during glass transition produced ∼ 15 % higher residual stress than slow cooling. A mechanics based curvature model, combined with the elasticity and viscoelasticity of thermoplastics, predicted the residual stress development. ^ The residual stresses were further studied with a thermoplastic-metal cylindrical configuration. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was injection-molded around a metal rod and a joint assembly was created during the cooling. The in-process residual stresses were visualized using plane polariscope. Slitting and strain gage techniques were used along with a FEM model to measure and interpret the circumferential residual stress at ∼ 5 MPa in the PMMA ring. Two methods, water soaking and slitting, reduced the residual stresses. ^ Environmental stress cracking of the thermoplastic adhesive was revealed in this study. Combination of experimental observation and a FEM model demonstrated that the surface roughness of the adherend can induce stress concentration at the interface. The stress concentration was shown to be a significant cause of the adhesive <b>environmental</b> <b>cracking.</b> ^ For two new thermoplastic and thermosetting adhesives, Bemis 6343 and FM 300 - 2, preliminary fracture studies were carried out. As the loading speed of the Bemis 6343 DCB increased from 2. 5 mm/minute to 381. 0 mm/minute, the fracture toughness increased from ∼ 2000 J/m 2 to ∼ 4000 J/m 2.
