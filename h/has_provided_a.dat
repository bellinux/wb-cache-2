5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when {{and where it is}} needed. According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only in the direction of travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 1967 {{when the}} formal new town {{designation}} order was made, the , {{area to be}} developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages.

5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft.

5|$|Between 1972 and 1975, {{what is now}} the B {{store in}} Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire Cricket Club's Old Trafford ground, next door, <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> concert venue for bands such as Oasis, Foo Fighters, The Cure, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys and Take That.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{probably}} {{arrived in}} Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority {{emerged in the}} 8th century. The Buckquoy spindle-whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Oghaminscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now {{generally considered to be}} of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times. The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse era <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> variety of written records, the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.|$|E

The chain {{has supported}} charities and causes in communities where its restaurants are located, including the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Nashville after severe flooding in 2010. In the same year, Cracker Barrel established Cracker Barrel Cares Inc., an employee-funded non-profit organization that provides support to Cracker Barrel employees. Cracker Barrel has also formed a partnership with the Wounded Warrior Project, a charity for injured veterans. In attempts to rebuild its image after several race-related controversies, the firm <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> scholarship through the National Black MBA Association, and job skills programs and sponsorships with 100 Black Men of America and the Restaurant and Lodging Association.|$|E

5|$|Jaffna's {{history of}} being an {{independent}} kingdom lends legitimacy to the political claims of the Sri Lankan Tamils, and <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> focus for their constitutional demands. Northern Tamil society is generally categorised into two groups: those who are from the Jaffna peninsula in the north, {{and those who are}} residents of the Vanni to the immediate south. The Jaffna society is separated by castes. Historically, the Vellalar, who form approximately fifty percent of the population, were involved in agriculture, using the services of castes collectively known as Panchamar (Tamil for group of five). The Panchamar consisted of the Nalavar, Pallar, Parayar, Vannar, and Ambattar. Others such as the Karaiyar, existed outside the agriculture-based caste system. The caste of temple priests known as Iyers were also held in high esteem.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar {{was added to}} the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use of asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E
5|$|Warfare was {{prevalent}} in the Maya world. Military campaigns were launched {{for a variety of}} reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state. Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training. Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions. Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took. In the 8th–9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén. The rapid abandonment of Aguateca by its inhabitants <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry in situ. Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace. The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, and never returned to collect their abandoned property. The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after. This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it. Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite.|$|E
