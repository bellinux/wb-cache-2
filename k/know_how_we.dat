500|$|In addition, Kant {{claims that}} the concept of God is not of one a {{particular}} sense; rather, it is an [...] "object of pure thought". He asserts that God exists outside the realm of experience and nature. Because we cannot experience God through experience, Kant argues {{that it is impossible to}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> would verify God's existence. This is in contrast to material concepts, which can be verified by means of the senses.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
500|$|Conran and Avnet {{were able}} to cut costs {{considerably}} by shooting the entire movie in 26 days (not the usual {{three to four months}} that this kind of movie normally takes) on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 and working entirely on three different blue screen soundstages in London, England with one notable exception. Conran wrote a scene that was added later in which Polly talks to her editor in his office that was shot on a physical set because {{there was no time to}} shoot it on a blue screen soundstage. The footage from the HD camera was run through a switcher and then through a Macintosh computer running Final Cut Pro that allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. Conran said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> would have made this movie. It's really what allowed us to line up everything, given there was nothing there." [...] After each day of shooting, footage was edited and sent overnight to editors in L.A. who added CG and sent it back.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2005; the crew filmed for ten {{hours a day}} for thirty-one days. The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' child labor laws, which necessitated {{spending}} at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch. Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, [...] "I honestly don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> figured it out, but we did". To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer David Mullen, the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes. This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day. Most of the filming took place in South Los Angeles, which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget. Scenes were also filmed at the University of Southern California, Hollywood Palladium—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and Venice High School.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Selena's third studio album Entre a Mi Mundo and the launch of a {{clothing}} boutique in 1993, the singer and her band began working on Amor Prohibido. Having achieved the success and the fan base that EMI Latin's president Jose Behar was seeking, {{he wanted to take}} advantage of [...] "newly discovered markets". The singer's brother, A.B. Quintanilla, felt it was important that the music he produced for Selena remain [...] "fresh". EMI Latin had insisted on a Grammy Award-winning producer to work with Selena on the album. A.B. later told BuzzFeed how he had to [...] "outdo" [...] himself to remain her principal record producer. Owing to Entre a Mi Mundos commercial success, and its career-launching single [...] "Como la Flor", A.B. found it [...] "difficult" [...] to produce another successful recording. In a 2002 interview he said that writing [...] "a part two" [...] to [...] "Como la Flor" [...] was infeasible so he enlisted Selena y Los Dinos band members Pete Astudillo and Ricky Vela to help with the album's writing process. The result was a [...] "more mature sound [...] " [...] that included experimental recording and production. It was the final album with any production and songwriting assistance by Astudillo, as he parted with Los Dinos to pursue a solo career. The entire production of Amor Prohibido lasted six months beginning on September 17, 1993. It took two weeks for the band to complete its post-production before the album was given a street date of March 13, 1994. Vela noticed the band was becoming stagnant and had to rush the production because of an approaching deadline. Selena's husband and guitarist Chris Pérez, wrote that the constant touring demands and the opening of the boutiques depleted time spent creating Amor Prohibido, saying [...] "I don't even <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> managed to find time to make the next album." [...] Vela {{said in an interview that}} it was common for the band to arrange the sequencing of the entire project in their homes before going into the studio to record the songs.|$|E

Also they call their river, which we spell Paraguay, and pronounce I don't <b>know</b> <b>how,</b> Pä-rä-wä-eé.|$|R
5000|$|Cuomo {{described}} {{his relationship with}} Sinclair as [...] "constantly pulling each other in these different directions", the former wishing to [...] "evolve and try crazy experiments", while the latter served as [...] "the voice of the fans, very conservative"; Cuomo concluded that Sinclair had largely [...] "won". Sinclair would often even interrupt Cuomo {{in the midst of}} a vocal take if Cuomo lost his Long Island accent, featured heavily on the Blue Album. Rhythm guitarist Brian Bell stated that [...] "Sinclair <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> should sound more than <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> should sound". Following the composition of each song, Sinclair would take the individual band member and work privately with them on their individual's instrument arrangement. Cuomo stated that this would allow for more [...] "fresh and layered" [...] ideas.|$|R

'This small group successfully outgunned the microphones and managed to give some journalists this totally erroneous impression that that was how the student body felt about Carter,' he said."

We want to say that we have nothing bad in our heart against anyone."

You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee.

2500|$|However, {{not all of}} Lopez's {{collaborators}} were new. She {{reunited with}} longtime collaborator, Rodney Jerkins (Darkchild) {{who has worked with}} Lopez numerous times in the past. Darkchild produced [...] "This Cannot Be Love", although the song did not make the final track listing for Love? It has similar introductory chords to [...] "The Boy Is Mine" [...] (1998) by Brandy Norwood and Monica. [...] "This Cannot Be Love" [...] has a progressive uptempo melody which continues to gather pace {{over the course of the}} song, while in the lyrics Lopez [...] "asks if true love exists." [...] When asked what inspired some of the album's records, Lopez told The Advocate, that whenever she records a new album she always thinks of dance music as it is popular in the gay community and club cultures. She said songs like [...] "This Cannot Be Love"have musicality similar to her worldwide hit, [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999), which was well received by the LGBT community.

2500|$|Ice Cube {{released}} his third album, The Predator, in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's Los Angeles riots, {{in the first}} single, [...] "Wicked", he rapped [...] "April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel". The Predator debuted at number one on both the pop and R charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from The Predator included [...] "It Was a Good Day" [...] and [...] "Check Yo Self", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after The Predator, Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album Lethal Injection, which was released {{at the end of}} 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the G-Funk sound of Dr. Dre's The Chronic, was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from Lethal Injection, including [...] "Really Doe", [...] "Bop Gun (One Nation)", [...] "You <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> <b>We</b> Do It" [...] & [...] "What Can I Do?". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, Kausion, and Da Lench Mob.|$|E
