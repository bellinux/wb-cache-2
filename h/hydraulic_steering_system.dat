40|$|This paper {{shows the}} energy saving power {{steering}} system, which was named as KEEPS (Kayaba Electronic Controlled Energy Saving Power Steering). In a conventional {{hydraulic power steering}} system, the hydraulic pump always supplies enough quantity of oil to the hydraulic circuit. This extra oil flow increases driving torque of the pump, thus the hydraulic power steering system wastes energy. On the other hand, KEEPS can control oil flow electrically {{in accordance with the}} condition of a vehicle. In the measurement test for energy consumption of the power steering system with the actual vehicle on test courses, KEEPS got 48 % less at city mode, 41 % less at highway mode and 39 % less at country mode compared with the conventional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{antivibration}} controller design problem for electrical power steering (EPS) systems. The EPS system has significant advantages over the traditional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system.</b> However, the improper motor controller design {{would lead to the}} steering wheel vibration. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the antivibration control strategy. For the implementation study, we also present the motor driver design and the software design which is used to monitor the sensors and the control signal. Based on the investigation on the regular assistant algorithm, we summarize the difficulties and problems encountered by the regular algorithm. After that, in order to improve the performance of antivibration and the human-like steering feeling, we propose a new assistant strategy for the EPS. The experiment results of the bench test illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed control strategy. Compared with the regular controller, the proposed antivibration control reduces the vibration of the steering wheel a lot. © 2014 Zhaojian Wang and Hamid Reza Karimi...|$|E

The task of a SbW system is twofold: turning the road wheels tracking the handwheel rotation and providing the driver with a feeling of the steering effort. In this paper, the issue of designing a SbW system is faced. An approach is proposed, based on three steps. Firstly, the model of a conventional <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> is formulated. Then the SbW system is developed with the same structure as the conventional ones. Finally, performance indexes for the steering maneuver are defined and utilized to set up the parameters of the SbW system.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the steering system implemented on the tractor IceMaker I. No direct position feedback {{is used for the}} steering angle of the front wheels. Instead, the steering angle is estimated by a motion model of the vehicle using gyro and odometer information. This estimated angle is used as feedback to a regulator that controls the steering system. The operator sets the requested steering angle and the regulator controls the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system</b> to maintain the requested steering angle. Within certain limits, the tractor can be expected to behave according to the motion model irrespective of the surface conditions. The tractor can be teleoperated from a remote computer through a wireless network, WLAN. To enable teleoperation, the tractor has been equipped with a computer, some sensors, and other necessary equipment. During teleoperation, the operator controls the steering angle of the front wheels and the speed of the tractor using a joystick. The steering system has been tested both during winter conditions on a low friction surface and also on dry asphalt. The results indicates good performance when teleoperating the tractor. When driving carefully it is possible to operate the tractor up to full speed (25 km/h). However, the steering regulator tends to exaggerate the real steering angle during sharp turns when driving on very slippery surface.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the assumptions made and solutions {{used in a}} newly designed low-bed semi-trailer for the transportation of heavy and oversized loads, especially heavy self-propelled road machinery. During the design phase, special {{attention was paid to}} the versatility of the semi-trailer. The semi-trailer consists of 4 main modules: a hydraulic removable gooseneck allowing for coupling the semi-trailer to a tractor unit, an extendable low bed, a 2 -axle bogie and a 3 -axle bogie. The modules can be combined in different ways to create different configurations of the semi-trailer. Owing to that, the carrying capacity of the semi-trailer can be easily matched to the equipment carried. Depending on the current needs, the semi-trailer can have 2, 3 or 5 axles, a payload from 28 to 65 tons, and a length from 13. 2 to 20. 1 m. Wheeled and caterpillar vehicles can drive onto the lowbed from the front, after the gooseneck has been detached. The length and width of the bed can be adjusted within the range of 2 and 0. 6 m, respectively. An important advantage of this semi-trailer is the fact that in a 2 -axle configuration it meets the regulations for standard trailers and can be driven in public roads and carry normal loads without a special permission. Thanks to the fact that all its wheels are steered and controlled by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> the semi-trailer has very good manoeuvrability despite its long length. The semi-trailer meets rigorous safety demands – it is equipped with...|$|E

5000|$|Power <b>steering.</b> Older <b>{{hydraulic}}</b> power <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> are {{powered by}} a hydraulic pump constantly engaged to the engine. Power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a hydraulic pump reduces fuel efficiency.

50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> work {{by using}} a {{hydraulic}} system to multiply force applied to the steering wheel inputs to the vehicle's steered (usually front) road wheels. The hydraulic pressure typically comes from a gerotor or rotary vane pump driven by the vehicle's engine. A double-acting hydraulic cylinder applies a force to the steering gear, which in turn steers the roadwheels. The steering wheel operates valves to control flow to the cylinder. The more torque the driver applies to {{the steering wheel and}} column, the more fluid the valves allow through to the cylinder, and so the more force is applied to steer the wheels.|$|R
50|$|A {{mechanical}} linkage between {{the steering wheel}} and the steering gear is retained in EPAS. In the event of component failure or power failure that causes a failure to provide assistance, the {{mechanical linkage}} serves as a back-up. If EPAS fails, the driver encounters a situation where heavy effort is required to steer. This heavy effort {{is similar to that of}} an inoperative <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> assist <b>system.</b> Depending on the driving situation, driving skill and strength of the driver, steering assist loss may or may not lead to a crash. The difficulty of steering with inoperative power steering is compounded by the choice of steering ratios in assisted steering gears vs. fully manual. The NHTSA has assisted car manufacturers with recalling EPAS systems prone to failure.|$|R

40|$|The EPS (electric power <b>steering)</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} used to replace the {{conventional}} HPS (<b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering)</b> <b>system</b> in vehicles. This <b>system</b> assists the <b>steering</b> effort of the driver using an electric motor and a gear force reduction.

Therefore, this paper proposes an advanced control strategy for EPS that uses the lateral force of the front wheels. In addition, we experimented with this proposed control algorithm using a simulation and confirmed that it reduced the assist torque and saved motor power. Although it is difficult to obtain the lateral wheel force of the tires for the proposed method, it is able to reduce the torque ripple of the EPS actuator, as well as troublesome problems with steering wheel vibration. Moreover, this EPS control strategy can improve a vehicle&# 39;s dynamic stability...|$|R
