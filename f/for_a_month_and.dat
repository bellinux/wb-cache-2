5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E

5|$|After the Olympics, Simpson trained {{throughout}} his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode {{in the national}} 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October before taking a short break from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks' racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at Herne Hill Velodrome. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the Royal Air Force (RAF) revealed Simpson to be colour blind.|$|E
5|$|In August 1993, Dozzell {{was sold}} to Tottenham Hotspur for £1.9 million; in his first season, he made 32 {{appearances}} and scored eight goals. Dozzell suffered numerous injuries during his time at White Hart Lane, restricting the number of games in which he played. In the 1994–95 season, he managed just seven appearances and failed to score. He made a total of 99 league and cup appearances and scored 14 goals over his four seasons at the club. Dozzell made a brief return to Portman Road in 1997, on loan <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> made ten appearances before signing for Northampton Town in 1997. A season with The Cobblers saw him score four goals from 26 appearances and help the club to the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. This {{was followed by a}} move to newly promoted Colchester United, initially on a monthly contract, where Dozzell made more than 100 appearances and scored 11 goals in three seasons.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, Boulding {{returned}} to League Two side Mansfield Town, and after impressing manager Peter Shirtliff in pre-season training, {{he was offered}} a contract. His younger brother Rory Boulding also joined Mansfield at the same time. His first game back at Mansfield was on {{the opening day of}} the 2006–07 season in a 2–2 draw with Shrewsbury Town, before he scored in the following game as Mansfield defeated Milton Keynes Dons 2–1. At the end of September he was sidelined by a knee injury, which kept him out of the side <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> in January 2007 he was angry after he was dropped to the substitutes' bench in favour of fellow strikers Barry Conlon and Martin Gritton for a game against Hereford United. Mansfield won the game 3–1 with Boulding coming on to score one of the goals. He finished the season with just six goals from 45games, as Mansfield finished in 17thposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{spent their}} {{first month of}} service drilling in Washington D.C. During this time they were barracked in the U.S. Treasury Building. On May 25, they marched to Alexandria, Virginia where they set up camp and remained <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> a half. During this time, President Lincoln and his cabinet reviewed the regiment and dubbed them the “Steady Fifth” due to their performance during the review. While encamped in Alexandria, the unit received new uniforms consisting of dark blue coats and trousers—the Regular Army uniform of the time. The 5th Massachusetts was one of very few volunteer units to take the field in Regular Army uniforms and were frequently mistaken for Regular troops during the Bull Run campaign. On July 13, the 5th Massachusetts received orders to march for Centreville, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Following Taboo Tuesday, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put}} in charge of Raw, after Eric Bischoff took the night off, {{following}} his match the night before. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch against Randy Orton, as he lost a steel cage match to Orton the previous night. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at the November pay-per-view Survivor Series. Orton did not receive the opportunity, as he lost to Flair. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match involving Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Maven and Chris Benoit) facing off against Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge and Gene Snitsky) at Survivor Series. The winning team would be granted absolute control of running the show <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> the winning members would all get a week {{to be in charge of}} the program. At the November event, Team Orton defeated Team Triple H and the team were given the opportunity to be in charge of Raw for a week.|$|E
5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then tried to walk out on the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while they searched for a new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving coach Steve Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the top table, however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held the unwanted distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E

5|$|The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics {{season began}} with Christopher {{the subject of}} a {{possible}} trade. The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees, but they wanted Christopher in return. Mack refused to give him up, and as a result the trade never materialized. He began the season in the starting rotation, and was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5–0 loss against the Yankees. Over {{the first part of the}} season, Christopher again split time between the rotation and the bullpen. In a 7–3 loss to the Indians on July 18, Christopher could not get out of the second inning, allowing five earned runs. After this, he did not pitch <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever. He finished the season with five wins, seven losses and a 4.30 ERA. After the season ended, Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball. He had lost 10 pounds in the final months of the season and was light to begin with, and decided that he would retire if he could not gain the weight back over the winter.|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>and</b> the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E
