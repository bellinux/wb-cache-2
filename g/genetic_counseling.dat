5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek <b>genetic</b> <b>counseling</b> before deciding to have children. As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E

By addressing genetic {{health care needs}} and specific differences of developing countries, these disparities may be mitigated. We sought to describe the attitudes and knowledge of subjects with hereditary neurological diseases in Mali before and after receiving <b>genetic</b> testing and <b>counseling</b> for the first time. A questionnaire of attitudes and knowledge items was adapted and piloted for use in Mali. We found {{that the majority of}} subjects had positive attitudes toward <b>genetic</b> testing and <b>counseling,</b> both before and afterwards. Subjects responded to approximately half of the knowledge questions regarding hereditary transmission correctly before and after <b>genetic</b> testing and <b>counseling.</b> Neither overall attitudes nor knowledge scores changed significantly from baseline. Concerns about confidentiality were expressed by the majority of subjects.

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. <b>Genetic</b> <b>counseling</b> is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThere is no {{valid and}} {{reliable}} instrument to evaluate <b>genetic</b> education and <b>counseling</b> received by parents who have an infant with a positive newborn screen for cystic fibrosis (CF). MethodsThis study assessed the validity and reliability of a new instrument designed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of <b>genetic</b> education and <b>counseling</b> received by parents who have an infant with a positive newborn screen for cystic fibrosis (CF). A 16 -item CF genetic knowledge questionnaire (CFGKQ) was completed by 84 members of the general population (GP) and 441 genetic counselors in the United States. Participants also rated the importance of genetic content. ResultsSignificant group differences were found in mean percentages of correct responses (p< 0. 05). High consistency was found between initial and follow-up questionnaire administrations. Cronbach's alpha scores= 0. 82 – 0. 85 initially and 0. 77 – 0. 81 at follow-up administrations. Two items lacking empirical support were removed. In comparison to genetic counselors, GP respondents placed greater importance on recurrence risks and implications of a CF diagnosis for family members than the newborn screening process or autosomal recessive mechanisms. ConclusionsThe 14 -item CFGKQ appears to have promising validity and reliability for use within the United States. This instrument may be a useful tool in the development of evidence-based <b>genetic</b> education and <b>counseling</b> programs. Additional research is needed to validate this instrument for use with other populations...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, we {{detected}} mutations of LDLR, APOB and PCSK 9 in 11 Chinese FH families, {{among which}} ten {{were found to}} be deleterious mutations.

More patients were not available for statistical analyses, and no percentage of Chinese FH patients with positive genetic diagnosis could be revealed in this study. However, the present identification of three novel mutations and other mutations not only further supports the significant role of LDLR in FH, but also expands the spectrum of LDLR mutations.
