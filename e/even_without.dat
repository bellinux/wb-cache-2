5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, <b>even</b> <b>without</b> access to optical equipment, {{it is still}} possible for the amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E
5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. <b>Even</b> <b>without</b> the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having a slightly different profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E

5|$|After such {{training}} is completed, or <b>even</b> <b>without</b> any EMS training, working in or visiting other nations {{is one way}} physicians can participate in international emergency medicine. Some physicians choose to pursue their careers overseas, while others opt for shorter trips. For example, a team of U.S. physicians spent seven months helping establish a new emergency department and emergency residency program in Hangzhou, China.|$|E
5|$|Claims of {{intermediate}} mass {{black holes}} {{have been met}} with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to mass segregation. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards {{the center of the}} cluster, <b>even</b> <b>without</b> a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.|$|E
5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally <b>even</b> <b>without</b> playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E

5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>without</b> {{managerial}} manipulation, quotas {{were very}} often low {{and easy to}} overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers {{would be able to}} fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive optics imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, <b>even</b> <b>without</b> a spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{graduates}} of state-run Shinto schools, such as Kokugakuin University and Kougakkan University, were implicitly allowed to become public school teachers. A {{greater number of}} better-trained priests with educations at state-supported schools, combined with a rising patriotic fervor, is believed by some to have seeded {{an environment in which}} grassroots Emperor worship was possible, <b>even</b> <b>without</b> financial support for local shrines.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{was built}} {{to the east of}} the fourteenth-century town on a {{slightly}} raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's outer walls was about 2.8ha (7acres), but with outbuildings, other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total area has been estimated to be at least 8ha (20acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar, and <b>even</b> <b>without</b> their former polished facings the walls are about 3m (10ft) thick.|$|E

5|$|Wilkinson's Dazzle {{camouflage}} {{was accepted}} by the Admiralty, <b>even</b> <b>without</b> practical visual assessment protocols for improving performance by modifying designs and colours.

5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. <b>Even</b> <b>without</b> the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply <b>even</b> <b>without</b> silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters <b>even</b> <b>without</b> fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E

5|$|Explosive eruptions {{occur when}} magma decompresses as it rises, {{allowing}} dissolved volatiles (dominantly water and carbon dioxide) to exsolve into gas bubbles. As more bubbles nucleate a foam is produced, which decreases {{the density of}} the magma, accelerating it up the conduit. Fragmentation occurs when bubbles occupy ~70-80 vol% of the erupting mixture. When fragmentation occurs, violently expanding bubbles tear the magma apart into fragments which are ejected into the atmosphere where they solidify into ash particles. Fragmentation is a very efficient process of ash formation and is capable of generating very fine ash <b>even</b> <b>without</b> the addition of water.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the Kosovar Albanian {{population}} {{was able to}} use the Albanian flag as its national flag. However, the flag had to be charged with a red star, since this was a common symbol of the Yugoslav nation. <b>Even</b> <b>without</b> this requirement, the flag of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania at the time had a red star, outlined in gold, above the double headed eagle. Later on, different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation.|$|E
5|$|In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006), an {{unrelated}} case {{brought about by}} the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that <b>even</b> <b>without</b> the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.|$|E
