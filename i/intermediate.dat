It deals with issues concerning legal relations which {{stem from the}} circulation of <b>intermediated</b> securities. The first part maps voluntary and involuntary dispositions with <b>intermediated</b> securities. In the framework of voluntary dispositions it describes rules concerning transfers of <b>intermediated</b> securities - both stock market and over-the-counter (OTC) - as well as collateral arrangements comprising <b>intermediated</b> securities. The second part concentrates on the aspects of private international law of dispositions with <b>intermediated</b> securities, and in particular on difficulties with localisation of <b>intermediated</b> securities and accounts where they are recorded. The third part examines public policy aspects of <b>intermediated</b> holdings. It asks whether the theory of incorporation of the right in a certificate applying to directly held certificated equity securities - which allows their holder to hide their identity - contributes to negative social effects, like corruption, tax evasion, conflict of interest or money-laundering. The first two parts are based on an identical [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Detection of <b>intermediates</b> is {{the general}} way to {{investigate}} a reaction mechanism, because the <b>intermediates</b> connect the reactants and the products, the <b>intermediates</b> can reflect some internal relationships between the reactants and the products. By studying the the structures of <b>intermediates,</b> the reaction process and reaction mechanism can thus be understood. Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) is an effective material as halogen-free flame retardants, it has six crystalline forms. In preparation of APP, the factor of temperature raising rate is investigated, some <b>intermediates</b> are detected, the XRD spectra of these <b>intermediates</b> are discussed. The results are informative for controllable preparation of APP in industrial production...|$|R

In the case of chymotrypsin, this <b>intermediate</b> is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme <b>intermediate.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo explore early <b>intermediates</b> in {{membrane}} fusion {{mediated by}} influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and {{their dependence on}} {{the composition of the}} target membrane, we studied lipid mixing between HA-expressing cells and liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) with different hydrocarbon chains. For all tested compositions, our results indicate the existence of at least two types of <b>intermediates,</b> which differ in their lifetimes. The composition of the target membrane affects the stability of fusion <b>intermediates</b> at a stage before lipid mixing. For less fusogenic distearoyl PC-containing liposomes at 4 °C, some of the <b>intermediates</b> inactivate, and no <b>intermediates</b> advance to lipid mixing. Fusion <b>intermediates</b> that formed for the more fusogenic dioleoyl PC-containing liposomes did not inactivate and even yielded partial lipid mixing at 4 °C. Thus, a more fusogenic target membrane effectively blocks nonproductive release of the conformational energy of HA. Even for the same liposome composition, HA forms two types of fusion <b>intermediates,</b> dissimilar in their stability and propensity to fuse. This diversity of fusion <b>intermediates</b> emphasizes the importance of local membrane composition and local protein concentration in fusion of heterogeneous biological membranes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the role of recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallins in the heat-induced inactivation and aggregation of citrate synthase. Homo-multimers of both αA- and αB-crystallins confer protection against heat-induced inactivation in a concentration-dependent manner and also prevent aggregation. Interaction of crystallins with early unfolding <b>intermediates</b> of citrate synthase reduces their partitioning into aggregation-prone <b>intermediates.</b> This appears to result in enhanced population of early unfolding <b>intermediates</b> that can be reactivated by its substrate, oxaloacetate. Both these homo-multimers do not form a stable complex with the early unfolding <b>intermediates.</b> However, they can form a soluble, stable complex with aggregation-prone late unfolding <b>intermediates.</b> This soluble complex formation prevents aggregation. Thus, {{it appears that the}} chaperone activity of α-crystallin involves both transient and stable interactions depending on the nature of <b>intermediates</b> on the unfolding pathway; one leads to reactivation of the enzyme activity while the other prevents aggregation...|$|R
