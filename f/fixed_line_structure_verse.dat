50|$|If σ is a collineation of a {{projective}} plane, a point P with P = Pσ {{is called}} a fixed point of σ, and a line m with m = mσ {{is called a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> of σ. The points on a <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> need not be fixed points, their images under σ are just constrained to lie on this line. The collection of fixed points and <b>fixed</b> <b>lines</b> of a collineation form a closed configuration, which is a system of points and lines that satisfy the first two but not necessarily the third condition {{in the definition of}} a projective plane. Thus, the fixed point and <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> for any collineation either form a projective plane by themselves, or a degenerate plane. Collineations whose fixed structure forms a plane are called planar collineations.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the market {{potential}} for internet services interacted historically with the diffusion process of <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> and mobile telephony. Design/methodology/approach – The authors evaluate the historical interactions between internet, <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> and mobile telephony using the International Telecommunications Union data set from 1991 until 2003 for 214 countries. Findings – It was found that between 1991 and 2003 mobile and internet services were fully complementary; <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> facilitated the diffusion of internet service, but internet diffusion did not affect <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> telephony. The authors discuss the implications of these results in the light of current developments of the telecommunications industry. Research limitations/implications – Internet adoption should be analysed in close relation to the adoption of other telecommunication services, such as <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> and mobile telephony. Originality/value – The paper shows the interconnectivity of the internet with other telecommunication services and emphasizes the asymmetric nature of these interactions. Telecommunication services interactions are discussed in the light of recent industry developments...|$|R

50|$|In earlier days teledensity was {{computed}} {{as the number}} of <b>fixed</b> telephone <b>lines</b> per hundred inhabitants. But this method has become less significant with an increasing number of countries register a trend of mobile cellular subscribers outnumbering the <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> connections. Hence, as an alternative, mobidensity or mobile cellular subscribers per hundred inhabitants was proposed. Since this method caused disadvantage to some countries where the <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> network is well established, or others where the mobile network is still in its initial stage of development, effective teledensity has been proposed by ITU as the sloution, which is defined as either <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> connections or mobile subscribers per hundred inhabitants - whichever is higher.|$|R
40|$|The {{internet}} {{has become an}} extremely important modern day technology for business and {{made a lot of}} activities very easy. It is used for almost all purposes, even with important issues such as in education and government organizations. In view of these benefits, various technologies have been developed to connect users to the internet. Some of these technologies include dial up, ISDN, DSL, satellite and mobile broadband. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find the causes of low patronage of <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access (DSL using landline) among households in Ghana. The paper employs qualitative research design whilst the survey method (both interview and questionnaire) was applied as the data collection methodology. The main findings were that most educated people in Ghana are computer and internet literates and perceive the internet as important. It was also found that many people are of the view that <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access is expensive and slow. More importantly, most people are ignorant about <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access and do not know the advantages that <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access has over its competitors. Finally, it was discovered that <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband connection is absent in most communities and where it exists, most people complain of lack of money to subscribe to the service. Based on the findings, the paper concludes that low patronage of <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access i...|$|R
