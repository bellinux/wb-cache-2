40|$|The {{development}} of coherent optical networks and processing are catalysing increasing attention as solutions {{to accelerate the}} data transfer speed and data processing. Conventional technology in coherent optical networks can perform at the maximum speed of 100 Gb/s. Here we evaluate the effect of plasmonic finite response time on the coherent perfect absorption process for a plasmonic metamaterial absorber, to achieve 100 Tb/s. All-optical modulation means control of the phase or intensity of one light beam by another. In the coherent perfect absorption scenario, the interference of two counter-propagating coherent beams on a highly absorbing material of sub- wavelength thickness can either lead to nearly total transmission or to nearly total absorption of the incident light, depending on their mutual intensity and phase. We study the <b>coherent</b> <b>modulation</b> of the total energy {{as a function of}} the pulse duration, from few hundreds fs down to 6 fs. Our measurements allow us to assess the maximal bandwidth for all-optical control of femtosecond pulses, which is about 100 THz. All optical switching also eliminate the disadvantages of optical-electrical-optical conversion thus opening a road to advances in terabits per second communications for high-performance communications and computing. Our device based on coherent absorption has the advantage of being compact, intrinsically low power (as low as single photons), while demonstrating large modulations (modulation bandwidth ~ 7 : 1) and speed exceeding 100 THz has been observed.

40|$|Using semiclassical {{radiation}} theory, a formalism {{similar to}} that used by Lamb in his "Theory of an Optical Maser" is developed for studying the amplification of vector traveling waves in a laser-type medium. The effect of the medium on the waves is given in terms of space (or time) dependent field amplitudes and phases and a nonlinear index of refraction. With particular emphasis on typical gaseous media, the effects of Doppler broadening are treated in detail for arbitrary ratios of natural to Doppler linewidths. Polarization and propagation vectors in various directions are considered, and the nonlinear effects are found to make an isotropic medium effectively anisotropic. Lowest order nonlinear effects (due to a polarization cubic in the field amplitudes) are studied extensively, and the frequency dependence of several of these processes is presented in graphical form. In particular, the introduction of fields at new frequencies and polarization effects are considered. The characteristics of these nonlinear processes peculiar to Doppler broadened lines are discussed, and the processes are interpreted in terms of saturation and <b>coherent</b> <b>modulation</b> of the population inversion density. Strong nonlinear effects are considered in a more approximate way and are found to consist of saturation of the various linear and nonlinear processes previously considered. These strong nonlinear effects should occur at low enough intensities to be easily observed in practice on a CW basis. With the present formalism, the analytical results of Gordon, White and Rigden regarding gain saturation in laser amplifiers are obtained, and the extension is made to include frequencies away from line center and the effects of multiple spectral components.
