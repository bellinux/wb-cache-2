500|$|Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News {{rated the}} film 4 out of 5 stars; while she criticized the terrorists' lack of depth and weak points in Neerjas second half, she wrote that [...] "the {{climax of the}} film is {{powerful}} and makes up for that blip." [...] Jason Klein of Variety declared that DAR-Film Leaderboard was notably absent of Oscar-nominated films, but part of the gap was filled by Neerja. Sonali Kokra of The National praised the film: [...] "Neerja is a great story told well. Mitesh Mirchandani’s jerky camerawork <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of using the claustrophobic confines of the aircraft to showcase the oppressiveness of the situation and the terror of the hostages." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Chuck Versus the Intersect" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, with several praising the casting of the series, especially that of Zachary Levi. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode {{a rating of}} 9 out of 10, writing, [...] "Schwartz and Fedak's script for the Chuck pilot is very strong, deftly mixing action and humor. Where Schwartz's other new series, Gossip Girl, could use more of the humor he brought to The O.C., Chuck <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> capturing the wit and self-awareness Schwartz's previous series contained." [...] Varun Lella of AOL TV criticized the episode's opening as being [...] "a weak gag", though writing that [...] "the ensuing moments were hilarious enough to almost erase the poorly executed opening moments." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the pilot better than he expected, as well as [...] "energetic, cinematic, and quite funny." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- {{on a scale of}} A+ to F.|$|E
500|$|GameFan {{praised the}} [...] "super stylish" [...] full motion video. Allgame felt {{the game to}} be worth playing for the FMV alone, calling it the [...] "best aspect of the game" [...] and [...] "an awesome video {{presentation}} that, combined {{with a number of}} high quality voice-acting jobs, <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of conferring the intensity and danger of the nuclear dilemma at hand." [...] Game Revolution noted the strong production values of most of the FMV and while a minority had [...] "back yard" [...] production, they nevertheless used quality actors and [...] "fairly impressed" [...] the reviewer, though he criticised the [...] "MTV-like editing". Edge also noted the [...] "MTV-style presentation" [...] and called it [...] "stylish" [...] and atmospheric. Reviewing Nuclear Strike 64, Allgame praised the atmospheric music as [...] "reminiscent of a large budget political spy thriller". The reviewer said: [...] "what really cranks up the adrenaline and ramps up the immersion factor in the game is the great sound effects." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN gave [...] "Walkabout" [...] a 9.5/10, stating that [...] "Terry O'Quinn puts in an {{exceptional}} performance", and commenting that showing Locke, who [...] "seemed like a confident and resourceful {{man with a}} mysterious and intriguing past", to be a [...] "shell {{of a human being}} that is trying desperately to find his place in the world" [...] was [...] "a perfect juxtaposition of the differences between Locke off and on the island". He also praised the supporting stories, claiming that [...] "Matthew Fox <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of playing the uneasy leader" [...] as Jack Shephard and that the Shannon-Charlie storyline [...] "does supply a little comic relief". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it described the revelation that Locke was a paraplegic as being [...] "one of the show's signature moments", and commented that the episode [...] "cemented the show as 'Must-See TV'" [...] and was [...] "a five-star effort." ...|$|E
500|$|William Leith of the London Evening Standard was {{impressed}} with the biography, and noted that [...] "the thing about Madonna is not in her sensationalism, it’s in the fact that how much humane she appeared in the book. Taraborrelli does a fine job of capturing the world's most famous courtesan, in the most infamous way", and John Smyntek from Knight Ridder thought [...] "Taraborrelli [...] retelling all [...] and more. After all, in those 10 years, the Great Woman has had two children, wed and maintained her image as a major pain in the keister. He <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of bringing forth these unknown facts." [...] Ward Triplet of the Kansas City Star felt that although the book is [...] "an eerie, but compelling day by day account of Madonna, and how she became who she is, sometimes Taraborrelli feels like revealing more about his process of writing than his subject", and Ann O' Neil in the Los Angeles Times complimented the book for being [...] "different" [...] from the [...] "regular dirt written everyday about Madonna." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Have You Seen This Snail?" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called the episode deeply hilarious {{and described the}} plot as a [...] "bittersweet riot". He drew attention to how the story {{is similar to the}} plot of [...] "Dumped", an earlier episode in which Gary deserted SpongeBob. David Johnson of the DVD Verdict positively reacted to the DVD release of the episode and said [...] "I'm not sure what to say, here. Mr. Squarepants is so ridiculously popular, this disc will most definitely sell itself." [...] Aida Ekberg of Yahoo! Voices ranked Amy Poehler on her [...] "Top 10 SpongeBob SquarePants Guest Stars" [...] list and said [...] "I'm surprised more comedians haven't been guest stars on SpongeBob. Amy Poehler <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> with her creepy grandma voice, playing pure evil masked behind plate after plate of chocolate chip cookies." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk loved the scene [...] "When Gary realizes he has to escape from her crushing love (which equals constant overeating) or die like the other snail shells he finds" [...] He said [...] "it's both funny and rather touching." ...|$|E

[...] "In summary, on Fire was an {{acceptable}} episode of the hit supernatural show.

The direction was great too, allowing the audience see the varying sides of Enzo’s character. Ian <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> alongside Enzo.

500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Travis Fickett from IGN retroactively gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. Fickett wrote that [...] "Hot Girl" [...] helped to establish {{what type of}} character Michael would eventually become in the subsequent seasons, noting the character's [...] "deep and desperate loneliness" [...] which would eventually become a main conceit in the series. He concluded that the episode ended with a [...] "classic Office moment"—Michael realizing that Jim will be giving Katy a ride home—that [...] "captures the desperation and loneliness of [...] – and <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of {{setting the stage for}} the show's terrific second season." [...] Miss Alli from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B but described it as [...] "the weakest of the first season." [...] Alli noted that the episode was largely the [...] "play on the same joke," [...] featuring Michael and Dwight [...] "making idiots of themselves over Katy." [...] However, she did positively compare the American version of the show to the British version, stating, [...] "All things considered, I think the first season is very underrated owing to unnecessary comparisons to the British version," [...] but concluded that the episode was [...] "its weak moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Lewis of Allmusic felt {{it showed}} them [...] "as a talented young band, despite the flimsy songwriting {{and the lack}} of light and shade on the album". While Greg Lawrence at WHAMMO.com.au noted that it {{provides}} [...] "a mature, complete range – from the early-penned punk mayhem of 'Blame' to the delicacy of the 'Twilight=Dusk', from the dark tones of 'Jerks of Attention' to the bright strains of radio hit 'Leaving Home'. The album <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of capturing the amazing live dynamic of the band".|$|E

However, he stated, [...] "I really can't imagine them having TWO drummers on stage, so Jeff will be doing the drumming duties on his own (which he <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job),</b> although I would love to finish what I started with the Oliva's so long ago.

"Start All Over", a song co-written by Dobson and {{featuring}} her on background vocals, {{was recorded}} by Miley Cyrus for her album [...] (2007) {{and was released}} as a single, reaching number 57 on the Billboard Pop 100. During a 2009 interview Dobson said, [...] "I wrote a song, she dug it, and she sang it. But I didn't want it for my record.

2500|$|In {{his review}} for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "A {{peerless}} ensemble of actors fills Glengarry Glen Ross with audible glares and shudders. The play was zippy black comedy about predators in twilight; {{the film is}} a photo-essay, shot in morgue closeup, about the difficulty most people have convincing themselves that what they do matters". However, Desson Howe's review in The Washington Post criticized Foley's direction, writing that it [...] "doesn't add {{much more than the}} street between. If his intention is {{to create a sense of}} claustrophobia, he also creates the (presumably) unwanted effect of a soundstage. There is no evidence of life outside the immediate world of the movie". Movie Room Reviews gave the film 4 stars and said [...] "Director James Foley <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of making the film seem claustrophobic, so that the audience almost feels as if it is in the fluorescent lighting of the drab office." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown on April 10, {{at which time}} the {{controls}} were demonstrated. IGN were impressed; [...] "The pointing function works really well in Scarface. Just like the PC version's mouse control, players now have near pin-point weapon precision {{that makes it easier}} and more intuitive to gun down the opposition with the huge assortment of firepower within the experience. You can still target individuals to tighten up your aim using the Z button on the nunchuk, but because the Wii Remote's pointer already <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> with its precision it's rare that we found ourselves using it." [...] GameSpot were less impressed; [...] "When you're wielding the chainsaw, its movement will be tied to that of the Wii Remote, and by slashing in different directions and at different heights you'll be able to target enemies' heads, legs, and individual arms. With practice you'll purportedly be able to remove all of the aforementioned extremities before the torso hits the ground, but the associate producer showing us the game on this occasion never managed to pull it off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Overwatchs {{diversity}} also {{extends to}} other character facets. Blizzard {{has said that}} some of the characters have LGBT identities; Metzen said that the inclusion of LGBT characters was not [...] "to be a data point or feel contrived in any way", but instead to have these identities [...] "play out organically". Tracer was the first identified as one of the LGBT characters via one of the promotional online comics. Blizzard said on this reveal [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes our heroes who they are. From the very beginning of our work on Tracer's story, it just felt right to make this an aspect of her character." [...] Blizzard reiterated their goal to have a diverse cast with Tracer's reveal, stating, [...] "from the beginning, we've wanted the universe of Overwatch to feel welcoming and inclusive, and to reflect the diversity of our players around the world."

You can still understand what's going on without it, and the disparate clash of her thoughts and dialogue would have never happened. Hopefully, they will get smoothed out a bit in future issues, but—for now—this issue is only alright." [...] Jeff Lake of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10 and said, [...] "Overall, A-Force #1 is a solid, if unspectacular debut. It's great to see this cast together again, especially {{in the hands of}} Wilson, Molina and Martin, but as of now this new direction feels hamstrung by its need to square peg its way into a round hole." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 saying, [...] "While this book starts off with a shaky foundation - namely, {{that you have to have}} read a Secret Wars tie-in to understand where Singularity came from - Wilson <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> at firming things up, with her new heroine proving to be a fun addition to the Marvel Universe." ...|$|E
