40|$|The {{influence}} of the heating system method on greenhouse microclimate was investigated overnight, using an experimental greenhouse tunnel with a tomato crop. The heating system consisted of plastic heating pipes located close to the gutter holding the growing substrate and an <b>air</b> <b>heater,</b> located 2. 6 in above the ground. All the measurements were performed during two periods: (a) a period when only pipe heating was used; and (b) a period with pipe and air heating together. Heating pipes only could maintain the desired inside air temperature up to a temperature difference between inside and outside air of 10 degrees C, whereas this difference was increased to 15 degrees C {{with the addition of}} the <b>air</b> <b>heater.</b> Energy consumption with a system combining heating pipes and an <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> was 19 % higher. The use of the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> enhanced the vapour pressure difference and thus the crop transpiration. For both cases crop temperature was lower than air temperature but this difference was larger with the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> and resulted in an increase in crop aerodynamic conductance. The use of the <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> for dehumidification purposes was also investigated. It was shown that with the <b>air</b> <b>heater,</b> although the mass transfer conductance to the cover was higher, condensation flux was smaller which resulted in less condensation at the inner surface of the cover. These results indicate that the use of a mixed system is favourable in greenhouse tunnel conditions since the use of the <b>air</b> <b>heater,</b> although increasing slightly the energy consumption, improves the control of both air temperature and humidity, particularly by keeping the inside air dew point temperature lower than the cover temperature and preventing the occurrence of condensation on the plastic films.

Samples of the deposits were also analysed using optical microscopy and QEMSCAN, an automated electron beam image analysis system. Chemical and mineralogical analysis showed that the deposits are unusual in containing high amounts of sulphate, particularly of aluminium and, to a lesser extent, iron. From the analyses it appears that the formation of the deposits is due to the high sulphate content which is acting as a cementing agent. There is an indication that temperature could be another factor in formation of the deposits, with a decrease in temperature leading to the formation of sulphurous acid which then reacts with the reactive glassy amorphous fly ash phase to form the aluminium and iron sulphates. Dew point calculations indicated that this is a possible deposit formation mechanism based upon <b>air</b> <b>heater</b> temperature data obtained from the utility.
