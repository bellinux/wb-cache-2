5|$|Also, Theodoric Strabo, whose {{hatred of}} the Isaurian Zeno had {{compelled}} him to support Basiliscus' revolt, left the new Emperor's side. Basiliscus <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> raised his own nephew Armatus, who was rumoured to be also the lover of Basiliscus' wife, {{to the rank of}} magister militum, the same that Strabo held. Finally, the support of Illus was most likely wavering, given the massacre of the Isaurians allowed by Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, and insisted that Brooks <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} very well at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. Hamer expressed some disappointment with this, while hoping that the DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did somewhat better, and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> been seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln hired John Kirby to {{represent}} Nintendo in court. Kirby had won other big cases {{for the likes}} of PepsiCo., General Foods, and Warner-Lambert. Kirby researched the game's development, taking depositions from designer Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi in Japan. Miyamoto claimed that he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> called his ape character King Kong at first, as that was a generic term in Japan for any large ape.|$|E
5|$|Multiple static {{lines of}} defence, {{to delay the}} enemy's advance.

5|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the first two {{requirements}} had been satisfied, and that the guideline had not been rigidly enforced because the PSA {{had been willing to}} consider representations from cruise operators like the plaintiff, and, if the circumstances required, the PSA had been willing to grant an exception to the 30% restriction rule. Moreover, a number of concessions <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> been made by the PSA.|$|E
5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> made its own decision in the matter.|$|E

5|$|The {{isolation}} of vanadium metal proved difficult. In 1831, Berzelius reported {{the production of}} the metal, but Henry Enfield Roscoe showed that Berzelius <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> produced the nitride, vanadium nitride (VN). Roscoe eventually produced the metal in 1867 by reduction of vanadium(II) chloride, VCl2, with hydrogen. In 1927, pure vanadium was produced by reducing vanadium pentoxide with calcium.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> set out on the road to Antioch but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E
5|$|Between 1885 and 1908 it was {{believed}} that the signal had been sent using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it was pointed out that this had not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E

5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates {{that he was on}} a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually dining in the mess of Culloden at the moment of the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reported}} {{interest from}} English clubs Everton, Manchester United, Arsenal, and Spanish club Real Madrid, {{rumors of a}} move to rivals Marseille began to surface. On 28 June 2008, Lyon confirmed that a proposed transfer to Marseille had been cancelled for the time being. However, Ben Arfa confirmed to the local La Provence newspaper on 29 June that he had signed for the southern coast club and would not return to Lyon for pre-season training the following day. La Provence later reported that Ben Arfa <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> missed training in Lyon on 30 June, confirming his intentions.|$|E

Included in his total were 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and one Messerschmitt Bf 110. Official records differ over the exact total. After the war, two of Finucane's victories that were credited as probables <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> been destroyed, but were not officially included. His total victory count {{could be as high}} as 32. Some sources credit him this figure.|$|E
5|$|His {{grouping}} {{lost much}} of its supporters to the newly formed National Peasants' Party, and scored under 2% in the 1927 elections. Around 1930, Averescu began opposing the universal suffrage he had endorsed earlier, and issued an appeal to the intellectuals in order to have it discarded from legislation on the basis that it was easily influenced by the parties in power. He and his supporter, the pro-authoritarian poet Octavian Goga, received criticism from the left-wing Poporanist journal Viața Românească, who claimed that Averescu <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> provoked and encouraged widespread electoral irregularities during his time in office.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
