40|$|At {{least two}} {{distinct}} mechanisms {{appear to be}} responsible for accumulation of iodine by the thy-roid gland. The first, called the "iodide trap" by Vanderlaan and Vanderlaan (1), involves the concentration, presumably within the thyroid cells, of inorganic iodide obtained from the circulating blood.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study shows}} that iodinated <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> can be {{produced}} when iodide-containing waters are in contact with manganese oxide birnessite (delta-MnO 2) in the pH range of 5 - 7. In the absence of natural organic matter (NOM), iodide is oxidized to iodate that is also adsorbed onto delta-MnO 2. In the presence of iodide and NOM, adsordable <b>organic</b> <b>iodine</b> <b>compounds</b> (AOI) are formed at pH < 7 because of the oxidation of iodide to iodine by delta-MnO 2 and the reactions of iodine with NOM. In addition, iodoacetic acid and iodoform {{have been identified as}} specific iodinated byproducts. Formation of iodoform is not observed for high NOM/delta-MnO 2 ratios due to inhibition of the catalytic effect of delta-MnO 2 by NOM poisoning. Experiments with model compounds such as resorcinol and 3, 5 -heptanedione confirmed that the delta-MnO 2 /l(-) system is very effective for the formation of iodinated <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> These results suggest that birnessite acts as a catalyst through the oxidation of iodide to iodine and the polarization of the iodine molecule, which then reacts with NOM moieties. Furthermore, our results indicate that during water treatment in the presence of manganese oxide, iodinated <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> may be formed, which may lead to taste and odor or toxicological problems...|$|R

To isolate IAA, the column is washed with water and eluted with ammonia. To isolate HI, the column is washed with borate buffer, then with water and eluted with ammonia. After removal of the ammonia by heat, the <b>organic</b> <b>iodine</b> <b>compounds</b> are digested with chloric acid. Iodine is assayed by eerie sulphate-arsenious acid colorimetry. Normal values for IAA ranged from 3. 6 to 7. 2 μg iodine/ 100 ml serum (mean value 5. 10 μg iodine/ 100 ml), and for HI from 3. 0 to 6. 0 /μg iodine/ 100 ml serum (mean value 4. 30 μg iodine/ 100 ml) ...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic {{emissions}} of gaseous organic iodine-atom precursors {{have the potential}} to significantly affect atmospheric chemistry and climate, however there is currently considerable uncertainty associated with quantifying their sources. We present sea-air fluxes calculated from simultaneous air and seawater measurements of a comprehensive range of volatile <b>organic</b> <b>iodine</b> <b>compounds</b> (VOICs), including CH 3 I and the less commonly reported dihalomethanes CH 2 ICl, CH 2 IBr and CH 2 I 2, made during two cruises in the Atlantic Ocean between 15 - 58 N. The combined dihalomethane flux provides a global iodine source (~ 0. 33 0. 19 Tg I y - 1) comparable to that of CH 3 I, and a surface iodine atom source 3 - 4 times higher. However, a 1 D atmospheric model reveals that, in the tropical east Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of Cape Verde, even these combined VOIC fluxes are capable of supporting only ~ 10 - 25 % of the observed IO levels, and suggests that a substantial (340 - 640 nmol I m- 2 d - 1) additional photochemical source of iodine is required...|$|R
40|$|Bioadhesive and {{biodegradable}} microspheres {{were obtained}} by chemical cross-linking with epichlorohydrin of an alkaline solution of a mixture of starch and a-, b-, or g-cyclodextrin (CyD). Microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, swelling degree, and water retention. The percentage of the effective CyD in microspheres was estimated by measuring the amount of <b>iodine</b> and typical <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> (TOCs) retained in the hydrophobic cavity of CyD. Gabexate Mesylate (trade name Foys; GM), an antiallergic drug, was included in microspheres by soaking in an aqueous solution containing the drug, followed by solvent evaporation or lyophilization. UV, IR, and DSC data indicated that {{despite the fact that}} GM is a hydrophilic drug, its hydrophobic moiety close to the benzene ring is able to penetrate the CyD cavity and to form stable inclusion complexes. Values of the association equilibrium constant for GM binding to CyD, obtained by UV differential spectroscopy, indicated that the affinity of the drug for a- and g-CyD is higher than that for b-CyD. In vitro, GM was gradually released during 1 h. Even if the release rate of the drug is relatively fast, the microspheres might actually provide the best platform since the material adheres to the nasal mucosa which was proved by adhesion tests. The GM integrity was checked by comparing its anti-trypsin activity beforeand after release...|$|R
40|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} trace element for humans and animals because of its important role as a constituent of thyroid hormones. From a radioecological viewpoint, on the other hand, the anthropogenic iodine- 129 (^ I, half-life: 1. 6 x 10 ^ 7 years) is of great concern since {{it is one of}} the most persistent radionuclides released from nuclear facilities into the environment. Given its long half-life, ^ I can participate in the biogeochemical cycling of iodine and potentially accumulate in the human thyroid gland. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain better information on the behavior of iodine in the environment for accurate safety assessments of ^ I. Major pathways of the iodine cycling are volatilization of <b>organic</b> <b>iodine</b> <b>compounds</b> into the atmosphere, concentration of iodine to living organisms, reduction and oxidation of inorganic iodine species, and sorption of iodine on soils and sediments. Considerable geochemical evidences have indicated that these processes are influenced or controlled by biological activities, although detailed mechanisms are still unclear.

40|$|Photocuring of {{epoxides}} proceeds by a cationic mechanism. The required photoinitiators are iodonium or sulfonium salts with non-nucleophilic anions. The {{influence of}} different photoinitiators on the adhesion properties {{of both a}} rigid and a soft epoxide is examined. Depending on the substrates to be joined, different decomposition products of the initiators are concentrated in the interphase. This accumulation of decomposition products in the interphase leads to a decreased adhesion. On gold surfaces the sulfur of sulfonium salts is concentrated as expected. But surprisingly the iodine of the iodonium salts is also concentrated on gold. It could be shown by immobilization experiments that <b>organic</b> <b>iodine</b> <b>compounds</b> with the iodine in any oxidation state reacted with gold surfaces. Due to this reaction iodide anions are formed. On silicon surfaces the fluorine of the anions PF 6 - and SbF 6 - is concentrated due to the high affinity of silicon for fluorine. The iodonium salt with [B(C 6 F 5) (4) ](-) anion contains no fluorine able to react with the silicon. Therefore, the fluorine cannot be concentrated in the interphase and the joints prepared with the soft epoxide containing this initiator have a higher shear strength compared to adhesives with conventional anions...|$|R

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} bromine- and iodine-containing compounds substantially reduce regional, {{and possibly}} even global, tropospheric ozone levels. As such, these halogen gases reduce the global warming effects of ozone in the troposphere, and its capacity to initiate the chemical removal of hydrocarbons such as methane. The majority of halogen-related surface ozone destruction is attributable to iodine chemistry. So far, <b>organic</b> <b>iodine</b> <b>compounds</b> have been assumed {{to serve as the}} main source of oceanic iodine emissions. However, known organic sources of atmospheric iodine cannot account for gas-phase iodine oxide concentrations in the lower troposphere over the tropical oceans. Here, we quantify gaseous emissions of inorganic iodine following the reaction of iodide with ozone in a series of laboratory experiments. We show that the reaction of iodide with ozone leads to the formation of both molecular iodine and hypoiodous acid. Using a kinetic box model of the sea surface layer and a one-dimensional model of the marine boundary layer, we show that the reaction of ozone with iodide on the sea surface could account for around 75 % of observed iodine oxide levels over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. According to the sea surface model, hypoiodous acid - not previously considered as an oceanic source of iodine - is emitted at a rate ten-fold higher than that of molecular iodine under ambient conditions...|$|R
