5|$|The living {{conditions}} at the fort were poor. It was surrounded by marshes, with a poor road network, and the garrison had to survive on collected rainwater. A trader called a sutler built a house inside the southern entrance, growing vegetables within the south-west bastion and enjoying an effective monopoly on selling food to the soldiers. New barracks for the officers and enlisted men were rebuilt in 1772, but the officers often preferred to live across the river in the more urban setting of Gravesend, near the military headquarters there. A cricket match in 1776 between men from the Kentish and Essex sides of the Thames reportedly ended in bloodshed when guns were seized from the guardroom; newspapers recounted how an Essex man and a sergeant were shot dead, and a soldier was bayonetted, before both sides fled the scene. It is uncertain how accurate the newspaper account was, although the historians Andrew Saunders and Charles Kightly <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>some</b> credence.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, the VFL {{planned the}} first purpose built mega-stadium, VFL Park (later known as Waverley Park), to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>some</b> {{independence}} from the Melbourne Cricket Club, which managed the Melbourne Cricket Ground. VFL Park was planned to hold 155,000 spectators, which {{would have made it}} one of the largest stadiums in the world – although it would ultimately be built with a capacity of 78,000. Land for the stadium was purchased at Mulgrave, then farmland but predicted to be near the demographic centre of Melbourne's population.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were mostly positive, with Walton of The Moving Picture News stating, [...] " [...] variant of Enoch Arden, with a newspaperman interjected. The resurrected {{undesirable}} husband is cleverly eliminated. The coincidences are too miraculous to suit a plain newspaperman." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror agreed in premise that {{the plot of the}} film had been done before, but stated, [...] "...the Thanhouser people have done it fairly well and added a few details which, while not quite logical, <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>some</b> new interest." [...] The Moving Picture World offered a neutral summary of the plot, but concluded that the film [...] "is a graphic illustration of conditions which might arise almost any time, and develops an interestingly dramatic story as it proceeds." [...] One local review of the film called it [...] "splendid", but either by typographical error or for reasons unknown, gives a different story of the plot and even stating that the wife fell to her death by accident when attempting to see her.|$|E

500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>some</b> personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{producing}} {{the music for}} Oni, O'Donnell was tasked with composing the music for Bungie's next project, which would be unveiled at E3 2000. After talking with Joseph Staten, O'Donnell decided the music needed to be [...] "big, exciting, and unusual with a classical orchestra touch to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>some</b> weight and stature. We also wanted it {{to have some sort}} of 'ancient' feel to it." [...] O'Donnell came up with the idea of opening the piece with gregorian chant and jotted down the melody in his car. Because he did not know how long the presentation would be, O'Donnell created [...] "smushy" [...] opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as time required to back up a rhythmic middle section. The music was recorded and sent to New York the same night the piece was finished; the resulting music became the basis for the Halo series' [...] "highly recognizable" [...] signature sound, and what has been called one of the best-known video game themes. The use of the chant in the main theme has been credited with contributing to popular interest in the genre. Halos music used an interactive engine to change music in response to player's actions; this non-linear method has since become widespread. The scores for Halo and its sequel Halo 2 garnered awards such as The Game Developer's Choice Award and Best Original Video Game Soundtrack from Rolling Stone.|$|E

2500|$|The rhythm {{has been}} {{compared}} to Diddley's [...] "Mona", later covered by The Rolling Stones. After a break, Marr and Porter added a few overdubs, including a slide guitar part that [...] "gave [...] real tension", according to the guitarist. It was created using an early harmonizer that was also able to cache 1.2 seconds of delay, a very large amount for the time. Artists had been using it as a sampler; Porter claims that he recorded the delay rather than the original to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>some</b> [...] "weirdness". He also claims that he played one of the slide guitars; Marr disputes this but let him take credit anyway because of his leadership in recording the song.|$|E
