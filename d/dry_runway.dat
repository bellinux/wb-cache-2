40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of friction between aircraft tires and contaminated runway surfaces. Wet-, snow- and ice-covered surfaces are considered. A tire Brush model developed for aircraft braking on <b>dry</b> <b>runways</b> is adapted {{to take into account}} the effect of contaminants. Compared with a dry surface, contaminants are assumed to affect the static and dynamic friction coefficients, the tire stiffness, the tire slip ratio and the length of the contact patch. Linear relationship is established between static and dynamic friction coefficients. The dynamic friction coefficient is reduced using an empirical model for wet surfaces and experimental fitting for snow- and ice-covered surfaces. The tire stiffness is modified considering the frequency and temperature dependence of the tire mechanical properties. Values on snow and ice are lower than those on wet and dry surfaces. A physical model is developed to calculate the length of the wet contact patch. Finally, it is assumed that the aircraft effective slip ratio is surface dependent; values are determined for each of the studied contaminants. Theoretical friction-slip curves are realistic in terms of shape and differentiation between surface conditions. The model is applied to a Falcon 20 aircraft and a runway monitoring device called IMAG. Friction-slip and friction-speed curves are calculated and compared to experimental data.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has {{recently}} completed a statistical investigation of landing-contact conditions for two large turbojet transports and a turboprop transport landing on a <b>dry</b> <b>runway</b> during routine daylight operations at the Los Angeles International Airport. Measurements were made to obtain vertical velocity, airspeed, rolling velocity, bank angle, and distance from the runway threshold, just prior to ground contact. The vertical velocities at touchdown {{for one of the}} turbojet airplanes measured in this investigation were essentially the same as those measured on the same type of airplane during a similar investigation (see NASA Technical Note D- 527) conducted approximately 8 months earlier. Thus, it appeared that 8 months of additional pilot experience has had no noticeable tendency toward lowering the vertical velocities of this transport. Distributions of vertical velocities for the turbojet transports covered in this investigation were similar and considerably higher than'those for the turboprop transport. The data for the turboprop transport were in good agreement with the data for the piston-engine transports (see NACA Report 1214 and NASA Technical Note D- 147) for all the measured parameters. For the turbojet transports, 1 landing in 100 would be expected to equal or exceed a vertical velocity of approximately 4. 2 ft/sec; whereas, for the turboprop transport, 1 landing in 100 would be expected to equal or exceed 3. 2 ft/sec. The mean airspeeds at touchdown for the three transports ranged from 22. 5 percent to 26. 6 percent above the stalling speed. Rolling velocities for the turbojet transports were considerably higher than those for the turboprop transport. Distributions of bank angles at contact for the three transports were similar. For each type of airplane, 1 landing in 100 would be expected to equal or exceed a bank angle at touchdown of approximately 3. 0 deg. Distributions of touchdown distances for the three transports were also quite similar.

40|$|Landing {{excursion}} accidents {{have become}} a major concern over recent decades regarding airline and airport safety. Available runway friction has {{a significant impact on}} aircraft landing performance. This is especially noted when aircraft are landing on wet or otherwise contaminated runways due to the reduced braking action, which has been well documented since the dawn of the jet aircraft age. The objective of this thesis is to develop a tool to help make recommendations for airports that are subjected to diverse weather conditions. In order to model an aircraft’s real landing performance, a mechanistic-empirical aircraft deceleration equation was developed. This equation contains all of the major forces that contribute to aircraft braking, and is calibrated and validated using digital flight data from <b>dry</b> <b>runway</b> aircraft landings. Digital flight data from a Boeing 737 - 700, runway pavement condition monitoring data, and weather data was collected. Finally, a Boeing 737 - 700 case study was conducted. As a result, it is able to back calculate the braking friction coefficient from the developed equation and evaluate the impact of wet and contaminated runways on aircraft braking performance. A study of a Boeing 737 - 700 aircraft landing performance on runways under different conditions was conducted. A mechanistic-empirical landing distance model is established based on the mechanistic-empirical deceleration equation, in order to accurately calculate the required landing distance. When developing the landing distance model, the following characteristics are considered: pilot settings (TLA, spoiler position, and flap position configurations), aircraft operational characteristics (touchdown speed and weight), the runway friction condition, and aircraft braking system characteristics. A Boeing 737 - 700 real data case study was conducted and a comparison was made with the Boeing 737 Quick Reference Handbook reference landing distance. The results indicate the model offers an accurate prediction of aircraft landing distance. Finally, future applications of this thesis are introduced. The potential of the development of a runway assessment, evaluation, and reporting framework was proposed. Opportunities of applying this thesis in on-board landing distance calculation, quick exit taxiway design and airport operation optimization, and fuel consumption reduction were presented.

40|$|As {{part of the}} CryoSat Calibration and Validation Experiment (CryoVEx) {{this work}} {{is related to the}} {{calibration}} and validation of ESA's AirborneSAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter System (ASIRAS). ASIRAS was designed to simulate the CryoSat SAR Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL) for reasons of pre-launch and simultaneous accuracy and backscatter studies by using a similar instrument. The purpose of the ASIRAS calibration and data validation is to provide confidence in estimates of the uncertainty of the ASIRAS data products such as surface elevation and phase difference. Error estimates of the ASIRAS surface elevation in different snow zones were assessed using simultaneously acquired reference surfaceheights from an airborne laser scanner (reference digital elevation model). The phase difference and coherence tests were performed using data acquired over corner reflectors. The data were collected over the main validation sites in Greenland (EGIG line), Austfonna (Svalbard) and Devon Ice Cap (Canadian Arctic) during five CryoVEx sea- and land icecampaigns in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Prior to the validation of the ASIRAS data, a calibration and dating concept was designed and implemented. The latter was necessary in order to align all instruments (GPS, INS, laser scanner and ASIRAS) exactly to one reference time(GPS-UTC). Several dating and instrument uncertainties (e. g. systematic errors in the laser scanner raw data and ASIRAS time shifts) could be solved and corrected. In order to derive the surface elevation, processing software for the determination of laser squinting angles, the geocoding of the laser heights, the interferometric processing, and the retracking of the ASIRAS echoes was developed. The accuracy of the ASIRAS surface elevation was examined along selected 2 km to 3 km long profiles for four different surface types (<b>runway,</b> <b>dry</b> snow and percolation zone of Greenland, and accumulation zone of Austfonna) byusing five different retracker algorithms. An overall rms accuracy of 0. 05 m was found, however with a varying offset to the reference DEM reaching from 0. 0 m for the runway to 1. 50 m for the dry snow zone. The findings are related to roughness and backscatter variations along the chosen profiles. In general, higher accuracy could be found in regions of lower radar wavelength related surface roughness. The large offset in the dry snow zone is most likely not caused by surface roughness but related to volume scattering within the snowpack. Furthermore, inhelm_grl_ 2007 the feasibility was demonstrated to derive the winter snow accumulation in the percolation zone of Greenland based on ASIRAS data. In the high altitude mode, ASIRAS allows the determination of across track surface slopes by means of interferometric processing. The analysis showed a difference of - 0. 43 /- 0. 81 m to the reference DEM with high rms values related to low coherence and unwrapping errors. Additional measurements, possibly at higher flight levels, are needed to investigate the overall low coherence. In summary, this comprehensive study proves the concept of ASIRAS as the core instrument for the Cryosat satellite validation. In addition, ASIRAS on its own may contribute significantly to a fundamental understanding of microwave signatures over land and sea ice. In this context, a forward model which simulates the ASIRAS response over different layered and non layered media will help to better understand and exploit the presented findings...|$|R
