Diffusion coatings, mainly constituted with aluminide or platinum-aluminide, {{is still the}} most common form of surface protection. To further enhance resistance to corrosion and oxidation, MCrAlX-based overlay coatings (M=Ni or Co, X=Y, Hf, Si) are deposited to surface of superalloys. Compared to diffusion coatings, overlay coatings are less dependent on the composition of the substrate, but also more expensive, since they must be carried out by air or vacuum plasma spraying (APS/VPS) or else electron beam physical vapour deposition (<b>EB-PVD).</b> Thermal barrier coatings provide by far the best enhancement in working temperature and coating life. It is estimated that modern TBC of thickness 300 Î¼m, if used in conjunction with a hollow component and cooling air, has the potential to lower metal surface temperatures by a few hundred degrees.|$|E

Coatings are often applied {{on a variety of}} materials to extend the life of components under severe thermal, corrosion, wear, and oxidation environments. Interest in replacing chromium electroplating has sparked the use of <b>EB-PVD</b> technology for the repair of navy landing gear due to the high deposition rates of the <b>EB-PVD</b> process. The surface morphology, microstructure, and texturing of TiC films produced by reactive ion beam-assisted, <b>EB-PVD</b> will also be discussed for wear resistant applications in the cutting tool industry.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the effect of microstructure of the coating to the thermal conductivity of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs and the methods to reduce the thermal conductivity of these coatings have been investigated. Findings: Microstructure of the <b>EB-PVD</b> coating - it is found that they are formed in two different structure and microstructural characteristics and they are different from each other. Practical implications: Nowadays, selection of materials for usage purpose is getting important because of new high technologic developments. Especially for the parts operating at high temperatures, materials which have low thermal conductivity and high mechanical resistance are preferred. Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) are used in aerospace, diesel engine and power plant technologies due to porous structures and low thermal conductivity. Generally these coatings are applied by two methods, Electron Beam-Plasma Vapour Deposition (<b>EB-PVD)</b> and Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS).

40|$|Gas turbine {{manufacturers}} have achieved continuingly improved engine efficiency and thrust-to-weight ratio by designing with increased Turbine Entry Temperature (TET). The protection of High Pressure Turbine (HPT) aerofoils with thin insulating ceramic coatings, {{referred to as}} Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC's), {{has emerged as the}} next key technology to allow for further increases in TET. Electron Beam Physical Vapour Deposition (<b>EB-PVD)</b> is today's most promising processing route for the manufacture of TBC's applied on aerofoils. The purpose of this work was to generate a sound understanding {{of the relationship between the}} <b>EB-PVD</b> process and the structure of Zr 02 - 8 wt%Y 2 O 3 ceramic deposits, which could be exploited to achieve improved TBC performance. In particular, the role of deposition temperature and the potential benefits in using RF and DC plasma assistance of the <b>EB-PVD</b> process were investigated, together with their influence on the erosion performance of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBC's. The significance of particulate erosion as a degradation mode is assessed under conditions representative of the HPT environment. New explorable routes to achieve reduced thermal conductivity of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBC's are identified. It is shown that <b>EB-PVD</b> TBC's deposited at low temperature contain a massive content of microscopic voidage (- 50 %) which is responsible for their lack of thermal stability. The growth of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBC's at elevated deposition temperatures is explained in terms of dynamic sintering, whereby diffusion processes compete against the high rate arrival of vapour atoms to overcome the spontaneous defectiveness of the atomic build up. Modelling of the gas discharge physics has highlighted scope for improving the effectiveness of plasma assistance in causing ceramic structural damage, capable of modifying the coating thermal properties. The erosion rate of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBC's is shown to be controlled by their degree of plastic deformation upon particle impacts, which in turn depends on the ceramic column diameter and inherent porosity...|$|E

40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBC) {{are used to}} protect hot path components of gas turbines from hot combustion gases. For a number of decades, {{in the case of}} aero engines TBCs are usually deposited by electron beam physical vapour deposition (<b>EB-PVD).</b> <b>EB-PVD</b> coatings have a columnar microstructure that guarantees high strain compliance and better solid particle erosion than PS TBCs. The main drawback of <b>EB-PVD</b> coating is the deposition cost that is higher than that of air plasma sprayed (APS) TBC. The major scientific and technical objective of the UE project TOPPCOAT was the development of improved TBC systems using advanced bonding concepts in combination with additional protective functional coatings. The first specific objective was to use these developments to provide a significant improvement to state-of-the-art APS coatings and hence provide a cost-effective alternative to <b>EB-PVD.</b> In this perspective one standard porous APS, two segmented APS, one <b>EB-PVD</b> and one PS-PVD (TM) were tested at 700 degrees C in a solid particle erosion jet tester, with <b>EB-PVD</b> and standard porous APS being the two reference systems. Tests were performed at impingement angles of 30 degrees and 90 degrees, representative for particle impingement on trailing and leading edges of gas turbine blades and vanes, respectively. Microquartz was chosen as the erodent being one of the main constituents of sand and fly volcanic ashes. After the end of the tests, the TBC microstructure was investigated using electron microscopy to characterise the failure mechanisms taking place in the TBC. It was found that PS-PVD (TM) and highly segmented TBCs showed erosion rates comparable or better than <b>EB-PVD</b> samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is to}} further the understanding on the effects of dopants on the erosion resistance of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs by studying the effects of 2 mol% Gd 2 O 3 additions on the room and high temperature erosion resistance of as received and aged <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs. Previously it has been reported that gadolinia additions increased the erosion rate of EB- PVD TBCs, this is indeed the case for room temperature erosion, however under high temperature (825 Ã ÃÂ°C) erosion conditions this is not the case and the doped TBCs have a slightly lower erosion rate than the standard YSZ <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs. This has been attributed to a change in the erosion mechanisms that operate at the different temperatures. This change in mechanism was not expected under the impact conditions used and has been attributed to a change in the column diameter, and how this influences the dynamics of particle impactio...|$|E

The effect of two different thin metal film coating methods was studied in transmission laser micro-joints of titanium-coated glass and polyimide. The coating methods were cathodic arc physical vapor deposition (CA-PVD) and electron beam evaporation (<b>EB-PVD).</b> Titanium-coated glass joined to polyimide film can have neural electrode application. The improvement of the joint quality will be essential for robust performance of the device. Low power fiber laser (wave length = 1100 nm) was used for transmission laser micro-joining of thin titanium (Ti) film (similar to 200 nm) coated Pyrex borosilicate 7740 glass wafer (0. 5 mm thick) and polyimide (Imidex) film (0. 2 mm thick). Ti film acts as the coupling agent in the joining process. The Ti film deposition rate in the CA-PVD was 5 - 10 angstrom/s and in the <b>EB-PVD</b> 1. 5 angstrom/s. The laser joint strength was measured by a lap shear test, the 71 film surfaces were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the lap shear tested joints were analyzed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The film properties and the failure modes of the joints were correlated to joint strength. The CA-PVD produced around 4 times stronger laser joints than <b>EB-PVD.</b> The adhesion of the Ti film on glass by CA-PVD is better {{than that of the}} <b>EB-PVD</b> method. This is likely to be due to a higher film deposition rate and consequently higher adhesion or sticking coefficient for the CA-PVD particles arriving on the substrate compared to that of the <b>EB-PVD</b> film. <b>EB-PVD</b> shows poor laser bonding properties due to the development of thermal hotspots which occurs from film decohesion...|$|E
40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBC) processed by electron beam {{physical vapor deposition}} (<b>EB-PVD)</b> show complex deformation behavior due to their columnar microstructure and multi-scale porosity. Limited information is available regarding the inelastic deformation behavior. Furthermore, the existing data for the elastic properties of <b>EB-PVD</b> coatings varies in a wide range, depending on the measurement method. In most cases, the fragile <b>EB-PVD</b> coatings are tested on the substrate, onto which they were deposited. Since the ceramic coatings are deposited onto metallic substrates, which have about 1000 Â°C, compressive residual stresses develop in the coating after cooling down. Since the deformation behavior of <b>EB-PVD</b> coatings is stress dependent, the residual stresses cannot be calculated without knowledge of the stress-strain response, and without knowledge of the residual stress the elastic properties cannot be measured correctly. To overcome this dilemma, tubular free standing <b>EB-PVD</b> coating samples with a thickness of 250 Âµm have been processed and tested in compression at room temperature. For introducing the mechanical load safely into the gauge length a soft clamping has been developed, and the strain was measured using a contact-free laser extensometer. Several subsequent loading and unloading cycles were performed on specimens with different thermal pre heat treatments. Non-linear stress-strain behavior was observed, showing increasing stiffness with increasing compressive stress. Cycle by cycle the stiffness increased, indicating inelastic deformation, which has also been observed in creep experiments in the same test configuration. Long term thermally aged specimens showed higher stiffness than as processed specimens...|$|E
40|$|Yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (YSZ) {{has been}} used as a thermal/environmental barrier coating for gas turbine engine blades. Current methods of fabrication include air plasma spraying (APS) and electron-beam physical vapor deposition (<b>EB-PVD).</b> The APS technique results in a coating that loses effectiveness with thermal cycling. The <b>EB-PVD</b> technique deposits a columnar microstructure which accommodates thermal expansion mismatch, but the process is capital intensive and also line-of-sight. A technique currently being investigated is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which can reduce the need for costly capital equipment, is simpler, and can deposit high quality coatings on hidden surfaces. Further, CVD coatings can act also as a top coat to seal an <b>EB-PVD</b> coating from ingress of damaging salts from the combustion environment.

40|$|The rise in aero-engine {{operating}} temperatures due to {{economic and environmental}} issues has generated many technological inventions. Few among them are {{the development of new}} generation super alloys which can tolerate higher temperatures and high stresses, and the evolution of ceramic coatings on top of the alloys which can reduce the temperature load. These thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are mainly deposited by electron beam physical vapor deposition (<b>EB-PVD),</b> which has inter-columnar porosity, and by air plasma spraying (APS), which has porosity and cracks mainly running parallel to the interface. These TBCs are used in protecting combustion chamber walls, turbine blades and vanes allowing higher {{operating temperatures}} of aero-engines. CMAS (CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2) attack becomes more dominant in the increased temperature range of current aero-engines. Currently 7 wt. % Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (7 YSZ) {{has been used as a}} TBC in aero-engines. As CMAS melts at temperature 1200 Â°C and above, it infiltrates through the porous inter-columnar TBC structure with help of capillary forces. This infiltration causes severe mechanical stresses within the TBC upon thermal cycling subsequently leading to crack formation and TBS spallation. As the state of the art 7 YSZ TBC coatings could not resist the CMAS infiltration, the development of an <b>EB-PVD</b> alumina layer as an alternative CMAS resistant coating will be part of this work. The fabrication of <b>EB-PVD</b> Al 2 O 3 on top of 7 YSZ coatings was achieved by varying the deposition process parameters and the corresponding morphology of <b>EB-PVD</b> Al 2 O 3 / 7 YSZ coatings was studied. The coatings were deposited on alumina substrates in order to conduct long term infiltration tests. CMAS infiltration experiments were performed at 1225 ÂºC and 1250 ÂºC for different time intervals starting from 1 to 10 hours. In addition, very short term infiltration tests for 5 minutes were performed at 1250 Â°C using a model CMAS source and a real volcanic ash. The results show that the studied <b>EB-PVD</b> Al 2 O 3 / 7 YSZ coatings induced the crystallization of the CMAS melt by forming stable spinel (MgAl 1. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 4) and anorthite (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 4) phases which were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. These layers exhibit a minimal growth making <b>EB-PVD</b> alumina topcoat a promising candidate for CMAS resistant multilayer TBCs. However, the <b>EB-PVD</b> Al 2 O 3 samples experienced heavy sintering during long time exposure at high temperatures and the formed cracks in the layer have allowed the CMAS to fully infiltrate. Thus, multifunctional reaction-bonded alumina oxide (RBAO) was deposited on top of <b>EB-PVD</b> Al 2 O 3 which acts as a sacrificial layer forming the stable CMAS arresting products and inhibiting further infiltration...|$|E

Up to 900 Â°C AVA deposits and <b>EB-PVD</b> YSZ do not show significant interaction. Viscous flow above the glass transition of AVA (Tg ~ 930 Â°C) yields proceeding wetting of <b>EB-PVD</b> YSZ coatings. At 1100 Â°C, the YSZ surface is covered by a dense glaze-like AVA overlay. At 1200 Â°C AVA is mostly infiltrating the coating, leaving a crystalline plagioclase- and hematite-type residue at the interface. Moreover, some ZrSiO 4 is formed at the expense of YSZ. The overall thermochemical effects upon short-term exposure of the <b>EB-PVD</b> YSZ coating to a small AVA load were moderate, in particular prior to complete infiltration. On the other hand, AVA acts as a solvent for the stabilizing Y 2 O 3 beyond 1000 Â°C and a progressive depletion of Y 2 O 3 in the YSZ is observed at the AVA / YSZ interface.

40|$|Yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (YSZ) {{is used as}} {{a thermal}} barrier coating (TBC) to protect super-alloy blades such as Mar-M 247 or Rene-N 5 during engine operation. The current method for YSZ fabrication for TBC applications is by air-plasma spraying (APS) or electron beam physical vapor deposition (<b>EB-PVD)</b> (Haynes 1997). APS gives reasonable deposition rates, but has a limited life and aging effects due to its porous and lamellar structure. The <b>EB-PVD</b> coatings are more stable and can accommodate thermomechanical stresses due to their characteristic strain-tolerant, columnar microstructure. <b>EB-PVD,</b> however, is primarily line-of-sight, which often leaves ''hidden areas'' uncoated, has low throughput, and has high capital cost. The process of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is investigated here as an economical alternative to <b>EB-PVD</b> and APS, with the potential for better overall coverage as well as the ability to produce thick (100 - 250 {micro}m), strain-tolerant, columnar coatings. MOCVD of YSZ involves the use of zirconium and yttrium organometallic precursors reacting with an oxygen source. Previous researchers have used diketonate or chloride precursors and oxygen (Wahl et al. 2001 a, Wahl et al. 2001 b, Yamane and Harai 1989). These precursors have low transport rates due to their low carrier solvent solubility (Varanasi et al. 2003).

In addition, isothermal oxidation of APS TBCs resulted in significant Al-depletion of the two-phase (ï¿½+ï¿½) NiCoCrAlY bond coat, which finally led to a completely ï¿½-depleted microstructure.

These materials show a high strain tolerance relying on their unique coating morphology which is comprised by weakly bonded columns. Growth of these columns occurs in a preferred crystallographic orientation producing inter-columnar gaps in between them. Furthermore, the open porosity is enhanced by the presence of voids between feather-like sub-columns which are surrounding the primary column surfaces inclined toward their growing axis. Finally, rotation of the specimens during the vapour deposition process produces additional intra-columnar closed pores formed inside the primary columns. The results obtained in this work demonstrate that the variation of the parameters during the <b>EB-PVD</b> process alters the columnar morphology of the coatings. Consequently, these morphological changes affect primarily the thermal conductivity {{which is one of the}} key physical properties of this material group. This study investigates three different morphologies of PYSZ <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs in terms of the spatial and geometrical characteristics of their porosities and the corresponding thermal conductivity in as-coated state and after heat treatments at 1100 Â°C for 1 h and 100 h. Changes of the surface area, shape and size of the open and closed pores after heat treatments are characterized by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Method (BET) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs is also altered as their microstructure on modification of the <b>EB-PVD</b> process parameters. Correlation of the changes in the thermal conductivity with that of the analysed microstructures, regarding the changes in shape and surface area of the pores in as-coated and heat-treated states, revealed that the thermal conductivity of these coatings is principally influenced by the shape of the pores and secondarily by the pore surface area available at the cross section perpendicular to the heat flux...|$|E
40|$|Electron-beam {{physical}} vapor deposited (<b>EB-PVD)</b> {{thermal barrier}} coatings (TBCs) display a lower thermal conductivity {{compared with the}} deposited bulk material. This effect is achieved due {{to the presence of}} pores within these films. The spatial and geometrical characteristics of the porosity influence directly the magnitude of the achieved reduction of the thermal conductivity. In this work, three <b>EB-PVD</b> coating containing different microstructures were manufactured by varying the manufacturing process parameters during the deposition process. Their corresponding thermal conductivities were measured via the Laser Flash Analysis Method (LFA) in both the as-coated state and after ageing (1100 Â°C/ 100 h). Analysis of the pore formation during processing was carried out by ultrasmall-angle x-ray scattering (USAXS). This technique is supported with a computer based modeling developed by researchers at Advanced Photon Source (APS) in ANL, USA, and in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA. The model enables the characterization of the size, shape, volume and orientation of each of the pore populations in <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs. The effect of these spatial and geometrical characteristics of the porosity on the thermal conductivity of the <b>EB-PVD</b> coatings were studied via a non-interacting approximation based on MaxwellÂ´s model. Results of LFA measurements and the applied approximation indicate an interrelation between the microstructure and the thermal properties of the analyzed <b>EB-PVD</b> coatings. Microstructures containing a higher volume fraction of fine anisotropic intra-columnar pores, and larger voids between feather-arms oriented at lower angles toward the substrate plane correspond to lower thermal conductivity values. Inter-columnar gaps do no significantly contribute to lowering the thermal conductivity due to their orientation parallel to the heat flux and their lower volume fraction compared with the volume occupied by the primary columns. On heat-treatment, the deepest section of the gaps between feather-arms break-up into arrays of nano-sized low aspect ratio voids. The anisotropic, elongated intra-columnar pores evolve toward low aspect ratio shapes that are less effective in reducing the thermal conductivity...|$|E

For this purpose two alternative TBC-compositions were produced by EB-PVD-process: Fully yttria (14 wt. %) stabilised zirconia (FYSZ) and pyrochlore (LaZr 2 O 7) both of which yield intrinsically low thermal conductivity values.

It is an important task to uphold low thermal conductivity in TBCs during long-term service at elevated temperatures. One {{of the most promising}} methods to fulfil this task is to optimize the properties of PYSZ-based TBC by tailoring its microstructure.

However, TBCs are susceptible to various life limiting issues associated with their operating environment including erosion, corrosion, oxidation, sintering and foreign object damage (FOD). This is a review paper that examines various degradation and erosion mechanisms of TBCs, especially those produced by electron beam physical vapour deposition (<b>EB-PVD).</b> The results {{from a number of}} laboratory tests under various impact conditions are discussed before the different erosion and FOD mechanisms are reviewed.

40|$|In the beginning, <b>EB-PVD</b> (electron beam {{physical}} vapour deposition) {{of aluminium}} on strip steel was introduced as corrosion protection. Meanwhile, various metallic and oxide layer stacks on strip steel are {{applied in the}} car production industries {{in order to improve}} corrosion protection, welding ability, wear resistance and adhesion of organic top coatings. Double sided copper coating of strip steel by <b>EB-PVD</b> is industrially introduced with the aim to obtain solderable surfaces for pipe soldering of high pressure pipes of refrigerator systems and brake lines. Recently, aluminium coatings on steel based alloys are applied in the production of metal supported catalytic converters. High resistance coatings like SiO 2 on stainless steel are applied as protection layers between the back contact of thin film solar cells and the bearing flexible metallic substrate. Thus, <b>EB-PVD</b> is well established as a large area coating technology. Reactive <b>EB-PVD</b> allows the deposition of some important compounds. Although <b>EB-PVD</b> is a superior coating technology regarding highest deposition rates, its successful industrial application in some cases depends on a further improvement of layer properties. Plasma activated <b>EB-PVD</b> is a process combination which allows to increase density, hardness, refractive index and other properties of the coatings. One possibility of plasma activation concerning the electron beam evaporation process is the ignition of a spotless arc discharge on the EB heated evaporant which is well known as the SAD (spotless arc activated deposition) process. This process, in which an anode near the crucible is applied in order to ignite a spotless arc onto the electron beam heated evaporant in the crucible, has been extended {{for the first time to}} large area dimensions. Reactive large area SAD of titanium dioxide has been carried out at deposition rates of up to 70 nm/s. Results of these investigations will be presented. Advantages of the process include high plasma densities with an ionisation degree of up to 60 %, less expensive additional equipment in the process surrounding of the EB evaporator compared to other plasma generation tools, and coinciding position of the arc on the evaporant with the location of the electron beam generated vapour source. The dynamic deposition rate of titanium dioxide achieved approximately 1000 nm. m/min. Expensive titanium suboxides as evaporant can be replaced by low cost titanium. Latest experiments showed that the SAD process can be extended to large area technology with no limitations with respect to substrate width. Thus, the way into industrial application is open. Applications of titanium and titanium compounds in the finishing industries are tabulated, where SAD may be applied in the near future...|$|E

The {{influence}} of NiCrAlY coatings prepared by low-pressure plasma-sprayed (LPPS) and electron beam {{physical vapor deposition}} (<b>EB-PVD)</b> respectively on the damping properties of 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti alloy were investigated. The results shown that, compared to uncoated sample, the damping capacity of NiCrAlY coated samples has been improved significantly. The Q- 1 value of the coated samples was approximately 0. 008 ï½ 0. 01 in range of 20 ï½ 300. The interface adhesion state has a distinct effect on the coatings â damping characteristics. The dynamic Youngâs modulus of the coated samples decreased compared to the uncoated substrate; and LPPS coated sampleâs dynamic modulus was {{lower than that of}} <b>EB-PVD</b> coated sample. Such difference resulted from different coating microstructure and interface adhesion morphology. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) deposited by <b>EB-PVD</b> protect the turbine blades {{situated at the}} high pressure sector of the aircraft and stationary turbines increasing the combustion temperature and/or diminishing the air-cooling requirements. It is an important task to uphold low thermal conductivity in TBCs during long-term service at elevated temperatures. One {{of the most promising}} methods to fulfil this task and to improve the turbine efficiency is to optimize the TBC properties by tailoring its microstructure and/or material. The different kinds of pores in <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs influence their thermal conductivity according to their size, shape, orientation and volume. These pores can be open (inter-columnar and between feather arms gaps) and closed (intra-columnar pores). Since such pores are located within three-dimensionally deposited columns and enclose large differences in their sizes, shapes, distribution and anisotropy, the accessibility for their characterization becomes very complex and requires the use of sophisticated methods. In this work, three different <b>EB-PVD</b> TBC microstructures were manufactured by varying the process parameters, yielding various characteristics of their pores. The corresponding thermal conductivities in as-coated and after annealing at 1100 C/ 1 h and 100 h conditions were measured via Laser Flash Analysis Method (LFA). Analysis of the pores formation during processing and their individual effect on the thermal conductivity are made by employing an USAXS-measuring method as well as modelling on the corresponding specimens which is able to characterize the size, shape, volume and orientation of all pores at the <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs. Evident differences in the thermal conductivity values were found for each microstructure in as-coated and after annealing conditions, as well as between them. Broader columns introduce higher values in thermal conductivity. In general, thermal conductivity increases after heat-treatment for all three microstructures investigated although those with smaller pore surface area shows smaller changes. ...|$|E
40|$|Partially {{stabilized}} zirconia (PYSZ) based {{thermal barrier}} coatings (TBC) manufactured by <b>EB-PVD</b> process are {{a crucial part}} of a system, which protects the turbine blades situated at the high pressure sector of aero engines and stationary gas turbines under severe service conditions. These materials show a high strain tolerance relying on their unique coating morphology, which is represented by weakly bonded columns. The porosity present in ceramic top coats affects the thermal conductivity by reducing the cross sectional area through which the heat flows. The increase in thermal conductivity after heat-treatment relates to the alteration of the shape of the pores rather than the reduction of their surface-area at the cross section. The studies carried out by the authors demonstrate that the variation of the parameters during the <b>EB-PVD</b> processing of PYSZ based top-coats alters the columnar morphology of the coatings. Consequently, these morphological changes affect primarily the thermal conductivity and eventually the Youngâ Modulus which are the key physical properties of this material group. 	New ceramic compositions covering zirconia coatings stabilized with alternative oxides, pyrochlores and hexaluminates are addressed. Failures occurring in ceramic top coats mark the lifetime of TBC system and therefore, it is necessary that their performance should go beyond that of the-state-of-the-art materials. This context summarizes the research and developments devoted to future generation ceramic top coats of <b>EB-PVD</b> TBCs. ...|$|E

40|$|The process {{dependence}} of Ir-based-alloy-coated Ni-based single crystal superalloys was investigated. An Ir- 4 at%Ta alloy, 10 mm thick, was coated on a Ni-based single crystal superalloy TMS- 82 +, {{by means of}} magnetron sputtering deposition (SD) and electron beam physical vapor deposition (<b>EB-PVD).</b> X-ray analysis revealed that the grain size of the as-SD-coated layer (20 nm) has five times smaller {{than that of the}} as-EB-PVD coated layer (100 nm), and the SD-coated specimens showed more rapid outer diffusion of Ni and Al from the substrate after annealing, than the EB-PVD-coated ones. On the other hand, the aluminizing treatment reduces the differences between the SD coated and <b>EB-PVD</b> coated specimens in terms of compositional distribution and oxidation resistance. This study also revealed that even without aluminizing, the simple annealing treatment enhances the oxidation resistance of the Ir- 4 %Ta-coated TMS- 82 +...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for thermal barrier coatings in high temperature {{applications such as}} aero gas turbines, leads {{to the development of}} improved processes and materials. The performance of thermal barrier coatings for aero gas turbines, especially for turbine blades of the hot section, is related mainly to the thermal shock resistance of the coating. Due to the columnar structure, <b>EB-PVD</b> Zirconia coatings have shown superior thermal shock resistance. Reproducibility of quality is the major problem which prevents the wide commercial use of these coatings. The present investigation describes the influence of the most important process parameters on the coating properties.

40|$|Controlling {{an inline}} Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (<b>eb-PVD)</b> process {{requires}} mostly {{the identification of}} proper process models, even more if {{the distance between the}} measuring points of the process input quantity (e. g. the electron beam power) and output quantity (e. g. a layer thickness measurement) is large in comparison to the used substrate velocity.
