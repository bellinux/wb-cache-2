40|$|AbstractTo {{simplify the}} study of visual <b>face</b> processing, we {{introduce}} a novel class of synthetic <b>face</b> stimuli based upon 37 measurements (head shape, feature locations, etc.) extracted from individual <b>face</b> photographs in both frontal and 20 ° side views. Synthetic <b>faces</b> are bandpass filtered optimally for <b>face</b> perception and include both line and edge information. Pilot experiments establish that subjects are extremely accurate in matching a synthetic <b>face</b> with the original grayscale photograph, even across views. To determine the perceptual metric of <b>face</b> space, we introduce <b>face</b> cubes in which the geometric differences between any <b>faces</b> in a four-dimensional <b>face</b> subspace can be precisely determined. Experiments on <b>face</b> discrimination using <b>face</b> cubes establish the metric of synthetic <b>face</b> space as locally Euclidean, with discrimination thresholds representing 4 – 6 % total geometric variation (as a percent of mean head radius) between <b>faces.</b> Discrimination thresholds are lowest for <b>face</b> cubes constructed around the average <b>face,</b> thus indicating that the mean <b>face</b> for each gender represents a natural origin for <b>face</b> space. Finally, synthetic <b>faces</b> exhibit a pronounced inversion effect for 20 ° side views and a characteristic “Thatcher effect” for inverted front views. Synthetic <b>faces</b> and <b>face</b> cubes thus provide a useful new quantitative approach to {{the study of}} <b>face</b> perception and <b>face</b> space...|$|R

40|$|<b>Face</b> {{adaptation}} techniques {{have been used}} extensively to investigate how <b>faces</b> are processed. It has even been suggested that <b>face</b> adaptation is functional in calibrating the visual system to the diet of <b>faces</b> to which an observer is exposed. Yet most adaptation studies to date have used unfamiliar faces: few have used <b>faces</b> with real world familiarity. Familiar <b>faces</b> have more abstractive representations than unfamiliar <b>faces.</b> The experiments in this thesis therefore examined <b>face</b> adaptation for familiar <b>faces.</b> Chapters 2 and 3 explored the role of explicit recognition of familiar <b>faces</b> in producing <b>face</b> identity after-effects (FIAEs). Chapter 2 used composite <b>faces</b> (the top half of a celebrity's <b>face</b> paired with {{the bottom half of}} an unfamiliar <b>face)</b> as adaptors and showed that only recognised composites produced significant adaptation. In Chapter 3 the adaptors were cryptic <b>faces</b> (unfamiliar <b>faces</b> subtly transformed towards a celebrity's <b>face)</b> and <b>faces</b> of celebrity's siblings. Unrecognised cryptic and sibling <b>faces</b> produced FIAEs for their related celebrity, but only when adapting and testing on the same viewpoint. Adaptation only transferred across viewpoint when a <b>face</b> was explicitly recognised. Chapter 4 demonstrated that <b>face</b> adaptation could occur for ecologically valid, personally familiar stimuli, a necessary pre-requisite if adaptation is functional in calibrating <b>face</b> processing mechanisms. A video of a lecturer's <b>face</b> produced FIAEs equivalent to that produced by static images. Chapters 5 and 6 used a different type of after-effect, the <b>face</b> distortion after-effect (FDAE), to explore the stability of our representations for personally familiar <b>faces,</b> and showed that even representations of highly familiar <b>faces</b> can be affected by exposure to distorted <b>faces.</b> The work presented here shows {{that it is important to}} take facial familiarity into account when investigating <b>face</b> adaptation effects, as well as increasing our understanding of how familiarity affects the representations of <b>faces...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Face</b> {{identity}} and facial expression are processed in two distinct neural pathways. However, {{most of the}} existing <b>face</b> adaptation literature studies them separately, {{despite the fact that}} they are two aspects from the same <b>face.</b> The current study conducted a systematic comparison between these two aspects by <b>face</b> adaptation, investigating how top- and bottom-half <b>face</b> parts contribute to the processing of <b>face</b> {{identity and}} facial expression. A real <b>face</b> (sad, “Adam”) and its two size-equivalent <b>face</b> parts (top- and bottom-half) were used as the adaptor in separate conditions. For <b>face</b> identity adaptation, the test stimuli were generated by morphing Adam's sad <b>face</b> with another person's sad <b>face</b> (“Sam”). For facial expression adaptation, the test stimuli were created by morphing Adam's sad <b>face</b> with his neutral <b>face</b> and morphing the neutral <b>face</b> with his happy <b>face.</b> In each trial, after exposure to the adaptor, observers indicated the perceived <b>face</b> identity or facial expression of the following test <b>face</b> via a key press. They were also tested in a baseline condition without adaptation. Results show that the top- and bottom-half <b>face</b> each generated a significant <b>face</b> identity aftereffect. However, the aftereffect by top-half <b>face</b> adaptation is much larger than that by the bottom-half <b>face.</b> On the contrary, only the bottom-half <b>face</b> generated a significant facial expression aftereffect. This dissociation of top- and bottom-half <b>face</b> adaptation suggests that <b>face</b> parts play different roles in <b>face</b> identity and facial expression.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Face</b> {{judgments}} of dominance {{play an important}} role in human social interaction. Perceived facial dominance is thought to indicate physical formidability, as well as resource acquisition and holding potential. Dominance cues in the <b>face</b> affect perceptions of attractiveness, emotional state, and physical strength. Most experimental paradigms test perceptions of facial dominance in individual <b>faces,</b> or they use manipulated versions of the same <b>face</b> in a forced-choice task but in the absence of other <b>faces.</b> Here, we extend this work by assessing whether dominance ratings are absolute or are judged relative to other <b>faces.</b> We presented participants with <b>faces</b> to be rated for dominance (target <b>faces),</b> while also presenting a second <b>face</b> (non-target <b>faces)</b> that was not to be rated. We found that both the masculinity and sex of the non-target <b>face</b> affected dominance ratings of the target <b>face.</b> Masculinized non-target <b>faces</b> decreased the perceived dominance of a target <b>face</b> relative to a feminized non-target <b>face,</b> and displaying a male non-target <b>face</b> decreased perceived dominance of a target <b>face</b> more so than a female non-target <b>face.</b> Perceived dominance of male target <b>faces</b> was affected more by masculinization of male non-target <b>faces</b> than female non-target <b>faces.</b> These results indicate that dominance perceptions can be altered by surrounding <b>faces,</b> demonstrating that facial dominance is judged at least partly relative to other <b>faces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Humans' <b>face</b> ability {{develops}} and matures {{with extensive}} experience in perceiving, recognizing, and interacting with <b>faces</b> that move most of the time. However, how facial movements affect 1 core aspect of <b>face</b> ability-holistic <b>face</b> processing-remains unclear. Here we investigated the influence of rigid facial motion on holistic and part-based <b>face</b> processing by manipulating the presence of facial motion during study and at test in a composite <b>face</b> task. The results showed that rigidly moving <b>faces</b> were processed as holistically as static <b>faces</b> (Experiment 1). Holistic processing of moving <b>faces</b> persisted whether facial motion was presented during study, at test, or both (Experiment 2). Moreover, when <b>faces</b> were inverted to eliminate the contributions of both an upright <b>face</b> template and observers' expertise with upright <b>faces,</b> rigid facial motion facilitated holistic <b>face</b> processing (Experiment 3).

40|$|A typical {{automatic}} <b>face</b> recognition {{system is}} composed of three parts: <b>face</b> detection, <b>face</b> alignment and <b>face</b> recognition. Conventionally, these three parts are processed in a bottom-up manner: <b>face</b> detection is performed first, then the results are passed to <b>face</b> alignment, and finally to <b>face</b> recognition. The bottom-up approach is one extreme of vision approaches. The other extreme approach is topdown. In this paper, we proposed a Markovian stochastic mixture approach for combining bottom-up and top-down <b>face</b> recognition: <b>face</b> recognition is performed {{from the results of}} <b>face</b> alignment in a bottom-up way, and <b>face</b> alignment is performed {{based on the results of}} <b>face</b> recognition in a top-down way. By modeling the mixture <b>face</b> recognition as a stochastic process, the recognized person is decided probabilistically according to the probability distribution coming from the stochastic <b>face</b> recognition, and the recognition problem becomes that “who the most probable person is when the stochastic process of <b>face</b> recognition goes on for an infinite long duration”. This problem is solved with the theory of Markov chains by properly modeling the stochastic process of <b>face</b> recognition as a Markov chain. As conventional <b>face</b> alignment is not suitable for this mixture approach, discriminative <b>face</b> alignment is proposed. And we also prove that the Markovian mixture <b>face</b> recognition results only depend on discriminative <b>face</b> alignment, not on conventional <b>face</b> alignment.

These indicators were accuracy for identification of own-race <b>faces</b> and the other-race effect (ORE) -the well-established finding that own-race <b>faces</b> are recognised more accurately than other-race <b>faces.</b> In Experiment 1 Caucasian and Asian participants completed a recognition memory task for own- and other-race real and CG <b>faces.</b> Overall accuracy for own-race <b>faces</b> was dramatically reduced for CG compared to real <b>faces</b> and the ORE was significantly and substantially attenuated for CG <b>faces.</b> Experiment 2 investigated perceptual discrimination for own- and other-race real and CG <b>faces</b> with Caucasian and Asian participants. Here again, accuracy for own-race <b>faces</b> was significantly reduced for CG compared to real <b>faces.</b> However the ORE was not affected by format.
