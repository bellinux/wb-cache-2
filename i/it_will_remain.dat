5|$|The Russian company Aviarestoration has rebuilt three MiG-3s. They all use Allison V-12 engines. One {{is in the}} US in the Military Aviation Museum of Pungo, Virginia and another, rebuilt from a MiG-3 {{shot down}} in 1942, first flew again around the start of 2010. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
5|$|The academy grounds {{are home}} to {{numerous}} monuments and statues. The central cadet parade ground, the Plain, hosts the largest number, and includes the Washington Monument, Thayer Monument, Eisenhower Monument, MacArthur Monument, Kosciuszko Monument, and Sedgwick Monument. Patton Monument was first dedicated {{in front of the}} cadet library in 1950, but in 2004 it was placed in storage {{to make room for the}} construction of Jefferson Hall. With the completion of Jefferson Hall, Patton's statue was relocated and unveiled at a temporary location on 15 May 2009, where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> until the completion of the renovation of the old cadet library and Bartlett Hall. There is also a statue commemorating brotherhood and friendship from the École Polytechnique in the cadet central area just outside Nininger Hall. The remaining campus area is home to 27 other monuments and memorials.|$|E

50|$|In February 2013, {{two former}} {{employees}} of Blackfire, Roblero Ciro Perez and Luis Antonio Flores Villatoro were detained by the State police, interrogated and underwent lie detector testing. Both men were cleared of having {{any involvement in}} the murder of Mr. Abarca. These interrogations clears the names of the last two gentlemen who were falsely accused of the crime. The investigation continues and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remained</b> focused on the former State government officials Nemesio Ponce and the former Governor Juan Sabines Guerrero.|$|R
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain,</b> therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|Once a room is {{cleared of}} monsters, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> clear, {{allowing}} the player to re-trace {{their way through}} the level, though once they move onto the next level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all their hearts, the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly-generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to the next level. On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's mother on the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, Sheol contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.|$|E

This stretch is an important, if often congested, transportation artery for the county.|$|E
25|$|Another {{variation}} of the regression hypothesis is the best learned-last-forgotten hypothesis, which emphasizes the intensity {{and quality of the}} acquired knowledge, not the order in which it is learned. Therefore, the better something is learned, the longer <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain.</b> Because the language component is repeated again and again, it becomes automated and increases the probability that it will last in the memory (Schöpper-Grabe 1998: 241).|$|E

25|$|It is an {{interesting}} butterfly in {{that it has a}} number of modes of flight. In the cool of the morning, the flight is slow considering that it is an edible and unprotected swallowtail.

25|$|The {{flashback}} arrestor (not {{to be confused}} with a check valve) prevents shock waves from downstream coming back up the hoses and entering the cylinder, possibly rupturing it, as there are quantities of fuel/oxygen mixtures inside parts of the equipment (specifically within the mixer and blowpipe/nozzle) that may explode if the equipment is incorrectly shut down, and acetylene decomposes at excessive pressures or temperatures. In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the {{flashback arrestor}}, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> switched off until someone resets it.|$|E
