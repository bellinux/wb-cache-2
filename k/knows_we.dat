In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life <b>knows</b> <b>we</b> need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the last thing you need right now is a knife." ...|$|E

McGee said [...] "It’s a gorgeous, gorgeous scene, even if it stands as a meta-criticism of the angst and turmoil of the show’s major characters". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was the right or wrong thing to do. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the pair amongst her favourite characters of the series, commenting [...] "Few things made [...] happier than seeing them comfortably ensconced in their retirement cabin with Walt's dog, Vincent. They {{had the good sense to}} give up the whole island rat race, and their optimistic, straightforward attitudes and down-to-earth humor grounded Lost and gave us a window into normalcy, which, goodness <b>knows,</b> <b>we</b> needed sometimes".|$|E

2500|$|Moore's {{inclusion}} of a 10-second clip with amputee Peter Damon has been criticized. Damon said the filmmaker [...] "should be ashamed of himself" [...] for claiming that soldiers were deceived into supporting the Iraq War and for using his injuries as reason to oppose the conflict. Damon [...] "agree with the President 100%. A lot of the guys down at Walter Reed feel the same way." [...] According to Damon's doctor, Lt. Col. Chester Buckenmaier, Moore took [...] "a very positive thing we're doing for soldiers" [...] who lost limbs and [...] "used it to tell a lie." [...] Responding to the criticism, associate producer Joanne Doroshow said, [...] "Anybody who has seen the film <b>knows</b> <b>we</b> have nothing but the deepest respect for the soldiers who were wounded.
