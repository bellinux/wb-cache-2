Tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) clathrate hydrate possesses the qualities of an efficient cold storage material.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the optimal distribution of the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface</b> area or conductance among the Stirling engine heat exchangers when the minimum of the total <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface</b> area of the heat exchangers is sought. The optimization procedure must fulfill one of the following constraints: (1) fixed power output of the engine, (2) fixed <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> rate available at the source, or (3) fixed power output and <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> rate at the source. Internal and external irreversibilities of the Stirling engine are considered. An analytic approach, when <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> occurs at small temperature differences at the heat reservoirs, provides several restrictions with regard to variables of the model.

In order to match the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface</b> of the FP (2  m 2 /mtrench), 10.15 coils have been considered for unit length of trench, split on two levels as a standard configuration reported in [10]; thus, every metre of FP is equivalent to 31.87  m of DN 20 slinky-coil.|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{the quality}} of the water under supply, it may need to be treated {{chemically}} to eliminate hardness which induces scale buildup on the inside of the locomotive boiler. The scale which builds up on <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces</b> forms a layer of insulation between the metal and the boiler water.

50|$|At high temperature, organic fluids {{decompose}} into {{lighter and}} heavier fractions {{in a process}} called cracking.

Coolant decomposition increases fouling of the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces</b> - the problems of necessary continuous cleaning and chemical recombination are difficult to solve.

50|$|Water quality {{with high}} RSC index {{is synonymous with}} the soft water quality in {{industrial}} water treatment terminology.

To avoid scaling in water cooled heat exchangers, water is treated by lime and or soda ash to remove the water hardness.|$|E

40|$|Nickel {{and iron}} mixed oxide Abstract. The {{condition}} of a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface</b> with boiling {{is composed of}} three environmental components; high temperature, high pressure and water vapor. In general an autoclave or a high temperature loop system is used for maintaining the required condition. The thermodynamic relationship of chemical reactions states that the free energy difference (∆G) is clearly dependent on the reaction temperature and independent of the reaction pressure if the reaction has no volume change: (∂∆G/∂P) T = ∆V ~ 0. Based on the above relationship, the high-pressure term {{was removed from the}} environmental components of the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface.</b> A vacuum quartz capsule with a moisturized metal oxide powder was used to study the formation of nickel ferrite. The feasibility of this simplified method to simulate a <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface</b> was confirmed by an analysis of the FT-IR spectra and XRD pattern during the transformation of a nickel and iron mixed oxide into nickel ferrite...|$|R
5000|$|Thickness of {{the rising}} film:-The rising film which is formed due to the {{pressure}} of the vapor within the vertical tubes greatly influences the efficiency of the heat transfer. This is because the thickness of the film will affect the heat transfer coefficients as well as the contact area for heat transfer. In relation to this, a thin and long film is favored as it reduces the distance between the two <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This would give higher heat transfer coefficients and overall heat transfer rate.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{reactions}} {{may occur}} on contact {{of the chemical}} species in the process fluid with <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In such cases, the metallic surface sometimes acts as a catalyst. For example, corrosion and polymerization occurs in cooling water for the chemical industry which has a minor content of hydrocarbons. Systems in petroleum processing are prone to polymerization of olefins or deposition of heavy fractions (asphaltenes, waxes, etc.). High tube wall temperatures may lead to carbonizing of organic matter. Food industry, for example milk processing, also experiences fouling problems by chemical reactions.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Characteristics of boiler feedwater== Water has higher heat {{capacity}} {{than most other}} substances. This quality makes it an ideal raw material for boiler operations. Boilers {{are part of a}} closed system as compared to open systems in a gas turbine. The closed system that is used is the Rankine cycle. This means that the water is recirculated throughout the system and is never in contact with the atmosphere. The water is reused and needs to be treated to continue efficient operations. Boiler water must be treated in order to be proficient in producing steam. Boiler water is treated to prevent scaling, corrosion, foaming, and priming. Chemicals are put into boiler water through the chemical feed tank to keep the water within chemical range. These chemicals are mostly oxygen scavengers and phosphates. The boiler water also has frequent blowdowns {{in order to keep the}} chloride content down. The boiler operations also include bottom blows in order to get rid of solids. Scale is precipitated impurities out of the water and then forms on <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This is a problem because scale does not transfer heat very well and causes the tubes to fail by getting too hot. Corrosion is caused by oxygen in the water. The oxygen causes the metal to oxidize which lowers the melting point of the metal. Foaming and priming is caused when the boiler water does not have the correct amount of chemicals and there are suspended solids in the water which carry over in the dry pipe. The dry pipe is where the steam and water mixture are separated.|$|E

In the first stage the commercial plate heat exchanger was investigated, while in the second one – the identical heat exchanger but with the modified <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface.</b> The direct comparison of thermal and flow characteristics between both devices was possible due to the assurance of equivalent conditions during the experiment. Equivalent conditions mean the same volumetric flow rates and the same media’s temperatures at the inlet of heat exchangers in the corresponding measurements’ series. Due to this the systematic experimental data show that larger roughness of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surface</b> leads to an increase of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficient on the side of cooling water (increase by about 30 ÷ 35 %) and simultaneously to an increase of flow resistance (up to 30 % when the volumetric flow rate is equal to 500 l/h).

Electrodes of alternating polarity are embedded within a nonconductive heat transfer wall material and are connected to a high voltage source {{at either end of}} the heat transfer wall material where the heat transfer wall material passes through a tube sheet, fitting or other confinement. When voltage from the high voltage source is applied to the alternating electrodes, electric field gradients are created on both the interior and exterior <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the heat transfer wall material. Regions of intense electric field gradient reside in close proximity to both <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces,</b> thus when nonconductive fluids pass over the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>surfaces,</b> bubbles are repelled from the regions of strong electric field gradients above the electrodes and additional fluid is attracted into these regions.
