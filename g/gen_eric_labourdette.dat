ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF ERIC SHINSEKI TO SPEAK ON SECURITY CHALLENGES FACING POST-CONFLICT DEMOCRACIES AT UGA CONFERENCE ATHENS, Ga. – In a rare public {{speaking}} appearance, former U. S. Army Chief of Staff <b>Gen.</b> <b>Eric</b> Shinseki {{will address the}} security challenges facing post-conflict democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan at a conference {{to be held at}} the University of Georgia on April 16. Shinseki was the first commanding general of NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia. He served in this capacity from 1995 to 1998 and {{played a key role in}} developing the United States’ strategy to stabilize post-conflict democracies worldwide. He served as our country’s Army chief of staff during the recent wars and post-war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. In February 2003, he testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee that securing post-war Iraq would require a peacekeeping force of “several hundred thousand” soldiers. U. S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz commented at the time that Shinseki’s predictions were “wildly off the mark. ” Since his retirement in the summer of 2003, Shinseki has turned down all interview requests from national and international media, including the Sunday morning political talk show circuit. This will be Shinseki’s first {{public speaking}} engagement relating to these matters since his retirement. The conference, From Autocracy to Democracy: the Effort to Establish Market Democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan, will provide a comprehensive analysis of the legal, political, economic and security issues facing post-war Iraq and Afghanistan. It will start at 9 : 00 a. m. and conclude at 6 : 00 p. m. The conference’s keynote address, to be delivered by Shinseki, will begin at 11 : 00 a. m. in the UGA Chapel. Other speakers at the conference will include: Establishing the Rule of Law Panel · Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, University of Virginia School of Law, will discuss post-war legal development in Iraq. · Scott Carlson, U. S. Sentencing Commission, will discuss post-conflict conciliation and criminal justice. · Mariam Nawabi, Embassy of Afghanistan, will address post-war legal development in Afghanistan.

Building the Institutions of the Nation Panel · Louis Aucoin, Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, who is spearheading a comparative analysis of various nations’ constitution-writing efforts commissioned by the U. S. Institute of Peace, will speak on constitution-writing in post-conflict societies. · Ambassador Karl Inderfurth, the former U. S. assistant secretary of state for south Asian affairs, will discuss the specific challenges of establishing free and transparent governmental institutions in Afghanistan and Iraq. · Howard Wiarda, UGA School of Public and International Affairs, will discuss the fundamentals of nation-building.
