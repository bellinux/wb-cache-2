5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during <b>dry</b> <b>weather.</b> In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during <b>dry</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite the scuffle, Eliza {{was part}} of the royal party who {{accompanied}} Lunalilo when he sailed to Kailua-Kona, in November 1873, the following month, {{in the hope that the}} <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> would improve his tuberculosis. However, the trip had no lasting effect on Lunalilo's health. After returning to Honolulu, Lunalilo succumbed to the disease and died on February 3, 1874.|$|E
5|$|Matthew {{produced}} moderate rainfall on its west side, as well. Portions of Texas and Oklahoma experienced over 5inches (127mm) of rain, while southern Arkansas received over 10inches (255mm) of rainfall. The rainfall was well-received due to {{a period}} of <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> in the area. Though it slowed harvest activities, it aided pastures.Rainfall patches left in Matthew's reached {{as far north as}} Northeastern Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC +1) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. Zonta set the fastest time of the session, a 1:26.448, six hundredths of a second faster than Häkkinen, in second place. Michael Schumacher had the third fastest time, ahead of Coulthard in fourth and Verstappen in fifth, with Salo {{rounding}} out the top six.|$|E

40|$|Nesolycaena medicea Braby is {{recorded}} breeding on Boronia eriantha Lindl. (Rutaceae) in the sandstone gorges of The White Mountains in inland northern Queensland. Larval and pupal durations are short during summer but pupae enter diapause {{with the onset}} of cooler, <b>drier</b> <b>weather.</b> Comments are made on adult variation...|$|R
50|$|Warmer and <b>drier</b> <b>weather</b> {{conditions}} were experienced during winter and extended into 2015, {{due to a}} developing El Niño event. Sydney was on track to record its hottest autumn on record and only had one fifth of the average rainfall in May. Adelaide recorded sixteen consecutive days of 20 C in May 2014.|$|R
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in <b>dry</b> <b>weather.</b> Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. <b>Dry</b> <b>weather</b> leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn earworm populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E
5|$|The dam and reservoir, {{along with}} other {{treatment}} structures built at and below the mine, have successfully reduced the <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> pollution of Spring Creek by up to ninety-five percent. Problems, though, still occur mainly {{in the form of}} large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir. Several concerns about the structural integrity and safety of the dam, both physically and biologically, arose in the 1990s. Emergency releases from Shasta Lake, often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water, have occurred {{from time to time to}} dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage.|$|E
50|$|This {{proposed}} {{timing is}} coincidental with the Fringillinae finches’ radiation starting time {{and also with}} the biggest Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau uplift, triggered by the Indian tectonic plate strongest collision; this established present day southern Asia monsoon regime and other drastic climatic changes, like <b>drier</b> <b>weather</b> in the Tibetan Plateau and Chinese deserts.|$|R

50|$|During El Niño, Alabama {{receives}} {{colder than}} average winter temperatures with wetter than average conditions {{along the southern}} {{parts of the state}} and drier than average conditions in the northern parts. La Niña brings warmer than average temperatures with the <b>drier</b> <b>weather</b> in the southern parts of the state due to a northern storm track.|$|R
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in cool and <b>dry</b> <b>weather.</b> Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his good performance, setting a time of 1:22.855 despite going into the gravel after braking too deep and also drove the spare Ferrari. Häkkinen was the second-fastest driver; Barrichello was third and Coulthard rounded out the top four. After the session ended, Arrows withdrew their appeal after they accepted the FIA's findings and de la Rosa was required {{to start at the}} back of the field.|$|E
5|$|The outflow {{from the}} works, which passes under the River Don Navigation and joins the river beside Jordans weir, {{has in the}} past been a major {{contributor}} to the pollution of the River Don, but some £70 million has been invested in upgrading the plant, to ensure that discharges to the river meet the requirements of the Freshwater Fish Directive. In <b>dry</b> <b>weather,</b> the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river at this point.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and <b>dry</b> <b>weather</b> through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that had been prepared for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire-fighting effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for the fire, and one Frenchman, Robert Hubert, was hanged {{on the basis of a}} false confession even though he had no hand in starting the fire.|$|E
5000|$|The wind, {{which often}} blows from {{southeast}} is called [...] "koshava". Košava blows from Montenegro {{for one to}} seven days (or even longer) with a speed of 100 km/h. It is most frequent in spring and autumn. Northern wind is dry, like koshava, but much colder. It comes in winter months and brings the coldest and <b>driest</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{outlined}} process {{shows the}} steps taken to evaluate extreme fire hazard for Pinnacles National Monument. These preliminary steps {{were taken to}} designate areas with an extreme fire rating. 1) Assign an ISFL Fuel Model to all areas within the Monument boundary. 2) Redo present fuel model and convert information into a GIS shapefile. 3) Categorize all lands within the NPS boundary according to slope. 4) Categorize all lands within the NPS boundary according to aspect. 5) Determine 90 th percent hottest, <b>driest</b> <b>weather</b> conditions for the study area coming from representative weather station (WIMS data). 6) Adjust those 90 th percent weather conditions for aspects and slopes not representative of weather station. 7) Evaluate fireline intensity into a GIS shapefile at 90 th percent hottest, <b>driest</b> <b>weather</b> for all fuel models, slope, aspect combinations. 8) Convert estimated fireline intensity information into extreme fire hazard GIS shapefile...|$|R
5|$|During El Niño events, {{winter and}} early spring {{temperatures}} are cooler than average with above average precipitation {{in the central}} and eastern {{parts of the state}} and <b>drier</b> <b>weather</b> in the western part. La Niña usually brings warmer than average temperatures with above average precipitation {{in the western part of}} the state while the central and coastal regions stay drier than average.|$|R
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with <b>dry</b> <b>weather.</b> These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in <b>dry</b> <b>weather.</b> Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, the eastern United States {{experienced}} generally hot and <b>dry</b> <b>weather,</b> leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was {{in contrast to the}} federally funded Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River.|$|E
