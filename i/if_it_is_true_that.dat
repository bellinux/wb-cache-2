5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some argue that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that,</b> {{as he has been}} told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E

He challenges theological fatalists to show how the addition of God's knowing some future-tense statement to be true adds anything essential to the problem over and above that statement's being true.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, {{we believe}} that {{individuals}} like to view themselves as noble by offering help. This concept {{is related to the}} notion of self-awareness. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> people focus on the impression they make on others, then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other. However, being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness. In fact, in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous. According to Dr. van Bommel, by introducing an accountability cue, the aim is to eliminate feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help.|$|E
25|$|It {{was rather}} {{unlikely}} that Caroline Austen would address the Chief Justice Lefroy as only 'Tom Lefroy' (she indeed addressed {{him as the}} still living 'Chief Justice in the later part of the letter). However, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the original Tom Lefroy purchased the Cadell letter after Jane's death, {{it is possible that}} he later handed it over to Thomas Edward Preston Lefroy (T.E.P. Lefroy; husband of Jemima Lefroy who was the daughter of Anna Austen Lefroy and Benjamin Lefroy). T.E.P. Lefroy later would give Cadell's letter to Caroline for reference. Cadell & Davies firm was closed down in 1836 after the death of Thomas Cadell Jr. The sale of Cadell's papers took place in 1840, possibly in November.|$|E

Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard said after the match, [...] "He {{did not want to}} come on; I don't know why." [...] Ronaldinho was critical of Eto'o's actions, saying that Eto'o was not putting the team first, but Eto'o rebutted the comment, claiming that he did not come on because he did not have enough time to warm up properly. Three months later, Eto'o said, [...] "These kind of things are usually just speculation and don't come through to me. However, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> I am a problem for my team then I will go. But like I said, I am happy here. The press can write what they want." [...] Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto'o and Ronaldinho.|$|E

John Calvin [...] "can be regarded as occupying a position roughly midway between" [...] the doctrines of Martin Luther on one hand and Huldrych Zwingli on the other.

For why should the Lord put in your hand the symbol of his body, unless it was to assure you that you really participate in it? And <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> a visible sign is given to us to seal the gift of an invisible thing, when we have received the symbol of the body, let us rest assured that the body itself is also given to us." ...|$|E

After failing to obtain £100 from Michelle, Dennis tells Louise about Michelle and Preston's relationship, while Bex and Preston decide to make their relationship official. Louise tells Bex that Michelle and Preston are having sex but Bex refuses to believe it, but when she sees Preston {{put his hand on}} Michelle's shoulder and Michelle flinch, Bex publicly asks <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> Michelle is having sex with her boyfriend. Louise reveals the truth and Martin attacks Preston and disowns Michelle. A drunk Michelle frantically tries to find Preston, getting into Phil's car having taken sleeping pills. Speeding around the square, Michelle is shocked to see Preston, who jumps {{out of the way of}} the car and as she swerves, she crashes into the chip shop where Kathy and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) are. Michelle is rushed to hospital, where she needs an operation after rupturing her spleen. She is later discharged but is angered upon learning that Sharon has convinced Preston to return to the States. Michelle decides to return to the States but Sharon convinces her to attend the police station to be interviewed over the crash. The police say that the CPS will assess if she should be charged with an offence, confiscating her passport so she cannot leave the country.|$|E

2500|$|In {{their book}} Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics, James B. Jacobs and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime {{legislation}} for exacerbating conflicts between groups. [...] They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, {{rather than as}} being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as [...] "hate crimes" [...] causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime. Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced. Some have argued that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> all violent crimes {{are the result of}} the perpetrator's contempt for the victim, then all crimes are hate crimes. Thus, if there is no alternate rationale for prosecuting some people more harshly for the same crime based on who the victim is, then different defendants are treated unequally under the law, which violates the United States Constitution. American forensic psychologist Karen Franklin said that the term hate crime is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes {{may not be the best}} remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts. [...] Some on the political left have been critical of hate crime laws for expanding the criminal justice system and dealing with violence against minority groups through punitive measures.|$|E
