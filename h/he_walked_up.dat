5|$|On 19 December 1914, near Givenchy, {{during a}} night attack, Lt. Bruce was {{in command of}} a small party which {{captured}} one of the enemy's trenches. In spite of being severely wounded in the neck, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> and down the trench, encouraging his men to hold on against several counter-attacks for some hours until killed. The fire from rifles and bombs was very heavy all day, and {{it was due to}} the skilful disposition made, and the example and encouragement shown by Lt. Bruce that his men were able to hold out until dusk, when the trench was finally captured by the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{was sent}} off in an {{incident}} against Hansa Rostock on 3 March 2001. With his Bayern Munich team losing 2–3 {{in the final}} minutes, he sneaked into the area during a corner kick, jumped up, and punched {{the ball into the}} opponent’s net. He immediately received a red card, which dismissed him from the game. He was named man of the match when {{he was part of the}} squad which played the 2001 Champions League title against Valencia. He played an important role in the penalty shoot-out held after the teams remained tied 1–1 after extra time, making three saves. He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match, after <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to a disappointed Santiago Cañizares, the opposition goalkeeper, after the penalty shoot-out and attempted to comfort him. The same year, Bayern Munich won the International Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors. But the team failed to win the UEFA Super Cup a couple of months earlier.|$|E

25|$|On 1 April 1818 {{a retired}} officer on half-pay, Lieutenant Davies, {{who had a}} {{grievance}} about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mad, shot Palmerston as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the stairs of the War Office. However, the bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After Palmerston learned that Davies was mad, he paid for his legal defence at the trial (Davies was sent to Bedlam).|$|E
25|$|Wolfe {{returned}} to the Montmorency camp on 26 July. Escorted by two battalions, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the Montmorency river to reconnoiter the French lines. At about five kilometres (3.1mi) from the river's mouth, he observed a ford allowing the easy crossing from the west shore to the east shore. This discovery {{was followed by a}} solid skirmish between British soldiers, attempting to cross, and French soldiers entrenched on the other side. The British reported 45 killed and wounded.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{immediately}} clear what happened next, although at some point, Bryant reloaded his weapon. Bryant {{walked back to}} the café and then returned to the gift shop, this time looking down to another corner of the shop where he found several people hiding in the corner. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to them and shot Ronald Jary through the neck, then Peter Nash and Pauline Masters, killing all three. He did not see Carolyn Nash, who was lying under her husband. Bryant aimed his gun at an unidentified Asian man, but the rifle's magazine was empty. Bryant then quickly moved to the gift shop counter, where he reloaded his rifle, leaving an empty magazine on the service counter, and left the building.|$|E

25|$|In September 1826, Lovejoy {{graduated}} from Waterville College with first-class honors {{at the top}} of his class. During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy. Dissatisfied with daily teaching, Lovejoy thought about moving to the South or Western United States. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West. Agreeing, Lovejoy in May 1827 moved to Boston to earn money for his journey, having settled on Illinois as his destination. Unsuccessful at finding work, he started to Illinois by foot. He stopped in New York City in mid-June, to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the Saturday Evening Gazette as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> and down streets, knocking on peoples' doors and wheedling passersby, in hopes of getting them to subscribe to the newspaper. Struggling with his finances, he wrote to Jeremiah Chaplin, the president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student so needed. Lovejoy promptly embarked on his journey to Illinois, reaching Hillsboro, Montgomery County, in the fall of 1827. Lovejoy did not think he could do well in Illinois's scantly settled land, so he headed for St. Louis.|$|E
500|$|From Monday to Saturday <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> {{and down}} the street until 6:30 pm, reduced to four days a week from 1985. Saturday evenings were spent with the cinema crowds in Leicester Square. He would go to bed at 12:30 am after saying a prayer. [...] "Quite a good prayer, unselfish too", he told the Sunday Times. [...] "It is a sort of {{acknowledgment}} of God, just in case there happens to be one." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller {{continued}} his battle with Hutton and Compton, although he resorted to bowling off spin from a shorter run to conserve energy {{late in the}} day. Hutton hit three fours in quick succession from Miller’s bowling to reach his fifty. The paceman responded to the spate of boundaries by reverting to pace and bowling a series of bouncers, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left (front) arm. The batsmen survived, but the bowler received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his barrage of short-pitched bowling. Some of the spectators shouted [...] "Bodyline". Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. Hutton responded by glancing Miller for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 2/121 at stumps on the third day, with Hutton and Compton still at the crease. Miller was jeered and heckled {{as he left the}} field at the end of play. The crowd surged towards him as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the steps into the dressing room, but there was no altercation. O'Reilly later defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that his field settings were less intimidatory than those of Bodyline.|$|E

500|$|Hutton then leg glanced Miller, before cover {{driving and}} square cutting him in another over. All three shots went for four {{and he reached}} his fifty in 110 minutes. Miller responded to the spate of {{boundaries}} {{with a series of}} bouncers, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his short-pitched barrage, including shouts of [...] "Bodyline". The original practitioners of Bodyline, Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, were both from Nottinghamshire and played at Trent Bridge, and were later excluded from selection for England after being blamed for the ill-feeling caused by Bodyline. The Nottinghamshire supporters were still angry with how their players had been removed and were not happy that Miller was able to do something they saw to be equivalent. For his part, Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. However, Hutton had the last word, glancing Miller down to fine leg for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 121/2, with Hutton and Compton on 63 and 36 respectively. Miller was widely jeered and heckled as he walked off the field, and the crowded surged towards him as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> the steps into the dressing room. O'Reilly defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that he had not employed a packed leg side field and had allowed the batsman the opportunity to score from hook and pull shots if he was willing to try; in contrast the packed Bodyline field meant batsmen would find little reward for such shots and defensive play would only lead to dismissal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{technique}} of angiography itself was first developed in 1927 by the Portuguese physician Egas Moniz at the University of Lisbon for cerebral angiography, the viewing of brain vasculature by X-ray radiation {{with the aid}} of a contrast medium introduced by catheter. [...] Cardiac catheterization was first performed when Werner Forssmann, in 1929, created an incision in one of his left antecubital veins and inserted a catheter into his venous system. [...] He then guided the catheter by fluoroscopy into his right atrium. [...] Subsequently, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> a flight of stairs to the radiology department and documented the procedure by having a chest roentgenogram performed. [...] Over the next year, catheters were placed in a similar manner into the right ventricle, and measurements of pressure and cardiac output (using the Fick principle) were performed.|$|E

Tebbit held aloft {{a copy of the}} Treaty and asked the conference a series of questions about the Treaty: did they want to see a single currency or be citizens of a European Union? The audience shouted back [...] "No!" [...] after each question. Tebbit received a tumultuous standing ovation and walked into the centre of the conference hall waving amongst the cheers.

2500|$|After {{four years}} Wingate left Charterhouse and in 1921 he was {{accepted}} at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, the Royal Artillery's officers' training school. For committing a minor offence against the rules, a first-year student would {{be subjected to}} a ragging ritual named [...] "running". [...] This ritual consisted of the first-year being stripped and forced to run a gauntlet of senior students, all of whom wielded a knotted towel which was used to hit the accused on his journey along the line. On reaching the end, the first-year would then be thrown into an icy-cold cistern of water. When {{it came time for}} Wingate to run the gauntlet, for allegedly having returned a horse to the stables too late, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> to the senior student {{at the head of the}} gauntlet, stared at him and dared him to strike.
