In order to promote the implementation of these measures, the Tariff Code establishes that the implementation costs of a measure {{and half of the}} net benefits will be reflected in the SEP supply tariffs. In this paper we analyze different criteria for valuing DSM measures, evaluating its effect in benefit cost ratio of the measures, in its merit order, in the total benefits value and, lastly, in the value that will be accepted in the SEP supply tariffs.

Using field work data we examine whether homebuyers willingness to pay is influenced by the biological condition of the neighboring riparian habitat and how homebuyers value alternative manmade green areas, specifically golf courses. We also explore the relationship between the field data and remote sensing vegetation indices. The results of a hedonic analysis of houses that sold within 0. 2 miles of 51 stratified-random selected riparian survey sites in Tucson, Arizona reveals that homebuyers significantly value habitat quality and negatively value manmade park-like features.

40|$|The {{increasing}} cost of energy, {{coupled with}} the recent drive for energy security and climate change mitigation have provided the impetus for harnessing renewable energy sources as viable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. Furthermore, recovering heat that is discharged from power plants, automobiles and various other industrial processes is of growing interest. Nevertheless, technologies attempting to provide small-scale heat recovery solutions have seen very limited commercialization. This is broadly due to two reasons: lack of historical research and development {{in the area of}} waste-heat recovery and small-scale power generation due to technical and cost impediments; and technical challenges associated with scaling the technology from utility-scale to commercial-scale, particularly with regard to expansion machines (turbines). However, due to rising primary energy costs and the <b>environmental</b> <b>premium</b> being placed on fossil fuels, the conversion from low-grade heat to electrical energy as well as small-scale distributed power generation is of increasing interest. In this regard, this project focuses on a novel rotating spool expansion machine at the heart of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which in turn is used as a heat recovery system. A comprehensive simulation model of the rotating spool expander is presented. The spool expander provides a new rotating expansion mechanism with easily manufactured components. Apart from efficiency improvements compared with other rotary machines, the spool expander also has the ability to control the expansion ratio using a novel mechanically-driven suction valve mechanism. Another advantage is the relocation of the face sealing surfaces to the outer radius of the device. The spool expander is also scalable to a size range (50 - 200 kW) that is too large for conventional positive displacement machines, and too small for dynamic machines with respect to manufacturability, efficiency and cost. A detailed analytical geometry model of the spool expander and the suction valve mechanism is presented. This geometry model forms a part of a comprehensive model that includes submodels for friction, leakage, and heat transfer. The results of the comprehensive model are validated using experimental data from a 50 kW prototype expander in an ORC system. Given the promise of the technology, this paper explores the design space using both a simulation based approach as well as an experimental prototype for concept validation...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in energy demand in Chile requires a choice for additional production between different kinds of energy sources currently available to the country. Current projects to develop large dams for hydropower in Chilean Patagonia impose an environmental price by damaging the natural environment. The increased use of fossil fuels {{on the other hand}} entails an environmental price related to emissions and global warming. This paper studies the debate on the future energy supply in Chile by investigating the preferences of households for different energy sources (fossil fuels, large hydropower in Chilean Patagonia and renewable energy). The paper also aims to value the externalities associated to these traditional methods of energy generation. Using the Contingent Valuation method, the willingness to pay for renewable energy sources over the other alternatives is elicited. Results suggest a strong preference for renewable sources with almost equally large environmental prices imposed by consumers on electricity from large dams and thermoelectric sources.

40|$|ABSTRACT:Pricing for an {{insurance}} policy {{can be described as}} the process of calculation of expected compensation to be paid to property losers as well as associated costs of potential risks. Loss forecast is accurate if the risks will be identified appropriately in order to calculate the frequency and expected severity of losses. This is particularly important about environmental risks since most of them appear in the long run. Environmental risk assessment model is both able to estimate the <b>environmental</b> liability <b>premium</b> for <b>environmental</b> pollution and degradation, and it can play a valuable role in promoting this industry. ELIS (Environmental Liability Insurance) software calculates the environmental risk number in industry sector and insurance charges for events resulting in environmental pollution.

The user selects the type of project, and input the descriptive information concerning the occurrence of possible environmental pollutions. The model calculates risk numbers, the type of accidents, classification and weighting of severity of environmental impacts, risk priority numbers (RPN); pollutant volume and environmental sensitivity, environmental cost of contaminates, and finally Net premium for Possible Accidents. The case study indicated the applicability of then model. For this case an oil refinery in Iran was selected with a capacity of 85, 000. barrels of refined oil per day.

Potential methods for environmental improvement range from regulation to market solutions. This study looks at consumer willingness to pay for pork products with embedded environmental attributes. Experimental auctions showed that over one-half of the participants (62 %) paid a premium that did not vary significantly between differing regions of the United States. For the entire group, the average premium paid for the most environmental 2 -lb package of pork loin chops was $. 94; a premium of 22 %. When evaluated for the premium payers (the 62 %), the premium was $ 1. 60 per package; a premium of 37 %. Results show that participants {{were willing to pay}} higher prices for pork products produced in systems with improved <b>environmental</b> attributes. The <b>premium</b> for products with embedded multienvironmental attributes was significantly greater than for those with single environmental attributes. The level of willingness to pay did not vary significantly across regions for the most environmental package. Participants also were willing to pay more for the product with improved surface water, groundwater, and odor emissions than for the product with just two of these attributes. Thus, it appears that the product with the greatest chance of success is one that has all three attributes embedded. For the most <b>environmental</b> package, bid <b>premiums</b> did not differ significantly between areas studied. Moreover, the percentage of participants paying selected premium levels did not vary between regions. For example, for the triple attribute product, 62 % of the participants indicated a willingness to pay a premium. This ranged from 56 to 67 % percent across the study area. This paper shows that there is an opportunity to develop a market for products that embody environmental attributes. Consumers are concerned about the environment and are willing to pay more for products that are produced in a way that reduces environmental impact. This research suggests that as the industry develops methods that help sustain or improve the environment, there is a segment of society that will support a market for such products...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} for the Israeli Government and includes an updated cost evaluation, configuration optimization, and mode of operation, for a 100 MWe solar power plant, {{the first of}} five similar plants to be erected at one location. Regarding the preferred technology, the central receiver concept, although potentially more efficient then trough since it fits into a combined cycle plant- is neither technologically mature enough nor proven for commercial application. The Fresnel concept is in a similar development stage. The trough technology, used for the SEGS plants, is the only mature and proven technology ready for application today. The current trough plants use the solar steam to directly drive the turbine at 371 oC, due to the thermal oil limitations. This paper analyzes the option of further superheating the steam to 540 oC- the optimal temperature for commercial steam turbine. Higher cycle efficiency improves the plant cost effectiveness, since a smaller solar field is required. Solar fraction reduction can be compensated by thermal storage. The power cost is evaluated {{as a function of}} the solar fraction, for several operational modes. High solar fraction would increase the power cost significantly. Since the solar plant power generation largely overlaps the hours of high demand, and consequently high power cost-the plant becomes marginally economical for Israel at its present power cost level. The expected increase in power cost would make thus plant even more economically attractive. With the <b>environmental</b> and location <b>premium,</b> the plant becomes economical at the current power tariff.

40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was {{originally}} {{seen as an}} instrument with a bilateral character where an entity from an industrialised country invests in a project in a developing country (DC). Also, multilateral funds were envisaged that would bundle investments to spread project risks. The sluggish implementation of incentives for industrialised country companies to embark on CDM projects and low carbon prices led to a preference of just buying Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) instead of investing in projects. Thus a third option has gained prominence - the unilateral option where the project development is planned and financed within the DC. We propose that a project should be called "pure unilateral" if it involves no foreign direct investment (FDI), only has {{the approval of the}} Designated National Authority (DNA) of the host country and sells its CERs after certification directly to an industrialised country. Unilateral projects can become attractive if the host country risk premium for foreign investors is high despite a high human, institutional and infrastructure capacity and domestic capital availability. Moreover, transaction costs can be reduced compared to foreign investments that have to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. On the other hand, technology transfer is likely to be lower, capacity building has to be done by the host country and all risks have to be carried by host country entities. The potential to carry out unilateral CDM projects strongly varies among DCs. Whereas several countries from Asia and Latin America might well be able to design projects autonomously, most of the Sub-Saharan countries rely on foreign support. International donors of capacity building grants should increasingly address those DCs that are not in the focus of foreign investors and support them in the design of projects.

40|$|Brownfields {{redevelopment}} {{has been}} encouraged by governments or {{the real estate}} market because of economic, social and environmental benefits. However, uncertainties in contaminated land redevelopment may cause massive investment risk and need to be managed so that contaminated land redevelopment is facilitated. This study was designed to address hydrogeological as well as economic uncertainty in a hypothetical contaminated land redevelopment project and manage the risk from these uncertainties through the integration of the hydrogeological and economic uncertainties. Hydrogeological uncertainty is derived from incomplete site information, including aquifer heterogeneity, and must be assessed with scientific expertise, given the short history of redevelopment projects and their unique hydrogeological characteristics. Hydrogeological uncertainty has not yet been incorporated in one framework with the economic uncertainty that has been relatively well observed in financial markets. Two cases of Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) contamination were simulated using a physically-based hydrogeological model to address hydrogeological uncertainty: one concerns the effect of an ethanol spill on a light NAPL (LNAPL) contaminated area in the vadose zone, and the other is regarding the vapour phase intrusion of volatile organic compounds, in particular, Trichloroethylene (TCE), a dense NAPL (DNAPL), into indoor air through a variably saturated heterogeneous aquifer. The first simulation replicated experimental observations in the laboratory, such as the capillary fringe depressing and the NAPL pool remobilizing and collecting in a reduced area exhibiting higher saturations than observed prior to an ethanol injection. However, the data gap, in particular, on the chemical properties between the model and the experiment caused the uncertainty in the model simulation. The second NAPL simulation has been performed based on a hypothetical scenario where new dwellings in a redeveloped area have the potential risk of vapour phase intrusion from a subsurface source into indoor air because remediation or foundation design might fail. The simulation results indicated that the aquifer heterogeneity seemed the most significant factor controlling the indoor air exposure risk from a TCE source in the saturated zone. Then, the exposure risk was quantified using Monte Carlo simulations with 50 statistically equivalent heterogeneous aquifer permeability fields. The quantified risk (probability) represents the hydrogeological uncertainty in the scenario and gives the information on loss occurrence intensity of redevelopment failure. Probability of failure (or loss occurrence intensity) was integrated with cost of failure (or loss magnitude) to evaluate the risk capital in the hypothetical brownfields redevelopment project. The term “risk capital” is adopted from financial literature and is the capital you can lose from high risk investment. Cost of failure involves economic uncertainty and can be defined based on a developer’s financial agreement with new dwellers to prevent litigation in the case of certain events, such as an environmental event where indoor air concentrations of pollutants exceed regulatory limits during periodic inspections. The developer makes such a financial agreement with new dwellers because new dwellings have been constructed founded on flawed site information, and municipalities may require it if a land use planning approval is required. An agreement was presumed that the developer would repurchase the affected houses from new dwellers immediately, if indoor air contamination exceeded the regulatory limit. Furthermore, the developer would remediate any remaining contamination, demolish the affected houses and build new houses if they were worth investing in. With this financial plan assumed, the stochastic housing price, stochastic inflation rate and stochastic interest rate have been considered to cause the uncertainty in the cost of failure, and the information on these stochastic variables was obtained from the financial market due to its long history of observations. This research reviewed appropriate risk capital valuation methods for hydrogeologists to apply straightforwardly to their projects, with integrating probability of failure (hydrogeological uncertainty) and cost of failure (economic uncertainty). The risk capital is essentially the probability of failure times the cost of failure with safety loading added to compensate investors against hydrogeological and financial uncertainty. Fair market prices of risk capital have been valuated using financial mathematics and actuarial premium calculations, and each method has a specific safety loading term to reflect investors’ level of risk aversion. Risk capital results indicated that the price of the risk capital was much more sensitive to hydrogeological uncertainty than financial uncertainty. Developers can manage the risk capital by saving a contingency fee for future events or paying an insurance premium, given that the price of this risk capital is the price of a contingent claim, subsequent to failure in remediation or in foundation design, and equivalent to an <b>environmental</b> insurance <b>premium</b> if there is an insurance company to indemnify the liability for the developer. The optimal framework of investment strategy in brownfields redevelopment can be built by linkage of addressing and integrating uncertainties and valuating risk capital from the uncertainties. This framework involves balancing the costs associated with each step while maximizing a net profit from land redevelopment. The optimal investment strategy, such as if or when to remediate or redevelop and to what degree, is given when the future price of the land minus time and material costs as well as the contingency fee or insurance premium maximizes a net profit...|$|R
40|$|Forest-derived methane may {{contribute}} significantly to a vehicle fleet independent of fossil fuels by 2030. At present, there is sufficient technical knowledge about energy conversion methods and several Swedish actors have investigated and prepared investments in production facilities, but the technology is not commercially mature yet and it needs support during a development period. Investments in the technology have become less favorable because of the drop in the oil price in 2014. In addition, the predictability of the policy instruments supporting production and use of renewable energy are perceived as low by investors. This report emphasize that these factors combined are major reasons why potential investments are postponed. We have conducted a literature study and an interview study with three industry actors {{to answer the question}} “How can forest derived methane complement biogas from anaerobic digestion in the Swedish transport sector?” Interviews were mostly conducted in situ and in co-operation with the f 3 project “Examining systemic constraints and drivers for production of forest-derived transport biofuels” (f 3 2014 - 002370). The literature study included the recent development of renewable transport fuels in Sweden, existing and proposed policy instruments, and possible technical pathways from forest biomass to transport fuels. Sweden has accomplished a high share of renewables in the transport sector – 12 % based on energy content or 17 % when accounting in accordance with the EU Renewable Energy Sources Directive (RES). Thus, Sweden has the highest share of renewables in the transport sector among the member states and has with a good margin accomplished the EU-RES target of 10 % renewables by 2020. The use of electricity in plug-in electric vehicles is not included in these figures and the number of electric vehicles is increasing rapidly. The most common biofuels in transport are biodiesel, ethanol, and biogas. Biodiesel increases rapidly, mainly through low blend-in, and is now the most common biofuel in the Swedish transport sector. The majority is HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils), but the share of FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) is still considerable. The use of ethanol peaked during 2008 and has been decreasing since then. Ethanol is distributed through both low and high blend-in (E 5 and E 85). The use of upgraded biogas in the transport sector has increased continuously since its introduction 1996. Upgraded biogas is complemented by natural gas to meet the vehicle gas demand. A voluntary agreement among the distributors maintains a minimum biogas share that corresponds to 50 %. The biogas share is much higher today (74 % by volume, average Jan. -Aug. 2015) and some large end-users use pure upgraded biogas. Upgraded biogas is mainly distributed in compressed form through gas cylinders (79 %), but also through injection to the natural gas grid (21 %). Very little biogas is distributed in liquid form (LBG). Studies of the practical production potential shows that the current vehicle gas demand could be met entirely with upgraded biogas. However, an increased demand will eventually require other production pathways based on other feedstocks. Gasification of forest biomass is one such pathway. One alternative is that an increased demand is met with natural gas, resulting in fossil lock-in effects. Another alternative is a stagnated vehicle gas market. Production of upgraded biogas and use in the transport sector have been promoted in different ways, e. g., demand on handling of waste that will promote anaerobic digestion, investment support to production facilities, support to distribution infrastructure, <b>environmental</b> car <b>premiums,</b> and exemptions of energy and CO 2 taxes. The tax exemptions are only granted until the end of 2015 but the Swedish government has applied for permission to the European Commission for a tax exemption until the end of 2020. A biofuel may only be compensated to a certain level to comply with rules set by the European Commission. If the renewable alternative is cheaper because of tax exemptions or tax reductions it is considered as overcompensation and illegal state aid and the compensation has to be adjusted. This has in Sweden occurred for FAME, E 5 and E 85, but since the cost for biogas is almost twice that of natural gas, it is not likely that the tax exemptions for biogas will be considered as illegal state aid.   Among the suggested policy instruments in the FFF inquiry are the price premium model and the quota obligation. The government prepared for a quota obligation but it was later withdrawn because the European Commission considered it as illegal state aid when combined with Sweden´s current CO 2 tax. These changes decrease the predictability for potential investors. The actors that we have interviewed propose different policy instruments to promote production of transport fuels from forest biomass: the price premium model, a quota obligation, or a system inspired by the tradable green certificate system. However, more important than the type of policy instrument is that the support is substantial and predictable during the pay back period of the investment. There is a large potential in forest biomass for transport fuel production in Sweden. Different pathways, which result in different transport fuels, compete not only for the feedstock and the end-users, but also for financing, research & development funds, and the policy makers’ attention. This study suggests that: In order to attract investments in forest-derived methane, the vehicle gas market must continue to increase.   Increased policy support directed at the demand may be needed. This is because the gasification technology is sensitive to economies of scale {{and the size of the}} facilities that have been considered are equivalent to the entire market for upgraded biogas. To invest in such a facility implies too large a risk given the size of the current demand and the uncertainties of the future market. If methane should be able to play an increasingly important role in a future transportation sector, the gasification technology need policy support during a development period. The predictability of policy support is perceived as low. The predictability is more important than the specific type of policy instrument to attract investments. The interviewees in this report suggest the following policy instruments for the support of forest-derived methane: the price premium model, a quota obligation, or a system inspired by the tradable green certificate system. The current low oil price decreases the likelihood for investments. Policy instruments that compensate for the oil price risk are needed, e. g. the price premium model. Swedish industry actors can realize the potential in forest biomass through production of transport fuels if beneficial conditions are given. Such a development does not only contribute to a vehicle fleet independent of fossil fuels but also to regional development. QC 20160229 </p...|$|R
