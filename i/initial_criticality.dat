50|$|The Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station is {{a nuclear}} power plant on the shore of Lake Erie near Monroe, in Frenchtown Charter Township, Michigan on {{approximately}} 1,000 acres. All units of the plant are operated by the DTE Energy Electric Company and owned (100 percent) by parent company DTE Energy. It is approximately halfway between Detroit, Michigan, and Toledo, Ohio. It is also visible from parts of Amherstburg and Colchester, Ontario {{as well as on the}} shore of Lake Erie in Ottawa County, Ohio. Two units have been constructed on this site. The first unit's construction started on August 4, 1956 and reached <b>initial</b> <b>criticality</b> on August 23, 1963, and the second unit received its construction permit on September 26, 1972. It reached criticality (head on) in June 21, 1985 and was declared commercial on November 18, 1988. The plant is connected to two single-circuit 345 kV Transmission Lines and 3 120 kV lines.

5000|$|MH-1A: 10 MW electric, plus {{fresh water}} {{supply to the}} {{adjacent}} base. Mounted on the Sturgis, a barge (no propulsion systems) converted from a Liberty ship, and moored in the Panama Canal Zone. <b>Initial</b> <b>criticality</b> at Ft. Belvoir (in Gunston Cove, off the Potomac River), January 24, 1967. It {{was the last of}} the eight plants to permanently cease operation. The MH-1A was designed by Martin Marietta Corporation. It remained moored at Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal from 1968 until 1977, when it was towed back to Ft. Belvoir for decommissioning. It was moved to the James River Reserve Fleet in 1978 for an expected 50 years of SAFSTOR. This reactor used low-enrichment uranium (LEU) in the range of 4 to 7 percent. The MH-1A had an elaborate analog-computer-powered simulator installed at the Training Division, USAERG, Ft. Belvoir. The MH-1A simulator was obtained by Memphis State University Center for Nuclear Studies in the early 1980s, but was never restored or returned to operational service. Its fate is unknown after the Center for Nuclear Studies closed.|$|E
5000|$|SM-1: 2 MW electric. Fort Belvoir, Virginia, <b>Initial</b> <b>criticality</b> April 8, 1957 (several {{months before}} the Shippingport Reactor) and the first U.S. nuclear power plant to be {{connected}} to an electrical grid. Used primarily for training and testing, rather than power generation for Ft. Belvoir. The plant was designed by the American Locomotive Company (renamed ALCO Products, in 1955), and was the first reactor developed under the Army Nuclear Power Program. See the SM-1 image gallery, below. This plant was a tri-service training facility, with both the US Navy and Air Force sending personnel to be trained on shore-based facilities (the Navy had a different stand-alone program for ship-based nuclear power, which is still in operation). The SM-1 and associated training facilities at Ft. Belvoir were the only training facility for shore-based military power plants. The plant cooled its condensers using the waters of the Potomac River. For about the first 10 years of its operation, the SM-1 unknowingly released tritium into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, until the development of the Packard Tri-Carb detector, which was the first detector system capable of detecting the low-energy beta decay of tritium. The instrumentation in the SM-1 pre-dated the development of solid-state devices and used vacuum tubes.|$|E
5000|$|PM-3A: 1.75 MW electric, plus {{heating and}} desalinization. McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Owned by the Navy. <b>Initial</b> <b>criticality</b> March 3, 1962, {{decommissioned}} 1972. The PM-3A, located at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, {{was designed by}} the Martin Company to provide electric power and steam heating to the Naval Air Facility at McMurdo Sound. PM-3A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent.The PM-3A (Portable, Medium-power, 3rd generation) was a plant installed to provide power for the McMurdo Base in Antarctica. During 1970-1971, it achieved a world-record power run. It {{was one of the}} first shore-based power plants to use solid-state equipment. The PM-3A was not operated by the Army, but was under the NAVFAC (Naval Facilities Engineering Command [...] "Sea Bees"), shore-based power division of the US Navy. Although the majority of the personnel were Navy, the PM-3A was a tri-service stationing. For 1970-1971, there was an Army Sergeant and an Air Force Sergeant stationed with the crew. The plant was air-cooled with the condensers and fan units running glycol. Waste heat was also used for desalination using vacuum flash distillation. The reactor was located in buried tanks in the ground. After decommissioning, the plant was cut into pieces and transported to the US for burial. The soil surrounding the tanks had become radioactive, so it was also removed and transported to Port Hueneme Naval Base, California, where it was incorporated into asphalt pavement.|$|E

40|$|Ancillaries are {{surgical}} instrument, used {{to implant}} prosthesis. Their management involves {{the departments of}} sterilization and surgery {{as well as the}} suppliers. Having such a long circuit will expose the instruments to potential risk hazards like, logistics problems, lack of traceability, deterioration of material performance or/and risk of transmission of infectious agents. The target of our study is securing the circuit of the orthopedic ancillaries by establishing a cartography of risk. A preliminary analysis of risks (APR) has identified 105 scenarios with risk of vulnerability 1, and 58 scenarios with risk of vulnerability 2. The analysis of hazardous situations of vulnerability 1 identifies 121 scenarios with 54. 5 % of scenarios with <b>initial</b> <b>criticality</b> level 2 and 5 % of scenarios with <b>initial</b> <b>criticality</b> of level 3.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} the critical isoscalar condensate, formed during heavy-ion collisions. Our analysis is based on a simplified model where the sigma and the pions are the only degrees of freedom. In field description, both in physical and momentum space, we find that the freeze-out profile presents a structure which reveals clear traces of the critical fluctuations in the sigma-component. In particle representation, using Monte-Carlo simulations and factorial moment analysis, we show that signatures of the <b>initial</b> <b>criticality</b> survive at the detected pions. We propose the distribution of suitably defined intermittency indices, incorporating dynamical effects due to sigma-pion interaction, as the basic observable for the exploration of critical fluctuations in heavy-ion collision experiments.
