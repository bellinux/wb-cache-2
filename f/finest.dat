5|$|The Basilica of Saint Mary was {{constructed}} between 1907 and 1915 on {{land that was}} formerly a farm, then a zoological garden. Archbishop John Ireland supervised the planning of the church, originally named the Pro-Cathedral of Minneapolis, along with the Cathedral of St. Paul in Saint Paul. He chose architect Emmanuel Masqueray, who was trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The first Mass was held on May 31, 1914. Church leaders desired to build the <b>finest</b> altar in America, handcrafted of the <b>finest</b> marble they could afford. It was elevated {{to the rank of}} basilica and became the first basilica in the United States in 1926. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as one of the area's <b>finest</b> examples of Beaux-Arts architecture.|$|E

5|$|By 7June 1823, Etty {{felt that}} he had reached the limits of what he could {{accomplish}} in Venice, and was considering returning home. Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian's Venus of Urbino, considered one of the <b>finest</b> works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the <b>finest</b> copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in Venice. On 8October 1823 Etty finally left Venice, travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the master thesis was a <b>fine</b> arts colony for primary school pupils as {{motivation}} for <b>fine</b> arts activity. In general, {{there have been few}} studies and papers on <b>fine</b> arts colonies for primary school pupils. A <b>fine</b> arts colony is organised outside the standard space, classroom, and provides a possibility of a wider and deeper exploration of all <b>fine</b> arts fields and techniques. Each year, educators receive tenders for <b>fine</b> arts colonies, but can apply {{only a limited number of}} pupils. Therefore, our current practice is to only apply pupils gifted in <b>fine</b> arts. We can consequently conclude that there are likely many pupils also gifted in <b>fine</b> arts that do not attend the <b>fine</b> arts colony. The objective of the study was to determine the interest for attending the <b>fine</b> arts colony, whether the colony motivates pupils for additional <b>fine</b> arts activity, or is it just another competition, or <b>fine</b> arts contest, which stimulates pupils for <b>fine</b> arts with its external motivational assets (high prizes for selected works for an exhibition, recognition for award-winning works, etc.). The objective of the study was to prove that a <b>fine</b> arts colony is a means of motivation for <b>fine</b> arts activities for all pupils. In the theoretical section, we have emphasised motivation in the learning process, motivation for <b>fine</b> arts creativity, goals and purpose of organising the <b>fine</b> arts colony, comparison of <b>fine</b> arts colonies with contests and ex tempore and <b>fine</b> arts colonies as additional work with gifted pupils. The empirical section of the study is composed of two parts: quantitative non-experimental questionnaire for pupils that attended the colony and for those that did not attend the colony. The qualitative research includes case study of pupils that were identified and included in a personalised programme for gifted pupils and those that were not. By analysing <b>fine</b> arts works, we have presented the difference in motivation for work in a classroom and <b>fine</b> arts activity in a <b>fine</b> arts colony. The results of the qualitative and quantitative study will contribute to a new didactic quality of <b>fine</b> arts courses in the <b>fine</b> arts colony framework. They will contribute an insight into methods of teaching and work with gifted pupils in the field of <b>fine</b> arts. We have designed a model for planning and implementing a <b>fine</b> arts colony, where pupils will acquire quality <b>fine</b> arts experience and will be additionally motivated for <b>fine</b> arts activity. ...|$|R

40|$|Properties of the {{recycled}} <b>fine</b> aggregates and the {{suitability of}} the same in cementitious mortar were studied and {{compared with those of}} natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. The results showed that the particle size distribution of recycled <b>fine</b> aggregates is compatible with those of natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. The recycled <b>fine</b> aggregates had <b>fine</b> fraction and bulk density of 13. 47 % and 1407 kg/m 3, respectively while those of the natural <b>fine</b> aggregates were 1. 51 % and 1453 kg/m 3, respectively. Specific Gravity of recycled <b>fine</b> aggregates was 2. 499 with compared to 2. 408 of Natural <b>fine</b> aggregates and the water absorption was 6. 325 % with compared to 0. 71 % of Natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. Chloride Content of recycled <b>fine</b> aggregate was 0. 0150 % with compared to 0. 0005 % of natural <b>fine</b> aggregate. Properties of mortar made fewer than five testing scenarios consisting different proportions of natural <b>fine</b> aggregate to recycle <b>fine</b> aggregate as 100 %- 0 %, 75 %- 25 %, 50 % - 50 %, 25 %- 75 %, and 0 %- 100 % were compared with those of 100 % natural <b>fine</b> aggregates. With increasing percentage of recycled aggregate content, compressive strength increased in 0. 7 Water cement ratio while the workability decreased. According to the results, mortar properties could be achieved with mix proportions of 50 % natural <b>fine</b> aggregate and 50 % recycled <b>fine</b> aggregate, without significantly affecting the mortar properties, indicating a 50 % saving of natural <b>fine</b> aggregates thus reducing environmental impacts and enhancing sustainability...|$|R
