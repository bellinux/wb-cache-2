25|$|Hull kicked-off the 133rd FA Cup Final and {{dominated}} possession {{for the opening}} stages. Barely four minutes into the game, Hull won a corner that was crossed in by Stephen Quinn to find Tom Huddlestone {{on the edge of}} the penalty area; Huddlestone tried a volley that went into the path of James Chester, who tapped it in from close range to give Hull City an early lead. The high tempo with which Hull started the game overwhelmed Arsenal, and four minutes after the first goal, they scored again. Ahmed Elmohamady received a free kick and crossed it in to the penalty area. This caused controversy as Arsenal believed he had taken the free kick several yards in front of where the foul was committed. Nevertheless, the ball was picked up on the <b>far</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty area by Quinn, who got past Aaron Ramsey and crossed it in to the goalmouth, where it was headed towards goal by centre-back Alex Bruce. Arsenal goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański parried it out to Hull captain and fellow centre-back Curtis Davies, who fired the ball into the far bottom corner of the goal. Hull almost scored a third goal moments later, when a header from Bruce was headed off the goal line by Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs. Instead, it was Arsenal who scored the next goal; in the 16th minute, they won a free kick {{on the edge of the}} Hull penalty area, which Santi Cazorla fired over the Hull wall and into the top corner of the goal. For the rest of the first half, chances were scarce and Hull maintained their lead into the half-time interval.|$|E

[...] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor.

2500|$|The {{first stage}} in the British plan was a preparatory attack on the German {{positions}} south of Ypres at Messines Ridge. The Germans on the ridge had observation over Ypres and unless it was captured, observed enfilade artillery-fire could be fired against a British attack from the salient further north. Since mid-1915, the British had been mining under the German positions on the ridge and by June 1917, 21 mines had been filled with nearly [...] of explosives. The Germans knew the British were mining and had taken counter-measures but they were surprised at {{the extent of the}} British effort. Two of the mines failed to detonate but [...] off on 7 June, at [...] British Summer Time. The final objectives were largely gained before dark and the British had fewer losses than the expected [...] the initial attack. As the infantry advanced over the <b>far</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge, German artillery and machine-guns east of the ridge opened fire and the British artillery was less able to suppress them. The attack removed the Germans from the dominating ground on the southern face of the Ypres salient, which the 4th Army had held since the First Battle of Ypres in 1914.|$|E

"A large {{quantity}} of provisions had been gathered, and a food committee {{took charge of}} it, issuing rations daily to the various families and groups that arranged themselves into messes.

While the world crashed to ruin about them and all the air was filled with the smoke of its burning, these low creatures gave rein to their bestiality and fought and drank and died.

60|$|If I were jacking, {{with a light}} blazing brightly {{before me}} in my canoe, to see what night folk I might {{surprise}} on the shore, Quoskh {{was the only one}} for whom my jack had no fascination. Deer and moose, foxes and wild ducks, frogs and fish,--all seemed equally charmed by the great wonder of a light shining silently out of the vast darkness. I saw them all, at different times, and glided almost up to them before timidity drove them away from the strange bright marvel. But Quoskh was not to be watched in that way, nor to be caught by any such trick. I would see a vague form on the <b>far</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light's pathway; catch the bright flash of either eye as he swung his weather-vane head; then the vague form would slide into the upper darkness. A moment's waiting; then, above me and behind, where the light did not dazzle his eyes, I would hear his night cry--with more of anger than of questioning in it--and as I turned the jack upward I would catch a single glimpse of his broad wings sailing over the lake. Nor would he ever come back, like the fox on the bank, for a second look to be quite sure what I was.|$|E

These sounds often caused Tarzan profound speculation. They baffled him because he thought that he knew his jungle so well that there could be nothing within it unfamiliar to him. Sometimes he thought that as colors and forms appeared to differ by night from their familiar daylight aspects, so sounds altered with the passage of Kudu and the coming of Goro, and these thoughts roused within his brain a vague conjecture that perhaps Goro and Kudu influenced these changes. And what more natural that eventually he came to attribute to the sun and the moon personalities as real as his own? The sun was a living creature and ruled the day. The moon, endowed with brains and miraculous powers, ruled the night.|$|E
