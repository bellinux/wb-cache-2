It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the telescope towards the object for observation. Next, turn the <b>focusing</b> <b>screw</b> until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye {{from one side to the}} other or from top to bottom.|$|E
50|$|Semmendinger {{cameras were}} most {{commonly}} single lens cameras under the model name Excelsior. All {{were made of}} finely polished mahogany with a cloth of rubber bellows and brass <b>focusing</b> <b>screws.</b> After Semmendinger's invention of the silver corners (Patent No. 145020), these were included in all future Excelsior model cameras. In addition to the common single lens variety, Semmendinger produced stereo cameras with combinations of either two or four lenses. All cameras produced by Semmendinger {{were part of the}} Excelsior brand, yet {{attempts have been made to}} distinguish between variations.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{deformation}} {{mechanisms of}} (Mg,Fe) (2) SiO 4 olivine {{is important for}} the understanding of flow and seismic anisotropy in the Earth's upper mantle. We report here a numerical modelling at the atomic scale of dislocation structures and slip system properties in Mg 2 SiO 4 forsterite. Our study <b>focuses</b> on <b>screw</b> dislocations of [100] and [001] Burgers vectors. Computations are performed using the so-called THB 1 empirical potential set for Mg 2 SiO 4. Results of dislocation core structures highlight the primary importance of the (010) plane for [100] slip dislocations. For [001] dislocations, we confirm the occurrence of a stable narrow core that evolves into transient planar configurations to glide in (100) and (010). Such configurations suggest a locking-unlocking mechanism...|$|R

The research part of this thesis deals with current trends in the automotive industry, especially {{with the problem of}} assembling seats part, with <b>focus</b> on <b>screwing.</b> The design part of this thesis maps the process of designing two variants of an automatic robotic workstation. Special attention was given to the process of choosing the right industrial robot for the task, {{as well as to the}} construction of the end-effector and of the resulting 3 D data. The right version of the workstation for the consecutive implementation was then chosen based on multi-criteria evaluation. The finishing touch of this thesis is a risk analysis for the implemented workstation...|$|R
30|$|The fixture-abutment {{connection}} type {{is also important}} for implant longevity. Quek et al. reported that narrow-diameter implants are more easily broken than wider implants {{because they have a}} narrow platform diameter [21]. However, different results are expected from implants with an internal connection. Certain {{studies have shown that the}} biomechanical stability of internal conical connection implants is better than in butt-joint implants [22, 23]. Herein, we used implants with a conical connection, and the force on implants with a conical connection was not <b>focused</b> on a <b>screw</b> but a connection.|$|R
40|$|In linearised {{continuum}} elasticity, {{the elastic}} strain {{due to a}} straight dislocation line decays as $O(r^{- 1 }) $, where $r$ denotes {{the distance to the}} defect core. It is shown in Ehrlacher, Ortner, Shapeev (2016) that the core correction due to nonlinear and discrete (atomistic) effects decays like $O(r^{- 2 }) $. In the present work, we <b>focus</b> on <b>screw</b> dislocations under pure anti-plane shear kinematics. In this setting we demonstrate that an improved decay $O(r^{-p}) $, $p > 2 $, of the core correction is obtained when crystalline symmetries are fully exploited and possibly a simple and explicit correction of the continuum far-field prediction is made. This result is interesting in its own right as it demonstrates that, in some cases, continuum elasticity gives a much better prediction of the elastic field surrounding a dislocation than expected, and moreover has practical implications for atomistic simulation of dislocations cores, which we discuss as well...|$|R
40|$|There is {{extensive}} {{literature on}} using screw theory {{to study the}} first order kinematic properties of robot manipulators. In this paper, we <b>focus</b> on <b>screw</b> theory {{and its relationship to}} second and higher order kinematic properties. We start with the geometry of the Lie group SE(3), the special Euclidean group in three dimensions. It is well known that the set of all twists can be identified with the tangent vectors at the identity element to form a Lie algebra. We argue that in order to describe second order kinematic properties, it is necessary to endow SE(3) with an affine connection. The connection allows us to differentiate twists to obtain higher order derivatives. To get correct expressions for the rigid body acceleration and jerk, it is necessary to use a suitable affine connection. We show that there is a unique symmetric connection with this property. We also prove that there is a unique invariant, symmetric connection that leads to the definition of the acceleration screw. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} mobile {{learning}} offers opportunities {{to do two}} things at once in an educational context. Two experiments were set up to examine the effect of performing a secondary task while learning with a mobile device. The experimental group had to combine a learning task with a secondary task. The control group only had to perform a learning task. Additionally, participants of the experimental group received different instructions (“doing both tasks as good as possible”, “learning score is important” or “screwing score is important”). Afterwards, all the participants had to complete a learning test and participants of the experimental group also received a screwing score. In general, the effect of condition on the learning task was rather limited. Only one significant effect was found and it was limited to a difference between students of the control group who outperformed the students <b>focusing</b> on the <b>screwing</b> task while learning. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Within {{a decade}} of being {{introduced}} in America, 3 general forms of camera were in popular use: the American- or chamfered-box camera, the Robert’s-type camera or “Boston box”, and the Lewis-type camera. The American-box camera had beveled edges at the front and rear, and {{an opening in the}} rear where the formed image could be viewed on ground glass. The top of the camera had hinged doors for placing photographic plates. Inside there was one available slot for distant objects, and another slot in the back for close-ups. The lens was focused either by sliding or with a rack and pinion mechanism. The Robert’s-type cameras were similar to the American-box, except for having a knob-fronted worm gear {{on the front of the}} camera, which moved the back box for focusing. Many Robert’s-type cameras allowed focusing directly on the lens mount. The third popular daguerreotype camera in America was the Lewis-type, introduced in 1851, which utilized a bellows for focusing. The main body of the Lewis-type camera was mounted on the front box, but the rear section was slotted into the bed for easy sliding. Once <b>focused,</b> a set <b>screw</b> was tightened to hold the rear section in place. Having the bellows in the middle of the body facilitated making a second, in-camera copy of the original image.|$|R
40|$|Chillers are a {{significant}} component of large facility energy use. The focus {{of much of the}} development of chilled water systems {{in recent years has been}} on optimization of set point and staging controls, improvements in chiller design to increase efficiency and accommodate chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerant replacements. Other improvements have been made by upgrading controls to the latest digital technologies, improving access and monitoring via communications and sophisticated liquid crystal displays (LCD), more robust fault diagnostics and operating and maintenance information logging. Advances have also been made in how chiller plant systems are designed and operated, and in the diversity of chiller products that are available to support innovative approaches. As in many industries, these improvements have been facilitated by advances in, and lower costs for, enabling technologies, such as refrigerants, compressor design, electronics for controls and variable frequency drives (VFD). Along with the improvements in electronics one would expect that advances have also been made in the functionality of unit controls included with chillers. Originally, the primary purpose of this project was to investigate the state of practice of chiller unit controllers in terms of their energy saving capabilities. However, early in the study it was discovered that advances in this area did not include incorporation of significantly different capabilities than had existed 10 - 15 years ago. Thus the scope has been modified to provide an overview of some of the basic controls-related energy saving strategies that are currently available along with guideline estimates of their potential and applicability. We have minimized consideration of strategies that could be primarily implemented via design practices such as chiller selection and plant design, and those that can only be implemented by a building management system (BMS). Also, since most of the floor space of federal buildings occurs in large buildings, we have <b>focused</b> on water-cooled <b>screw</b> and centrifugal chillers of 100 ton capacity and greater. However, the role of reciprocating and gas chillers (absorption and engine driven) is discussed briefly. Understanding the demographics of chiller deployment in the federal sector, state of practice of energy savings strategies and control features availability will help federal energy managers and program implementers to make informed decisions in support of energy saving performance contracting (ESPC) and other programs...|$|R
