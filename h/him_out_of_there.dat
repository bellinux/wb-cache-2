60|$|He was {{a monster}} of cruelty, which is saying {{a great deal}} in that day. He beat his wives--not that he ever had more than one wife at a time, but that he was married many times.

60|$|Sometimes, indeed, we {{have seen}} <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> imagination. <b>There</b> he is a poor, tired, clumsy creature, footsore and dusty, with a halter round his neck, and a swarthy {{foreigner}} to make his life miserable.

He said no, it was his duty to stand {{whatever}} the law done to him, and he would stick to the jail plumb through to the end, even if there warn't no door to it. It disappointed Tom and graveled him a good deal, but he {{had to put up with}} it.|$|E

There, he finds a fox trap (which looks more like a bear trap) and gently gets himself caught in it. When the trapper discovers him, however, he boots <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there</b> while proclaiming they are only looking for a silver fox.

He takes the fox back with him to the farm, all the while saying hes [...] "Practically sold already".|$|E

60|$|The long dusky column {{pushed on}} {{steadily}} through dim forest, wide morass, and tracts of hot white sand, {{and it happened}} one evening when the advance guard were a considerable distance ahead that Dom Erminio sat alone on the veranda at San Roque.

Now {{and then a little}} fitful breeze crept up the misty river, and filled the forest that rose above it with mysterious noises. Then it dropped away again, and left a silence the Chefe commenced to find oppressive behind it. He could hear the oily gurgle of sliding water, and at times a sharp crackle in the crazy building behind <b>him,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> which <b>there</b> drifted a damp mildewy smell, but that merely emphasized the almost disconcerting absence of any other sound. Indeed, it was so still that the soft rustle his duck garments made as he moved jarred on him, and he was glad when the little muggy breeze flowed into the veranda again.|$|R

I would not want to go in that ditch. It’s not pretty. It was very bad. I can imagine what was going through his mind down there, because there was more than one still alive—people grabbing hold of his pants, wanting help. “I can’t help you. You’re too bad off.” He found this one kid and brought the kid back up and handed it to Larry, and we laid it across Larry and my lap and took <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there.</b> I remember thinking Glenn Andreotta put himself where nobody {{in their right mind would}} want to be, and he was driven by something. I haven’t got the aircraft on the ground real stable. He bolted out of that aircraft into this ditch. Now he was a hero. Glenn Andreotta gave his life for his country about three weeks later. That’s the kind of guy he was, and he was a hero that day.|$|E
