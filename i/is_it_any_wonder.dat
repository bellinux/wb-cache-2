500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Linder of IGN commented [...] "2004's Greatest Hits: My Prerogative [...] {{captured}} the highlights from Britney's heyday, but lacks the more mature club-oriented material that she's churned out in recent years. That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase". Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, and deserve better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> this compilation is so good?".|$|E

He was like some terrible moral huntsman digging mankind out of the snug burrows {{in which they had}} lived hitherto. In the white blaze of this kingdom of his there was to be no property, no privilege, no pride and precedence; no motive indeed and no reward but love. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> that men were dazzled and blinded and cried out against him? Even his disciples cried out when he would not spare them the light. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> that the priests realized that between this man and themselves there was no choice but that he or priestcraft should perish? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> that the Roman soldiers, confronted and amazed by something soaring over their comprehension and threatening all their disciplines, should take refuge in wild laughter, and crown him with thorns and robe him in purple and make a mock Cæsar of him?

"I like better," [...] replied Hilda, [...] "to {{look at the}} bright, blue sky, roofing the edifice {{where the}} {{builders}} left <b>it</b> open. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> very delightful, in a breezy day, to see the masses of white cloud float over the opening, and then the sunshine fall through it again, fitfully, as it does now.

6000|$|... "The Lord of the Isles {{was by far}} {{the least}} popular of the series, and Mr. Scott was very prompt at making such discoveries. In about a week after its {{publication}} he took me into his library, and asked me what the people were saying about The Lord of the Isles. I hesitated, much in the same manner that Gil Blas might be supposed to do when a similar question was put by the Archbishop of Grenada, but he very speedily brought the matter to a point--'Come, speak out, my good fellow, what has put it in your head to be on ceremony with me? But the result is in one word--disappointment!' My silence admitted his inference to its fullest extent. His countenance certainly did look rather blank for a few seconds (for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a singular fact, that before the public, or rather the booksellers, gave their decision he no more knew whether he had written well or ill, than whether a die, which he threw out of a box, was to turn out a sise or an ace). However, he almost instantly resumed his spirits and expressed his wonder rather that his popularity had lasted so long, than that it should have given way at last. At length, with a perfectly cheerful manner, he said, 'Well, well, James, but you know we must not droop--for you know we can't and won't give over--we must just try something else, and the question <b>is,</b> what <b>it's</b> to be?' Nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> he spoke thus, for he could not fail to be unconsciously conscious, if I dare use such a term, of his own gigantic, and as yet undeveloped, powers, and was somewhat under forty years old. I am by no means sure whether he then alluded to Waverley, as if he had mentioned it to me for the first time, for my memory has greatly failed me touching this, or whether he alluded to it, as in fact appears to have been the case, as having been commenced and laid aside several years before, but I well recollect that he consulted me with his usual openness and candour respecting his probability of succeeding as a novelist, and I confess my expectations were not very sanguine. He saw this and said, 'Well, I don't see why I should not succeed as well as other people. Come, faint heart never won fair lady--let us try.' I remember when the work was put into my hands, I could not get myself to think much, of the Waverley Honour scenes, but to my shame <b>be</b> <b>it</b> spoken, when he had reached the exquisite scenes of Scottish manners at Tully-Veolan, I thought them, and pronounced them, vulgar! When the success of the book so utterly knocked me down as a man of taste, all that the good-natured Author observed was, 'Well, I really thought you might be wrong about the Scotch. Why, Burns had already attracted universal attention to all about Scotland, and I confess I could not see why I should not be able to keep the flame alive, merely because I wrote in prose in place of rhyme.'"--Memorandum.|$|R

60|$|The adventurer's {{instinct}} {{took with}} it the adventurer's judgment; Harold was not content with small results. Amidst the vast primeval forces there were, he felt, vast results of their prehistoric working; and he determined to find some of them. In such a quest, purpose <b>is</b> much. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> hardly <b>any</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, that in time Harold found himself alone {{in the midst of}} one of the great treasure-places of the world. Only labour was needed to take from the earth riches beyond the dreams of avarice. But that labour was no easy problem; great and difficult distance had to be overcome; secrecy must be observed, for even a whisper of the existence of such a place would bring a horde of desperadoes. But all these difficulties were at least sources of interest, if not in themselves pleasures. The new Harold, seemingly freshly created by a year of danger and strenuous toil, of self-examining and humiliation, of the realisation of duty, and--though he knew it not as yet--of the dawning of hope, found delight in the thought of dangers and difficulties to be overcome. Having taken his bearings exactly so as to be safe in finding the place again, he took his specimens with him and set out to find the shortest and best route to the nearest port.|$|R

They were double cousins, you see. Their fathers were brothers and their mothers were twin sisters, and they did look a terrible lot alike. Of course," [...] added Miss Cornelia scornfully, [...] "it wasn't one of those freak resemblances you read of in novels where two people are so much alike that they can fill each other's places and their nearest and dearest can't tell between them. In those days you could tell easy enough which was George and which was Dick, if you saw them together and near at hand. Apart, or some distance away, it wasn't so easy. They played lots of tricks on people and thought it great fun, the two scamps. George Moore was a little taller {{and a good deal}} fatter than Dick--though neither of them was what you would call fat--they were both of the lean kind. Dick had higher color than George, and his hair was a shade lighter. But their features were just alike, and they both had that queer freak of eyes--one blue and one hazel. They weren't much alike in any other way, though. George was a real nice fellow, though he was a scalawag for mischief, and some said he had a liking for a glass even then. But everybody liked him better than Dick. He spent about a month here. Leslie never saw him; she was only about eight or nine then and I remember now that she spent that whole winter over harbor with her grandmother West. Captain Jim was away, too--that was the winter he was wrecked on the Magdalens. I don't suppose either he or Leslie had ever heard about the Nova Scotia cousin looking so much like Dick. Nobody ever thought of him when Captain Jim brought Dick--George, I should say--home. Of course, we all thought Dick had changed considerable--he'd got so lumpish and fat. But we put that down to what had happened to him, and no doubt that was the reason, for, as I've said, George wasn't fat to begin with either. And {{there was no other way}} we could have guessed, for the man's senses were clean gone. I can't see that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> we were all deceived. But it's a staggering thing. And Leslie has sacrificed the best years of her life to nursing a man who hadn't any claim on her! Oh, drat the men! No matter what they do, it's the wrong thing. And no matter who they <b>are,</b> <b>it's</b> somebody they shouldn't be. They do exasperate me." ...|$|R
