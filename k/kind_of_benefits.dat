Poland's then ruling party, Law and Justice, mainly noted concerns that it might force Poland to grant homosexual couples the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> which heterosexual couples enjoy, while the UK was worried that the Charter might be used to alter British labour law, especially as relates to allowing more strikes. The European Scrutiny Committee of the British House of Commons, including members of both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, has however cast doubts on the provision's text, asserting that the clarification might not be worded strongly and clearly enough to achieve the government's aims.|$|E
5000|$|The {{removal of}} the {{boundaries}} between [...] "civil society" [...] and [...] "political society" [...] meant that caste now played a huge role {{in the political arena}} and also influenced other government-run institutions such as police and the judicial system. Though caste seemed to dictate one's access to such institutions, the location of that caste also played a pivotal role. If a lower caste were concentrated enough in one area, it could then translate that pocket of concentration of its caste members into political power and then challenge the hegemony of locally dominant upper caste. Gender also plays {{a significant role in the}} power dynamic of caste in politics. Women's representation within the political system seems to also be tied to their caste. Lower, more conservative castes have less female participation in politics than upper, more socially liberal, castes. This has caused a disproportionately large number of upper-caste women to occupy political office when compared to their lower caste counterparts. The hierarchy of caste and its role in politics and access to power and resources has created a society of patron-client relationships along caste lines. This staunchly rigid structure was most prevalent during the Congress-dominating period. This eventually led to the practice of vote banking, where voters back only candidates that are in their caste http://m.timesofindia.com/india/90-per-cent-of-people-vote-on-caste-lines-Katju/articleshow/18117893.cms, or officials from which they expect to receive some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E
