5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E

50|$|In September 2005 several {{changes were}} made to the Panda, {{including}} standard fitment of ABS and a <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> airbag.|$|R
50|$|Japan model {{went on sale}} in 2005-01-20. Early Nissan Note models include 15RX, 15E, 15S, 15S V-package, 15E FOUR, 15S FOUR, 15S FOUR V-package. Early Nissan Note Rider models include 15S, 15S V-package, 15S FOUR, 15S FOUR V-package. Early Note Lifecare Vehicles include Enchante (Slide-out Lift <b>Front</b> <b>Passenger's</b> Seat) (15E, 15S, 15E FOUR, 15S FOUR), Enchante (Swivel <b>Front</b> <b>Passenger's</b> Seat) (15S, 15S FOUR), Driving Helper with Autech Driving Control Package Type e (15S, 15S FOUR).|$|R
50|$|This is {{also the}} only {{generation}} of the Honda Odyssey where the power windows are only on the driver's and <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> doors.|$|R
5|$|Exclusive is {{consistently}} {{the most expensive}} trim for each market, with the biggest choice of engines and features. It is the only model to feature a folding <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat, making the storage space into the whole interior of the car except the driver's seat. Extras for the trim include: tinted windows, rear parking sensors, automatic windscreen wipers, a leather and chrome interior, pollen filter, and dual-zone automatic climate control, which allows for two varying temperature settings simultaneously in the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
25|$|An airbone assault vehicle {{known as}} the CSK002 Airbone Assault Vehicle is {{equipped}} with smoke grenade dischargers, a machine gun on top and an AGL on the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat.|$|E
50|$|The Renegade offers either cloth or leather seating surfaces. It offers {{seating for}} five passengers, with a 40/20/40 split-folding rear bench seat, and a fold-flat <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> seat for more cargo capacity.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Front</b> <b>passengers</b> now {{sit behind}} a fascia brow padded for extra safety {{and they have}} {{individual}} split-bench seats; the rear seat is two inches further back with modified corners and shoulder padding.|$|R

25|$|The S70 scored five of five {{stars for}} front impact {{protection}} for driver and <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> in the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety testing, and {{four out of}} five stars for driver and rear passenger side impact protection.|$|E
25|$|For the interior, the GS 300 {{featured}} walnut {{wood trim}} {{on the center}} console, leather seating, an automatic tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, and the option of a Nakamichi premium stereo system. Driver and <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> airbags were standard. A moonroof, remote 12-CD auto changer, and traction control (TRAC – left hand drive vehicles only) were options.|$|E
25|$|Early 1975 models {{featured}} {{the seat belt}} interlock system introduced on all 1974 models that required both the driver and <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> to fasten their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. However, Congressional action to rescind that regulation, which led automakers to discontinue the device and permitted dealers and garages to disconnect the device on cars so-equipped.|$|E
50|$|The HiAce rebadged with {{a luxury}} orientation, the Toyota RegiusAce, was {{introduced}} August 1999 with different versions called the Regius HiAce and Regius Touring HiAce sold at Toyopet and Vista dealerships. The RegiusAce uses a cab over setup, meaning that <b>front</b> seat <b>passengers</b> sit {{on top of}} the front axle and the 1TR-FE engine is located underneath the floor and between the <b>front</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{restrictions}} on the new driver. For {{the first three months}} after receiving the license, he may drive only if there is an experienced driver sitting in the <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> seat, — and the law additionally defines the requirements for the driver to be called [...] "experienced". The charges for violating traffic laws are much more heavy on the new driver; there is a list of traffic law violations that immediately cancel the new driver's license. Additional limitations apply on young drivers; i.e., if the new driver is younger than 21 years old, he may not transport more than two passengers without an experienced driver accompanying him in the <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> seat.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{equipped}} with six airbags; two for the <b>front</b> <b>passengers,</b> two side impact airbags that deployed from {{the outer edge of}} the front seats and side curtain airbags that dropped in front of the front and second row side doors.|$|R
25|$|The {{dashboard}} made of impact-absorbing, artificial foam {{was reinforced}} {{with a thin}} aluminium layer which effectively prevented hoses, valves, housings and other components from heating and engine from penetrating through the dashboard inside the passenger cabin in a severe impact. The passenger glove box also featured a defined point of rupture, which considerably reduced the probability of <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> injuries.|$|E
25|$|The '68 Electra 225 got {{a revised}} grille and {{taillight}} trim along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside, {{there was a}} revised instrument panel with a square speedometer and other instruments, plus a new steering wheel. Shoulder seat-belts were standard for both the driver and <b>front</b> <b>passenger.</b> Base and Custom models were still offered, with the Limited trim option available on the Electra 225 Custom hardtop sedan.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} Fabia trim levels were Classic, Ambiente, Sport and Elegance. In the UK the trim levels were called 1, 2, Sport, 3, and GreenLine (later S, SE, Elegance, and GreenLine). In India, the trim levels were Active, Classic, Ambiente and Elegance. All models sold within the EU were equipped with ABS, <b>front</b> <b>passenger,</b> driver and side airbags. Curtain airbags and ESC were available as an option.|$|E
5000|$|A {{specific}} {{use of the}} term [...] "phaeton" [...] is with the dual cowl phaeton, a body style in which the rear passengers were separated from the driver and the <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> by a cowl or bulkhead, often with its own folding windshield.|$|R
5000|$|... 1967 Skylarks {{got all the}} Federally-mandated safety {{equipment}} as other U.S. market passenger cars, including a dual-circuit hydraulic brake system, energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way hazard flashers, shoulder belt mounting points for outboard <b>front</b> <b>passengers,</b> softer interior surfaces and recessed control on the instrument panel.|$|R
25|$|The four-speed gearbox was not {{bolted to}} the engine, but was a {{separate}} shaft-driven unit mounted between {{the second and third}} crossmembers. While the remote gearbox placement led to a complicated linkage to the column-mounted shifter, resulting in vague shifter action, it also improved legroom for the <b>front</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
25|$|On June 26, 2011, Beasley {{was driving}} in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka when he was pulled over by a {{policeman}} for speeding. The policeman noticed that the car smelled of a strong odor of marijuana. The officer allegedly found marijuana {{in a plastic bag}} under the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat. However, Beasley said the marijuana was not his, but belonged to a friend whom he had just dropped off. Beasley was consequently fined and ticketed.|$|E
25|$|The {{hatchback}} coupe {{features a}} lower roofline and a fold-down rear seat. The notchback sedan {{had the lowest}} price {{and is the only}} Vega model with an enclosed trunk. The Safari wagon has fixed rear-side glass and a swing-up liftgate. A panel delivery based on the wagon was sold through the 1975 model year. It has steel panels in place of the rear-side glass, and an additional enclosed storage area. An auxiliary <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat was optional.|$|E
25|$|Major {{standard}} features {{included a}} water repellent front door glass, an acoustic windshield, solar energy absorbing glass, electrochromic auto-dimming side mirrors with puddle lamps, electrochromic auto-dimming rearview mirror, 10-way driver and <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> power and heated seats with three-position Lexus Memory System, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, and a power trunk closer. The GS sedans also {{were the first}} to feature the latest generation of Lexus' SmartAccess keyless system–-adding a push-button start {{for the first time as}} standard.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{tightening}} auto {{safety regulations}} from the NHTSA, all 1990 and 1991 Accords {{sold in the}} United States came equipped with motorized shoulder belts for <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> to comply with passive restraint mandates. These semi-automatic restraints were a two component system; a motorized shoulder belt along with a non-integrated and manually operated seatbelt. The shoulder belts automatically raced around each window frame encircling both the driver and <b>front</b> seat <b>passenger</b> whenever the <b>front</b> door closed. The process reversed to release them when opened. The lap belts however, still required manual fastening.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the UHSS reinforced body structure, Proton has also equipped twin front airbags for all variants of the new Saga. Other passive safety features include two ISOFIX child seat mounts with top tethers, head restraints and five three-point seat belts, with pre-tensioning for <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> and an audible driver's seat belt reminder.|$|R
5000|$|The {{compulsory}} {{wearing of}} seat-belts for <b>front</b> seat <b>passengers</b> {{for three years}} ...|$|R
25|$|New {{integrated}} {{seat and}} shoulder belts were introduced this year {{along with a}} federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} sustained significant structural damage. There was major {{damage to}} the left wing's leading edge, leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps, and spoilers. The left wing fuel tank was breached near the outboard end of the outboard flaps. The front radome and weather radar were heavily damaged, and {{damage to the}} underside of the fuselage extended {{from the front of the}} aircraft all the way back to the left <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> door. The nose landing gear well and the main electronics bay also were damaged.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, {{a mother}} and her {{daughter}} were found deceased in their still-running Porsche Cayenne SUV against a guardrail on Florida's Turnpike, initially thought to be victims of Carbon monoxide poisoning. Their deaths remained unexplained as the medical examiner waited for results of toxicology tests on the victims, until urine tests revealed that hydrogen sulfide was the cause of death. A report from the Orange-Osceola Medical Examiner’s Office indicated that toxic fumes came from the Porsche’s battery, located under the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> seat.|$|E
50|$|The seventh {{generation}} Sambar van {{and truck}} {{were introduced to}} Japan April 2, 2012 {{and based on the}} Toyota Pixis Van/Truck. It is with this generation where the engine was installed {{in the front of the}} vehicle, between the <b>front</b> <b>passengers,</b> and driven by the rear wheels, and continuing to offer on demand four wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|Vis-à-vis {{automobiles}} {{were popular}} in {{the early history of}} motoring. These were driven from the forward-facing rear seat, with <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> sitting ahead of the steering controls and facing the driver. <b>Passengers</b> in the <b>front</b> seat would obstruct the vision of the driver in the rear seat, and the style fell out of favour before 1905.|$|R
5000|$|The Active, {{introduced}} in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, radio/cassette player, driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> airbag {{have been made}} standard. This model has the 1100 cc [...] "FIRE" [...] engine and a five-speed gearbox.|$|R
