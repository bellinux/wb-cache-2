25|$|Many {{psychological}} and management theories exist regarding {{the types of}} <b>job</b> <b>content</b> which is intrinsically satisfying to employees and which, in turn, should minimise external voluntary turnover. Examples include Herzberg's two factor theory, McClelland's Theory of Needs, and Hackman and Oldham's Job Characteristics Model.|$|E
25|$|The job-based {{theories}} {{hold that}} the key to motivation is within an employee's job itself. Generally, these theories say that jobs can be motivating by their very design. This is a particularly useful view for organizations, because the practices set out in the theories can be implemented more practically in an organization. Ultimately, according to the job-based theories, the key to finding motivation through one's job is being able to derive satisfaction from the <b>job</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to discuss motivation and job attributes in I–O psychology without crediting Frederick Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory (also referred to as Herzberg's Two-factor theory). Published in 1968, Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is {{the primary source of}} motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. For an organization {{to take full advantage of}} Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on <b>job</b> <b>content,</b> it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.|$|E
30|$|As in Peri and Sparber (2009), {{the final}} {{measures}} of Abstract, Routine and Non-Routine Service <b>Job</b> <b>Contents</b> are the weighted averages of {{the intensity of}} the activities included under each of the three measures. 9 In addition, given that our aim is to provide relative measures of intensity of abstract, routine and non-routine service <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> for each occupation, we normalize the intensity of each of these three <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> within occupations so that the sum of the intensities of the three of them is 1.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is threefold. First, we compute {{differences}} on job tasks (Abstract, Routine and Manual) across a harmonized and hence comparable sample of Anglo-saxon, many European and even Asian advanced countries. We do so by using very precise information on <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> at the worker level, which allows for job task heterogeneity within occupations. Second we assess {{the extent to which}} computer adoption leads to the observed differences of <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> across countries. Third, we test the impact of tasks at work on average wages and wage inequality. Our results show remarkable differences in the degree of polarization of <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> across countries, being computer adoption at work a key significant driver of such differences. In particular, ICT use at work explains 10. 0 % (7. 7 %) of the cross-country conditional differences in Abstract (Routine) tasks at work. Finally, our results indicate that although differences in tasks explain an important and significant part of wage differentials (similar to what is found in Autor and Handel, 2013), we cannot find a clear pattern in the explanation of wage inequality gaps by looking at differences in task endowments and task returns...|$|R
30|$|To match occupations with {{particular}} <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> {{we rely on}} information on job task requirements assembled by Peri and Sparber (2009) for the US, Goos et al. (2010) for different European countries, and Amuedo and De la Rica (2011) for Spain, among others. The starting point is to merge data on <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> (or task requirements) based on the US Department of Labor’s ONet survey 5 with Census occupation classifications to examine task specialization patterns of workers. ONet is a primary source of occupational information providing data on key attributes and characteristics of occupations. It replaces the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT), which was used for earlier research, prominently by Autor et al. (2003). ONet data is collected for 812 occupations based on the 2000 Standard Occupational Code (SOC).|$|R

30|$|As a {{robustness}} check, we {{have used}} an alternative definition of routine-intensive jobs—only those whose content relate to Operation Monitoring and Operation and Control as Autor and Dorn (2013). The rest of <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> previously assigned as routine intensive by Goos et al. (2010) have been left aside (in their classification they also consider arm-hand steadiness, manual dexterity, finger dexterity and strength as routine <b>job</b> <b>contents).</b> Given that abstract, routine and service tasks are in relative terms, each of the measures has been redefined {{with respect to this}} alternative routine task measure. Results, although not reported and available upon request, are qualitatively identical to the ones found in the previous section, which suggests that the particular definition of routine-intensive tasks used in this paper is robust to alternative definitions of routine tasks used in other studies.|$|R

This article examines how new demand for security services from international client firms in Mumbai impacts on the quality standards and <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> of security guards. Using empirical data, this article highlights the increasing differentiation in terms of <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> and benefits for security guards. The emergence of new clients for security services has increased the need for trained, educated personnel to handle multiple, and sophisticated tasks leading to these jobs being better paid and more skilled.

30|$|In this fourth section, we look {{specifically}} at employed workers and analyze how their age structure changes in rising and declining occupations. To this end, we follow Autor and Dorn (2009) and estimate {{changes in the}} age composition of workers in each occupation {{for each of the}} intervals considered before, according to the three different <b>job</b> <b>contents,</b> as well as the routinization index. We do this separately by gender.|$|R
30|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{from a variety}} of countries has found a neat decline in the share of middle wage occupations which has been named the polarization process. Indeed, some authors, such as Autor and Dorn (2013) find that this process has accelerated during the great recession. This reallocation of workers has been mainly observed within different industries and this has led many scholars to relate this phenomenon to a change in technology motivated by a decrease in the price of capital goods. Indeed, Autor et al. (2003) and Goos et al. (2009) relate the abovementioned polarization process to a decrease in the demand for occupations performing routine <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> or tasks that workers in the middle-wage occupations perform and which can be easily mechanized. On the other hand, it has also been documented that occupations which perform jobs that are more difficult to be substituted by technology, such as abstract qualified occupations or unqualified jobs which require interpersonal skills, are rising in relative employment terms. This means that workers previously performing routine tasks have been reallocated to jobs requiring either more abstract or more interpersonal service <b>job</b> <b>contents</b> or tasks.|$|R

30|$|This section {{introduces}} the link developed by Autor and Dorn (2009) {{with regards to}} the implication of the routinization theory for the change in the distribution of employment by age. Routinization implies the displacement of occupations which are intensive in routine tasks to occupations more intensive in non-routine (service or abstract) <b>job</b> <b>contents.</b> This non-neutral occupational change may change the age composition of occupations if there are different incentives and/or abilities of workers to enter/exit from rising/declining occupations at different stages of their life cycle.
