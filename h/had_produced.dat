During early production in mid-1998 the band worked on seven tracks in Los Angeles with Matthew Wilder, who <b>had</b> <b>produced</b> Tragic Kingdom, but had creative differences with him.

5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907.

On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions <b>had</b> <b>produced</b> a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E
