40|$|Systematic model-driven {{decision-making}} {{is crucial}} to design, engineer, and transform manufacturing enterprises (MEs). Choosing and applying the best philosophies and techniques is challenging as most MEs deploy complex and unique configurations of process-resource systems and seek economies of scope and scale in respect of changing and distinctive product flows. This paper presents a novel systematic <b>enhanced</b> <b>integrated</b> modelling <b>framework</b> to facilitate transformation of MEs, which is centred on CIMOSA. Application of the new framework in an automotive industrial case study is also presented. The following new contributions to knowledge are made: (1) an innovative structured framework that can support various decisions in design, optimisation, and control to reconfigure MEs; (2) an enriched and generic process modelling approach with capability to represent both static and dynamic aspects of MEs; and (3) an automotive industrial case application showing benefits in terms of reduced lead time and cost with improved responsiveness of process-resource system with a special focus on PPC. It is anticipated that the new framework {{is not limited to}} only automotive industry but has a wider scope of application.

The results demonstrate that the curricular structure of the Nursing Program is to discipline, academic, predominantly an asignaturista model with ranking courses, content duplication, and fragmented work gap between theory and practice. No integration axes are detected, nor interdisciplinarity. We conclude they must overcome the discipline prototype and continuity of the asignaturista traditional curriculum.

50|$|As {{one size}} {{does not fit}} all, AITIC’s personalised {{approach}} to assist {{the representatives of the}} LACs to better understand the rules of the MTS has been its trademark. One of the best known examples of the tools AITIC has developed to assist the LAC representatives is its Glossary of Most Commonly Used International Trade Terms with Particular Reference to the WTO, which is in its second edition and has been translated into the three official languages of the WTO (English, French and Spanish) and also into Portuguese, Russian and Macedonian. The agency’s flexible structure allows it to provide tailor-made services to address the particular needs of the LACs for information and analysis {{on a wide range of}} issues concerning trade and development in the context of the WTO. Examples of such services are: organisation of workshops and “Flash Meetings”, on topics of interest to the LACs (i.e., Safeguards, Services, WTO Rules), publishing information notes (e.g., Aid for Trade, the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Framework</b> for LDCs). In addition, its Official Fellowship Programme provides on-the-job training for LAC officials. AITIC’s recent capacity building programmes have included courses for Geneva-based delegates on Services and Agriculture. Most of the AITIC activities (and website) are provided in the three official languages of the WTO. Finally, LACs have unrestricted access to the facilities of the Non-Residents' Unit. AITIC was an initiative of Switzerland's federal authorities to assist resource constrained developing countries and economies in transition to have a more active trade diplomacy. Originally set up as an association under Swiss private law, AITIC was transformed into an intergovernmental organisation in 2004 and has been funded during its first five-year budgetary cycle by seven Sponsoring Members (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK). At present, AITIC has 59 Participating Members and four in the process of accession. AITIC has been the subject of two external evaluations by a Dutch consultancy, ECORYS, one in 2004 and the most recent one in 2007. A “perception audit” was performed by Burson-Marsteller in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Aid-for-trade {{programs}} can help strengthen low-income countries’ supply capacity {{and knowledge of}} trade preferences, which {{will allow them to}} take fuller advantage of these preferences. Aid for trade to support preference reform can be divided into three categories: (i) creation of information-sharing mechanisms to ensure that governments, SMEs and other businesses are aware of the opportunities that preferential market access offers; (ii) capacity-building support to overcome supply-side and policy constraints; and (iii) support to ease the adjustments to preference erosion that will inevitably occur. As with other aid initiatives, coordination and cohesion among assistance programs is critical for success. Delivery mechanisms such as the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Framework</b> (EIF), the Trade Facilitation Facility (TFF), and the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), are aimed at facilitating such coordination, but more could be done. And, as preference programs are intended to be temporary, aid for trade can also facilitate graduation from these programs and compensate beneficiaries for preference erosion. Unfortunately, this area is still lacking the level of innovation and financial support needed. Aid Effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the right}} conditions, Africa has the {{potential}} to not only feed its own population but that {{of the rest of the}} world ” – Kanayo Nwanze President International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). Indeed a bold statement considering parts of the continent are often stricken by drought and famine. While Africa is endowed with about 12 per cent of the world’s arable land suitable for agriculture, 80 per cent of such land remains uncultivated and irrigation is minimal. Yet, agriculture provides livelihoods for 80 per cent of the population in the Eastern African Community (EAC), where creating an enabling environment for equitable terms of trade among stakeholders in the sector is a must for the region’s development. This brief examines the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agriculture disciplines and negotiations, their impact on the EAC domestic and international trade relations, the opportunities arising, and how equitable agriculture development can best be enhanced by the multilateral trading system. Key Messages 1. EAC and its national governments should pursue meaningful market access for their agriculture products. 2. In facilitating trade and redressing current constraints, the EAC and its members should allocate sufficient budgetary resources that would complement Aid for Trade and <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Framework</b> initiatives in the region. 3. EAC and Member States should promote capacity building of stakeholders in the agriculture sector and prioritize the niche sectors in which the region has a comparative advantage. 4.

40|$|This Report is {{an update}} of the Cape Verde Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, titled Cape Verde’s Insertion into the Global Economy, {{produced}} and validated by the Government of Cape Verde in December 2008. Like the previous 2008 study, this Cape Verde Diagnostic Trade Integration Study Update provides a critical {{examination of the}} major institutional and production constraints that hinder Cape Verde’s ability to capitalize fully on the growth and welfare gains from its integration into the world economy. As a policy report, this study offers a set of priority policies and measures that can be implemented by {{both the public and}} private sectors to mitigate and surmount these supply side and institutional constraints. These recommendations are summarized in an Action Matrix. The Report is fruit of the generous support of the multi-donor program the <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Framework</b> (EIF). In every crisis there is an opportunity. Four years after the validation of the country’s first Diagnostic Trade Integration Study in 2008, Cape Verde finds itself in a drastically altered external environment. Cape Verde faces a worsened external environment than four years ago, when it was also traversing years of crisis as global food and energy prices escalated. Just as the country was validating its first trade study in late 2008, and celebrating its graduation from the list of Least Developed Countries, the onset of the deepest global recession in recent memory triggered an even worse external situation as the country’s principal source of markets, investments, remittances and aid, the Eurozone, unraveled economically and politically. As the Eurozone crisis spread, it was Cape Verde’s misfortune that the crisis contaminated precisely its biggest Eurozone partners and donors, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy. For such a highly dependent and exposed economy like that of Cape Verde, the deteriorating external sector has had a substantial negative impact on its macroeconomic performance. At the time of the validation workshop and graduation in 2008, no one could have foreseen or predicted the severity of the global crisis that followed. Despite traversing these years of adversity and external shocks, and suffering palpable setbacks, Cape Verde’s economy had proven surprisingly resilient, especially its principal sector, tourism. To its great credit, the country’s economic fundamentals are solid, and have been carefully and prudently managed over the years. For this reason alone, the country has thus far weathered the global and Eurozone crisis. Yet the near and medium term future remains uncertain. The country’s margin for maneuver has narrowed, its options far more limited, and hard choices lie ahead. Thus, there is no better time than now to analyze Cape Verde’s position in the global economy, and to examine the many challenges and opportunities it faces. The first diagnostic trade study outlined an ambitious agenda and set of policy strategies to enhance Cape Verde’s participation in the global economy. Written prior to the global crisis, the study did not, and could not, anticipate the scope and depth of the subsequent global and Eurozone crises. A few short months before the validation of the first DTIS Cape Verde joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). It has spent these four years adjusting to this status and implementing its commitments. At the same time, the country seeks greater economic integration with the European Union. Since 2008 the government has been investing heavily in the country’s economic infrastructure, focusing especially on fostering transformation in key sectors like agriculture, fisheries, tourism and creative industries. For these and many other reasons, it is both timely and urgent to review the road traveled since 2008. It is an opportune moment to reassess the country’s options, to rethink strategies, and to chart a new way forward that it is practical, implementable, and that builds on the country’s competitive advantages and current successes...|$|E
