[...] "We're really just trying to show that that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're just driving down the street, you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.' We're trying to show that this world {{is becoming more and}} more populated by zombies. Our thinking is that large population centers like Atlanta are really where the heart of this began and as [...] moved out to Hershel’s farm they didn’t really encounter very many walkers because they are moving out of the city center at a faster rate than the zombie population. And that zombie population is starting to catch up with them. The area is starting to become more and more dense with walkers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orwell {{tells us}} of his various {{movements}} between hospitals in Siétamo, Barbastro, and Monzón while getting his discharge papers stamped, after being declared medically unfit. He returns to Barcelona {{only to find}} that the POUM had been [...] "suppressed": it had been declared illegal the very day he had left to obtain discharge papers and POUM members were being arrested without charge. [...] "The attack on Huesca was beginning ... there must have been numbers of men who were killed without ever learning that the newspapers in the rear were calling them Fascists. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a little difficult to forgive." [...] He sleeps that night in the ruins of a church; he cannot go back to his hotel because of the danger of arrest.|$|E
60|$|Now {{when this}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> done in earnest, {{the result is}} one of those ill-distributed syllogisms which in rhetoric are called conceits.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} {{she came to}} a decision. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> unendurable; {{it would be better}} to get it over. Turning round so suddenly that Owen started, she said: ...|$|R
60|$|The father {{wondered}} if that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> current among that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> people. He had {{a sort of}} esthetic pleasure in the character and condition expressed by the words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] says Mr. Pendennis, archly, {{bending over}} his wife's fair hand--"I wonder whether this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{taking place in}} the drawing-room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very sensibly remarked, Miss Graves. I am sure Miss Gusset means well; {{and that}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> all very admirable in its way; but, but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes; I {{will hear}} you certainly, only this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> so painful to all parties, and I don't see {{the use of}} it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Linguist Patricia Cukor-Avila jokingly {{states that}} [...] "eventually {{all the people}} who hate this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>are</b> going to be dead, and the ones who use it {{are going to be in}} control." ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> gall and {{bitterness}} to Mrs. Morel, {{and she had}} a fair share of it. The women did not spare her, at first; for she was superior, though she could not help it.|$|R
6000|$|Nasmyth made a hasty gesture. [...] "You don't understand. She {{would no}} doubt have taken pity on any dumb creature. She did it because she could not help it. One could fancy that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> born in her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} with a mocking smile; [...] "not so many, after all. That's comforting, isn't it? This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> hard work, and damaging to the complexion." ...|$|E
6000|$|The pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He {{cleared his}} throat. [...] "These Anarchist--rascals," [...] said he, [...] "are fools, blind fools--to use bombs when this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> attainable. I think--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about the lawgivers," [...] said Clayton, [...] "but I have {{to say a word}} or two about the law. Do you think this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> going to remain?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Noise - Many {{results are}} {{reported}} that, while valid, {{are not very}} useful. The most common <b>of</b> these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> API error returns.

6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} not. Though I say it who shouldn't, Hester is the sweetest girl in Cambridgeshire. But her mother thinks her much {{too good to}} be given in {{marriage}} to any man. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> bound to come about some day.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Models about <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> These models <b>are</b> {{expressed}} as collections of relations <b>of</b> particular <b>kinds</b> between <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> They can <b>be</b> further subdivided {{in the following}} sub-categories: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> not healthy, my dear," [...] said Mr. Brooke. [...] "Casaubon, {{she will}} be in your hands now: you must teach my niece to take things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think this}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{altogether}} usual. Owing to the accident, they've no doubt had two trainloads to handle instead of one. But the platform's emptying; shall {{we look for}} a place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> {{going to}} count in the new armies," [...] Dick replied. [...] "Being popular on {{guest-night}} at the mess won't help a man to hold his trench or work his gun under heavy fire." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "All <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{going on}} within a band, {{but the most}} {{important}} reason is: the money. It is financially very difficult to make ends meet. We tried everything to be able to live off of it, but if you have to conclude after 10 years that you can't, then you have to stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|Early on {{the next}} morning he saw his friend and made some sort of {{laughing}} apology for his heat on the previous evening. [...] "It is so d---- hard when these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> said because a man has lent a young lady a horse. However, Tom, between you and me the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Art is imitation," [...] Evelyn remarked with {{a mocking}} smile. [...] "Why should one not imitate the {{drumming}} of horses' feet? or, for example, a storm at sea? I believe that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> popular at cheap concerts." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the verdict}} of the people is {{unanimously}} given. He ought not to have fooled with Mother Gooly's immortal part, {{to the neglect of}} the wheat crop. That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> not popular at Whiskyville. It is not business.--"Bullwhacker's Own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, {{if there}} is to be a fight, I'm good to go out with anybody,' said Dolly. 'When there's any beastly thing to be done, I've always got to do it. But don't you think that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a little slow?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Knowledge and {{requirements}} about a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> can <b>be</b> {{applied to the}} members <b>of</b> the <b>kind.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then Lord Rufford began. [...] "These <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} deuced hard upon a man. Of course if a {{man were}} a saint or a philosopher or a Joseph he wouldn't get into such scrapes,--and perhaps every man ought {{to be something of}} that sort. But I don't know how a man is to do it, unless it's born with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought {{rather more}} {{of him in}} the city," [...] Carroll replied. [...] "That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> new to him, and I'm {{inclined}} to believe I'd have let the folks he had to negotiate with have the mine for a good deal less than what he eventually got for it. But I've said something about that before, and after all I'm not here to play Boswell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will not}} be bound by such a promise for a moment. It is a thing not to be heard of. If that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to go on, any young lady will be {{entitled}} to ask any young gentleman not {{to say a word}} of marriage, just at her request." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, my dear, {{that all}} this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> too monstrous to be thought of. Goodness, gracious, me; two young {{people like you and}} Louis, who {{thoroughly}} love each other, and who have got a baby, to think of being separated! Of course it is out of the question." ...|$|E
6000|$|Coulthurst laughed again, good-humouredly. [...] "Of course I {{remember}} that, too, though I hope you've {{grown out}} of your fondness for taking liberties with other people's property. That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> still less tolerated in this country. In the meanwhile {{we have a good}} way to go before we camp. Once more, I'm much obliged to you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Principle of Sensory-Motor Coordination: Ideally, {{internal}} {{mechanisms in}} an agent should {{give rise to}} things like memory and choice-making in an emergent fashion, rather than being prescriptively programmed from the beginning. These <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> allowed to emerge as the agent interacts with the environment. The motto is, build fewer assumptions into the agent's controller now, so that learning can be more robust and idiosyncratic in the future.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Accordingly,' resumed Mr Toots, 'I {{acted on}} my own. Bright {{was the day}} on which I did so! Feeder! Nobody but myself can tell what the {{capacity}} of that woman's mind is. If ever the Rights of Women, and all that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>are</b> properly attended to, it will be through her powerful intellect--Susan, my dear!' said Mr Toots, looking abruptly out of the windows 'pray do not exert yourself!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Pope of The Fayetteville Observer {{said that}} while he doesn't condone the actions of Kenseth, [...] "NASCAR is as much at fault for what {{happened}} as Kenseth or Logano. They let the foundation for this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>be</b> built by not blackflagging an overly aggressive Logano, who could’ve gotten somebody killed, at Kansas. Kenseth was fed up with being pushed around, and Sunday, he pushed back." ...|$|R
