5000|$|In {{line with}} how {{a lot of}} theorizing has gone in the last century, {{comparative}} research does not tend to investigate [...] "grand theories," [...] such as Marxism.

A {{good example of this}} is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of <b>decommodification</b> of social welfare goods. He found {{that he was able to}} class welfare states into three types, based on their level of <b>decommodification.</b> He further theorized from this that <b>decommodification</b> was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of <b>decommodification,</b> then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.|$|E

5000|$|The three {{welfare state}} regimes {{highlight}} employment opportunity, wage gaps, and health status as differentiating factors {{when it comes}} to gender. In terms of employment opportunity, it is impacted by the feminization of poverty. This is when woman represent a disproportionate share of the poor population compared to men. [...] Varying beliefs between the three regimes on gender roles in the labor market effects the level of poverty pertaining toward sex. Wage gaps are affected by the differing beliefs on <b>decommodification</b> between the three welfare state regimes. The theory of <b>decommodification</b> looks to decommodify labor in order to substitute for wages, creating disparity between the pay of low-income earners (a category over-represented by women). [...] Lastly, health status is seen to be influenced by the promotion of gender equality. Those regimes, which believe in equality for all, were seen to have better overall health, compared to those regimes that do not promote gender equality.|$|E

5000|$|Conferences {{formed to}} address the issues in water {{governance}} such as the Third World Water Forum are becoming more apparent in the 21st century; however these can often fall foul to the same endemic problems outlined above. NGOs and members of civil society criticised the Third World Water Forum for failing to declare water a human right and continuing to prefer commodification as {{the solution to the}} current water crisis. They argue that the world’s poor stand to become worse off as a result of commodification as objectives of social equality and universal access are traded in for economic efficiency and profit. The social inequality and environmental degradation that have arisen are proof that economic valuation failed to take into account key social and environmental costs of using water. Nevertheless, there is opposition to the continued commodification Polanyi [...] termed ‘counter movement’. In this case they are concerned with returning water back to the global commons. NGOs and members of civil society have formed voluntary networks with the aim of banning future decisions to further commodify water. These movements have arisen in opposition to capitalist accumulation through globalisation and are serving to decrease the trend in commodification. Full commodification faces difficulties theoretically as it relies on an economic good or service being standardised and readily exchangeable in the market place irrespective of its spatial and temporal dimensions. Bakker argues that this is nigh on impossible for water due to its biophysical characteristics that contravene all efforts to fully commodify. Capitalism depends on a changing balance between (re-) commodification and <b>decommodification,</b> which as Jessop [...] points out means that the processes of commodification, <b>decommodification</b> and recommodification will continue to appear in ‘waves’ due to capitalism's continual pursuit of accumulation by dispossession.|$|E
5000|$|Political {{scientist}} Benjamin Radcliff {{has argued}} that more generous social programs produce a higher {{quality of life for}} all citizens, rich and poor alike, as such programs not only improve life for those directly receiving benefits (or living in fear of someday needing them, from the prospect of unemployment or illness) but also reduce the social pathologies (such as crime and anomie) that are the result of poverty and insecurity. By creating a society with less poverty and less insecurity, he argues, we move closer to creating a nation of shared prosperity that works to the advantage of all. Thus, his research suggests, life satisfaction (or [...] "happiness") is strongly related to the generosity of the social safety net (what economists often call <b>decommodification),</b> whether looking across the industrial democracies or across the American states.|$|E

5000|$|Even though {{countries}} are placed into these three welfare state regimes, many {{are very close}} in ideologies with one another. The nations which are identified under each welfare state regime can be classified as ‘prototypes’. This means that each welfare state regime identified {{should not be taken}} as an ideal type. This notion derives from Esping Andersen’s <b>decommodification</b> and social stratification index. The index highlights that each country varies in the strength of how strictly they follow the welfare state it is categorized under. Due to {{the fact that many of}} the social issues which a country faces is intersectional, they may take on another welfare states ideology to target a certain issue. [...] For example, Esping-Anderson notes that, “European conservative regimes have incorporated both liberal and social democratic impulses. Over the decades, they have become less corporatist and less authoritarian.” [...] A lot of the scrutiny which Esping-Anderson’s research concluded was due to the legitimacy of what each welfare state represented. It is important to realize this when looking at gender issues in the welfare state regimes.|$|E
5000|$|Perceived {{health status}} is {{impacted}} {{in a couple}} of ways in regards the welfare state regimes. These factors include benefits received through differing ideologies and socio-economic disadvantages which groups of people face. When focusing on benefits which people receive, liberal welfare states have minimal access to benefits because of the minimal government influence. As well, privatized care requires means testing and strict criteria in order to be considered for care. The conservative welfare state has benefits which are earnings related and depend on what the employer decides to offer their employees. Conservative regimes also believe in family ties which impact the amount of personal care a person receives. The liberal and conservative welfare state regimes provide benefits depending on an individuals engagement in the workforce. As has been noted, women tend to face a disadvantage in employment opportunity and wages. This makes it difficult to receive good health benefits in liberal and conservative regimes. The social democratic welfare state believes in universal public care services in return for full employment by society. The social democratic regime believes in creating equality for all with access to good health and health care. This regime is able to do this because it has a fully contributive market economy which agrees to decommidifying their labour for this care. [...] A study conducted by Eikemo et. al depicts how welfare state regimes impact health issues caused by socio-economic disadvantages. The authors do so through the European Social Survey which focused on 21 different countries. The main findings were that liberal and social democratic regimes had a higher perceived health rating than the conservative regime. The study relates these findings to the <b>decommodification</b> theory. Liberal and social democratic regimes substitute worker wages and receive care service to compensate for that loss.These services are seen to correlate with better health. On the other hand, the conservative view rejects decommodifiction, causing the access for necessary care to be lower. Socio-economic explanations for gender health also point to women being more vulnerable to health problems. Women disproportionally represent the poorer populations across the welfare state regimes. Women who are economically deprived are more vulnerable to infectious disease, arthritis, migraines, stress, mental illness (depression), and increased risk to heart disease.|$|E
5000|$|As was {{highlighted}} by Hadas Mandel and Michael Shalev in their theoretical analysis {{looking at how}} the welfare states shape the gender pay gap, the theories of decommodfication and defamilialization underline the key differences. ‘Decommodification believes in decommodifying labour in order to substitute a workers wage with direct means of income transfers, or indirectly through free or subsidized goods and services (social insurance, cash benefits, public housing, free public services). Defamilialization is the state taking action for care work {{in order to allow}} more females to be able to join the work force as opposed to tending to the family all day’. Both of these theories combine to allow the labour force to grow with a larger female population. The liberal welfare state regime and the social democratic welfare state regime both support these theories. The liberal welfare state looks to encourage the activity of people in a free market economy {{and to be able to}} support themselves with private social and family services. The liberal regime calls for women to join the work force in order to pay for these services and contribute to the economy. The social democratic welfare state believes in universalism which means that government provides public services, and thus allows more women to join the work force. In opposition to both of these regimes, the conservative welfare state mostly rejects <b>decommodification</b> and defamilialization. Conservative beliefs prefer a status differentiating society and value the traditional family roles to maintain that. Thus, women are expected to tend to the family, while men remain the primary breadwinners. To help display the differences that these theories have on the gender pay gap, Hadas Mandel continued his research to discover how welfare state policies effect socio-economic positions. He did so using the Luxembourg Income Study from 21 advanced countries, looking at the gender pay gap with low and high income earners. When it comes to low income earners, the study found that there was not a significant wage gap between men and women in the liberal and social democratic regimes. Where there was a significant wage gap was in social democratic regimes and high income wage earners. The study found that this category of earners had a considerably larger gap than the liberal and conservative regimes for high income earners. Also, as was hypothesized in the study, the conservative welfare state had higher gender wage gaps than the other welfare states with low income earners and still had a recognizable gap with high income earners. The conclusion of the study was that the gender wage gap was determined by the advantage or disadvantage mothers faced with the welfare states interference. A similar study done by Solomon Polachek and Jun Xiang, used the same Luxembourg Income Study, but looked at different factors that influence the gender income wage gaps. This study concluded that fertility rate, age gap between spouses in their first marriage, and the top marginal income tax rate are all factors which correlate with the results. This states that there are external social factors which influence the pay gap between men and women, as well as the institutional factors which were noted previously.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} resolve the gender {{blindness}} of Esping-Andersen's <b>decommodification</b> index and examine which socioeconomic and political forces that explain <b>decommodification</b> when female <b>decommodification</b> is accounted for. To answer these questions a multiple regression analysis is utilized with the same eighteen OECD countries as used by Esping-Andersen, but with a time series of 1971 - 2002. Documented research on welfare policies and the <b>decommodification</b> of women {{has been plagued by}} a limited time perspective and theory generating work using descriptive statistics. Critique of the <b>decommodification</b> index can be divided into four main categories: limited regime typology with only three welfare regime types, operational validity, replicability and its gender blindness. By gender blindness they mean the index's lack of perspective when it comes to female <b>decommodification.</b> In this thesis the latter three problems are addressed. The field of comparative welfare state research has a long tradition of trying to understand what explains welfare regimes' development. The problem, before Esping-Andersen's work and to a lesser degree after, has been that contrasting conclusions have been drawn on what explains it based on data operationalization and methods used. There is however a strong consensus on the positive effect from left leaning political parties on <b>decommodification</b> and this still holds true for my findings. The central new findings of this thesis is that family welfare policies are the most effective policy tools for keeping women employed. The paradox is that by increasing the proportion of active female labor they also qualify for higher levels of <b>decommodification</b> in the form of replacement rates. My improved <b>decommodification</b> index incorporates these policies and by doing so alleviate the critique of gender blindness. Furthermore what explain <b>decommodification,</b> and especially family welfare policies, are female politicians independent of party loyalties. Implicating that female politicians are the prime example of practicing political self-interests...|$|E

40|$|Although the decommodifying {{capacity}} of states (effort {{to provide a}} standard of living independent of the market) has been a key focus of welfare state research, its relevance for gender has been less clear. Given large scale changes in gender relations with growing economic, political, and familial equality I suggest the need to reevaluate <b>decommodification</b> {{from the perspective of}} gender. Results from descriptive and regression analyses reveal that gender influences are significantly linked to <b>decommodification</b> outcomes. Increases in women’s employment and political representation and declining fertility are positively associated with <b>decommodification.</b> Most variation is between nations, yet, a consistent effect of women’s labour force participation suggests its influence both within and across welfare states. Outcomes roughly correspond to accepted welfare typologies, and implications for future research on <b>decommodification</b> are discussed...|$|E
