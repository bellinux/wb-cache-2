40|$|A <b>geodetic</b> <b>control</b> <b>network</b> is the {{wire-frame}} or {{the skeleton}} on which continuous and consistent mapping, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and surveys are based. Traditionally, geodetic control points are established as permanent physical monuments {{placed in the}} ground and precisely marked, located, and documented. With the development of satellite surveying methods and their availability and high degree of accuracy, a <b>geodetic</b> <b>control</b> <b>network</b> could be established by using GNSS and referred to an international terrestrial reference frame used as a three-dimensional geocentric reference system for a country. Based on this concept, in 1992, the Egypt Survey Authority (ESA) established two networks, namely High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN) and the National Agricultural Cadastral Network (NACN). To transfer the International Terrestrial Reference Frame to the HARN, the HARN was connected with four IGS stations. The processing results were 1 : 10, 000, 000 (Order A) for HARN and 1 : 1, 000, 000 (Order B) for NACN relative network accuracy standard between stations defined in ITRF 1994 Epoch 1996.

An alternative form of spatio-temporal infrastructure that is feasible and practical to establish might involve the use of Digital Terrain Model (DTM) databases. These databases use higher positional resolutions, and are exhibiting an increasing level of positional and height accuracy. Still, when comparing temporal DTMs, the separation of actual physical phenomena from data-related ambiguities is essential in the framework of spatio-temporal analysis. This paper proposes the use of a hierarchical co-modeling of different DTM databases for the task of landform monitoring.
