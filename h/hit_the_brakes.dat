500|$|Webber {{said he was}} {{at fault}} for causing the {{accident}} between himself and Rosberg on lap nineteen; [...] "I thought I'd managed to catch it but I lost the car and made contact with the wall. Then Nico hit me, which wrecked his race as well. It was my mistake and it wasn't my day." [...] Rosberg was puzzled over the incident; he said, [...] "I don't understand why Webber didn't <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> It was crazy to roll back across the track like that." [...] Gerhard Berger, who raced in Formula One for thirteen years, courted controversy when he accused Webber of causing the incident deliberately and claimed Webber planned to take out either Alonso or Hamilton. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner defended Webber {{in an interview with}} The Daily Telegraph, saying it was [...] "absurd" [...] that Webber attempted to take out another competitor and stated the car suffered heavy damage with the collision with the wall. Webber later went to Rosberg and apologised for the crash on the Friday before the Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a witness}} interviewed by NPR, Salihee {{was killed by}} the first bullet fired. Another witness interviewed by NPR stated that Salihee saw the soldiers, and was shot as he <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> A third witness interviewed by NPR said that three shots were fired, the first as the car tried to stop. The witness said the car was coming [...] "very fast" [...] but screeched to a halt.|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, Bede came up {{with another}} novel {{solution}} {{to the problems of}} converting pilots to the new aircraft. They took an engine-less example and bolted it to the front of a pickup truck on a trapeze, attaching the pilot's throttle control to the truck's. Pilots could test fly the aircraft without danger - if a problem developed the driver of the truck simply <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Jack Rabbit : A wooden {{roller coaster}} opened in 1920 {{designed}} by John A. Miller and built by Harry C. Baker. The ride {{consists of an}} initial 7 story drop, then two hills, a flat turn, another two hills, another flat turn and lastly a dip inside a dark tunnel before <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Driving the Death Star - When the Death Star pilot {{has to go}} to the bathroom, he has Gary the Stormtrooper {{take over}} the Death Star, but when they near a planet, Gary <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> causing a series of unfortunate events around the Death Star. Gary {{eventually}} stops the Death Star before it crushes his daughter's elementary school.|$|R
50|$|The car's Electronic Stability Control (ESC) feature {{allows for}} {{right amount of}} braking force to each wheel so that the car doesn't lose direction. <b>The</b> Anti lock <b>Braking</b> System (ABS) helps the car from {{skidding}} on slippery roads. Hillstart Assist Control (HAC) prevents rollback during a hill start. This feature automatically detects an incline and <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> as <b>the</b> driver is about to accelerate.|$|R

50|$|Homer {{is driving}} {{in his usual}} manner and style (ineptly and recklessly) when he careens into an alleyway, with no room to {{maneuver}} and no time to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> where a Santa's Little Helper and the now-homeless Gil are eating out of trash cans. Homer is horrified by the notion of hitting a sweet and lovable dog, so he slams into Gil instead, who ends up with a serious neck injury and plans to sue the Simpsons for everything they've got.|$|E
50|$|The train's {{conductor}} <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> {{as soon as}} he saw Briat, {{but because}} of momentum, was not able to stop the train in time to prevent it from hitting him. Briat's leg was severed by the train. As he did not die immediately, paramedics started to take him to the hospital, but he died before reaching the hospital. Germany has an agreement with France which allows Germany to send its nuclear waste to France for reprocessing, as long as Germany takes it back afterward for storage.|$|E
50|$|After {{the train}} leaves the station, the ride makes two turns before riders climb the 55 ft (17 m) lift hill. After the drop the ride turns and goes up a bunny hill. It is {{followed}} by many bunny hills, a tunnel, and even banked turns. Shortly after, <b>the</b> ride <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and returns <b>the</b> train back to the station.|$|R
50|$|On {{their way}} home in Boycie's Jaguar, Rodney accidentally throws the cigar pack out the window, and when Del <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> {{to get out and}} recover it, another car smashes {{into the back of the}} Jaguar. The Trotter Brothers find out that it was the faulty Cortina driven by the Australian man, who gets out and chases them up the street.|$|R
50|$|After all riders are buckled up, {{the ride}} {{begins with a}} small sharp turn to the right. Then the riders are lifted up to 24m. Train drops {{a little bit and}} banks to the right again. Riders then take a 21m drop, leading to a {{vertical}} loop, then a large turn to the right. Next element is a double corkscrew. Trains turn again before <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Frank Manley: [...] "Sylvia said “The white line, {{the white}} line’s gone. Stop!" [...] I just <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and I said “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t stop.” And next thing we just hung off the gap...when I swung the door open, I could see, more or less, see the water...and I just swung meself towards {{the back of}} the car and grabbed the {{headrest}} like that to pull myself around. There's a big automatic transmission pan underneath car - that's what it balanced on." ...|$|E
50|$|The ride {{starts with}} a lift hill. Unlike the {{traditional}} chain lift, the Roller Coaster's lift hill use drive tires, which many coasters use to roll into a train station. At {{the end of the}} lift, riders face a swooping banked curve, leading to a camelback hill, then a highly banked curve to the right. Another hill appears, followed by a large turn, leading riders to a cave in middle of the air. Trains then bank for the last time and <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> A small curve leads riders to the station.|$|E
5000|$|... "A couple {{miles up}} Archer there, she jumped {{with a start}} like a horse and said 'Here! Here!' I <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> I looked around and didn't see no kind of house. 'Where?' I said. And then she sticks out her arm and points across the road to my left and says 'There!'. And that's when it happened. I looked to my left, like this, at this little shack. And when I turned she was gone. Vanished! And the car door never opened. May the good Lord strike me dead, it never opened." ...|$|E
50|$|Riding {{the boat}} again, James forcefully <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{knocking}} Frank into the lake, but James and Emma {{bring him back}} on board to safety. When a crocodile appears, James draws his gun and the crocodile dives under to knock the three off the boat. The boat is demolished, and all three go to land unharmed. The three meet Struthers and Ahmad, who drove a plane to distract the crocodile.|$|R
50|$|Camaro Challenge: The Swerve and Avoid - This annual {{challenge}} {{is dedicated to}} {{a fan of the}} show, who had taken the lessons from this challenge to heart and had narrowly avoided a truck using the skills taught from this challenge; {{she and her husband were}} invited to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre as guests for this challenge. Contestants will have two attempts at passing at 70 km/h. Lance <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and fails on the first go, and in his induced anxiety he fails his second run. Jamie, despite her nervousness, passes on her first try. Dale misinterprets her senses and <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> car on the first try, and <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> on <b>the</b> second try. Despite Donna's yelling, Brad also passes, a stark contrast from the earlier cornering challenge. Diane fails going too slow and braking far beforehand, and is convinced to drive up to 100 km/h on a practice run before attempting her second run. On that run, she accelerates to 80 km/h, and almost clears it; she nevertheless is considered to have passed the challenge for overcoming her speed fears. Dean clears the obstacle at 80 km/h, but later spins out of control, and so fails that run. He skids too far and loses control in the second run, as well.|$|R
25|$|He then <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> to stop {{while she}} stops her motorcycle. Rikrok then hears a noise {{behind him and}} it's the other accomplices and the girlfriend driving the {{convertible}} {{on the other side}} of the bridge with the highway down below. An eighteen-wheeler drives by, and Shaggy leaves Rikrok a text message telling him to look behind and he notices the truck and jumps off the side of overhead and lands on the truck. He is then dropped off at Shaggy's mansion, showing the same scene from the start of the video.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 May 2005, while {{filming a}} {{commercial}} with his troupe in Mexico City, an overtaking car slammed into his motorcycle caravan, sending Ponce {{flying into the}} air and injuring three other actors. Ponce {{was rushed to the hospital}} but died early the next morning. Police charged the driver with involuntary homicide and detected alcohol on his breath, but believed he did not intend to kill Ponce. Ponce's co-star Poncho de Nigris accused the man of trying to hit them, stating, [...] "the car didn't <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> or anything".|$|E
50|$|The {{train was}} {{arriving}} into Zagreb from Vinkovci at 19.45 local time. The driver, Nikola Knežević {{and his assistant}} Stjepan Varga, were both exhausted, both of them having worked for two full days.A subsequent investigation into the accident showed that the train at several sites exceeded the speed limit by nearly 70 kilometers per hour, so that instead of entering the station at the speed limit of 40 km/h, the engine driver rushed in with a speed of 104 km/h. They also began to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> too late, so that the train derailed and soon became an unrecognizable wreck.|$|E
50|$|On December 11, 2012, Secret was {{involved}} in a car accident. According to a report by Sports Chosun, around 2:00 am in Korean standard time, the van that Secret rode in was filmed speeding down the highway by another vehicle with a camera. It was then seen hitting an ice patch which caused their van to slide and veer off the road hitting the guardrail and flipping over. The van was then caught passing in front of another car, however, the other driver managed to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and avoided slamming into the band's van, which would have resulted in the van's crash becoming more serious.|$|E
50|$|The ride {{begins by}} exiting {{the station and}} {{ascending}} a 106 ft tall chain lift. The train will then bank left making a 180 degree turn and enter a 106 ft tall 90 degree drop, followed by a dive loop. The train then will rise up {{to the right and}} drop again, entering a hill followed by several turns. After the turns it drops and turns into a zero g stall followed by a zero g roll. It does an over banked turn to <b>the</b> left then <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run.|$|R
5000|$|At a gas station, Jim {{sees the}} {{hitchhiker}} {{climb out of}} a truck. Inside, he introduces himself as John Ryder and asks for a ride. Reluctantly, Jim agrees. While on the road, he becomes violent and attacks them, holding a knife to Grace's eye. He tells Jim {{the only way to}} save them both is to say [...] "I want to die". Jim <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> causing <b>the</b> hitchhiker to <b>hit</b> his head on the windshield and kicks him repeatedly until Grace opens the passenger door and he is pushed out.|$|R
5000|$|The Superman: Tower of Power at Six Flags St. Louis was {{manufactured}} by Intamin, {{and is one}} of Intamin's [...] "Giant Drop" [...] models. Riders sit in open-air ski lift style seats that face away from the tower, leaving their feet dangling. The cars lift up slowly at first, but quickly accelerate to 12 mph (19 km/h) after leaving <b>the</b> magnetic <b>brakes.</b> Riders are held {{at the top of the}} 23-story tower for several seconds at the top. The cars are then released in a random order and free fall some 129 ft (39 m), reaching 62 mph (100 km/h) before <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{accident}} {{brought out}} a full course caution and the remaining drivers were told to slow down for the safety car. On the front stretch, Yokoyama was behind a group of cars that slowed down awaiting for the safety car to come out. However, Yokoyama was approaching the field too fast and before he could <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> he hit one car and became airborne. The force of the impact sent Yokoyama into a signboard; the car disintegrated and then fell to the pavement. Yokoyama died instantly from severe injuries sustained in the crash and the organizers decided to cancel {{the rest of the}} race. He was 25 years old.|$|E
5000|$|After {{falling to}} 23rd one-lap down {{following}} flat left-front tire at lap 200 and rallying to a sixth-place finish, Jimmie Johnson {{said that the}} whole ordeal [...] "was really weird. I went into Turn 3 and got on the brakes and the car traveled and slowed down. It felt like something broke in the left-front, but they {{said there was a}} lugnut inside the wheel. I guess when I <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> to slow down a lugnut hit the valve stem and took the tire out. Fortunately some cautions fell in quick order to let us get back on the lead lap. We had a solid car and got up there to ninth or something and some guys ran out of fuel and got us to sixth.” ...|$|E
50|$|The deliveryman boards glumly, {{and starts}} off, unaware of his stowaways. With him come the {{shouting}} and bickering voices of Carlene and Rhonda, much to Mibs’ displeasure, {{accompanied by the}} voice of Bobbi’s tattoo. As they reach the road, though, the bus turns {{the opposite direction of}} Salina. The kids can’t say anything, so they stay quiet and still, hiding {{at the back of the}} bus. They drive for a long time until Bobbi gets bored and kicks Fish, who’s sitting at the end of the cot. Fish’s powers vex, and there’s a mini windstorm of chaos at the back of the bus, prompting the bus driver to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> Samson calms Fish’s anger, just as the bus driver shows up at the back of the bus, mad as he can possibly be.|$|E
5000|$|On November 25, 2009 Toyota amended its {{floor mat}} recall {{involving}} the same 3.8 millionvehicles sold in North America. Toyota will reconfigure the accelerator pedal, replace the all-weather floor mats with thinner mats, and install a brake override system to prevent unwanted acceleration. <b>The</b> <b>brake</b> override system, also called [...] "brake to idle" [...] and already a common design in German cars, allows {{the driver to}} override <b>the</b> accelerator by <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> In a follow-up statement, the NHTSA announced the November 25, 2009 recall details as a [...] "vehicle-based remedy" [...] to address the floor mat pedal issue. According to Toyota, the repair work done under the amended recall for floor mat incursion problems are as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the trip}} arm may <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> lever directly, {{there have been}} {{installations}} where every wagon of a train has a separate trip cock on each bogie that has brakes. Hence in some installations the trip arm will be folded back to the safe position {{only a few seconds}} after a signal has turned red in order to reduce wear (which is an actual security risk as shown in the 1995 Russell Hill subway accident). Because of wear the trip arms for the opposite direction on the same rail will be actuated along with the trip arm for the nominal direction.|$|R
50|$|The ride {{will begin}} with a 50 mph (80 km/h) LSM launch into a 27m tall top hat element, which will pass under the lift hill of the Big One. The train will then {{navigate}} a tall helix before a series of highly banked turns, followed by an inline twist. A second launch will follow, which goes into an Immelmann loop. Another series of highly banked turns and s-curves will follow, before <b>the</b> train <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run and re-enters the station. The track will interact with many existing roller coasters, including the Big One, Steeplechase and the Big Dipper.|$|R
5000|$|Mountain bike {{suspension}} {{technology has}} made great advances since first {{appearing in the}} early 1990s. Early full suspension frames were heavy and tended to bounce up and down while a rider pedaled. This movement was called pedal bob, kickback, or monkey motion and took power out of a rider's pedal stroke [...] - [...] especially during climbs up steep hills. Input from hard braking efforts also negatively affected early full suspension designs. When a rider <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> these early suspensions compressed into their travel and lost some {{of their ability to}} absorb bumps. This happened in situations where the rear suspension was needed most. When braking efforts cause the suspension to compress it is referred to as brake squat, when braking causes the suspension to extend it is called brake jack.|$|E
50|$|Rantauprapat {{is a town}} in North Sumatra {{province}} of Indonesia {{and it is the}} seat (capital) of Labuhanbatu Regency. Rantauprapat is also a village in the district of Rantau Utara (North Rantau). It consists of 3 main roads. There was a saying (when Rantauprapat had only one main road) that if you forget to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> once you see the town, you will have passed the town. According to several trip agencies, the Suzuya hotel/mall is the best hotel in Rantauprapat. A number of citizens move to larger cities like Medan in search for more job opportunities and/or universities. In the year 2003 its status of administrative city was erased as it did not fulfill the requirements. A large river named the Bilah River runs through the town. It has 133740 inhabitants (as of 2010).|$|E
50|$|Ryan {{then walked}} towards the town centre of Hungerford, where police were {{attempting}} to evacuate the public. During this, Ryan killed 67-year-old Douglas Wainwright and injured his wife Kathleen in their car. Kathleen would later say that her husband <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> {{as soon as the}} windscreen shattered. Ryan fired eight rounds into the Wainwrights' Datsun Bluebird, hitting Douglas in the head and Kathleen in the chest and shoulder. Kathleen, seeing that her husband was dead and that Ryan was approaching the car whilst reloading, unbuckled her seatbelt and ran. The pair were visiting their son, a policeman on the Hungerford force. Coincidentally, Constable Wainwright had signed Ryan's request to extend his firearm certificate only weeks earlier. Next was Kevin Lance, who was shot in the upper arm as he drove his Ford Transit along Tarrant's Hill.|$|E
50|$|The train {{climbs up}} a 117ft lift hill and {{drops to the}} right 111ft and goes {{straight}} into the first inversion, a vertical loop (1 inversion) then slightly banks right then straight again {{ready for the next}} two inversions, a cobra roll (2 inversions) then once out the cobra roll it goes straight into a zero g roll (1 inversion) then does a 360-degree helix to <b>the</b> right and <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run before turning right into another brake run and finally turns right into the station ready to unload/load again. In total it has 4 inversions.|$|R
50|$|Riders {{exit the}} station and make a tight left turn before the lift begins pulling them to the top. A small drop, along with a turn, brings the train to the largest drop on the roller coaster. Directly after the drop, the two loops exist {{followed}} by a small hill with a banked turn. As the train makes its way over the walkway it flips riders twice in two corkscrews, one directly after the other. These make Carolina Cyclone the first ever coaster with four inversions. After the corkscrews riders are taken to a near-ground helix before <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> run and returning to the station.|$|R
5000|$|A team of MIT mathematicians has {{developed}} a model that describes the formation of [...] "phantom jams," [...] in which small disturbances (a driver <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> too hard, or getting too close to another car) in heavy traffic can become amplified into a full-blown, self-sustaining traffic jam. Key to the study is {{the realization that the}} mathematics of such jams, which the researchers call [...] "jamitons," [...] are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions, says Aslan Kasimov, lecturer in MIT's Department of Mathematics. That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic-jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s.|$|R
