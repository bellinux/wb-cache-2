5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E

5|$|With a large {{anticyclone}} centered near Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Carlotta turned {{more to the}} west. Deep convection {{increased in}} coverage and intensity as the system maintained impressive upper-level outflow over its southern semicircle. Late on June 20, Hurricane Carlotta began a period of rapid deepening, with warm waters and a very favorable upper-level environment, and in a twelve-hour period the pressure dropped 49mbar to an estimated minimum central pressure of 932mbar at 0600UTC on June 21; at the same time, Carlotta attained peak winds of 155mph (250km/h) while located about 285miles (455km) southwest of Acapulco. At {{the time of its}} peak intensity, Carlotta maintained a well-defined central dense overcast around an eye of 20miles (36km) in diameter. Satellite intensity estimates indicated winds of 160mph (260km/h), though through much of its duration there was a sizable <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> estimated winds and that of winds reported by Hurricane Hunters.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} also {{released}} in the United States, by the New York branch of Méliès's company. During the summer of 1905, Klaw & Erlanger showed it at the Aerial Gardens, on the rooftop of the New Amsterdam Theatre. In the American release, the scenes were slightly rearranged: {{the first and second}} scenes were switched in order, as were the sixth and seventh. In addition, because of a renumbering, ten tableaux were advertised instead of the French catalogue's twelve, although no scenes were removed. (The two prints of the film surviving in the Méliès family's archive, the Cinémathèque Méliès, use the French ordering of the scenes.) Another <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> French and American catalogues occurs for political reasons: the American catalog specifies that the protagonist is King Leopold, but the French one keeps the identity anonymous, so as not to offend Belgian audiences. Similarly, the Alps in the film are named as such in the American catalog but are unnamed in the French one.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Maemi left about 1.47million {{electric}} customers {{without power}} around the country, causing ₩12.9billion (KRW, $11.61million USD) in damage to power companies. Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell phone service. United States {{military bases in}} the country sustained about $4.5million in damage. Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000houses and damaged 13,000homes and businesses, leaving 25,000people homeless. About 150businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt. Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at ₩650billion (KRW, $565million), mostly property damage. The insured damage was over four {{times the amount of}} insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior. Overall damage was estimated at ₩5.52trillion (KRW, $4.8billion USD). By comparison, this total was ₩2.52trillion (KRW, $1.9billion USD) less than Rusa; the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> insured and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall. The storm killed 117people throughout South Korea.|$|E
