40|$|International audienceThis study {{examines}} {{the role of}} national culture on the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) rhetoric contained within <b>franchisee</b> <b>recruitment</b> promotional materials, where EO rhetoric {{is defined as the}} strategic use of words in organizational narratives to convey the risk taking, innovativeness, proactiveness, autonomy and competitive aggressiveness of the firm. The sample comprised 378 franchise organizations, in five different countries (Australia, France, India, South Africa and the UK). The results indicate that franchise systems operating in high uncertainty avoidance and feminine cultures use less entrepreneurially oriented rhetoric, suggesting that EO rhetoric in franchise organizations varies according to different national cultural contexts...|$|E

40|$|A {{shortage}} of suitable franchisee applicants {{has been identified}} by franchisors as a major hindrance to franchise sector growth in Australia. However, {{there has been little}} investigation into this issue within the organisational choice literature. This represents an important gap in the literature. In order to explore this issue it was first necessary to determine the expectations of franchisors regarding suitable franchisee prospects. Hence, this research explores desirable franchisee attributes and the factors that influence <b>franchisee</b> <b>recruitment,</b> together with suggestions on how franchisors may improve promotion of themselves to potential franchisees. A convenience sample of 12 franchisors was selected for participation. Respondents were interviewed about their current recruitment practices and the qualities they sought in franchisees. Findings suggest that while there is a core set of generic franchisee attributes, franchisors also need to determine a sub-set of additional attributes that are consistent with their own system requirements.

40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{factors that}} contribute to the success of franchising in the Australasian real estate brokerage industry. Evidence from both franchisor and franchisee perspectives reveals underlying fundamentals of competitive advantage. System success is argued {{to be based on the}} development of a complementary resource competency that ensures relationship sustainability. The franchisee adds value to the franchisor-initiated system and brand by developing presence and expertise in the local market. <b>Franchisee</b> screening and <b>recruitment</b> strategy is important, with prior experience and industry acculturation occupying a central place as a driver of success. The nature of entrepreneurship is a key question addressed and the strength of the entrepreneurial alliance is shown to be a component of the success equation. The pursuit of explanations beyond agency and resource scarcity theory widens the theoretical lens for examining the ubiquitous phenomenon of franchising in the real estate domain...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This is {{the first}} attempt to examine the {{theoretical}} and empirical linkages between franchisee personality traits and franchisee-franchisor relationship quality. Design/methodology/approach - A self-report online survey {{was used in this}} research to collect data from a random sample of 225 franchisees drawn across 80 franchise systems. Personality was represented by the Big Five personality traits (IPIP-B 5 scales) and relationship quality was conceptualized as a 23 -item second-order construct (incorporating trust, commitment and relationship satisfaction). Regression analysis was used to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings - Four of the five personality dimensions had the predicted effect on the outcome variable of relationship quality. Dimensions of "agreeableness", "conscientiousness", "emotional stability" had a positive effect on relationship quality, while "extraversion" had a negative effect on the dependent variable. Implications of these results are discussed. Research limitations/implications - Although personality is a valid predictor of work-related behaviours, future research should investigate the impact of other individual-level influences (e. g. autonomy, self-esteem, entrepreneurial fervour) on franchisee-franchisor relationship quality. Overall, the authors recommend administration of the Big Five tests in <b>franchisee</b> <b>recruitment</b> and ongoing management activities. Originality/value - The manuscript introduces the need to extend current inter-organisational approaches to understanding franchise relationships through the inclusion of interpersonal constructs like personality dimensions. In effect, it calls for a marriage of B 2 B and B 2 C perspectives to examining the franchising and more generally the relationship marketing phenomenon. No Full Tex...|$|E
