5|$|<b>Fleshy</b> lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins {{seem to have}} been an ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned ancestors of the tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have <b>fleshy</b> frontal fins.|$|E

5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the <b>fleshy</b> part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of <b>fleshy</b> fruits.|$|E
5|$|Also, gape rosette. A <b>fleshy</b> rosette {{found at}} the corners of the beaks of some birds, such as the puffin. In the puffin, this is grown as part of its display plumage.|$|E
5|$|Coconut (Cocos nucifera), used {{worldwide}} as a food. The <b>fleshy</b> part of {{the seed}} is edible, and used either desiccated or fresh as an ingredient in many foods. The pressed oil from the coconut is used in cooking as well.|$|E

5|$|Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied {{birds with}} short necks and short slender bills with a <b>fleshy</b> cere. There are about 308 species worldwide, five of which occur in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|The fruits {{produced}} by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are <b>fleshy,</b> although some are dry. All contain {{a large number}} of seeds. <b>Fleshy,</b> colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings. Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; giant tortoises are reported to distribute Opuntia seeds in the Galápagos Islands. Ants appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as Blossfeldia. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the <b>fleshy</b> visible pinna (also called the auricle), the ear canal, and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E

5|$|The single extant {{species of}} Ginkgophyta (Ginkgo biloba) has <b>fleshy</b> seeds {{produced}} {{at the ends}} of short branches on female trees, and Gnetum, a tropical and subtropical group of gymnosperms produce seeds at the tip of a shoot axis.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are <b>fleshy</b> body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, <b>fleshy,</b> and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., after they had evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a <b>fleshy</b> or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be a}} degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E

5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and <b>fleshy</b> concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), sessile, rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive <b>fleshy</b> wattle that hangs from {{the underside of the}} beak and a <b>fleshy</b> protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of , the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which they live and are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In all of Maryland's species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Four species of Phasianidae have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Skuas and jaegers are {{in general}} medium to large birds, {{typically}} with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, {{but have a}} <b>fleshy</b> cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fleshies</b> is a {{band from}} Oakland, California signed to Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles. They {{are known for}} their outlandish stage presence, their left-wing {{politics}} and their non-stop world touring schedule. From their inception they were an influential presence at events such as Geekfest, held in the late 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Marbled newts {{owe their}} name to their green–black, marbled colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line runs down back and tail. The crest of male marbled newts is smaller and <b>fleshier</b> {{than that of}} the crested newts and not indented, but marbled newt males also have a whitish tail band at {{breeding}} time.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} double bass, one {{issue with the}} use of thumb {{position}} is that it is harder to produce vibrato with the thumb than with the fingers, because fingers have much <b>fleshier</b> pads than the side of the thumb. Some cellists use finger substitution to replace the thumb with one of the fingers.|$|R
