40|$|The {{amount of}} {{software}} in automatic control and mechatronic systems has been continuously {{growing in the}} last years. Within this domain, it is also {{getting more and more}} important to have software architectures and frameworks which allow efficient application development. On the other hand, size and computational overhead plays an important role on embedded controllers. For this reason, we have developed a compact software framework for distributed real-time computing which supports a component based system design. For all components, a small number of required common methods is defined. The framework provides uniform communication between the components based on package mailboxes. These mailboxes allow inter-component communication between components on the same system, real-time communication between distributed systems, and also communication between heterogeneous real-time and non real-time operating systems. The current implementation is used for control of autonomous service robots which are equipped with one or two Linux RTAI <b>embedded</b> <b>PCs</b> and a Windows laptop with a Java user interface. The communication and synchronisation between the two <b>embedded</b> <b>PCs</b> is done via real-time Ethernet using RTnet. The non real-time communication is managed by a TCP/IP router. This paper describes the concepts of the framework, the integration of RTnet, and the experiences we have with our robotics application. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”A major {{barrier to}} {{advancing}} modern wireless networking {{research is the}} lack of an effective wireless network simulation platform that simultaneously offers high fidelity, scalability, reproducibility and ease of use. MiNT [8], [7] is an innovative wireless network emulation platform that is specifically designed to satisfy all these desirable properties. To support reconfigurable network topology and wireless node mobility, MiNT is built on a networked robot system that carries wireless networking equipments and is designed to be completely tetherless, capable of supporting 24 X 7 operation, and low-cost.

When triggered by the experiment controller, they switched to the TDMA state machine. The ZigBee nodes were programmed with two SnapMAC chains: on the receiving node, a simple chain was responsible for receiving and reporting all ZigBee packets. On the transmitting node, a TDMA chain was running that could switch between regular CSMA operation and TDMA operation as instructed by the experiment controller.|$|R
