25|$|Some Federal Circuit {{decision}}s, however, {{had held}} some transformations of signals and data patent-eligible. For example, the Abele decision approved a dependent {{claim to a}} method transforming X-ray attenuation data produced in a X-Y field by an X-ray tomographic scanner to an image of body organs and bones — {{while at the same}} time the Abele court rejected a more generic and abstract <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> to a process of graphically displaying variances from their average values of unspecified data obtained in an unspecified manner. The court said that this kind of difference between the two claims was critical to patent-eligibility. The dependent claim, unlike the <b>independent</b> <b>claim,</b> involved signal data representing tangible physical objects, which were electronically manipulated to provide a screen image of the physical objects. But Bilski's process had nothing to do with such a procedure. Like State Street, Bilski involved manipulation of financial data.|$|E

5000|$|Clarification/broadening of the {{independent}} claim: Independent claims are typically written with very broad terms, to avoid permitting competitors to circumvent the claim by altering {{some aspect of the}} basic design. But when a broad wording is used, it may raise a question as to the scope of the term itself. If a dependent claim is specifically drawn to a narrower interpretation, then, at least in the U.S., the doctrine of claim differentiation states that the <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> must be different from, and therefore broader than, the dependent claim [...] The doctrine dictates that it [...] "is improper for courts to read into an <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> a limitation explicitly set forth in another claim." [...] This means that if an <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> recites a chair with a plurality of legs, and a dependent claim depending from {{the independent}} recites a chair with 4 legs, the <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> is not limited to what is recited in the dependent claim. The dependent claim protects chairs with 4 legs, and the <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> protects chairs with 4 legs as well as chairs having 2, 3, 5 or more legs. Similarly, it may be unclear whether a [...] "base" [...] includes a [...] "set of legs." [...] A dependent claim, including the phrase, [...] "wherein said base comprises a set of legs," [...] if allowed by the patent examiner, clarifies that the word base in the <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> does not necessarily include legs. In practice, dependent claims are often used to home in on the inventor's preferred embodiment of the invention (e.g., the actual product design that the inventor intends to use.) The <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> broadly describes the invention; dependent claim #1 describes the invention in a narrower aspect that more specifically describes the preferred embodiment; dependent claim #2 is narrower still; etc.|$|E

Each dependent claim is, by law, more narrow than the <b>independent</b> <b>claim</b> upon which it depends.
