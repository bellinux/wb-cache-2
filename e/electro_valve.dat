In order to create an automatic control, a controller is needed to perform pre- established functions in an automatic to perform any desired processes. Electronics gives us solutions to develop automatic control systems using micro controllers. In this case, the problem is to control the liquid’s level according to the desired value using a digital signal controller “dcPIC’s”. The control process is made by acquiring the liquid’s level using a sensor. This value is then digitalized and linearized {{in order to be}} used in automatic control calculus. The desired value is imput trough a keyboard. The controller compares the actual measured value by the sensor and the imput reference value in order to perform the correction according to the existing error. The process of correction is performed trough the actuators which can be the pump or the <b>electro</b> <b>valve</b> depending on the error signal swing. A visualization of both the current liquid’s level and the imput reference value is also presented...|$|E

This research concentrates on static and dynamic performance of a linear hydraulic system under different operating conditions in case of connecting an <b>Electro</b> Hydraulic Servo <b>Valve</b> (EHSV) and a Proportional Directional Flow Control Valve (PDFCV). High technology is used for measuring and recording the experimental results which achieves accurate evaluations. Experiments have been conducted in case of no-load and under load 5560 N.

It is concluded that increasing the load decreases the bandwidth frequency, but increasing the supply pressure increases the bandwidth frequency. Comparing the time lag of the system considering connecting the (EHSV) with that in case of connecting (PDFCV), it's observed that in the present investigation the time lag improves by about 86. 4 % in case of free-load and by about 95. 3 % in case of system loaded...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft primary {{flight control}} {{surfaces}} are typically driven by two linear hydraulic actuators accepting the controlled flows from two independent hydraulic systems. When the actuators {{are part of a}} fly-by-wire system, actuators flows are controlled by valves, and a key issue is to ensure a pressure matching between the two actuators to prevent force fighting with a resulting loss of stiffness and dynamic performance. Different solutions have been used to minimize the pressure mismatch between two redundant electro hydraulic actuators, but limited use has been done of techniques based on generating compensation signals to reduce the difference between the pressure differentials of the two servo actuators. The advances in microprocessors computing power offer new possibilities that can be exploited to perform a good pressure matching between redundant actuators by using an appropriate control strategy without the need of a complex hydraulic design. This paper first presents a brief survey of the existing architectures of dual redundant electro hydraulic servo actuators, then describes a research activity performed on this subject. An optimal and robust equalization control strategy was devised, capable of minimizing the force fighting between servo actuators while using conventional <b>electro</b> hydraulic servo <b>valves,</b> thereby leading to appreciable weight and cost saving...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{the economy}} and {{environmental}} impacts of the energy utilization, most of the heat transfer industries such as steel mills, glass plants and forging shops, foundry process and furnaces are focusing on energy efficient strategies and implementing new technologies. Gas Technology Institute (GTI) and Air Liquide Chicago Research Centre (ALCRC) have applied Oscillating Combustion Technology (OCT) on high temperature forged furnaces and reheat furnace for melting steel. The oscillating combustion requires a new hardware to incorporate on the fuel flow ahead of the burner. Solid State Proportionate (SSP) valves were used to create oscillations in the fuel flow. Natural gas was used as fuel and the technology was applied with air-gas, oxygen-gas, and excess level of air during the oscillating combustion. The present work deals with the implementation of OCT on liquid fuels at ambient conditions for melting aluminum metal in a fuel-fired crucible furnace which is of importance to foundry. Also, carrying out a study over the enhanced performance characteristics of oscillating combustion and comparing its thermal effects with those of the conventional combustion mode. The oscillating device, developed by the author, unlike other oscillating valves used earlier is a cam operated <b>electro</b> mechanical <b>valve</b> cause oscillations on the fuel flow. Experiments were conducted at varying air-fuel ratio, aluminum stocks, frequency and amplitude of the oscillating valve. The results when compared to the conventional combustion led to low fuel and specific energy consumption, enhanced heat transfer rate, increased furnace efficiency with visibly low volumes of flue gases with reduced emissions. The increased heat transfer rate and furnace efficiency was found to be in agreement with the results of GTI and ALCRC experiments. The reasons for such improvements in performance characteristics were verified by conducting experiments in the furnace by measuring the temperature distribution at designated point and calculating the heat transfer rate both for conventional and oscillating combustion mode. The analyses presented in this paper are for two levels of air-fuel ratios above and below the stoichiometric ratio, three different loads at 100 & 200 amplitude and 5 & 10 Hz frequency of oscillating valve...|$|R
40|$|As the {{regulations}} for engine-out emissions {{around the world}} are getting increasingly stringent, dual-fuel (DF) combustion involving natural gas or methane as primary fuel ignited by a very small diesel pilot can be an attractive alternative to diesel only combustion in heavy duty engines of both road as well as marine applications. Natural gas or methane have potential for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions because of their high hydrogen to carbon ratio compared to diesel fuel. Their highly premixed combustion also produces less NOx than diesel as the overall combustion temperature is lower. Furthermore, they have huge potential for exploitation at competitive prices in regions such as India, China and North America, thus helping to reduce dependency on conventional diesel and gasoline. In this thesis work, an attempt has been made to characterize the DF combustion of premixed methane and diesel pilot with the help of optical and thermodynamic measurements. DF combustion experiments were carried out in a single cylinder, optical research engine with <b>electro</b> hydraulic <b>valve</b> actuation system and custom made engine control program that enable research with great degree of parameter freedom. Crank angle resolved images of Natural Luminosity (NL) resulting from combustion were acquired using a high speed CMOS camera. NL signals showing the development of premixed flame fronts, cylinder pressure traces, heat release rate (HRR) profiles and ignition delays are considered as tools for characterizing the DF combustion in this thesis work. Influences of methane lambda (λCH 4), of pilot fuel ratio (PR) and of charge air temperature on dual-fuel combustion were investigated separately using three different case studies. From optical and thermodynamic investigations, it was observed that the ignition delay and shape of HRR in DF combustion strongly depend upon lambda of the gaseous fuel. With methane substitution rate ranging from 82 % to 88 %, when λCH 4 was varied from 1. 1 to 1. 9, it was observed that the periods of ignition delays were longer at both least as well as most lean case, with relatively shorter delays around the λCH 4 1. 5 region. The study of DF combustion as a function of PR revealed that the DF ignition delay decreased with increasing PR until a certain extent after which any increase in PR did not bring the ignition delay significantly forward. In the final case study, for both λCH 4 1. 1 and λCH 4 1. 8 cases, it was observed that higher intake temperatures shortened ignition delays, promoted second stage combustion and reduced cycle-to-cycle variations. However, at high intake temperatures, certain DF cycles also demonstrated excessive rates of pressure rise immediately after the onset of combustion. In summary, it is concluded that at high substitution rates (ca. 85 %) and light load conditions as experimented in this thesis, DF combustion is dominated by the premixed flame front propagation mode rather than by the characteristics of diesel diffusion combustion...|$|R
