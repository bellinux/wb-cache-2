50|$|The crowded, <b>furry</b> <b>leaves</b> are an {{attractive}} {{feature of this}} eremophila but may make it less suitable for gardens in areas of high humidity. It also produces masses of flowers in spring. E. fasciata is difficult to propagate from seed or from cuttings but can be grafted onto Myoporum rootstock during warm weather. It prefers well-drained soil, will grow in full sun or partial shade and is tolerant of most frosts.|$|E
50|$|With its grey, <b>furry</b> <b>leaves</b> and {{masses of}} orange-red flowers, {{this is one}} of the most {{attractive}} eremophilas. It is fast-growing and its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds but it is often short lived. It can be easily propagated from cuttings and grown in a wide range of soils but performs best in full sun. It only needs an occasional watering during a long dry spell and is very tolerant of frost.|$|E

50|$|As time passes, Aleasha {{begins to}} {{struggle}} with her shift from canine to human. She eats meals with the family, but dislikes eating vegetables (until Mom tricks her by dropping stir-fry ingredients on the floor, knowing Aleasha's dog instincts would cause her to eat the food as it fell). When Aleasha is allowed to go trick or treating on Halloween, disguised as a werewolf like Nick, she gives in to her canine side by howling in fear upon being spooked by a man {{pretending to be a}} scarecrow at one house. At the same time, Aleasha is beginning to look like less like a dog and more like a <b>furry</b> child, <b>leaving</b> her in a very awkward halfway point through her transformation. By Christmas, Aleasha begins to gain more human abilities such as color vision. However, she is also no longer able to communicate with the family cat, Miss Kitty, as Aleasha's ears are now more human than animal.|$|R

The disc is yellow and rays are white or blue, the flower heads 2.5 to 5.9 cm in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|Pomaderris lanigera is {{a common}} plant from eastern and {{southern}} Australia. Often seen around 2 or 3 metres tall, with <b>furry</b> <b>leaves,</b> 6 to 10 cm long, 1.5 to 3 cm wide. Leaf hairs appear woolly, of a silvery grey or rusty brown colour. Attractive golden flowers in August and September. The specific epithet lanigera comes from the Latin, meaning [...] "woolly".

5000|$|This small eremophila {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{attractive}} in cultivation with its sometimes golden, <b>furry</b> <b>leaves</b> and large purple flowers which are present through most months. It grows particularly well in Melbourne. It, especially the cultivar [...] "Blue Bells", is well known in gardens in the drier parts of the United States. It can be propagated from cuttings taken in warm weather, or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. Grafted plants perform better in heavy soils. It is tolerant of drought but not humidity so a sunny, open position is preferred. It is tolerant of light frost, although may need a light pruning to remove frost damaged branches.|$|E
5000|$|In Tivoli, on {{a walk to}} {{the river}} on the {{afternoon}} of September 21, 2008, Zimmer was struck by a car. He died five days later on September 26 from his wounds at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He is survived by two sisters who live in Germany.

Egon, Zimmerâ€™s adventurous, <b>furry</b> alter ego, <b>leaves</b> the following note {{at the end of the}} book: [...] "I am having a good time. I will be home some day but not until the show ends. Maybe soon." ...|$|R
