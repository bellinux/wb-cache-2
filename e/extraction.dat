40|$|Abstract: Background. This {{study was}} done to {{determine}} if pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) dental <b>extractions</b> {{reduce the risk of}} osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Methods. Between 1987 and 2004, 413 patients with oropha-ryngeal carcinomas were treated with definitive RT at the Univer-sity of Florida. Dentate patients underwent pretreatment dental evaluation. Teeth in the RT field were usually extracted if thought to have poor long-term prognosis from dental disease. The end-point was grade 2 ORN using a modified staging system. Patients were excluded for local recurrence, additional RT above the clavicles, or head and neck surgery besides neck dissection. Results. ORN rates were as follows: edentulous, < 1 %; teeth in-field with pre-RT <b>extractions,</b> 15 %; and teeth in-field without pre-RT <b>extractions,</b> 9 %. Patients with poor in-field teeth and pre-RT <b>extractions</b> had a higher 5 -year incidence of ORN {{than those who did not}} have pre-RT <b>extractions</b> (16 % vs 6 %, p. 48). Like-wise, for those with in-field teeth in good condition and pre-RT <b>extractions,</b> the 5 -year ORN incidence was higher than for those who did not undergo <b>extractions</b> (15 % vs 2 %, p. 42). Multivar-iate analysis revealed increased ORN risk with doses of. 70 Gy, once-daily fractionation, or brachytherapy. Conclusion. Pre-RT <b>extractions</b> do not appear to reduce th...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Much of {{the work}} that has been done on {{economic}} linkage measures that are derived from input-output data has been or can be cast in the framework of partitioned matrices. In this paper we explore the ramifications of alternative "hypothetical <b>extractions</b> " within that framework. We examine all possible <b>extractions</b> and speculate on the plausibility of the economic stories that might underpin them, as well as whether or not they measure any interesting kind of linkage. We demonstrate that a number of alternative <b>extractions</b> produce identical results for certain measures of sectoral importance. In numerical illustrations, we find that an even larger number of the <b>extractions</b> produce identical rankings of sectors. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{predictive}} role of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), {{number of}} tooth <b>extractions,</b> and oral infections for mortality {{in people with}} and without diabetes is unclear.

Health information was retrieved from 6434 elderly men through questionnaire information, serum measurements, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Diabetes was reported by 425 men. Distinct differences were observed in baseline characteristics in individuals with and without diabetes. In the diabetes group, age and hs-CRP were statistically significant whereas in the nondiabetes group, age, hs-CRP, number of tooth <b>extractions,</b> tooth <b>extractions</b> for infections and oral infections combined, nonfasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, regular alcohol drinking, daily smoking, and level of education were independent risk factors. The number of tooth <b>extractions</b> < 5 was inversely related whereas more <b>extractions</b> increased the risk.

A good example is the occurrence of the pattern: a verb followed immediately by a preposition (e.g., located in).
