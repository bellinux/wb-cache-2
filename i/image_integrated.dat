40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{building}} modeling from DSM. The {{objective is to}} develop a highly automatic system of 3 D modeling. 3 D reconstruction of buildings has been an active research topic in digital city and GIS applications. Various data types have been used in the researches, including multi-image, <b>image</b> <b>integrated</b> with GIS map or planning map, <b>image</b> <b>integrated</b> with DSM, etc. There are hardly commercial automatic systems for reconstruction of buildings due to the complexities of the reconstruction itself. In our study, the reconstruction algorithm is based on the polyhedral model because of the complex structure and shape of most of the modern buildings. The building modeling includes preprocessing, building detection, roof modeling and wall modeling. Edge preserved adaptive smoothing is employed to enhance the jump edges and outline of the buildings and remove the height noise within smooth regions. Outline and jump edge detection and Hough line extraction are carried out to the DSM to segment the ortho-roof plane. With DSM the 3 D roof plane can be obtained. From the lines and relationships of lines and roofs the walls can be created and merged. The roofs and walls of a building are described as polygons with the vertices in anti-clockwise order. A case study is implemented to a DSM of a region of Tsukuba, Japan. 1...|$|E

Long-exposed <b>images</b> <b>integrate</b> motion information directly in form of motion-blur. With this additional information more robust and accurate motion fields can be estimated. In addition the moment of occlusion can be determined. Considering the basic signal-theoretical problem in motion field estimation, we exploit the fact that long-exposed <b>images</b> <b>integrate</b> motion information to prevent temporal aliasing. A suitable image formation model relates the long-exposed image to preceding and succeeding short-exposed images in terms of dense 2 D motion and per-pixel occlusion/disocclusion timings. Based on our image formation model, we describe a practical variational algorithm to estimate the motion field not only for visible image regions but also for regions getting occluded.

40|$|Introduction The <b>IMAGE</b> (<b>Integrated</b> MIMD Architecture for Generic Motion Estimation) [1], {{integrated}} circuit is a block matching processor which is conceived to efficiently support the encoding process {{of a family}} of DCTbased standards, in particular MPEG- 2 coding [2]. The circuit is able perform motion estimation on a large search area with different, user programmable algorithms, but is especially tailored to support a genetic algorithm [3]. Further functionalities are the refinement of motion vectors and the generation of the final prediction. The chip will be produced with a three metal, 0. 35 mm technology and will contain approximately 1. 5 M transistors. For the successful realisation of a circuit of this size, the testability aspect and the generation of an efficient set of test vectors for high fault coverage become key issues. Hence, a detailed analysis with regard to this point has been undertaken [4] which aimed to: review strategies applied on other chips, check the...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{cortical}} thickness estimation in-vivo {{is important}} for the study of many neurodegenerative diseases. When using magnetic resonance images (MRI), accuracy may be hampered by artifacts such as partial volume (PV) as the cortex spans only a few voxels. In zones of opposed sulcal banks (tight sulci) the measurement can be even more difficult. The aim of this work is to propose a voxel-based cortical thickness estimation method from MR by integrating a mechanism for correcting sulci delineation after an improved partial volume classification. First, an efficient and accurate framework was developed to enhance partial volume classification with structural information. Then, the correction of sulci delineation is performed after a homotopic thinning of a cost function <b>image.</b> <b>Integrated</b> to our voxel-based cortical thickness estimation pipeline, the overall method showed a better estimate of thickness and a high reproducibility on real data (R 2 [*]>[*] 0. 9).

A metamodel is a model itself of the simulation model, a regression model. This regression model supposes a linear relation between in- and output. By applying linear regression with the least squares method, the regression coefficients of the metamodel can be determined. With help of experimental designs, experiments have been carried out as effective and efficient as possible.

This paper develops a framework for analysing fiscal reforms that overcomes some of the significant conceptual and methodological deficiencies of existing approaches. The <b>IMAGE</b> (<b>Integrated</b> Microsimulation and Applied General Equilibrium) model developed for the UK is documented, and employed to analyse the important issue of corporate tax reform. The IMAGE model is the first to integrate the detailed demand-based approach typical of microsimulation models with the market analysis of applied general equilibrium models. In this respect, the model can simulate the impact of a given tax reform on the personal distribution of income, the functional distribution of income, economic efficiency and government revenue. In addition, the model incorporates imperfect competition in production. These features of the model are central to the main application in the paper, namely the examination of the incidence of corporate taxation. For example, the incorporation of micro-unit household data enables the effects of corporation tax reform on the househol...|$|E

Previously the stoichiometry of Gag in virions was inferred from indirect measurements carried out 2 decades ago.

In this technique, the number of scattered electrons in the dark-field <b>image</b> <b>integrated</b> over an individual freeze-dried virus particle on a grid is directly proportional to its mass. The RSV virions had a mean mass of 2. 5 × 108 Da, corresponding to about 1, 500 Gag molecules per virion. The population of virions was not homogeneous, with about one-third to two-thirds of the virions deviating from the mean by more than 10 % of the mass in two respective preparations. The mean masses for virions carrying genomes of 7. 4 or 9. 3 kb were indistinguishable, suggesting that mass variability is not due to differences in RNA incorporation...|$|E

A Macintosh II computer equipped with an image frame grabber board and Image software package allows for extensive analysis of the captured electron beam spot OTR patterns. The equipment is capable of measuring relative intensities to better than 1 % for a constant source image. With beam energies of nearly 100 MeV the captured OTR images show an unexpected assymetry in the beam intensity profile. The variations of the beam intensity and shape are shown for nominally steady beam conditions. Using <b>Image,</b> <b>integrated</b> signals of the beam spot OTR patterns for several targets {{as a function of}} beam current show a linear relationship, thereby creating a technique for computing electron beam current. Portions of the beam profile with varying percentages of beam spot maximum intensity also show a linear relationship between beam current and OTR image intensity. A radiation cone OTR pattern has been observed for the NPS linac beam. From the pattern, the Lorentz factor for the 100 MeV electrons is observed to be less than the computed value, and probably indicates the non-collinearity of the electron beam.

40|$|To {{meet the}} global demand for wood the old forest {{management}} module of the <b>IMAGE</b> <b>integrated</b> assessment model (Bouwman et al. 2006) only applied clear felling. As a consequence in whole gird cells the forest was completely harvested. In reality, however, there {{many different ways}} to produce wood, ranging from selective logging to clear felling and forestry plantations. Each of these logging systems will have different effects on the area needed for wood production and impact on remaining forest and diversity patterns. The global biodiversity model GLOBIO (Alkemade et al. 2009), which is coupled to the IMAGE model, however, needs more precise information on area needed and differentiates in impact of different forest management types. In this report an overview is given of different forest management types (clear felling, selective felling, reduced impact logging and forest plantations) and the associated wood production and harvest losses on an area base in different climate zones (boreal, temperate and tropical).

These scenarios form {{the low end of the}} scenario literature in terms of emissions and radiative forcing. They often show negative emissions from energy use in the second half of the 21 st century. The RCP 2. 6 scenario is shown to be technically feasible in the <b>IMAGE</b> <b>integrated</b> assessment modeling framework from a medium emission baseline scenario, assuming full participation of all countries. Cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases from 2010 to 2100 need to be reduced by 70 % compared to a baseline scenario, requiring substantial changes in energy use and emissions of non-CO 2 gases. These measures (specifically the use of bio-energy and reforestation measures) also have clear consequences for global land use. Based on the RCP 2. 6 scenario, recommendations for further research on low emission scenarios have been formulated. These include the response of the climate system to a radiative forcing peak, the ability of society to achieve the required emission reduction rates given political and social inertia and the possibilities to further reduce emissions of non-CO 2 gases. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|E

RIVM has developed the energy model TIMER {{as part of the}} global integrated assessment model, <b>IMAGE</b> (<b>Integrated</b> Model to Assess the Global Environment) to study long-term energy scenarios, related environmental problems and available options for mitigation (up to 2100). In the research project described, the aim was to find a modelling approach and identify determinants of transport energy demand to improve the projections of TIMER, focusing on passenger transport. Global transport models were compared by means of a literature study. The literature that could be reviewed for this project focused mainly on passenger transport in OECD countries. In addition, four global transport models were studied - i. e. two models from the World Energy Council, one from the International Energy Agency, and a model described by Schafer and Victor.

30|$|The {{worldwide}} effort {{devoted to}} the development of instrumentation and space science technology for the last few decades highly improved the reliability of remote-sensed image of the planetary surface. As the spatial resolution of in-orbital images is updated up to sub-meter level, inorbital planetary images can provide visual observation of detailed terrain features. In addition to the improvement of spatial resolution, the pointing accuracy of in-orbital planetary <b>image</b> <b>integrated</b> from radio tracking and the navigation equipment was also enhanced. Hence, accurate photogram-metric DTM can be produced if stereo images are available. In order to fully benefit from these products, it is essential to develop a processing tool to convert the remote sensing data, especially stereo optical image, to geodetically controlled topographic products. Also, we realized that it is not efficient to establish specific stereo processor for each in-orbital planetary optical sensor as has done for last half century in planetary exploration. Hence, we proposed a generic stereo processor employing universal sensor model and pyramidal geodetic control. In theory, it can be employed for any of planetary images within data hierarchy covering the target surface from low resolution to high and very high resolution. To prove the capability and transfer-ability of the system, the pilot scheme employing universal approach with Martian stereo imagery was developed. The processing principles, design of the system and validation are introduced in the following sections. In addition, the potential of prototype system to be utilized for processing stereo data derived from other planetary surfaces was discussed.|$|E
