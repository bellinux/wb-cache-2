40|$|ABSTRACT: Offshore, sub-sea {{pipelines}} that transport {{oil and gas}} experience {{thermal expansion}} induced by {{the temperature of the}} transported medium during operation. The expansion of the pipeline can induce overload and cause damage to offshore platforms or sub-sea structures that are connected to the pipelines. To mitigate and prevent these incidents, expansion spools are installed between offshore, sub-sea pipelines and risers on the platform. This paper presents {{the results of the study}} and development of a simplified design method for expansion spools, using the slope deflection method for the purpose of preliminary <b>design</b> or <b>front-end</b> <b>engineering</b> and <b>design</b> (FEED) ...|$|R

50|$|The American {{subsidiary}} of PTTGC plans to invest $100 million for detailed engineering {{design of a}} world-scale cracker on a site in Mead Township {{on the west bank}} of the Ohio River in Belmont County, Ohio. It will take up to one year to determine the feasibility of an ethane cracker in collabotation with two consortiums of engineering firms led by Bechtel Enterprises Holdings Inc and Fluor Corporation, which will conduct the preliminary <b>front-end</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> work and cost estimates. The construction would require a multibillion-dollar investment. The ethane cracker would process ethane extracted from the region’s Marcellus and Utica Shale formations into ethylene, which is a basis for common plastics and resins. PTTGC wants to finalise their investment decision in 2016 or 2017. Should the project go ahead, it would need approximately three and a half years to complete the construction of the ethane cracker facility.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{technical and}} operational aspects {{pertaining to the}} transport of CO 2. It deals with lessons learnt from the development of three large CCS demonstration projects: the UK-based Don Valley project, the Dutch ROAD project, and the Spanish Compostilla project. These projects were all selected by the European Commission in 2009 to receive funding under the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR). The purpose of the demonstration projects is to verify feasible capture techniques (i. e. gasification, flue-gas cleaning, and oxy-coal combustion in circulating fluidised bed, respectively), and to demonstrate geological storage options, off-shore and on-shore. As the distance and elevation of the CO 2 transport system are inherently given by the project, the transport conditions for the CO 2 will generally differ from one project to another. The demonstration projects {{have shown that the}} thermophysical nature of CO 2 is prone to complicate certain operational procedures mainly due to phenomena like phase change, hydrate formation and Joule-Thomson cooling. The <b>front-end</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> studies suggest, however, that the handling of CO 2 is quite feasible during normal operation, although customised solutions may be required to handle transients like emergency shut-down and pipeline re-pressurisation. This implies that CO 2 transport is not seen as an insuperable hurdle to the design and operation of large CCS systems...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{materials}} technology, information and management systems {{have led to}} improvements in the engineering design, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of process columns. The development of the <b>front-end</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> (FEED) process {{has led to the}} incorporation of best practices in the specification of equipment on projects during the design phase. The aim of the research is to investigate whether technical specifications {{have an impact on the}} life cycle costs of process columns. Adding to the initial capital cost of equipment, in the form of technical specification requirements, in an attempt to reduce life cycle costs, is always challenged during the project phase of a product life cycle. The principle of designing for the full product life cycle of process columns requires that consideration for both the project and operating life cycle be made at the stage of basic engineering. What is important to note is that the potential for life cycle cost savings at the beginning of a product life cycle is higher than during the operating life cycle. Figure S. 1 illustrates this concept, and what is observed is that the potential for life cycle cost savings diminishes as the product life progresses over time. Process columns were chosen as the type of equipment to be investigated based on the nature, size and complexity of the equipment when compared to other equipment on a processing unit. Process columns are amongst the highest capital cost pieces of equipment in petrochemical units and usually have many auxiliary pieces of equipment associated with it in a system i. e. reboilers, condensers, pumps etc. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.
