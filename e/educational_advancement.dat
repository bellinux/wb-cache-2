25|$|Founded in 1899, Elizabethtown College {{is one of}} many higher {{learning}} institutions founded in the 19th century by churches or church members interested in the <b>educational</b> <b>advancement</b> of their denominational membership. The College was founded by interested members of the Church of the Brethren in response to an initiative by the Reverend Jacob G. Francis. Francis advocated for Elizabethtown because of the proximity to the railways (which holds true to this day as an Amtrak station is currently there). First classes for the new college were held on Nov. 13, 1900, in the Heisey Building in downtown Elizabethtown. During its first two decades, the College operated as an academy, offering a limited curriculum centering on four-year teaching degrees and high school type classes.|$|E

He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in Triumphant Democracy (1886) and Gospel of Wealth (1889). Carnegie bought Skibo Castle in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his New York mansion located at 2 East 91st Street at Fifth Avenue. The building was built in 1903 and he lived there until his death in 1919. His wife Louise also lived there until her death in 1946. The building is now the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution. The surrounding neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side has come to be called Carnegie Hill. The mansion was named a National Historic Landmark in 1966. He then devoted his life to providing the capital for purposes of public interest and social and <b>educational</b> <b>advancement.</b>|$|E

Robert Smalls, a native son and leading figure in post-war Beaufort would later become one of South Carolina's first elected African-Americans to the United States Congress and remained a prominent civic leader in the state and in Beaufort until his death in 1915.

50|$|Paxton {{describes}} {{three factors}} that are the basis for why national level representation has become much larger {{over the past several}} decades. The first is the changing structural and economic conditions of nations, which says that <b>educational</b> <b>advancements</b> along with an increase in women's participation in the labor force encourages representation. The second is the political factor; representation of women in office being based on a proportionality system. Some voting systems are built so that a party that gains 25% of the votes gains 25% of the seats. In these processes, a political party feels obligated to balance the representation within their votes between genders, increasing women's activity in political standing. A plurality-majority system, such as the one the United States, United Kingdom, and India has, only allows single candidate elections, and thus allows political parties to entirely dictate regions' representatives even if they only control a small majority of the vote. Last, there is the ideological disposition of a country; the concept that the cultural aspects of women's roles or positions in the places they live dictate where they stand in that society, ultimately either helping or handicapping those women from entering political positions.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the content and volume of literature that has been written on cultural competency in emergency medicine since its educational imperative was first described by the Institute of Medicine in 2002. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search through the PUBMED portal in January 2015 to identify all articles and reviews that addressed cultural competency in emergency medicine. Articles were included in the review if cultural competency was described or if its impact on healthcare disparities or curriculum development was described. Two reviewers independently investigated all relevant articles. These articles were then summarized. Results: Of the 73 abstracts identified in the initial search, only 10 met criteria for inclusion. A common theme found among these 10 articles is that cultural competency in emergency medicine is essential to reducing healthcare disparities and improving patient care. These articles were consistent in their support for cross-cultural <b>educational</b> <b>advancements</b> in the EM curriculum. Conclusion: Despite the documented importance of cultural competency education in medicine, there appears to be only 10 articles over the past 12 years regarding its development and implementation in emergency medicine. This comprehensive literature review underscores the relative dearth of publications related to cultural competency in emergency medicine. The limited number of article findings is striking when compared to the growth of emergency medicine research over the same time period and can serve as a stimulus for further research in this significant area of EM education...|$|R
