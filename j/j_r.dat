40|$|About ten taxa of Proteaceae {{are known}} from the Early Eocene in Tasmania, one from a Late Eocene site, 22 from four Early Oligocene sites, one from a Late Oligocene/Early Miocene site, 12 or 13 from two Early Pleistocene sites, and five or six from the Middle and Late Pleistocene. Most of the Tertiary fossils are of extinct species, but the extant species Lomatia fraxinifolia and Telopea truncata have been {{recorded}} from the Early Oligocene as well as apparent close relatives of the subalpine rainforest species Orites milliganii, and the sub-tropical rainforest species, O. excelsa. None of the Early Oligocene species are known {{from more than one}} site, implying very high regional diversity, and floristic differentiation among the sites. High diversity of Proteaceae at some sites may be associated with oligotrophic soils. There is no evidence of any of the modern species-rich scleromorphic groups of Proteaceae except Banksiinae. Scleromorphy was well established in Oriteae, Embothrieae and Banksiinae by the Early Oligocene. The Early Eocene fossils have very small stomata, sparsely distributed on the leaf, which may have been due to elevated atmospheric CO 2. All extant Tasmanian genera and many extant species were present by the Early Pleistocene as well as some extinct species. The specific diversity within the region was probably higher than it is now. In order to resolve a nomenclatural problem with the genus Proteaciphyllum, Euproteaciphyllum G. <b>J.</b> Jord., <b>R.</b> <b>J.</b> Carp. & <b>R.</b> S. Hill, gen. nov. is proposed and this name is applied to 10 previously described species.

40|$|Vaccinia virus, {{a member}} of the {{poxvirus}} family, contains a conserved <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> open reading frame that encodes a late protein of 17. 8 kDa. The 18 -kDa <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein is associated mainly with the membrane fraction of intracellular mature virus particles. This study examines the biological function of <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein in the vaccinia virus life cycle. A recombinant vaccinia virus was constructed to conditionally express <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein in an isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) -inducible manner. When <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> is not expressed during vaccinia virus infection, the virus titer is reduced approximately 100 -fold. In contrast, <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein is not required for viral gene expression, as indicated by protein pulse-labeling. <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein is also not required for DNA processing, as the resolution of the concatemer junctions of replicated viral DNA was detected without IPTG. A deficiency of <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein caused a severe delay in the processing of p 4 a and p 4 b into mature core proteins 4 a and 4 b, indicating that <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein participates in virion morphogenesis. Infected cells grown in the absence of IPTG contained very few intracellular mature virions in the cytoplasm, and enlarged viroplasm structures accumulated with viral crescents attached at the periphery. Abundant intermediate membrane structures of abnormal shapes were observed, and many immature virions were either empty or partially filled, indicating that <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein is important for DNA packaging into immature virions. <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein also coimmunoprecipited with A 45 R protein in infected cells. In summary, these results indicate that vaccinia virus <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> is a membrane protein that is required for virus growth and plaque formation. <b>J</b> 1 <b>R</b> protein interacts with A 45 R protein and performs an important role during immature virion formation in cultured cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractJ 3 R, the 39 -kDa subunit of {{vaccinia virus}} poly(A) polymerase, is a {{multifunctional}} protein that catalyzes (nucleoside- 2 ′-O-) -methyltransferase activity, {{serves as a}} poly(A) polymerase stimulatory factor, and acts as a postreplicative positive transcription elongation factor. Prior results support an association between poly(A) polymerase and the virion RNA polymerase. A possible direct interaction between <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> and H 4 L subunit of virion RNA polymerase was evaluated. <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> was shown to specifically bind to H 4 L amino acids 235 – 256, C terminal to NPH I binding site on H 4 L. H 4 L binds to the C-terminal region of <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> between amino acids 169 and 333. The presence of a <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> binding site near to the NPH I binding region on H 4 L led us to evaluate a physical interaction between NPH I and <b>J</b> 3 <b>R.</b> The NPH I binding site was located on <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> between amino acids 169 and 249, and <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> was shown to bind to NPH I between amino acids 457 and 524.

Analysis of transcription activity demonstrated that <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> is not required for early mRNA synthesis and is not an essential factor in early gene transcription termination or transcript release in vitro. <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> interaction with NPH I and H 4 L {{may serve as a}} docking site for <b>J</b> 3 <b>R</b> on the virion RNA polymerase, linking transcription to mRNA cap formation and poly(A) addition...|$|R
