Planimetric positional error limits {{the accuracy of}} landscape change measurements based on features interpreted from high spatial resolution imagery (1 m), and this limitation depends on {{the magnitude of the}} positional error, the spatial heterogeneity of landscapes, and the spatial extent of the change detection window (the change detection resolution). For this reason, accuracy assessments of change measurements from feature-based approaches require careful evaluation of the impacts of positional errors across land-scapes differing in spatial heterogeneity at different change detection resolutions. We quantified such impacts by computing the false changes produced by spatially shifting and comparing high-resolution <b>ecological</b> <b>maps</b> derived by feature interpretation and ground interpretation of 1 m resolution Ikonos imagery of rural China and 0. 3 m resolu-tion aerial photographs of suburban United States. Change detection error increased significantly as positional errors increased, as landscape heterogeneity increased, and as the change detection resolution became finer. Regression-derived relationships between change estimation error and positional error, change detection resolution, and landscape hetero-geneity allow calculation of the minimum change detection window size at which it is possible to obtain change meas-urements of a specified accuracy given any set of feature-based <b>ecological</b> <b>maps</b> and their positional error.

Recognizing the importance of hydrology in landscape dynamics, we base an <b>ecological</b> <b>mapping</b> approach on topological features of terrain from a hydrologic and habitat perspective. This approach emphasizes convexities and concavities of topography as caplands and confluent cuplands, respectively. A concept of coherent convex contours provides an operational basis for determining capland components, with cupland components being predominantly concave contributing areas for higher-order streams. Scaling sequences of subdivisions give progressive partitioning down to sizes of units that serve practical purposes of natural resource management.

Whereas other research has focused on individual elements of this environmental change, this thesis applies the concepts of landscape ecology to understand the complete picture of the changing environment of a barrier island. Mapping is fundamental to detecting and monitoring change. Currently no mapping scheme can effectively integrate geomorphological and <b>ecological</b> <b>mapping</b> of the landscape. This research combines the fundamental concepts of landscape ecology and geomorphological mapping to develop a landscape <b>ecological</b> <b>mapping</b> methodology. The mapping scheme has been developed to understand the landscape change of Galveston Island, Texas from 1980 to 1995. Using a geographic information system (GIS), aerial photograph maps were created and classified with a level I Anderson land use / land cover classification, and then were reclassified using the patch-matrix- corridor model of landscape ecology. These maps provide a temporal-based, spatial sununary of landscape change. Comparing these maps from several time periods highlights areas and patterns of change. From 1980 to 1995, Galveston Island experienced a 5 % increase in urban area so that it occupies nearly the same total area as the nonforested wetland matrix of Galveston Island. This increased urbanization perforates the non-forested wetland with patches of development and even isolates portions of the salt marsh and wind tidal flat corridors at the margins of the island. The urban expansion has taken place primarily at the expense of salt marsh which experienced a loss of 50 million square feet over the last 15 years. Additionally, this encroachment by urban development has changed the shape of the salt marsh patches. According to an area-to-perimeter comparison, salt marsh areas became thinner and more convoluted in shape from 1980 to 1995. This research shows that land use / land cover classification systems provide a useful prerequisite to landscape <b>ecological</b> <b>mapping.</b> However, the land use / land cover and landscape ecological classification systems should not be mutually exclusive. Each classification system focuses on different aspects of the landscape, and when used together, they provide a powerful tool for land management...|$|E

This thesis applies concepts of landscape ecology in order to assess the degree of landscape structural change which has taken place due to the impoundment of Lake Somerville and recreational development within Birch Creek State Park, a unit of Lake Somerville State Recreation Area managed by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Mapping is a fundamental tool necessary in recording and quantifying patterns of landscape change. This research employs the landscape <b>ecological</b> <b>mapping</b> scheme developed by Karen Lynch (1996) in order to monitor and detect landscape change in Birch Creek State Park from 1958 to 1988. Geographic information system (GIS) software was used to create land-use maps from aerial photographs. Maps were classified with level III Anderson et at. (1975) land-use and land cover classification, and then reclassified using Lynch's patch-corridor-matrix landscape <b>ecological</b> <b>mapping</b> scheme. These maps provide a temporal summary of spatial change at Birch Creek State Park. Comparing these maps from four different time periods, addresses changing landscape patterns. From 1958 to 1988, Birch Creek State Park experienced a change in its land-use/land cover as well as its landscape ecology. The data indicates that as human modification of the landscape increased so did the measured heterogeneity. Not only has there been {{an increase in the number}} of patches, but there has been an increase in the types of patches present. The increase of urban land-use has dissected, perforated, and fragmented the landscape. This increase in urban land-use has changed the shape of forest patches, resulting in a decrease in area-to-perimeter ratio. Analyses of avian communities provide valuable information about the effects of landscape change on wildlife. While the introduction of the lake provides new habitat for some avian species, fragmentation of the landscape due to recreational development reduces habitat for species requiring large interior habitat. Local diversity can increase as a result of fragmentation coupled with ecotonal expansion, meaning the colonization of patches by opportunistic species...|$|E
