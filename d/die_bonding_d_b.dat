The riparian stand of the Nature Reserve “Krajkowo” has the traits of an uneven-aged, multi-layer, mixed forest with many dead or dying old trees.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the moisture dependence of engineering properties of melon seeds {{is essential for the}} design of its processing equipment. Selected engineering properties of two varieties of melon (Citrulus lanatus- Variety A and Solanum sp. - Variety B) were determined at a moisture content range of 4. 06 to 16. 81 % (dry basis). An increase in the moisture content resulted in a directly proportional increase in all the properties for the two varieties except for the compressive force which decreased as the moisture content increased. The minimum and maximum value of emptying angle of repose was 21. 370 for variety B at 4. 06 % (<b>d.</b> <b>b.)</b> and 24. 260 for variety A at 16. 81 % (<b>d.</b> <b>b.).</b> The minimum value for coefficient of friction was 0. 19 for Variety B against glass at moisture content of 16. 81 % (<b>d.</b> <b>b.)</b> and a maximum corresponding value of 0. 36 for Variety A against plywood at 4. 06 % (<b>d.</b> <b>b.),</b> respectively.

40|$|Well-logging and {{aerospace}} applications require electronics capable of withstanding elevated temperature operation. A {{key element of}} high temperature packaging technology is the Si die attach material, and a comparative study of two die attach systems for use in harsh environment has been performed. <b>Die</b> <b>bond</b> sample packages, using commercial adhesives and an Au-Si eutectic solder, have been manufactured and were subsequently thermally exposed for various times at 250 and 300 °C respectively.

40|$|The {{operation}} of electronic packages under exceptionally harsh environments presents a significant {{challenge for the}} microelectronics industry, for example, in down-hole, well-logging and turbo-machinery applications. High temperature Au based solders are one potential candidate for die attachment for harsh environments and is already used in limited cases. For Au-Si <b>die</b> <b>bonding,</b> some of the Si is provided by diffusion from the Si die itself.

40|$|Production of corn masa-based {{products}} is flourishing in the United States, {{as is the}} generation of masa processing waste. Masa by-products have potential for value-added utilization, an option which could produce less pollution in the environment and economic benefits for masa processors.

40|$|Thirty-two {{engelmann spruce}} (Picea engelmannii) ranging in <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. from 9. 4 to 84. 6 em, twenty subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) with <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. 2 ̆ 7 s from 8. 1 to 58. 8 em, and twenty aspen (Populus tremuloides) ranging in <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. from 4. 5 to 48. 2 em. were destructively sampled in Northern Utah to {{construct}} wood and bark biomass and production prediction equations for {{above and below}} ground parts. These prediction equations were then applied to stand table data from 20 x 25 meter plots representing a sere that changes from subalpine meadow to aspen to fir to a 2 ̆ 7 climax 2 ̆ 7 stand of spruce. The biomass production data along the successional stages were then used to test some of Odum 2 ̆ 7 s hypotheses regarding ecosystem development (Science 1969). In all biomass and production predictive equations diameter at breast height (1. 38 meters) and its transformations {{was found to be}} the single best independent variable. Spruce bole bark biomass was best correlated linearly with <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. Spruce bole wood, branch wood and branch bark were best predicted with a <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. 2 relationship. All fir above ground biomass components as well as all aspen above ground components except aspen branch wood were best correlated with <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. 2 Aspen branch wood biomass was best predicted by a <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. 3 equation. Seedling sized fir, spruce, and aspen (trees less than 1. 38 meters in height) had their total above ground wood and bark biomass best predicted using basal diameter 3 as the independent variable. Seven spruce and fir stump and root systems, from trees ranginq from 2. 5 to 66. 0 em. in <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h., were excavated by hand. All roots down to one centimeter in diameter were cut weighed and oven-dried. Biomass data from the fir and spruce stumps and roots were combined because of their similarity. The resulting combined biomass data was described accurately by using <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. 4 as the independent variable. Aspen root biomass was obtained through the use of three randomly located excavated cubic meter pits in each of four different clones. The aspen pit root biomass was best described by employing a sixth degree polynomial using the diameter (em) of the four nearest trees to pit center divided by their average distance (meters) to pit center. Two production methods were used : l) mean annual increment (MAl) and 2) periodic annual increment (PAl). No production estimates for roots were made. Spruce bole wood and bark MAl 2 ̆ 7 s were best predicted by <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. and log-log <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. equations respectively. Spruce branch wood and branch bark MAl 2 ̆ 7 s were both best described by <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. (li near) relationships. All fir MAl branch and bole components used <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. 2 in their predictive equations. All aspen MAl equations used sixth degree polynomials with <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. as the independent variable. Polynomials were employed when downward or leveling trends could not be adequately represented using standard statistical techniques. Spruce and aspen PAI equations were constructed using polynomials. Fir PAl, because of the data, could be best predicted using standard regression techniques. Fir bole wood and bark PAl equations were 2 ̆ 7 linear and thus best described by <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. untransformed. Fir branch and wood PAl showed some leveling which was gradual enough to best be fitted by a <b>d.</b> <b>b.</b> h. 2 ̆ 23 equation. Using the biomass and production predictive equations and stand tables from plots representing a succession, plot biomass and productions were generated. The plot biomasses and productions were plotted against estimated age (time from the initial meadow invasion by aspen). Above and below ground total wood and bark plot biomass was found to increase with time through all stages being low in early aspen dominated stages (1. 5 x 10 5 kg/ha@ 7. 5 years) to high in late spruce dominated stands (5. 25. x 10 5 kg/ha@ 258 years). This finding supports Odum 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis that biomass is low in early stages and higher in later stages of ecosystem development. Both estimates (MAl and PAI) of total above-ground plot production show that production is high in early aspen stages (PAl is 4. 7 x 103 kg/ha/yr@ 65 years), low in mid-successional fir dominated stands (PAl is 3. 0 x 10 3 kg/ha/yr@ 130 years), and high again in the late spruce stages (4. 6 x 10 3 kg/ha/yr @ 258 years). This tends to contradict Odum 2 ̆ 7 s hypothesis that production tends to keep decreasing after the initial stages of succession. While these tests of Odum 2 ̆ 7 s hypotheses are only on the basis of tree wood and bark, these values will probably be found to be the largest single biomass and possibly production community contributors...|$|R
