5|$|Kaling and {{executive}} producer Greg Daniels {{came up with the}} episode idea after Kaling held a Diwali party in 2005 for series staff. She undertook research about Indian culture and the resulting episode was substituted in place of one that would have been Halloween-themed. The episode was directed by Miguel Arteta. According to Nielsen Media Research, an estimated 8.8 million viewers tuned in; it earned a 4.2/10 rating among adults aged 18 to 49, placing first in this <b>demographic</b> <b>group.</b> Critical reception to the episode was largely positive, with many praising Kaling's writing, Carell's performance, and other comedic elements. As a result of the episode, The Office became the first American comedy series to depict the holiday, and several commentators have credited it with helping introduce Indian customs to American audiences.|$|E

Test bias {{is a form}} of systematic (i.e., non-random) error which leads to examinees from one <b>demographic</b> <b>group</b> having an unwarranted advantage over examinees from another <b>demographic</b> <b>group.</b> According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient evidence that test bias is actually present because the test could be measuring real differences among groups. Psychometricians use sophisticated scientific methods to search for test bias and eliminate it. Research shows that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately determine whether it is biased or not.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} demographic differentials in alcohol and illicit drug use, participation, own price effects and cross price effects. This paper uses a data set of over 49, 000 individuals from the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse and links drug and alcohol prices and policies to the individual records. The size of this data set makes it possible to estimate use, participation and demand curves for specific <b>demographic</b> <b>groups.</b> Public policies designed to reduce substance abuse have been oriented towards increasing the price of alcohol and illicit drugs. Little, however, is known about the relative responsiveness of various <b>demographic</b> <b>groups</b> to these policies. The data show that racial and ethnic minorities consume more cocaine, but consume less or equal amounts of alcohol, marijuana and heroin than the total population. The results also show a consistent pattern of negative own price effects for alcohol and illicit drugs and complimentarity between alcohol and illicit drugs. The own price effects did not differ substantially between <b>demographic</b> <b>groups</b> suggesting that price policies have a similar effect on all <b>demographic</b> <b>groups.</b> The pattern of complimentarity between alcohol and illicit drugs suggest that alcohol taxes also reduce drug use. ...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the German labor market by examining its dynamics and their cyclical sensitivity. The {{main focus of}} this analysis is the heterogeneity in the dynamics of job-to-job flows. We do not only allow for differences between <b>demographic</b> <b>groups</b> {{in the size of}} the transition rates but also in their cyclical sensitivity. Furthermore, job tenure and experience in an occupation is taken into account. Using the IAB employment subsample for the years 1975 to 2004 for West Germany and 1993 to 2004 for East Germany,   18 <b>demographic</b> <b>groups</b> and three job-duration groups are distinguished. The <b>demographic</b> <b>groups</b> are defined by age, gender, and skills. Job-to-job transitions are found to be the largest flows in the German labor market and therefore they form a  substantial part of labor-market dynamics. However, compared to U.S. findings, these rates are somewhat smaller.|$|R
25|$|As women {{increasingly}} worked {{outside of}} the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the <b>demographic</b> <b>group</b> that soap opera advertisers pay the most for. Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama. An early term for the reality TV genre was docu-soap. A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.|$|E
25|$|Edison/Mitofsky {{conducted}} an exit poll {{on behalf of}} the National Election Pool which is the only source of data on voter demographics in California in the 2008 election. The statistical trends from the exit poll of 2,240 voters suggested that an array of voters came out both in opposition to and in support of Proposition 8, with no single <b>demographic</b> <b>group</b> making up most of either the Yes or No vote. The National Election Pool poll showed that support for Proposition 8 was strong amongst African American voters, interviewed in the exit poll with 70% in favor, more than any other racial group. Their support was considered crucial to the proposition's passing, since African Americans made up an unusually larger percentage of voters that year, due to the presence of Barack Obama on the ballot. Polls by both the Associated Press and CNN mirrored this data, reporting support among black voters to be at 70% and 75%, respectively. A later study by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF), examining the black vote only from five counties within the state, suggested that black support was closer to 58%.|$|E
25|$|After the {{uncovering}} of a coup-plot by Irish {{laborers and}} Black slaves, however, further emigration of Irish servants was banned. The slave trade would be outlawed in Bermuda in 1807, and all slaves were freed in 1834. At {{the end of}} the 17th century, whites composed the majority of Bermuda's population. Blacks and Native Americans were both small minorities. They combined, however, absorbing the Irish and Scots, and no small part of the White English bloodline, to be described as a single <b>demographic</b> <b>group</b> a century later, with the Bermuda's population being divided into White and Black Bermudians. As 10,000 Bermudians had emigrated, prior to American independence, most of them White, this left Blacks with a slight majority. Portuguese immigration, which began with a shipload of Madeiran families in the 1840s has been offset by sustained immigration from the West Indies which began at {{the end of the}} 19th century. Today, about 60% of Bermudians are described as being of African descent, although many may have greater European ancestry, and almost all Bermudians would be able to easily find ancestors and relatives of either African or European descent.|$|E
40|$|Aspiring {{professional}} accountants need {{to develop}} certain competencies comprising both technical knowledge and professional skills (also referred to as generic skills), during their initial professional development (IPD). However, despite interventions to develop these competencies, {{there is still a}} gap between employers' expectations and graduates' competencies. It has been argued that Emotional Intelligence (EQ) may be the missing link in the IPD of professional accountants. It has been suggested that instructors should adopt specific non-traditional pedagogical approaches to develop professional skills and EQ. The effectiveness of these approaches may, however, be compromised by the diversity in the classroom. Instructors should take cognisance of the demographic differences of the individuals within the student group and the impact of these differences on the development of professional skills and EQ, when selecting the pedagogical approaches. Instructors should also take cognisance of the interaction between demographic variables within the <b>demographic</b> <b>groups.</b> This dissertation explored demographic differences in students' perceptions of the professional skills developed {{at the end of their}} IPD. Statistically significant differences were noted between different <b>demographic</b> <b>groups</b> of students on whether they have developed professional skills.
