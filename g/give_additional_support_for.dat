40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to assess the test-retest {{reliability}} of the Work Ability Index (WAI) questionnaire. Reliability was tested using a test-retest design with a 4 week interval between measurements. Valid data were collected among 97 elderly construction workers aged 40 years and older. We analysed the test-retest reliability of the WAI score itself (range 7 - 49 points) and classification in one of the four WAI categories based on this score: poor (7 - 27 points); moderate (28 - 36 points); good (37 - 43 points); and excellent work ability (44 - 49 points). Exactly the same WAI score on both measurements was reported by 25 % of the subjects and 95 % of the individual differences between measurements were found to be < 6. 86 points (two times standard deviation). Despite the individual changes between measurements, no significant difference was reported in the mean WAI score at group level between test and retest measurements (40. 4 versus 39. 9). The percentage of observed agreement for the classification of subjects in one of the four WAI categories on both measurements equalled 66 %.

40|$|A human clonal glioma cell line, U- 343 MGa Cl 2, cultured under serum-free conditions, {{was found}} to release a factor that competed with 125 I-labeled platelet-derived growth factor (125 I-PDGF) for binding to human {{foreskin}} fibroblasts. The concentration of competing activity in conditioned medium was equal to 20 - 30 ng of PDGF per ml. The PDGF receptor competing activity had an elution position on Sephadex G- 200 close to that of tracer PDGF. The same fractions in the chromatogram also contained growth-promoting activity and material active in a PDGF radioimmunoassay. Incubation of partially purified, 125 I-labeled glioma factor with fibroblasts, or rabbit anti-PDGF serum, led to the selective binding of a component with an estimated Mr of 31, 000, as shown by NaDodSO 4 /gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. After reduction this component migrated as a Mr 18, 000 protein. Thus, the behavior in NaDodSO 4 /gel electrophoresis {{was similar to that}} of PDGF. Furthermore, incubation of partially purified glioma factor with immobilized PDGF antibodies markedly decreased the amount of PDGF receptor competing activity remaining in the supernatant. These results suggest that the factor produced by glioma cells has structural, immunological, and functional resemblance to PDGF.

40|$|Information Extraction {{from natural}} texts {{has a great}} {{potential}} {{in areas such as}} Tourism and can be of great assistance in transforming customers 2 ̆ 7 comments in valuable information for Tourism operators, governments and customers. After extraction, information needs to be efficiently transmitted to end-users in a natural way. Systems should not, in general, send extracted information directly to end-users, such as hotel managers, as {{it can be difficult to}} read. Naturally, humans transmit and encode information using natural languages, such as Portuguese. The problem arising from the need of efficient and natural transmission of the information to end-user is how to encode it. The use of natural language generation (NLG) is a possible solution, for producing sentences, and, with them, texts. In this paper we address this, with a data-to-text system, a derivation of formal NLG systems that use data as input. The proposed system uses an aligned corpus, which was defined, collected and processed, in about approximately 3 weeks of work. To build the language model were used three different in-domain and out-of-domain corpora. The effects of this approach were evaluated, and results are presented. Automatic metrics, BLEU and Meteor, were used to evaluate the different systems, comparing their values with similar systems. Results show that expanding the corpus has a major positive effect in BLEU and Meteor scores and use of additional corpora (in-domain and out-of-domain) in training language model does not result in significantly different performance. The scores obtained, combined with their comparison with other systems performance and informal evaluation by humans of the sentences produced, <b>give</b> <b>additional</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the capabilities of the translation based approach for fast development of data-to-text for new domains...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} tree {{of mammals}} is being resolved quickly. Complete mitochondrial DNA sequences are valuable data for deep mammalian phylogenetic relationships. From this study, {{the use of}} long-range PCR followed by short-range PCR and sequencing was {{proven to be a}} successful strategy for sequencing complete mt-genomes. This method is more efficient and cheaper than current cloning approaches. This method is also able to avoid most of the nuclear mitochondrial copies. Long branch attraction is a problem confusing the deep mammalian phylogeny. By sequencing complete mt-genomes of key taxa (2 marsupials, 2 bats, a pika, a gymnure, a rodent and a shrew) to break up long branches, this study resolve some ambiguous relationships in mammalian phylogeny. The 8 mammalian mitochondrial DNA sequences from this study <b>give</b> <b>additional</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the 4 groupings (Xenarthrans, Afrotheria, Supraprimates and Laurasiatheria) of placental mammals from current molecular studies. Some of the ambiguous relationships of higher mammalian relationships also get improved resolution. Bats are a monophyletic group but megabats may be paraphyletic. Eulipotyphla is a monophyletic group and deepest in the Laurasiatheria. Rodents are monophyletic and apart from a problem with the tree shrew, are sister to lagomorphs (Glires). With the new gymnure complete mt-DNA available, the aberrant hedgehog mt-genome is returning to its traditional position in the placental tree and joins other Eulipotyphla (mole, shrew). This monophyletic Eulipotyphla is observed {{for the first time in}} the mammalian mitochondrial tree. The Erinaceidae (hedgehog and gymnure) and murid rodent seem to be under different processes of evolution and are attracted to the outgroups. By comparing trees without outgroups (unrooted trees) and with outgroups (rooted trees) and by constraining group(s) with unstable positions, the influence of marsupials/platypus outgroups on Erinaceidae and murid rodent can be investigated. The results from this study suggest that there is a long branch attraction problem between marsupials/platypus outgroups and murid rodent and Erinaceidae; the basal postions of Erinaceidae and murid rodent found in previous studies may be long branch attraction artifacts. The resolved mammalian tree will be the basis for further molecular studies for estimating the time of divergence of extant mammalian orders, for the prediction of protein secondary structure, for the processes of transition of nucleotides and amino acids sequences in the tree, etc. Having a resolved mammalian tree is not the end for this research, rather a pivotal step for understanding evolution in molecular level...|$|E
40|$|Healthy coastal {{fish stocks}} and {{communities}} comprise {{an important part}} of the environmental targets of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Baltic Sea Action Plan, both in Sweden and the Baltic Sea as a whole. As such, the status of fish communities along our coasts should be assessed and Good Environmental Status (GES) should be achieved in 2020 by using a suite of selected indicators. Many coastal fish stocks in the Baltic Sea are typically local in their appearance and response to environmental conditions. In spite of a well-developed coastal fish monitoring program in Sweden, there are still spatial gaps in its coverage limiting the potential for a full comprehensive status assessment of coastal fish. Within the commercial fishery, all fishermen are obliged to report the catches and effort of their fishery to the European Commission via daily logbooks. To date, however, the information gathered from the small-scale coastal fisheries has not been used to assess the status and development of coastal fish stocks and communities. In this report we assess the potential for using data collected within the small-scale coastal fishery for indicator development and status assessments of coastal fish by 1) screening the species targeted and gears used in the commercial fishery, 2) comparing the temporal development of indicators derived from the commercial fishery and fishery independent coastal fish monitoring, and 3) comparing the outcome of status assessments derived from indicators developed using the two sources of data. Our results show that the commercial coastal fishery in Sweden is mainly targeting cod, herring, whitefish, flounder and perch, and to a minor extent also pike and pike-perch. These species are mainly caught using gillnets, but in some areas traps or trap-nets are of importance. Catches of species of noncommercial value as roach and breams and other members of the carp family are very low or not registered, and the data is hence limited to a few species of commercial importance. We found an overall weak match and substantial variation across coastal areas between indicators derived from the commercial fishery and fisheries independent monitoring data. There was, however, a reasonable concordance between the Abundance of large perch (above 25 cm) from monitoring data and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of perch in the commercial fishery. When assessing the environmental status of the fish communities based on indicators derived from the two sources of data, there was a rather good overall match in GES for the indicators Abundance of perch, Abundance of large perch and Abundance of piscivores and CPUE based indicators from the commercial fishery. The match was lower for the indicator Abundance of large piscivores and indicators ignoring effort data in the commercial fishery. Our results suggest that CPUE data from the coastal commercial fishery could potentially be used as a complement and <b>give</b> <b>additional</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> status assessments of coastal fish in Sweden, particularly for the indicator Abundance of large perch. Since no information on size structure or the abundance of species of low commercial value could be obtained from the coastal commercial fisheries statistics, the data reported is in its current form of limited use for more detailed assessments of coastal fish communities. This regards important parameters such as size structure and the abundance of important functional groups as carp fishes. The fisheries statistics includes many sources for potential errors, but there are some means that can be used to increase the value of this data for assessments. The quality of the reporting can be improved, a selected number of coastal fishermen can be contracted for more detailed self-reporting of their catches and efforts. It is especially important to focus on registration of by-catch (both undersized fish of focal species and species of non-commercial value), subsampling for length and age estimates, and improved resolution of the effort and fishing location. This would be especially valid for those species and stocks that we have limited information on in the fishery independent gillnet monitoring programs as for example whitefish, pike-perch, pike and flatfishes...|$|E

We successfully model these variations using a precessing asymmetric accretion disk with a varying emissivity law. We interpret the emissivity variation as due to the fact that the source of ionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximum emission to drift inwards (and thus to regions of higher velocities).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -&# 945;, TNF-&# 946; and interleukin (IL) - 10 gene polymorphisms with the OLP risk. Material and Methods Forty two unrelated patients with OLP and 211 healthy volunteers were genotyped for TNF-&# 945; (- 308 G/A), TNF-&# 946; (+ 252 A/G), IL- 10 (- 1082 G/A), IL- 10 (- 819 C/T), and IL- 10 (- 592 C/A) polymorphisms. Results The frequencies of allele A and genotype GA of TNF-&# 945; (- 308 G/A) were significantly higher while allele G and GG genotypes were lower in OLP patients as compared to the controls (P 0. 05).

40|$|A {{modeling}} {{of the normal}} state of the p-doped high-temperature superconductors (HTSC's) is presented. This is achieved starting from a more conventional metallic phase for optimal- and overdoping and passing via the underdoped to the insulating state by consecutive orbital selective compressibility-incompressibility transitions in terms of sum rules for the charge response. The modeling is substantiated by corresponding phonon calculations. Extending investigations of the full dispersion and in particular of the strongly doping dependent anomalous phonon modes in LaCuO, which so far underpin our treatment of the density response of the electrons in the p-doped HTSC's, <b>gives</b> <b>additional</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the {{modeling of}} the electronic state, compares well with recent experimental data and predicts the dispersion for the overdoped regime. Moreover, phonon densities of states have been calculated and compared for the insulating, underdoped, optimally doped and overdoped state of LaCuO. From our modeling of the normal state a consistent picture of the superconducting phase also can be extracted qualitatively pointing in the underdoped regime to a phase ordering transition. On the other hand, the modeling of the optimal and overdoped state {{is consistent with a}} quasi-particle picture with a well defined Fermi surface. Thus, in the latter case a Fermi surface instability with an evolution of pairs of well defined quasiparticles is possible and can lead to a BCS-type ordering. So, it is tempting to speculate that optimal $T_C$ in the HTSC's marks a crossover region between these two forms of ordering.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{commonly}} accepted that embryonic segmentation of vertebrates is regulated by a segmentation clock, which is {{induced by the}} cycling genes Hes 1 and Hes 7. Their products form dimers that bind to the regulatory regions and thereby repress the transcription of their own encoding genes. An increase of the half-life of Hes 7 protein causes irregular somite formation. This was shown in recent experiments by Hirata et al. In the same work, numerical simulations from a delay differential equations model, originally invented by Lewis, <b>gave</b> <b>additional</b> <b>support.</b> <b>For</b> a longer half-life of the Hes 7 protein, these simulations exhibited strongly damped oscillations with, after few periods, severely attenuated the amplitudes. In these simulations, the Hill coefficient, a crucial model parameter, was set to 2 indicating that Hes 7 has only one binding site in its promoter. On the other hand, Bessho et al. established three regulatory elements in the promoter region. Results We show that – with the same half life – the delay system is highly sensitive {{to changes in the}} Hill coefficient. A small increase changes the qualitative behaviour of the solutions drastically. There is sustained oscillation and hence the model can no longer explain the disruption of the segmentation clock. On the other hand, the Hill coefficient is correlated with the number of active binding sites, and with the way in which dimers bind to them. In this paper, we adopt response functions in order to estimate Hill coefficients for a variable number of active binding sites. It turns out that three active transcription factor binding sites increase the Hill coefficient by at least 20 % as compared to one single active site. Conclusion Our findings lead to the following crucial dichotomy: either Hirata's model is correct for the Hes 7 oscillator, in which case at most two binding sites are active in its promoter region; or at least three binding sites are active, in which case Hirata's delay system does not explain the experimental results. Recent experiments by Chen et al. seem to support the former hypothesis, but the discussion is still open. </p...|$|R
