Linear regressions are used on datasets extracted from the World Values Survey for four study countries – Australia, the USA, Britain and New Zealand. The {{results show that the}} conventional civic engagement model <b>no</b> longer <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> contemporary youth are statistically less engaged in politics than adults. The index of progressive individualism developed in this study, however, does diminish the impact of age in determining variation in political engagement.

Japan's leading pharmaceutical firms invest less in R&D and record lower sales than leading global firms.
