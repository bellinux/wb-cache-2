40|$|A {{hypervelocity}} <b>impact</b> <b>shield</b> assembly {{for protecting}} a spacecraft surface from hypervelocity impactors. The shield assembly includes {{at least one}} sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer of hypervelocity impactor disrupting/shocking material. A primary spacing element, including space-rated open cell foam material, is positioned between {{the at least one}} sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and a spacecraft surface. A cover member is arranged and disposed relative to the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and the primary spacing element to maintain the integrity of the hypervelocity <b>impact</b> <b>shield</b> assembly. In the event of exposure to a hypervelocity impactor, the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer is perforated while shocking the impactor breaking it into fragments, and/or melting it, and/or vaporizing it, thus providing a dispersion {{in the form of an}} expanding debris cloud/plume which spreads the impact energy of the impactor over a volume formed by the primary spacing element between the sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer and the spacecraft surface. This significantly reduces impact lethality at the spacecraft surface. The space-rated open cell foam material provides an extremely lightweight, low-cost, efficient means of spacing and supporting the at least one sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer before, during, and after launch. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is in the form of a multi-shock assembly including a plurality of sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layers. In such instance, the hypervelocity <b>impact</b> <b>shield</b> assembly includes a plurality of secondary spacing elements. Each secondary spacing element is positioned adjacent an associated sacrificial impactor disrupting/shocking layer to form a multi-shock subassembly.

40|$|AbstractThe parallel, Double Wall, {{hypervelocity}} <b>impact</b> <b>shield</b> configuration {{has been}} heavily tested and characterized for ballistic performance for normal and oblique impacts for the ISS and other programs. However, in many locations with spacecraft designs, the rear wall cannot be modeled as being parallel or concentric with the outer bumper wall and in cases with a cylindrical outer wall, the effective non-parallel angle commonly varies as the outer wall impact location changes. This complicates micrometeoroid and orbital debris assessment of critical spacecraft components located within outer spacecraft walls. Based {{on a study}} combining hypervelocity impact testing and hydrodynamic impact simulations on multiple shield configurations including non-parallel first and rear walls, this paper provides equation adjustments for use with the double wall Ballistic Limit Equation (BLE) {{for a variety of}} impact speeds, non-parallel wall angles and impact obliquities...|$|E

The {{first part of this}} dissertation is aimed at developing an understanding of the hypervelocity impact response of CNTs – at the nanotube level. Impact experiments are designed with CNTs as projectiles to impact and crater aluminum plates. The results show that carbon nanotubes are resistant to the high-energy shock pressures and the ultra-high strain loading during hypervelocity impacts. Under our experimental conditions, single-walled carbon nanotubes survive impacts up to 4. 07 km/s, but transform to graphitic ribbons and nanodiamonds at higher impact velocities. The nanodiamonds are metastable and transform to onion-like nanocarbon over time. Double-walled carbon nanotubes retain their form and structure even at impacts over 7 km/s. Higher hypervelocity impact resistance of DWCNTs could be attributed to the absorption of additional energy due to relative motion between the layers in the transverse direction of these coaxial nanotubes.

Composite laminates were prepared via compression molding and nanotube buckypapers via vacuum filtration.

The experimental results show that nanotubes dispersed in polymer matrix do not affect the hypervelocity impact resistance of the composite system.

40|$|New {{concepts}} for protective shields for NASA s Crew Exploration Vehicles (CEVs) {{and planetary}} probes offer improved mission safety and affordability. Hazards include radiation from cosmic rays and solar particle events, hypervelocity impacts from orbital debris/ micrometeorites, and the extreme heating environment experienced during entry into planetary atmospheres. The traditional approach {{for the design}} of protection systems for these hazards has been to create single-function shields, i. e. ablative and blanket-based heat shields for thermal protection systems (TPS), polymer or other low-molecular-weight materials for radiation shields, and multilayer, Whipple-type shields for protection from hypervelocity impacts. This paper introduces an approach {{for the development of a}} single, multifunctional protective shield, employing nanotechnology- based materials, to serve simultaneously as a TPS, an <b>impact</b> <b>shield</b> and as the first line of defense against radiation. The approach is first to choose low molecular weight ablative TPS materials, (existing and planned for development) and add functionalized carbon nanotubes. Together they provide both thermal and radiation (TR) shielding.

40|$|International audienceIcy {{deposits}} surrounding Planum Boreum, Mars, contain {{crucial information}} for deciphering paleoclimate and past geologic processes at the martian north pole. One such deposit, Abalos Mensa, is an enigmatic wedge of material {{located near the}} ~ 1 km high Rupes Tenuis. Its unique location and lobate morphology have fostered formation hypotheses that assume either fluvial or aeolian erosion of a once-larger ice deposit. The aeolian scenario posed previously requires <b>impact</b> <b>shielding</b> of ancient basal unit material to provide an erosional remnant which seeds later deposition, while the fluvial hypotheses invoke cryovolcanism beneath the younger north polar layered deposits (NPLD) and associated outflow to erode the adjacent chasmata. Here we combine newly available radar sounding data, high-resolution imagery, digital elevation models, and atmospheric modeling to examine internal structure and infer both the mechanisms for, and timing of, Abalos Mensa formation. From this integrative approach, we conclude that Abalos Mensa formed as a distinct feature via atmospheric deposition following erosion of Rupes Tenuis and grew concurrently {{with the rest of}} Planum Boreum as the NPLD accumulated. The required processes are consistent with those observed today: no exotic phenomena (cryovolcanism, fluvial activity, or <b>impact</b> <b>shielding)</b> appear necessary to explain the formation of Abalos Mensa.

40|$|The {{presence}} of a honeycomb core in a multi-wall shielding configuration for protection against micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) particle impacts at hypervelocity is {{generally considered to be}} detrimental as the cell walls act to restrict fragment cloud expansion, creating a more concentrated load on the shield rear wall. However, mission requirements often prevent the inclusion of a dedicated MMOD shield, and as such, structural honeycomb sandwich panels are amongst the most prevalent shield types. Open cell metallic foams are a relatively new material with novel mechanical and thermal properties that have shown promising results in preliminary hypervelocity <b>impact</b> <b>shielding</b> evaluations. In this study, an ISS-representative MMOD shielding configuration has been modified to evaluate the potential performance enhancement gained through the substitution of honeycomb for open cell foam. The baseline shielding configuration consists of a double mesh outer layer, two honeycomb sandwich panels, and an aluminum rear wall. In the modified configuration the two honeycomb cores are replaced by open-cell foam. To compensate for the heavier core material, facesheets have been removed from the second sandwich panel in the modified configuration. A total of 19 tests on the double layer honeycomb and double layer foam configurations are reported. For comparable mechanical and thermal performance, the foam modifications were shown to provide a 15 % improvement in critical projectile diameter at low velocities (i. e. 3 km/s) and a 3 % increase at high velocities (i. e. 7 km/s) for normal impact. With increasing obliquity, the performance enhancement was predicted to increase, up to a 29 % improvement at 60 (low velocity). Ballistic limit equations have been developed for the new configuration, and consider the mass of each individual shield component in order to maintain validity in the event of minor configuration modifications. Previously identified weaknesses of open cell foams for hypervelocity <b>impact</b> <b>shielding</b> such as large projectile diameters, low velocities, and high degrees of impact obliquity have all been investigated, and found to be negligible for the double-layer configuration...|$|R

The modeling effort focused on varying HEU masses from 1 kg to 20 kg; varying types of shields including wood, steel, cement, polyethylene, and borated polyethylene; varying depths of the HEU in the shields, and varying engineered shields immediately surrounding the HEU including steel, tungsten, and cadmium. Neutron and gamma-ray signatures were the focus of the study and false negative detection probabilities versus measurement time were used as a performance metric. To facilitate comparisons among different approaches an automated method was developed to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for different sets of model variables for multiple background count rate conditions. This paper summarizes results or the analysis, including laboratory benchmark comparisons between simulations and experiments. The important <b>impact</b> engineered <b>shields</b> can play towards degrading detectability and methods for mitigating this will be discussed...|$|R
