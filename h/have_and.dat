5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective.

The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E

5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.

5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents.

Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma.

However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E

5|$|Lexical {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language.

Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers <b>have</b> <b>and</b> use these innovative signs.|$|E

5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as <b>have</b> <b>and</b> do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} {{that began with the}} {{accession}} of the Emperor Nerva and ended with the death of the Emperor Commodus, the Empire continued to weaken. It was becoming difficult to recruit enough soldiers for the army, inflation was becoming an issue, and on at least one occasion, the Empire almost went bankrupt. The most significant constitutional development during this era was the steady drift towards monarchy. M. Cocceius Nerva succeeded Domitian, and although his reign was too short for any major constitutional reforms, he did reverse some of his predecessor's abuses. He was succeeded by Trajan in 98, who then went further than even Nerva had in restoring the image of a free republic, by, for example, allowing the senate to regain some independent legislative abilities. Hadrian succeeded Trajan as Emperor. By far, his most important constitutional alteration was his creation of a bureaucratic apparatus, which included a fixed gradation of clearly defined offices, and a corresponding order of promotion. Hadrian was succeed by Antonius Pius, who made no real changes to the constitution. Antonius Pius was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius in 161. The most significant constitutional development that occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius was the revival of the republican principle of collegiality, as he made his brother, L. Aelius, his co-emperor. In 169, Aelius died, and in 176, Marcus Aurelius made his son, L. Aurelius Commodus, his new co-emperor. In 180, Marcus Aurelius died, and Commodus became Emperor. Commodus' tyranny revived the worst memories of the later Julian emperors, as he was more explicit than any of his predecessors in taking powers that he did not legally <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> in disregarding the constitution. He was killed in 192.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E
