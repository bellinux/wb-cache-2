25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs), {{also called}} buckytubes, are carbon molecules with a cylindrical nanostructure. They have a hollow structure with walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of graphene. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("chiral") angles, {{and the combination}} of chiral angle and radius controls properties such as electrical conductivity, electrolyte wettability and ion access. Nanotubes are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs). The latter have one or more outer tubes successively enveloping a SWNT, much like the Russian matryoshka dolls. SWNTs have diameters ranging between 1 and 3nm. MWNTs have thicker coaxial walls, separated by spacing (0.34nm) that is close to graphene's <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multi-walled {{nanotubes}} (MWNTs) {{consist of}} multiple rolled layers (concentric tubes) of graphene. There are two models {{that can be}} used to describe the structures of multi-walled nanotubes. In the Russian Doll model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g., a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the Parchment model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> in multi-walled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 Å. The Russian Doll structure is observed more commonly. Its individual shells can be described as SWNTs, which can be metallic or semiconducting. Because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes, one of the shells, and thus the whole MWNT, is usually a zero-gap metal.|$|E

30|$|Based on first-principle calculations, the stability, {{electronic}} structure, optical absorption, and modulated electronic properties {{by different}} <b>interlayer</b> <b>distances</b> or by external electric fields of bilayer α-GeTe are systemically investigated. Results show that van der Waals (vdW) bilayer α-GeTe has an indirect band structure with the gap value of 0.610 [*]eV, and α-GeTe has attractively efficient light harvesting. Interestingly, {{along with the}} decrease of <b>interlayer</b> <b>distances,</b> the band gap of bilayer α-GeTe decreases linearly, due to the enhancement of interlayer vdW interaction. In addition, band gap transition is originated from the electric field-induced near free-electron gas (NFEG) under the application of positive electrical fields. However, when the negative electric fields are applied, there is no NFEG. On account of these characteristics of bilayer α-GeTe, a possible data storage device has been designed. These results indicate that bilayer α-GeTe has a potential to work in new electronic and optoelectronic devices.|$|R

50|$|The {{detailed}} {{structure of}} SWNHs was further extensively analyzed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The considerably strong peak due to single bonding carbons {{was observed in}} C1s XPS spectrum of SWNH. This peak intensity increased with oxidation treatment, coinciding with the decrease in Raman G/D intensity ratio. It was concluded {{that the presence of}} a considerable amount of single bonding carbons was the reason for the unique assembly structure accompanying with a strong D-band in Raman spectrum of SWNHs.

5000|$|Permeation {{of water}} through the {{membrane}} {{was attributed to}} swelling of graphite oxide structure which enables water penetration path between individual graphene oxide layers. The <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> of dried graphite oxide was reported as 6.35 Å, but in liquid water it increased to 11.6 Å. Remarkably, the paper also cited the inter-layer distance in diluted NaOH as infinity thus reporting dispersion of graphite oxide on single-layered graphene oxide sheets in solution. The study also reported permeation rate of membranes for water 0.1 mg per minute per square cm. The diffusion rate of water was evaluated as 1 cm/hour. Boehm's paper also showed that graphite oxide {{can be used as}} cation exchange membrane and reports measurements of osmotic pressures, membrane potentials in KCl, HCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, BaCl2 solutions.

In 1995 Clearfield and coworkers elucidated its structure using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) and the Rietveld refinement method. [...] The structure of γ-Zirconium phosphate consists of Zr(IV) atoms octahedrally coordinated to four different oxygen atoms of an orthophosphate.

50|$|For {{the case}} of Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx, etching with {{concentrated}} hydrofluoric acid leads to open, accordion-like morphology with a compact distance between layers (this is common for other MXene compositions as well). To be dispersed in suspension, the material must be pre-intercalated with something like dimethylsulfoxide. However, when etching is conducted with hydrochloric acid and LiF as a fluoride source, morphology is more compact with a larger inter-layer spacing, presumably due to amounts of intercalated water. The material {{has been found to}} be ‘clay-like’: as seen in clay materials (e.g. smectite clays and kaolinite), Ti3C2Tx demonstrates the ability to expand its <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> hydration and can reversibly exchange charge-balancing Group I and Group II cations. Further, when hydrated, the MXene clay becomes pliable and can be molded into desired shapes, becoming a hard solid upon drying. Unlike most clays, however, MXene clay shows high electrical conductivity upon drying and is hydrophilic, being easily dispersed into single layer two-dimensional sheets in water without surfactants. Further, due to these properties, it can be quickly rolled into free-standing, additive-free electrodes for energy storage applications.|$|E

[...] The layered structure of α-Zirconium phosphate consists of Zr(IV) ions situated alternately slightly {{above and below}} the ab plane, forming an octahedron with the oxygen atoms of the tetrahedral phosphate groups. Of the four oxygen atoms in the phosphate groups, three are bonded to three different Zr atoms, forming a cross-linked covalent network. The fourth oxygen atom of the phosphate is perpendicular to the layer pointed toward the interlayer region. In the interlayer region is localized a zeolitic cavity where a basal water molecule resides, forming a hydrogen bond with the OH group of the phosphate that is perpendicular to the layer. The alpha phase of zirconium phosphate is under the P21/n space group, with cell dimensions of a = 9.060 Å, b = 5.297 Å, c = 15.414 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 101.71° and Z = 4.21 The basal <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> for the α-Zirconium phosphate is 7.6 Å, where 6.6 Å is the layer thickness and the remaining 1 Å space is occupied by the interstitial water molecules in the interlayer gallery.

30|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> {{on the performance of}} the EDLC cells was systematically investigated. The experiment results indicated that the intercalation of SDS surfactant in TRG sheets could prevent the restacking of the TRGS sheets resulting in an <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> of 0.66  nm. A facile approach was demonstrated to tuning the <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> of TRGSE by introducing the EMI-TFSI to interact with TRGS. It is found that the vibration mode of the intercalated SDS is shifted by the interaction with EMI-TFSI IL implying the occurrence of Coulomb interaction between the SDS and EMI-TFSI. It is also found, the <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> of the TRGSE is enlarged to 3.92  nm. These results suggest the formation of large ionic aggregates or micelle in TRGSE sheets. Also, with the large <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance,</b> the TRGSE (200.5  F/g) has a capacitance of 1.78 folds higher than the TRGS (112.7  F/g). Also, the energy density of the TRGSE (61.8  Wh/g) is 1.77 folds higher than that of TRGS (34.9  Wh/kg). The increase in both capacitance and energy density would be attributed to the increased <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> of TRGSE that increase the accessible surface area for the EMI-TFSI electrolyte.|$|E

Also, the <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> of the TRGSE sheets is further enlarged to 3.92  nm suggesting the formation of SDS/EMI-TFSI aggregates or micelles. The substantial improvements in both capacitance and energy density of the TRGSE cells may mainly attribute to the large <b>interlayer</b> <b>distance</b> that leads to the more accessible surface area for the large-sized ILs.|$|E
