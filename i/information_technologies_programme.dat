An agent driven service negotiations and decision process based on usage-centred knowledge about task requirements substitutes the traditional production planning activity. We introduce methodology for integration of the project-driven production planning based on agent-based engineering within the existing enterprise resource planning system...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation in {{information}} retrieval (IR) has focussed largely on noninteractive evaluation of text retrieval systems. This is increasingly {{at odds with}} how people use modern IR systems: in highly interactive settings to access linked, multimedia information. Furthermore, this approach ignores potential improvements through better interface design. In 1996 the Commission of the European Union <b>Information</b> <b>Technologies</b> <b>Programme,</b> funded a three year working group, Mira, to discuss and advance {{research in the area}} of evaluation frameworks for interactive and multimedia IR applications. Led by Keith van Rijsbergen, Steve Draper and myself from Glasgow University, this working group brought together many of the leading researchers in the evaluation domain from both the IR and human computer interaction (HCI) communities. This paper presents my personal view of the main lines of discussion that took place throughout Mira: importing and adapting evaluation techniques from HCI, evaluating at different levels as appropriate, evaluating against different types of relevance and the new challenges that drive the need for rethinking the old evaluation approaches. The paper concludes that we need to consider more varied forms of evaluation to complement engine evaluation...|$|E

For this to be possible, firstly, educational policy and plans have to be adjusted. Secondly, teachers must get a thorough introduction to computer ethics, and learn appropriate teaching methods. Finally, teaching materials have to be developed and distributed. We describe ongoing efforts to help bring all this about. status: publishe...|$|R

Although <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> <b>programmes</b> in New Zealand do include industry projects and some limited work experience, there may be potential in the IT tertiary sector for a more structured work experience course performed under industry and academic supervision. This paper looks at the advantages of an internship or work experience paper to the student, industry and to the tertiary provider. A proposed structure for such a course is outlined in the discussion with the distinctions drawn between the internship / work experience model and the industry projects model. Examples are provided from other academic disciplines where structured work experience {{has had a long}} history informing the practitioner environment as well as providing valuable real-world experience to the trainee student. These examples from other disciplines are explored for any implications that can be drawn for the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> education community.
