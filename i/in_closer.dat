5|$|Benbow {{returned}} to active naval service in September 1693, joining Thomas Phillips, the second engineer of the ordnance, in jointly commanding a flotilla of bomb vessels to attack Saint-Malo. Benbow went aboard the 48-gun HMS Norwich {{and began the}} bombardment on 16 November. It continued intermittently until 19 November when a large fireship was sent into the harbour. An {{attempt was made to}} bring her alongside the town walls, but she ran aground, was set on fire, and exploded. Despite the failure of the initial plan, considerable damage was done, and Benbow's forces were able to take the fort on Quince Rock and disabled it, carrying artillery and prisoners away and bringing them to Guernsey. Benbow was still dissatisfied with the overall result and initiated a court-martial against Captain Henry Tourville, accusing him of cowardice for not bringing his ship <b>in</b> <b>closer.</b> There was no conviction though, as the mortars were proved to be defective.|$|E
5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, because that would place the homologous duplexes <b>in</b> <b>closer</b> alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E
5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and the stage is set for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral <b>in</b> <b>closer</b> together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E

5|$|The Benedictine reform {{movement}} on the continent started with the foundation of Cluny Abbey in Burgundy in 909-10, but the influence of Cluny, which was innovative in its customs, was largely confined to Burgundy. England's closest links were with the more conservative Fleury Abbey on the Loire, which had great prestige because it held Saint Benedict's body. The leaders of the English movement were also influenced by the reforms which had been promulgated by the Carolingian Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious at the Synods of Aachen in the 810s, and particularly their promulgation of uniform monastic rules {{under the authority of}} the crown. Modest religious and diplomatic contacts between England and the Continent under Alfred and his son Edward the Elder (899–924) intensified during the reign of Æthelstan, which saw the start of the monastic revival. Four of Æthelstan's half-sisters married European rulers, resulting <b>in</b> <b>closer</b> contacts between the English and Continental courts than ever before.

5|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting a Gold Star {{in lieu of}} a Second Award of the Navy Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Phil Hinkle Bucklew, United States Naval (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service in the line of his profession as Officer in Charge of an LCT Scout Boat during the amphibious assault on the Normandy Coast of France on June 6, 1944. Embarked in one of the first craft to approach the strongly defended cost, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bucklew successfully accomplished his highly important mission of locating the designated beaches and, despite rough surf and continuous harassing enemy fire, skillfully led the first wave of DD tanks, going in close to the beach and taking his station as guide. Firing his boat's rockets over the tanks at target objectives in support of the landings, he moved <b>in</b> <b>closer</b> to direct his guns at suspected hostile machine-gun nests in houses along the beach and subsequently, in the face of heavy enemy opposition, rescued wounded personnel from burning landing craft and regulated the flow of traffic throughout the morning and afternoon of D-Day. The conduct of Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bucklew throughout this action reflects great credit upon himself, and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
5|$|The score {{remained}} the same through the fourth inning. Fogg was relieved by Taylor Buchholz {{in the top of}} the fifth and, following a double by Tulowitzki, Peavy allowed the game-tying run to score on a Holliday single. Seth Smith, pinch hitting for the pitcher in the bottom of the sixth, hit a triple and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Matsui to give the Rockies a 6–5 lead. The Rockies' Garrett Atkins appeared to homer in the bottom of the seventh, extending the Rockies lead, but umpires ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall, which was still in play, and awarded Atkins a double. Jamey Carroll pinch ran for Atkins, but no runs scored in the inning. The Rockies brought <b>in</b> <b>closer</b> Brian Fuentes {{in the top of the}} 8th, but the Padres re-tied the game when Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning, advanced to second base on a wild pitch, and scored on a double by Brian Giles.

The {{shelling}} lasted until 11:00 PM and delayed the assault until 1:00 AM when the Nerid began escorting the boats <b>in</b> <b>closer</b> to shore. Though at first the second Sardinian attack was unnoticed by the Tripolitanians, a sentry sighted the approaching force at 2:30 AM. Despite resistance from the Tripolitanian fleet and forces ashore, Mamelli pushed his force onward through grapeshot and musket fire. He soon reached the Tripolitanian brig and had his force board her, killing its officers and captain {{as well as a}} large portion of its crew. A second section of boats assaulted the schooners, taking them by boarding. At the same time, the third section of Sardinian boats managed to force their way ashore despite heavy opposition, capturing the dockyard and routing its Tripolitanian defenders. At 3:30 AM Mamelli fired off two rockets to signal a retreat, and burned the Tripolitanian ships his force had captured.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the largest}} {{political}} {{divisions of the}} Song known as circuits (lu) {{there were a number}} of prefectures (zhou), which in turn were divided into the smallest political units of counties (xian); there were about 1,230 counties during the Song period. The prefect during the early Northern Song was the prime official of local government authority, who was the lowest regional official allowed to memorialize the throne, was primary tax collector, and head magistrate over several magistrates within his jurisdiction that dealt with civil disputes and maintaining order. By the late Northern Song, the growth in the number of counties with different proportions in population under a prefect's jurisdiction decreased the importance of the latter office, as it became more difficult for the prefect to manage the counties. This was part of a larger continuum of administrative trends from the Tang to Ming dynasties, with the gradual decline of importance of intermediate administrative units—the prefectures—alongside a shift of power from central government to large regional administrations; the latter experienced progressively less influence of central government in their routine affairs. In the Southern Song, four semi-autonomous regional command systems were established based on territorial and military units; this influenced the model of detached service secretariats which became the provincial administrations (sheng) of the Yuan (1279–1368), Ming (1368–1644), and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties. The administrative control of the Southern Song central government over the empire became increasingly limited to the circuits located <b>in</b> <b>closer</b> proximity to the capital at Hangzhou, while those farther away practiced greater autonomy.|$|E
