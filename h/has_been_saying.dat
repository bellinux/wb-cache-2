He expanded, saying, [...] "They ought to worry about commitment under any circumstances. Every president <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> that the NATO countries do not pay their fair share". He also stated that, {{in the context of}} whether the United States would provide aid to Estonia (a NATO member) {{in the event of a}} Russian invasion, he [...] "would think about it a great deal".|$|E
500|$|The {{strain in}} race {{relations}} {{led to the}} Singaporean 1964 Race Riots, which PAP Malay politician Othman Wok later insinuated were planned beforehand by the ultras. In the year following the riots, tension continued growing. Syed Jaafar Albar declared that [...] "Wherever I am, I am a Malay", drawing harsh return fire from Lee, who stated in Parliament: [...] "If I had been going round and saying what [...] <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> — wherever I am, I am a Chinese — where would we be? But I keep on reminding the people that I am a Malaysian. I am learning Bahasa Kebangsaan [...] and I accept Article 153 of the Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{threat to}} Phelps' goal was Serbia's Milorad Čavić. In Athens 2004, Čavić was leading in a {{semifinal}} of the 100 metre butterfly, but right after his final turn, his suit {{opened at the}} neck and sucked in water, causing Čavić to finish last {{with a time of}} 53.12 seconds. At the 2008 European Championships, Čavić won the men's 50 metre butterfly and was the heavy favorite to win at twice that distance, but was suspended for wearing a [...] "Kosovo is Serbia" [...] T-shirt on the medal podium. American swimmer Gary Hall, Jr. told The New York Times that although [...] "Mike (Phelps) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> he’s going to win the 100 fly at the Olympics for the last year", he thought that Čavić would be the winner.|$|E

2500|$|Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion {{initially}} expressed pessimism over Miller's 'One-cent now' campaign, {{stating that}} [...] "I {{can assure you}} our citizens [...] can’t point out to us where there’s a lot of waste. Toronto, unfortunately, has that situation, in which their citizens are saying it, {{as well as their}} board of trade <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> it and even their own councillors are saying it". Denzil Minnan-Wong compared the two mayors, saying [...] "Hazel McCallion runs a tight ship. David Miller’s ship has leaks all over the place,” and some commentators suggested that Toronto would have a difficult time making a credible case to the federal government for funding. She unveiled her own plan known as 'Cities Now!' to get federal funding for municipal infrastructure. However, McCallion's proposal did not receive support during a meeting with fifteen regional mayors, and she agreed to support Miller's campaign.|$|E

Marty was tense that whole day, when he put the kids to bed though he calmed down considerably and was finally consoled.|$|R
