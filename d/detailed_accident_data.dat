Such severe road accidents cause harsh safety hazards on the roads of Sylhet area. This research work presents an overview of the road traffic accident and degraded road safety situation in Sylhet zone which in particular, discusses the key road accident problem characteristics identifying the hazardous roads and spots, most responsible vehicles and related components, conditions of drivers and pedestrians, most victims of accident, effects of accident on society, safety priorities and options available in Sylhet. In this regard, a comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted on the concerned groups of transportation and <b>detailed</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> was collected from a popular local newspaper. Analysis of the study reveals that Dhaka- Sylhet highway is the most hazardous in road basis and Sylhet Sador thana is the most vulnerable in thana basis in Sylhet region...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 26 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2007 "The challenges of implementing policy?", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: A study recently done by the Automobile Association of South Africa recorded an annual total of 70 000 minibus taxi crashes which indicates that taxis in SA amount for double the rate of crashes than all other passenger vehicles. <b>Detailed</b> <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> is not available for this category of vehicle, so there is insufficient evidence to support a clear cause {{for the number of}} fatalities in minibus taxi accidents. Any crash results from a combination of circumstances converging to a point where the driver does not have the skills or the options to avoid the crash. Systematic investigation is necessary to identify patterns of failure resulting in a crash. This could be associated with driver behaviour, road conditions or/and vehicle features. This paper is a follow up of the paper {{presented at}} SATC 2006 and will examine police records and case studies of minibus taxi accidents to scientifically identify any trends and factors causing these accidents. Crucial new evidence has emerged during this investigation. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

The results show that the front-end geometric shape of passenger cars has obvious influence on the dynamics response and injury risk of pedestrians' head.

The estimation results suggest that cruise vessel damage cost per vessel gross ton is greater for: allision, collision, equipment-failure, explosion, fire, flooding, and grounding cruise vessel accidents than for other types of accidents and a human cause. The accident injury severity is greater for ocean cruise than for inland waterway and harbor/dinner cruise vessel accidents and a human cause. The unit damage cost of $ 207 for explosion accidents is greater than that for other types of accidents.

This study investigates {{determinants}} {{of the property}} damage cost and injury severity of ferry vessel <b>accidents.</b> <b>Detailed</b> <b>data</b> of individual ferry vessel accidents for the 11 -year time period 1991 - 2001 that were investigated by the U. S. Coast Guard are used to estimate ferry-vessel accident property damage cost and injury severity equations. Tobit regression is used to estimate the former equation and the ordered probit model is used to estimate the latter. Property damage costs include damage costs to the vessel itself, its cargo and contents, and other-property damage (e. g., damage to pier structures and waterfront facilities). Injury severity for a ferry vessel accident is measured as an ordinal variable – no injuries, non-fatal injuries and fatal injuries. Damage cost and injury severity of individual ferry vessel accidents are expressed as functions {{of the type of}} vessel accident, vessel characteristics, vessel operation phase, weather/visibility conditions, type of waterway, type of vessel propulsion, type of vessel hull construction and cause of vessel accident. The property damage estimation results suggest that allision, collision and fire ferry vessel accidents incur more vessel property damage cost per vessel gross ton than other types of accidents. The injury severity estimation results suggest that injury severity is greater when the ferry vessel accident is caused by human error as opposed to vessel and environmental factors...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{the results}} of this study show that the ITS under study have a strong {{potential}} to improve the safety of PTW riders. It should be noted that the impacts are calculated for the assumed penetration rates and have to be recalculated when more accurate measurements of penetration rates become available. In order to realise the potential safety effects (or obtain even higher safety benefits than estimated in this study), the deployment of the most promising systems should be supported by different stakeholders and decision makers. In future, the accuracy of the estimates can be improved by better <b>accident</b> <b>data</b> (more <b>detailed</b> information on numbers and <b>details</b> of <b>accidents,</b> including also hospital data) and by trials to collect more information on the functioning of the systems and their effect on road user behaviour.|$|R

40|$|Accident {{prediction}} models (APMs) {{have been}} extensively used in site ranking {{with the objective}} of identifying accident hotspots. Previously this has been achieved by using a univariate count data or a multivariate count data model (e. g. multivariate Poissonlognormal) for modelling the number of accidents at different severity levels simultaneously. This paper proposes an alternative method to estimate accident frequency at different severity levels, namely the two-stage mixed multivariate model which combines both accident frequency and severity models. The accident, traffic and road characteristics data from the M 25 motorway and surrounding major roads in England have been collected to demonstrate the use of the two-stage model. A Bayesian spatial model and a mixed logit model have been employed at each stage for accident frequency and severity analysis respectively, and the results combined to produce estimation of the number of accidents at different severity levels. Based on the results from the two-stage model, the accident hotspots on the M 25 and surround have been identified. The ranking result using the twostage model has also been compared with other ranking methods, such as the naïve ranking method, multivariate Poisson-lognormal and fixed proportion method. Compared to the traditional frequency based analysis, the two-stage model has the advantage in that it utilises more <b>detailed</b> individual <b>accident</b> level <b>data</b> and is able to predict low frequency accidents (such as fatal accidents). Therefore, the two-stage mixed multivariate model is a promising tool in predicting accident frequency according to their severity levels and site ranking...|$|R
