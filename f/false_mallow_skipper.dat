50|$|Carcharodus alceae, the <b>mallow</b> <b>skipper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Hesperiidae. The scientific Latin species name alceae refers to the host plants Althaea, which, in turn, are named after the ancient Greek poet Alcaeus of Mytilene.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mallow</b> <b>skippers</b> {{lay their}} eggs {{on top of the}} leaves of {{different}} species of mallow (hence the common name of the species). The larvae mainly feed on Malva sylvestris, Malva moschata, Althaea officinalis, Lavatera thuringiaca and Hibiscus species. [...] The butterfly flies from April to October depending on the location. They get nectar from various herbaceous plants. In Central Europe usually this species has two generations (April-May and July), while in southern areas three or more generations are present. The fully grown caterpillars hibernate and pupate in the next Spring.|$|R
40|$|Background: Malvastrum coromandelianum {{belongs to}} the family Malvaceae, {{commonly}} known as <b>false</b> <b>mallow.</b> Ethnobotanical survey revealed that {{it is used to}} treat various disorders. Pharmacological screening revealed that the plant possess antinoceceptive, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antibacterial activities. Lack of standardization parameters for herbal raw material is a great hindrance in ensuring the purity of M. coromandelianum. The present work was taken up to with a focus to set standardization parameters for M. coromandelianum. Materials and Methods: The plant was subjected to macroscopic and microscopic studies. Physicochemical parameters such as ash value and extractive value were determined by standard procedures. Different extracts were screened for the presence of secondary metabolites. Phenolic and flavonoid contents were estimated. Plant was subjected for high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis using standard chromatographic procedure. Result: The microscopic characteristics showed the dorsiventral nature of leaf. Two types of trichomes were observed: Covering, unicellular, uniseriate, and bi-cellular head sessile glandular. Vascular bundle was surrounded by spongy parenchyma. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence alkaloids, tannins, amino acid proteins, and carbohydrates. The phenolic and flavonoid content estimation revealed the presence of appreciable amount of these constituents, while HPTLC analysis showed the presence of Î²-sitosterol in petroleum ether extract. Conclusion: These findings will be useful for the establishment of standardization parameters for M. coromandelianum...|$|R
50|$|Hibiscus acetosella (cranberry {{hibiscus}} or African rosemallow) is an angiosperm of {{the genus}} Hibiscus or rosemallow. The word acetosella is of Latin origin and is derived from an old name for sorrel (Oxalis) which comes from the sour taste experienced when eating the young leaves of the plant. Hibiscus acetosella is also known colloquially as <b>false</b> roselle, maroon <b>mallow,</b> red leaved hibiscus, and red shield hibiscus. It {{is one of the}} approximately 200-300 species that are seen in sub-tropic and tropic regions. This ornamental is usually found in abandoned fields or open areas, marshes, and forest clearings. Cranberry hibiscus is a member of a perennial group known as hardy hibiscus. In contrast to the tropical hibiscus, hardy hibiscus can tolerate colder conditions, are more vigorous, longer lasting, and have larger flowers. In colder climates, Hibiscus acetosella is easily an annual, but is often regarded as a perennial to zone 8-11. During one season, the plant can grow 90 - 170 cm tall and 75 cm wide as a shrub-subshrub.|$|R
