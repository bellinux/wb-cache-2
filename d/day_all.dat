On their return to work the next <b>day</b> <b>all</b> the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{was very}} {{successful}} in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states.

This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E
