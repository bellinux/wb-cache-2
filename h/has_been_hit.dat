5|$|Iran {{experiences}} {{at least one}} minor earthquake per day on average, and the Zagros region is particularly prone to seismic activity. During the last 100years, Iran <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by more than 130events stronger than magnitude5, with damaging earthquakes near Qeshm recorded in 1360, 1703, 1884, 1897, 1902, and 1905. The majority of Iranian quakes occur in the upper crust, close to the surface, {{which means that they}} are potentially more destructive.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific {{part of the}} Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{dismissal}} effected by the keeper {{is for him}} to catch a ball that has nicked the batsman's bat, called an edge, before it bounces.

More catches are taken by wicket-keepers than by any other fielding position.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} North Carolina owns the North Carolina Railroad Company, {{which owns the}} land and the bridge. (North Carolina Railroad owns no rolling stock, but leases tracks to Amtrak and Norfolk Southern Railway.) A heavy steel crash beam protects the bridge from over-height trucks, but does nothing to prevent crashes or protect the trucks. The crash beam <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> so often that it has had to be {{replaced}} at least once.|$|E
25|$|End-of-ball bonus: After each ball is played, {{the player}} scores bonus points {{depending}} on how many times certain features have been activated or the numbers of items that the player may obtain. Some games award a seemingly arbitrary number of points that depend {{on the number of}} times any switch <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit.</b> Virtually all games have the ability to assign a multiplier to the bonus. Most games cap the bonus multiplier at 5x or 10x, although more modern games apparently have no limit.|$|E

25|$|This ‘Inner Canal’ runs {{between the}} Yangtze and Huai'an in Jiangsu, {{skirting}} the Shaobo, Gaoyou and Hongze lakes of central Jiangsu. Here the land {{lying to the}} west of the canal is higher than its bed while the land to the east is lower. Traditionally the Shanghe region west of the canal has been prone to frequent flooding, while the Xiahe region to its east <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by less frequent but immensely damaging inundations caused by failure of the Grand Canal levees. Recent works have allowed floodwaters from Shanghe to be diverted safely out to sea.|$|E
25|$|Italy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> {{hard by the}} Financial {{crisis of}} 2007–08, that {{exacerbated}} the country's structural problems. Effectively, after a strong GDP growth of 5–6% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s, and a progressive slowdown in the 1980-90s, the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s. The political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt, that stood at over 135% of GDP in 2014, ranking second in the EU only after the Greek one (at 174%). For all that, the largest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece, {{and the level of}} household debt is much lower than the OECD average.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decade, the Philippines <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> {{severely}} by natural disasters. In 2005 alone, Central Luzon {{was hit by}} both a drought, which sharply curtailed hydroelectric power, and by a typhoon that flooded practically all of low-lying Manila's streets. Still more damaging was the 1990 earthquake that devastated a wide area in Luzon, including Baguio and other northern areas. The city of Cebu and nearby areas were struck by a typhoon that killed {{more than a hundred}} people, sank vessels, destroyed part of the sugar crop, and cut off water and electricity for several days. The Philippines is prone to about 6-9 storms which make landfall each year, on average. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption also damaged much of Central Luzon, the lahar burying towns and farmland, and the ashes affecting global temperatures.|$|E

25|$|The {{spring and}} fall months are {{pleasant}} but variable as cold fronts frequently bring strong to severe thunderstorms and occasional tornadoes to the region. The fall season (primarily October) features less rainfall and fewer storms, as well as lower humidity than the spring, but November and early December represent a secondary severe weather season. Birmingham {{is located on the}} heart of a Tornado Alley known as the Dixie Alley due to the high frequency of tornadoes in Central Alabama. The greater Birmingham area <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by two F5 tornadoes; one in Birmingham's northern suburbs in 1977, and second in the western suburbs in 1998. The area was hit by an EF4 tornado which was part of the 2011 Super Outbreak. In late summer and fall months, Birmingham experiences occasional tropical storms and hurricanes due to its proximity to the Central Gulf Coast.|$|E
25|$|Rivals No.10 Arkansas and No.11 Ole Miss met for {{a crucial}} three-game series at Swayze Field. In game one, Arkansas got home runs from Tim Carver and Brett Eibner, plus {{a grand slam}} from Travis Sample. Zack Cox went 3 for 3 (his 30th multi-hit game in 2010) as the Hogs rolled, 11–4. Ole Miss scored three runs {{in the first two}} innings, and despite solo shots from Zack Cox and Tom Hauskey, the Rebels took a 3–2 final. Game three belonged to Mike Bolsinger, as the senior pitcher went eight innings with giving up only two hits and {{striking}} out eleven. Andy Wilkins had 3 RBI as the Hogs won 7–0. Collin Kuhn broke the single-season school hit by pitch record in game three. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> 23 times. With the win, Arkansas took control of the SEC Western division.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{the changes}} in the 2006–2008 report, not all species were removed from the 2008–2010 list due to {{improvement}} in their situation. [...] Instead, new species were added to bring attention to other closely related species with very small populations that are also at risk of extinction. For example, the highly endangered eastern black crested gibbon (Nomascus nasutus) replaced the Hainan black crested gibbon. [...] The Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) replaced the Horton Plains slender loris (Loris tardigradus nycticeboides) because the former <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> the hardest of Asian lorises, all of which are declining rapidly due primarily to capture for the exotic pet trade, as well as use in traditional medicines and forest loss. [...] In another case, the brown-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps fusciceps) was omitted from the list since no spokesperson could be found for the species. [...] The same approach was taken with the 2012–2014 list.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{are on the}} {{run after}} they are {{attacked}} at their safehouse; Hurley drives the unconscious Sayid, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by two drugged darts, to his parents' house. On the way, Hurley is pulled over by deceased Oceanic Flight 815 survivor and former police officer Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who gives him {{advice on how to}} avoid the real cops. Upon arriving home, Hurley's dad, David, covers for them when the police show up and suggests that Hurley take Sayid to the hospital. Hurley refuses, and David ends up taking Sayid to Jack, who is successful in reviving him. At home, Hurley confesses to his mother Carmen that the Oceanic Six have been lying; she believes him, though doesn't understand his disjointed story. Later, Ben unexpectedly shows up at the house and tries to convince Hurley to go with him to meet up {{with the rest of the}} Oceanic Six, saying they all want the same thing—to go back to the island. Hurley wavers for a moment, then runs outside and turns himself in to police watching the house, having been advised by Sayid to do the opposite of whatever Ben asks. Later, Ben visits Ms. Hawking, who tells him she has found the island and that Ben only has seventy hours to return to it with Locke's corpse and the Oceanic Six.|$|E
