The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is <b>easier</b> <b>in</b> the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser data can be used to delimit work areas in the image.|$|E
5|$|Hostilities did not {{end with}} the {{publication}} of the Dictum. The garrison at Kenilworth refused to accept the terms given, and held out until 14 December, when deprivation forced them to surrender. In April 1267, the earl of Gloucesterwho had been central both to the royal victory at Evesham and to the drafting of the Dictumturned against the king. He occupied the city of London, and set himself up as the champion of the disinherited. After negotiations involving both Edward and Ottobuono, Gloucester relented, and by June a settlement was reached. Gloucester had forced a change to the conditions of the Dictum, whereby the disinherited were allowed to recover their lands before they had paid their fines rather than after; an arrangement that made repayment much <b>easier.</b> <b>In</b> the summer of that year, Prince Edward moved at the Isle of Ely, where the last of the rebels still held out, and forced them into submission under terms favourable to the rebels.|$|E

25|$|ALGOL 68 {{has been}} criticized, most {{prominently}} by {{some members of}} its design committee such as C. A. R.

25|$|As with 100% {{biodiesel}} (B100), {{to ensure}} the fuel injectors atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, vegetable oil fuel must be heated to reduce its viscosity to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers.

MAN B Diesel, Wärtsilä, and Deutz AG, {{as well as a}} number of smaller companies, such as Elsbett, offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.|$|E

25|$|According to some authorities, {{increasing}} {{evidence suggests that}} early skin-to-skin contact (also called kangaroo care) between mother and baby stimulates breastfeeding behavior in the baby. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother’s skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth. Immediate skin-to-skin contact may provide a form of imprinting that makes subsequent feeding significantly <b>easier.</b> <b>In</b> addition to more successful breastfeeding and bonding, immediate skin-to-skin contact reduces crying and warms the baby.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} major American {{cities in the}} postwar era, {{construction}} of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car <b>easier.</b> <b>In</b> 1956, Detroit's last heavily used electric streetcar line {{along the length of}} Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.|$|E

However, Aliadière soon equalised with his first Boro goal, and the first home league goal United had conceded that season. A Downing error gifted Manchester United their second, and Tevez added two more goals in the second half. The 1–4 defeat meant Middlesbrough had then conceded sixteen goals in six league games, while scoring only four.|$|E
