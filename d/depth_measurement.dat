40|$|Active depth cameras {{suffer from}} several limitations, which cause {{incomplete}} and noisy depth maps, and may consequently affect {{the performance of}} RGB-D Odometry. To address this issue, this paper presents a visual odometry method based on point and line features that leverages both <b>measurements</b> from a <b>depth</b> sensor and depth estimates from camera motion. Depth estimates are generated continuously by a probabilistic depth estimation framework for both types of features {{to compensate for the}} lack of <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> and inaccurate feature depth associations. The framework models explicitly the uncertainty of triangulating depth from both point and line observations to validate and obtain precise estimates. Furthermore, <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> are exploited by propagating them through a depth map registration module and using a frame-to-frame motion estimation method that considers 3 D-to- 2 D and 2 D-to- 3 D reprojection errors, independently. Results on RGB-D sequences captured on large indoor and outdoor scenes, where depth sensor limitations are critical, show that the combination of <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> and estimates through our approach is able to overcome the absence and inaccuracy of <b>depth</b> <b>measurements.</b> Comment: IROS 201...|$|R
500|$|The {{existing}} network of seismographs to monitor tectonic earthquakes has existed since 1975, although it remained small in population until 1985. Apart {{from a few}} short-term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada, no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at the Silverthrone Caldera or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes. Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately , and frequently within , for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors, particularly for earthquake depth. Such monitoring detects the risk of an eruption, offering a forecasting capability which is important to mitigating volcanic risk. Currently the Silverthrone Caldera {{does not have a}} seismograph closer than [...] With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity, the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location and <b>depth</b> <b>measurement</b> accuracy decreases. The inaccurate earthquake locations in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt are a few kilometers, and in more isolated northern regions they are up to [...] The location magnitude level in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is about magnitude 1 to 1.5, and elsewhere it is magnitude 1.5 to 2. At [...] "carefully monitored volcanoes both the located and noticed events are recorded and surveyed immediately to improve the understanding of a future eruption. Undetected events are not recorded or surveyed in British Columbia immediately, nor in an easy-to-access process.|$|E
2500|$|About {{this time}} the {{invention}} of the Whitehead torpedo posed a control problem which required accurate control of the running depth. Use of a depth pressure sensor alone proved inadequate, and a pendulum which measured the fore and aft pitch of the torpedo was combined with <b>depth</b> <b>measurement</b> to become the pendulum-and-hydrostat control. Pressure control only provided a proportional control, which if the control gain was too high, would become unstable and go into overshoot, with considerable instability of depth-holding. The pendulum added what is now known as derivative control, which damped the oscillations by detecting the torpedo dive/climb angle and thereby the rate of change of depth. This development (named by Whitehead as [...] "The Secret" [...] to give no clue to its action) was around 1868.|$|E
2500|$|To {{determine}} {{mass balance}} in the accumulation zone, snowpack depth is measured using probing, snowpits or crevasse stratigraphy. Crevasse stratigraphy makes use of annual layers revealed {{on the wall of}} a crevasse. Akin to tree rings, these layers are due to summer dust deposition and other seasonal effects. The advantage of crevasse stratigraphy is that it provides a two-dimensional measurement of the snowpack layer, not a point measurement. [...] It is also usable in depths where probing or snowpits are not feasible. In temperate glaciers, the insertion resistance of a probe increases abruptly when its tip reaches ice that was formed the previous year. The probe depth {{is a measure of the}} net accumulation above that layer. Snowpits dug through the past winters residual snowpack are used to determine the snowpack depth and density. [...] The snowpack's mass balance is the product of density and depth. Regardless of <b>depth</b> <b>measurement</b> technique the observed depth is multiplied by the snowpack density to determine the accumulation in water equivalent. It is necessary to measure the density in the spring as snowpack density varies. [...] Measurement of snowpack density completed at the end of the ablation season yield consistent values for a particular area on temperate alpine glaciers and need not be measured every year. In the ablation zone, ablation measurements are made using stakes inserted vertically into the glacier either at the end of the previous melt season or the beginning of the current one. The length of stake exposed by melting ice is measured at the end of the melt (ablation) season. Most stakes must be replaced each year or even midway through the summer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} an {{adaptive}} data fusion model that robustly integrates depth and image only perception. Combining dense <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> with images can greatly enhance {{the performance of}} many computer vision algorithms, yet degraded <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> (e. g., missing data) can also cause dramatic performance losses to levels below image-only algorithms. We propose a generic fusion model based on maximum likelihood estimates of fused image-depth functions for both available and missing depth data. We demonstrate its application to each step of a state-of-the-art image-only object instance recognition pipeline. The resulting approach shows increased recognition performance over alternative data fusion approaches. Despite its tremendous potential, dense depth estimation has fundamental limitations {{that must be addressed}} for robust performance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Orthognathic surgery {{leads to}} {{alteration}} of the spatial {{relationship of the}} mandible and maxilla resulting changes {{in the degree of}} facial projection. Traditional 2 -dimensional cephalometry and photographic techniques do not provide data on facial depth. Though stereophotogrammetry {{can be used as a}} noninvasive method for evaluating facial depth, the unavailability of ethnicity-specific norms hinder its routine use in clinical practice. The objectives of this study were to (a) generate an analytic scheme suitable for evaluating facial depth using stereophotogrammetry and (b) create normative data for the facial <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> for young Hong Kong Chinese adults. METHODS: Stereophotographic images from 41 male and 45 female ethnic Chinese young adults without facial deformities were analyzed. Facial <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> were performed based on standard anthropometric landmarks, with the aid of 3 dMDVultus software. RESULTS: All facial <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> were found in absolute terms to be significantly higher in males. In contrast, the upper face, maxillary, and sublabial depth indices were significantly higher in females, whereas no significant gender differences emerged for lower facial and maxillomandibular indices. CONCLUSIONS: A novel method of using stereophotographic images for quantifying facial depth was evaluated. Normative facial <b>depth</b> <b>measurements</b> for young Hong Kong Chinese adults were established. This gender-specific database can be used as a reference in the diagnosis, treatment planning, or evaluation of outcomes after surgical correction of facial deformities...|$|R

So, {{there is a need}} of adequate information about spatio-temporal behavior of water table depths over a region.
