5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for <b>its</b> <b>clear,</b> witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{uploaded}} to The Movies Online, Lionhead's website for user-created videos, on 22 November 2005 {{and was soon}} covered by American and French press. Although real-time-rendered, three-dimensional computer animation (machinima) {{had been used in}} earlier political films, The French Democracy attained an unprecedented level of mainstream attention for political machinima. While acknowledging the film's flaws, such as the grammatically poor English subtitles, commentators praised <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> political message and compared it to films such as La Haine and Do the Right Thing. The French Democracy inspired other politically conscious machinima works and fueled discussion about the art form's potential for political expression. Some raised concerns that video game companies would use their copyrights to control the content of derivative machinima films.|$|E

25|$|After <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> popularity, Swann then appealed via {{his video}} diary for fan-based {{versions}} of the dance, resulting in thousands of clips being posted on the web. As well as versions from England's travelling fans, the Barmy Army, there were postings from vicars, choirboys, schoolchildren, office workers, and various British personalities, including footballer and pundit Robbie Savage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Its</b> <b>clear,</b> almost {{conversational}} prose, {{devoid of}} jargon and overly specialized terminology, makes it especially suitable for undergraduates {{as well as}} the general public. The widely published Hartmann is eminently qualified to write such a work. He has both impeccable scholarly credentials and much experience making history accessible to a mass audience as an advisor for German films and television programs.|$|E
25|$|Sébastien, popular melody or voix populi to a loud, {{so it has}} a tenor tessitura phonic. The tessitura of {{this voice}} type will be typical of a common tenor, albeit with a lighter tone sans operatic training. Sébastien's voice is {{distinguished}} by <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> and bright timbre, the pectoral resonance and firmness in voice projection. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G2 up to B4.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson Davis {{was elected}} {{provisional}} president. His U.S. Senate resignation speech greatly impressed with <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> rationale for secession and his pleading {{for a peaceful}} departure from the Union to independence. Although he had made it known {{that he wanted to}} be commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies, when elected, he assumed the office of Provisional President. Three candidates for provisional Vice President were under consideration the night before the February 9 election. All were from Georgia, and the various delegations meeting in different places determined two would not do, so Alexander H. Stephens was elected unanimously provisional Vice President, though with some privately held reservations. Stephens was inaugurated February 11, Davis February 18.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge with}} the most slender arch was the Pont-Saint-Martin in the Alpine Aosta Valley. A {{favourable}} ratio of arch rib thickness to span {{is regarded as the}} single most important parameter in the design of stone arches. The arch rib of the Pont-Saint-Martin is only 1.03m thick what translates to a ratio of 1/34 respectively 1/30 depending on whether one assumes 35.64m or 31.4m to be the value for <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> span. A statistical analysis of extant Roman bridges shows that ancient bridge builders preferred a ratio for rib thickness to span of 1/10 for smaller bridges, while they reduced this to as low as 1/20 for larger spans in order to relieve the arch from its own weight.|$|E
25|$|A {{few yards}} away from the Ordnance Survey's {{triangulation}} point on the Graig stands Lisvane's only Cold War nuclear bunker. During World War II the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) observation post stood on the Graig with <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> views over the village {{and the city of}} Cardiff. The volunteer ROC observers spotted many German Luftwaffe raids approaching across the channel and activated the air raid warnings in the Cardiff area. In early 1966 a protected nuclear fallout shelter (or bunker) was completed on the site for the ROC (OS Grid Ref: ST 1898 8508), who by the 1960s had switched from above ground aircraft spotting to underground operations with instruments to detect nuclear explosions and warn the public of approaching radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear war.|$|E
5000|$|The Committee {{concluded}} that clearing house associations (associations {{created for the}} clearing of checks to and from individual banks) based in New York were gaining power at the public's expense. This was done via minimum capital requirements as well as predatory membership and discriminatory member policies. The report states, [...] "Non-member banks must engage a member bank as <b>its</b> <b>clearing</b> agent, which in effect leaves its future up to the discretion a single bank." [...] This clause allowed member banks and the boards of these clearing houses to stifle any competition that might arise from smaller upstart banks by simply telling their member banks not to act as their clearing agents. In fact, the Panic of 1907 started with {{the closing of the}} Knickerbocker Trust Co., when <b>its</b> member <b>clearing</b> bank (the National Bank of Commerce of New York) refused to act as <b>its</b> <b>clearing</b> agent anymore.|$|R

25|$|Although animal cruelty laws {{exist in}} Russia, dog {{fighting}} is widely practiced. Laws prohibiting dogfights {{have been passed}} in certain places like Moscow by order of that city's mayor. In much of Russia dogfights are legally held generally using Caucasian Shepherd Dog, Georgian shepherd, Central Asian Shepherd Dog. Temperament tests, which are a common and relatively mild form of dog fighting used for breeding purposes, are fairly commonplace. Most dog fights are traditional contests {{used to test the}} stamina and ability of working dogs used to protect livestock. Unlike fights with pit bulls and other fighting breeds, a veterinarian is always on hand and the contests are never to the death, and serious injuries are very rare. Most fights are over in minutes when <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> which dog is superior. At the end of three rounds the contest is declared a draw.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{was reading}} the poetry of William Wordsworth while she wrote Maurice. Tomalin has argued that [...] "Wordsworth does seem to preside over Maurice, with <b>its</b> <b>clear,</b> {{straightforward}} language, and its setting among simple people and poor labourers, and against elemental backgrounds of rocks and trees, cliffs and seashore".|$|E
500|$|In 1930, the Nassak Diamond had a {{somewhat}} elongated triangle form with rounded corners. The depth of {{one side of}} the triangle was thicker than the other. The diamond was [...] "without flaw, unusually brilliant, and so cut as to well display <b>its</b> <b>clear,</b> crystal brilliancy." [...] While on exhibit at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois, the [...] "Official guide book of the fair, 1933" [...] described the diamond as a flawless, blue- ...|$|E

500|$|Boito was doubly {{pleased with}} The Merry Wives as a plot. Not {{only was it}} Shakespearian, it was {{based in part on}} Trecento Italian works – Il Pecorone by Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, and Boccaccio's Decameron. Boito adopted a {{deliberately}} archaic form of Italian to [...] "lead Shakespeare's farce back to <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> Tuscan source", as he put it. He trimmed the plot, halved the number of characters in the play, and gave the character of Falstaff more depth by incorporating dozens of passages from Henry IV.|$|E
500|$|The three {{objects on}} the bedside cabinet {{represent}} the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light. [...] The light passing through {{the glass of the}} womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light, <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception, a device also found in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling [...] "lays one translucent symbolic form upon another".|$|E
500|$|Dutch {{scholar of}} Indonesian {{literature}} A. Teeuw writes that this collection is united by {{a theme of}} longing, which Jassin expands on: Amir is longing for his mother, longing for his loves, and longing for his homeland. All {{are referred to as}} [...] "kekasih" [...] (beloved) in turn. These longings, Teeuw writes, are unlike the religious overtones of Nyanyi Sunyi: they are more worldly, grounded in reality; Jassin notes another thematic distinction between the two: unlike Nyanyi Sunyi, with <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> depiction of one god, Buah Rindu explicitly puts forth several deities, including the Hindu gods Shiva and Parvati and abstract ones like the god and goddess of love.|$|E
50|$|Although no {{pertinent}} {{flight deck}} conversation was recovered from Flight 268's {{cockpit voice recorder}} by investigators with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), which assisted with the investigation, data recovered from the flight data recorder by the TSB showed that the aircraft initiated each step of its descent one step too early. At 16 DME the aircraft was a full 1,000 feet below <b>its</b> <b>cleared</b> altitude; at 10 DME (the Sierra reporting point) it was 1,300 feet below <b>its</b> <b>cleared</b> altitude. The aircraft approached the Mahabharat Range at an insufficient altitude and crashed into the south slope. Although the pilots of Flight 268 reported their aircraft's altitude accurately to air traffic control, controllers did nothing to alert them of their inappropriate altitude until seconds before the accident.|$|R
5000|$|Seeing a {{more serious}} side, Carl Van Doren wrote that Kennaston's story allegorically {{represented}} the human race's tendency to [...] "create better regions to dream in" [...] Likewise Hugh Walpole regarded the story as less interesting than Cabell's theme of longing for dreams, given <b>its</b> <b>clearest</b> expression (as of 1920) in this book.|$|R
60|$|Man is like God; and {{therefore}} God, in some inconceivable way, is like man. That {{is the great}} truth {{set forth in the}} first chapter of Genesis, which goes on unfolding itself more clearly throughout the Old Testament, till here, in Ezekiel's vision, it comes to, perhaps, <b>its</b> <b>clearest</b> stage save one.|$|R
500|$|Sappho's {{poetry is}} known for <b>its</b> <b>clear</b> {{language}} and simple thoughts, sharply-drawn images, and use of direct quotation which brings a sense of immediacy. [...] Unexpected word-play is a characteristic feature of her style. [...] An example is from fragment 96: [...] "now she stands out among Lydian women as after sunset the rose-fingered moon exceeds all stars", {{a variation of the}} Homeric epithet [...] "rosy-fingered Dawn". [...] Sappho's poetry often uses hyperbole, according to ancient critics [...] "because of its charm". An example is found in fragment 111, where Sappho writes that [...] "The groom approaches like Ares Much bigger than a big man".|$|E
500|$|Teeuw {{writes that}} this {{collection}} is united by {{a theme of}} longing, which Jassin expands on: longing for his mother, longing for his lovers (both the one in Sumatra and the one in Java), and longing for his homeland. All {{are referred to as}} [...] "kekasih" [...] (beloved) in turn. These longings, Teeuw writes, are unlike the religious overtones of Nyanyi Sunyi, being more worldly and grounded in reality.

500|$|Picken's Hole at the {{southern}} end of Crook Peak is considered to be of importance because of <b>its</b> <b>clear,</b> well-stratified sequence of deposits and faunas, all dating from within the Devensian. The cave is [...] below the plateau and [...] above the valley floor. It is named after M.J. Picken who found teeth in earth thrown out of their sets in the area by badgers. A large number of Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, and two Neanderthal teeth dated to about 55,000 years BP, have been recovered from the cave. Faunal deposits of spotted hyena, lion, Arctic fox, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, suslik and northern vole (Microtus oeconomus) from approximately 35,000 BP have also been recovered.|$|E

Black scales are scattered over the wings, which are otherwise striated with five postmedial lines.|$|R
