5|$|The other {{theory to}} gain support {{was that it}} was viral {{marketing}} to promote an upcoming movie or video game. A Redditor noted that the film version of Dan Brown's novel Inferno was beginning production at that time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> 2016 release. In the story, a rich villain makes a video warning of his plans to release a virus in order to reduce population growth.

Karthi's second film Aayirathil Oruvan, which was in production for nearly three years, was also planned to release on the same day. According to the Tamil Film Producers Council, two films starring the same actor could not be released on the same day, so Aayirathil Oruvan was given priority, whilst Paiyaa was postponed for 30 days. The release was postponed again for some reasons, before finally hitting the screens on 2 April 2010. The film had its premiere at the Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai.|$|E
5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding {{up the rest of the}} field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A glass bottle appeared on the outside of the track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow racing to continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Prost formed a fierce rivalry mainly with Ayrton Senna, but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. In 1986, {{at the last}} race of the season, he beat Mansell and Piquet of Williams to the title after Mansell retired late on in the race, and Piquet was pulled in <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> precautionary pit stop. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two {{had a series of}} {{controversial}} clashes, including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers' Championship. A year later at the same venue they collided again, but this time Prost, driving for Ferrari, lost out. Before the end of a winless 1991 season Prost was fired by Ferrari for his public criticism of the team. After a sabbatical in 1992, Prost joined the Williams team, prompting reigning Drivers' Champion Mansell to leave for CART. With a competitive car, Prost won the 1993 championship and retired from Formula One driving {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 32-yard line, Davis {{threw an}} {{incomplete}} pass then connected on a 21-yard pass to Jarvis {{for a first}} down. After an incomplete pass, Davis threw another pass to Jarvis, who caught it at the four-yard line. Facing third down, Davis attempted another pass. The ball was tipped {{into the air and}} caught by Virginia Tech defender Brent Warren. The Hokies resumed running down the clock with short rushes by Evans, who advanced the ball to the 13-yard line with 3:05 remaining in the game. Boston College used its allotted second-half timeouts to stop the clock and preserve time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> scoring drive. In a strategic move, Tech coach Frank Beamer ordered an intentional safety rather than attempt a punt from the Tech end zone. Any such kick {{has the potential to be}} blocked for a defensive touchdown. Thus, an intentional safety gives the defense two points while denying them the slight chance to score seven. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 30–12 with 3:05 remaining, but the limited time remaining meant Tech's lead would be sufficient to win the game without a series of unlikely events.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jan, {{now living}} with Michael, forces costly changes in Michael's life. This causes Michael {{to worry about}} his {{financial}} situation.

He hops a train to run away, but Jan meets him and tells him that they can work together to find a way to live. Meanwhile, Dwight pines over Angela, who is later asked out by Andy. After a pep-talk by Jim, Dwight returns as his normal annoying self, to Jim's pleasure. Pam and Jim visit Dwight's family farm, which he has fashioned into a bed and breakfast.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{used their}} {{third and final}} {{substitute}} in the 75thminute, replacing Giggs with Paul Scholes, who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and Scholes each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80thminutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona right back shepherded the ball out for a goal kick, while Scholes was booked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players went for the follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first to the ball and sent Puyol sprawling.|$|E

She later hands him divorce papers and confronts Sarah.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland offense had {{difficulty}} converting third downs, and managed only four on 13attempts, while their defense allowed 226passing yards and 201rushing yards. Late {{in the first}} quarter, Virginia quarterback Marc Verica completed a pass to receiver Kevin Ogletree for a 51-yard touchdown, the Cavs' first passing score of the season. Virginia was able to score twice more before half, to put the Terrapins into a 21–0 deficit. With {{seconds left in the}} second quarter, in a desperate gambit to recoup some points, quarterback Chris Turner attempted a hook and ladder play with a pass to Isaiah Williams who then lateraled to Darrius Heyward-Bey, who in turn lateraled to Da'Rel Scott. The maneuver picked up 45yards before Scott was shoved out of bounds, and a flag was thrown <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> hit by Virginia. Since a half cannot end on a defensive penalty, time would {{have been added to the}} clock, but it was ruled that the foul occurred after time had expired. Therefore, the penalty was assessed after the kick-off, and the Terrapins' trick play was for naught.|$|E

Five minutes later, Anderlecht came close to extending their lead, but Benny Nielsen's shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence. Liverpool started to exert themselves upon the match following this and equalised in the 27th minute when midfielder Jimmy Case scored {{from the edge of the}} Anderlecht penalty area. Five minutes before half-time Anderlecht extended their lead. Defender François Van der Elst found space in the Liverpool defence and his shot beat Clemence in the Liverpool goal to give Anderlecht a 2–1 lead. Anderlecht defender Jean Thissen was shown a yellow card before the end of the half <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> tackle on Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the film}} had its debut on June 15, the American Film Institute {{states that the}} film was {{released}} in October. This conflicts with a claim from the Paris Theater in Denver, Colorado, found in the September 29 issue of Motography, where the film {{was said to be}} popular. The Paris Theater would also run into legal troubles over the films showing, a fact reported in the October 6 edition of Motography. Newspaper accounts <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> October run begin in the San Francisco Chronicle with the Portola Theater debuting the film, originally for one week, starting on October 28, 1917. The film was popular enough to run a second week at the Portola. The film would be part of the vaudeville show at the Wigwam for four days starting on November 14. The film was suggested for mature audiences by the Portola Theater and the Wigwam Theater, both did not allow {{children under the age of}} 16 to enter.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season started {{much as the}} {{previous}} one had ended, with Blackburn taking until 17 September to win a match, a 4–3 victory at home to Arsenal. On 20 November, Robinson won a penalty against Wigan; the goalkeeper had gone up to the Wigan box <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>late</b> corner, and was kicked in the face by Wigan midfielder David Jones. The penalty was scored by Yakubu to level the score at 3–3. In a repeat of {{the previous}} season, Robinson conceded seven goals as Blackburn lost an away match 7–1, this time to Arsenal, on 4 February 2012. A run of 30 matches without a clean sheet was finally ended in a 2–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, a match which also took Blackburn out of the relegation zone, whilst another 2–0 win, this time against Sunderland, was the first time Robinson had kept back-to-back clean sheets since August 2010. Blackburn, however, would only score three points more all season and were relegated to the Championship after finishing in 19th position. In contrast to the two previous seasons where Robinson had averaged ten league clean sheets a season, he kept just three clean sheets in the league, having played 34 matches. All three clean sheets came from matches where Blackburn won 2–0. Following the departures of Christopher Samba and Ryan Nelsen from Ewood Park, Robinson became the Blackburn captain, initially on a temporary basis but later as the permanent captain.|$|E
