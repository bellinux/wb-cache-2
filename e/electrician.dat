40|$|Abstract Background The healthy worker effect (HWE) is a {{well-known}} phenomenon. In this study we used the extensive registration of all Danish citizens to describe the magnitude of HWE among all Danish <b>electricians</b> and evaluated strategies for minimizing HWE bias of the association between occupation and mortality. Methods All Danish male citizens aged 26 - 56 years in the period 1984 - 1992 were followed for three years in several registers. We evaluated HWE bias among <b>electricians</b> because they were unexposed to detrimental occupational exposures. We compared <b>electricians</b> to three reference groups (general population, construction industry and carpenters/brick layers) and utilized analytical methods for minimizing HWE bias (lag time analyses, age-stratified analyses, marginal structural model and restriction to employed, newly employed or long-term workers). Results The mortality rate was higher among <b>electricians,</b> who the year following active employment received incapacity benefits or were on long-term sick leave. <b>Electricians</b> receiving incapacity benefits, on long-term sick leave, unemployed, or with increased comorbidity index had lower odds of re-employment. <b>Electricians</b> had lower mortality rate (rate ratio, 0. 60; 95 %CI, 0. 52 - 0. 69) compared {{to the general population}}, while <b>electricians</b> leaving employment had increased mortality (1. 90; 1. 50 - 2. 40). Adjusting for several social events slightly attenuated the estimates, while the marginal structural model did not minimize bias. <b>Electricians</b> had the same mortality as the construction industry and carpenters/brick layers. Mortality was comparable to the general population after three or more years of lag time. Conclusions In this nationwide study, employment as <b>electricians</b> had marked effect on mortality. Appropriate reference selection and lag time analyses minimized the HWE bias. </p...|$|R
