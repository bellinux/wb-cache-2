50|$|For 1990, Ford {{introduced}} an <b>electronically-controlled</b> four-wheel drive system {{as an option}} for the Aerostar. Called E-4WD (Electronic 4-Wheel Drive), the system was specifically an all-wheel drive system. Using a Dana TC28 transfer case with a center differential (regulated by an electronically controlled electro-magnetic clutch), all four wheels were given traction at all times. The system shifted traction to the front wheels as it detected rear wheel spin, with no driver input required. As E-4WD was not intended for off-road driving, the Aerostar was not provided with specific low-range gearing.|$|E
50|$|Current PLS A1 {{variants}} are {{powered by}} a Caterpillar C-15 four-stroke diesel developing 600 hp, this coupled to an Allison 4500SP six-speed automatic transmission, and Oshkosh 36000 Series two-speed transfer case. The original PLS was {{powered by a}} Detroit Diesel 8V92TA V-8 two-stroke diesel developing 500 hp, with later production examples having the <b>electronically-controlled</b> DDECIV version of this engine. Original PLS were fitted with an Allison CLT-755 ATEC 5F/1R automatic transmission and Oshkosh 55000 two-speed transfer box. After October 2005, an Allison HD-4500 Generation 4 six-speed automatic transmission was fitted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{availability}} of microprocessors after about 1974 made another range of automotive applications economically feasible. In 1978 the Cadillac Seville introduced a [...] "trip computer" [...] {{based on a}} 6802 microprocessor. <b>Electronically-controlled</b> ignition and fuel injection systems allowed automotive designers to achieve vehicles meeting requirements for fuel economy and lower emissions, while still maintaining high levels of performance and convenience for drivers. Today's automobiles contain {{a dozen or more}} processors, in functions such as engine management, transmission control, climate control,antilock braking, passive safety systems, navigation, and other functions.|$|E
50|$|The Caterpillar C27 is an V12 diesel {{internal}} combustion engine made by Caterpillar. The engine is 27 liters in displacement (1648 cubic inches). The cylinder size is 5.39 x 6.06 bore/stroke. The engine can produce 500-1000 horsepower at 2100 RPM. The peak torque occurs at an engine speed of 1400 RPM.This engine began production as Caterpillar 3412. As emissions control was tightened, engine management and combustion chamber is redesigned therefore two different engines emerged: Then mechanically-controlled C27 and <b>electronically-controlled</b> C30. Caterpillar C30 block has been scaled up and C32 emerged. C27 also began to be produced with electronic engine control and management after 2007.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, the LFB {{announced}} {{they would be}} replacing the older-generation (currently used) Mercedes-Benz Atego pump appliances with brand new Mercedes-Benz Ategos which include new features such as: an improved 'crew cab' for the comfort and safety of firefighters, new high-pressure hoses which can deliver twice as much water as previous models, a brand new <b>electronically-controlled</b> pump, and a more economical and environment-friendly EURO VI engine, which will be compatible with London's low-emission zones. In 2017, 52 initial appliance orders are being rolled out across London ready for operational use, replacing the older 2002-2004 pumps, and later replacing the newer 2006-2008 pumps. The primary reason for {{the replacement of the}} older Ategos was due to their age (some being 15 years old) and poor economy.|$|E
50|$|Showcased in the {{redesign}} was the Modular V8. First {{introduced in the}} 1991 Lincoln Town Car, the 4.6L SOHC V8 was the replacement for the 5.0L (302 CID) Windsor V8 and the first engine {{of a family of}} overhead-cam engines that would be introduced in a number of Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars and trucks. Lighter than its predecessor, the 4.6L V8 produced nearly identical torque output while producing 40 additional horsepower in its standard single-exhaust configuration. As with its predecessor and the Lincoln Town Car, the 4.6L V8 was paired with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission. In 1993, the Ford AOD transmission was replaced by the <b>electronically-controlled</b> AOD-E version. For 1995, the AOD-E was replaced by the 4R70W, a heavier-duty version introduced in the Lincoln Mark VIII.|$|E
50|$|The {{drivetrain}} {{was available}} {{with a large}} number of engines (both turbocharged and non-turbocharged pre-Duratorq), sourced from Peugeot on early models, but engines from 1998 were mostly sourced from Ford, such as the York 'banana' engines which were described as 'dated', 'noisy' and 'ponderously slow' but 'dependable'. The Peugeot engines were praised as 'economical', often seen as more so than many of the Ford units. All engines were catalysed and were fitted with a drive-by-wire throttle setup, and ventilated front disc brakes were available as an optional extra, as was adjustable air suspension on long-wheelbase diesel models. The Ford Duratorq <b>electronically-controlled</b> direct-injection diesel engine appearing in 2001 (sourced from the Ford Transit) was fitted with a non-optional turbocharger, this was available with an optional intercooler, increasing the peak power output from 75PS to 90PS.|$|E
5000|$|Subaru {{chose to}} use an {{aluminum}} alloy horizontally-opposed [...] "boxer" [...] engine to minimize powertrain weight and lower {{the center of gravity}} so as to reduce body roll. The weight of the engine and automatic transmission are laterally balanced instead of being offset from left to right. The power delivery is also direct from the transmission to the front wheels, and distributed to the rear axle via a [...] "Variable Torque Distribution" [...] system which uses a central planetary differential gear with a <b>electronically-controlled</b> hydraulic clutch, with torque split 45% to the front axle and 55% to the rear axle under normal driving conditions. The rear wheels are driven through a rear differential, which is limited slip on some models. The front differential is integrated into the Subaru transmission.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, 3M {{introduced}} the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits {{could not be}} accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing & mix down recorder was also created with an <b>electronically-controlled</b> edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital [...] "word". Unfortunately, the only converters of the day were 12 bit & 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit [...] "word" [...] for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50 kHz). It {{was known to be}} the best sounding of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50 kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1 kHz for CD's & 48 kHz for digital video.|$|E
50|$|Wiremod is a user-created mod that {{significantly}} expands the sandbox {{capabilities of the}} game by adding {{a large number of}} pseudo-electronic components such as microcontrollers, logic gates, buttons, radios, gyroscopes, screens, GPS modules, sensors, laser rangefinders, speed sensors and much more. Wiring these components together allows the player to create a very large variety of <b>electronically-controlled</b> machines. It also features Expression2 (E2) general-purpose controllers, which allow the player to program the chip with a high-level programming language to compute inputs and outputs to control a wide swathe of elements. CPU modules, which use a Low-level programming language, allow similar capabilities, as well as the capability to render graphics on a digital screen, to be able to fully simulate a virtual computer. The use of Wiremod allows the creation of very complex contraptions, and everything from virtual computers to missiles, aircraft, spaceships and space probes, robots and drones; all constructed from components available in-game without the use of modded entities.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} remain in {{compliance}} with increasingly stringent federal fuel economy standards (under CAFE, Ford Motor Company was required to average 20.0 MPG {{for all of its}} vehicles for 1980), significant changes were made to the powertrain for the Continental Mark VI. The 460 and 400 cubic-inch V8s seen in the Mark V (and the Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Continental) were replaced in favor of much smaller V8 engines. The standard engine for the Mark VI was a 129-hp 302 cubic-inch V8. Essentially the Windsor V8 shared with the Versailles, the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis, and the Ford full-size trucks, the engine was the first V8 sold by Ford with fuel injection; to denote the engine, it was marketed by its 5.0L metric displacement (slightly rounded up from the correct 4.9L figure). As an option, a 140-hp 351 Windsor (5.8L) V8 was available; it was sold with an <b>electronically-controlled</b> variable-venturi 2-barrel carburetor. After 1980, the 351 was discontinued on the Mark VI, due to poor sales and the lack of a distinct power advantage over the 5.0L V8.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2017, {{the company}} {{revealed}} its new flagship bike, the Dogma F10. Unlike {{in previous years}} where Pinarello have timed their new product reveals with the Giro d'Italia, the F10 was revealed {{before the start of}} the 2017 season. The [...] team-bikes will be equipped with Shimanos newest 9150 Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, whilst Pinarello claim the F10 is 6.3% lighter and 7% stiffer than its predecessor (still composed of Torayca T1100 1K carbon), whilst a 53 cm unpainted frame has a claimed weight of only 820g. The F10 also has a 12.6% claimed aerodynamic advantage over the F8, coming in part from the 'concave' back shaped aerofoils (also found on the second version of the Bolide time trial bike). The F10 also has a number of aerodynamic devices which have been taken from other models, the aforementioned Bolide, as well as Bradley Wiggins' hour record bike. Only hours after its release, Taiwanese bike manufacturer - Velocite - claimed that new F10 and the second version of the Bolide infringe three of its patents. The F10 will also be available to the public immediately. During the 2017 Giro d'Italia a number of [...] riders tested the Dogma F10 X-Light - a lightweight version of the F10 - in readiness for the 2017 Tour de France. Pinarello claim an unpainted X-Light weighs in at 760g for a 53 cm sized frame. In mid-July the company announced the Dogma F10 Disc would be produced for sale. A day later the company revealed the Dogma K10, taking aerodynamic and visual cues from the F10 forebearer and the <b>electronically-controlled</b> suspension variant, the Dogma K10S Disk.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the next {{generation}} of imaging spectrometers will need greater capabilities and more flexibility than the High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (HIRIS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), which were designed for the first Earth Observation System platform. The emerging technology that represents a major advance in the scientific utility of imaging spectrometry is the acoustooptic tunable filters, (AOTFs). AOTFs are compact robust solid-state crystals which provide rapid (millisecond) <b>electronically-controlled</b> spectral tunability. This paper discusses the evolving requirements of imaging spectrometers and examines the basic system parameters of the HIRIS and the MODIS concepts involving the use of AOTFs, which will satisfy these requirements...|$|E
