5|$|Fans were <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> {{winning the}} Central League, and {{repeated}} the celebratory leap into Dōtonbori Canal. However, {{instead of the}} individual leapers representing the players, over 5,300 fans plunged into the canal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of release in Denmark in 1886, critics from the daily {{newspapers}} were generally <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> Ved Vejen. It is now considered {{an important contribution to}} Danish literature, listed in the Danish Culture Canon. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{was not as}} <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> a {{customs union}} as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff {{reciprocity}} provisions were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff that reduced duties on some inter-American trade. Otherwise, the conference achieved none of Blaine’s goals in the short-term, but did lead to further communication and what would eventually become the Organization of American States.|$|E

5|$|Greek {{officials}} and the public were <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared {{by many of the}} athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, Bradbury {{received}} {{orders from}} Parsons, {{who was now}} the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Parsons explained that he needed Bradbury {{to work on the}} explosive lenses required by an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Bradbury was less than <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the prospect, but he was a naval officer, and ultimately agreed to go.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E

5000|$|Andrew Motion, former Poet Laureate of Great Britain, {{published}} an <b>enthusiastic</b> essay <b>about</b> the film which concluded: [...] "film is revelatory - in the paradoxical {{sense that it}} allows Dylan to say some important things out loud, {{and to keep the}} silences, and retain the elements of mystery, which are essential to his genius. We should ask for nothing else." ...|$|R
5|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, {{judgmental}} young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> {{being in}} LA {{and even less}} so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but {{good sense of humor}} made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister: Although Jackson and Walsh envisioned The Frighteners as a low-budget {{film with}} unknown actors, Zemeckis {{suggested}} casting his Back to the Future star Fox {{in the lead}} role. Fox became <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> working with Jackson when he saw Heavenly Creatures at the Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Several critics however, {{were more}} <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the film. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave Hoodwinked! an A- and praised the zaniness of its humor. Calling the filmmakers heroes, he {{compared}} them to Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh {{due to their}} potential for bringing independent filmmaking to prominence in animation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tragedy is}} {{investigated}} by the detective German Ermakov. In his hotel room Ermakov meets with journalist Igor Malinin, one of the passengers of the ill-fated train. The subject of their conversation, of course, becomes the wreck. Malinin writes an <b>enthusiastic</b> article <b>about</b> the heroism of the driver Timonin but Ermakov, who compiles more and more information, understands that it's not so simple as it seems ...|$|R
5|$|Since Darwin was <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the idea, Wallace {{asked the}} Entomological Society of London {{to test the}} hypothesis. In response, the {{entomologist}} John Jenner Weir conducted experiments with caterpillars and birds in his aviary, and in 1869 he provided the first experimental evidence for warning coloration in animals.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Voss {{returned}} from leave, {{he was at}} odds with his squadron commander. He was detailed from his squadron to evaluate new fighter aircraft and became <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the Fokker Triplane. After transferring through three temporary squadron commands in two months, Voss was given command of Jagdstaffel 10 on 30 July 1917 at Richthofen's request. By now, his victory total was 34.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subsequent}} tour, Iron Maiden {{started working on}} their next studio effort, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band's previous records. Although it became their second release to top the UK charts, it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US. Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson was much more <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits. After the following tour in 1988, the band {{decided to take a}} year off.|$|E
60|$|Oh, you know, Ronny's very encouraging. He says I'm {{really getting}} on. I want so badly {{to be able}} to talk. You can't think how <b>enthusiastic</b> I am <b>about</b> Egypt. I love it.|$|R
30|$|Despite the <b>enthusiastic</b> rhetoric <b>about</b> {{the ways}} in which new {{technologies}} have burst the interest in debating political or social relevant issues [14]-[19], the role of the socio-technical system in enforcing informed debates still remains unclear. Indeed, the emergence of knowledge from this process has been dubbed collective intelligence or even more rhetorically wisdom of crowds[20]-[23], although we have become increasingly aware of the presence of unsubstantiated or untruthful rumors.|$|R
5000|$|Although the Fire Fly {{had yet to}} be used operationally, the Air Force was <b>enthusiastic</b> enough <b>about</b> {{the concept}} to issue {{contracts}} for follow-on variants. The USAF ordered nine [...] "Model 147Bs", including two prototypes and seven production aircraft. The Model 147B was designed for high-altitude reconnaissance, with wingspan extended from the 13 ft span of the Model 147A to 27 ft, raising the 147B's operational ceiling to 62,500 ft.|$|R
5|$|Clark, Ford, and Jennings {{were among}} {{a total of}} more than 1,000 members of the ABC News {{division}} that were part of the broadcast. They were all under the direction of ABC's Roger Goodman. The ABC 2000 Today telecast overall also received a Peabody Award. Reflecting on the event, Clark was <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> his participation, feeling that New Year's Eve 2000 {{was one of the biggest}} nights he had ever spent in Times Square.|$|E
5|$|Delsener {{presented}} {{the plan to}} Paul Simon {{in the summer of}} 1981. Simon was <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the idea, but questioned whether it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie One-Trick Pony. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He questioned whether he and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{spoke and}} {{voted in favor}} of the {{resolution}} of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged the United States into World War I. In August, Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating that democracy had little place in time of war. Harding voted for most war legislation, including the Espionage Act of 1917, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti-business. In May 1918, Harding, less <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E
2500|$|Gallup Poll editors {{noted in}} 2010 that [...] "in {{addition}} to conservatives being more <b>enthusiastic</b> than liberals <b>about</b> voting in this year's election, their relative advantage on enthusiasm {{is much greater}} than we've seen in the recent past." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1990 Knudsen {{participated in}} a {{workshop}} called [...] "The Environmental Model of Mars" [...] in Hungary. One morning Knudsen had {{sat down at the}} morning table at the workshop and started an <b>enthusiastic</b> conversation <b>about</b> why Mars exploration is especially important with two people unknown to him; it turned out that they were Agustin Chicarro, who was ESA's Solar System Research Project Scientist and leading and George Scoon, the chief designer of ESA's orbiter probes.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Dehai, Huancong, Fang Yangming (Aloysius Pang) and a {{few other}} young men form “Peaks Team” so that Renxin’s “Fire Team” cannot steal the limelight. This group of boys whose future seems {{uncertain}} are not exactly <b>enthusiastic</b> initially <b>about</b> participating in the tournament. Later, with encouragement from Yangming, who is afflicted with an incurable illness, they decide to take the tournament seriously in order to score a personal triumph as the boys feel that they have never won any prizes in their lives before.|$|R
5|$|In 1912, a Cecil Priestley was {{temporarily}} employed by Henn {{as a member}} of the Guildford Grammar School staff. It seems today that he conceived the idea of a Guildford Preparatory School. Henn was <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> this, however the Guildford Preparatory School did not integrate with the main Guildford Grammar School until 1921, when it became Guildford Grammar Preparatory School, and Priestley resigned from his position as the Head of the Prep School around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas {{that had been}} performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, initial {{reception}} by Manchester City supporters was polarised, {{with some}} lukewarm about moving from Maine Road {{which had a}} reputation for being one of English football's most atmospheric grounds, whilst others were <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>about</b> the bigger stadium and move back to East Manchester where the club was formed. Since 2010, the club has boasted more than 36,000 season ticket holders each season, which is more than the 35,150 maximum capacity of Maine Road just before the club moved homes.|$|E

5000|$|La Nature No. 999 of 23 July 1892 {{featured}} an <b>enthusiastic</b> article <b>about</b> the Théâtre Optique. Gaston Tissandier {{described how}} it enabled uninterrupted projection of a considerable {{series of actions}} and wrote that Reynaud had composed very amusing scenes with characters [...] "who engage in lively scenes and execute rapid movements of a charming effect" [...] (translated from French). He sensed that the system provided new possibilities and thought it would undoubtedly have a future with photographed series of poses, when it would become technically and economically more feasible to produce photographic strips.|$|R
60|$|He {{was popular}} on the stage; {{some of his}} plays were {{circulated}} separately in cheap and very perishable quartos. No collected edition of his plays appeared during his life; without {{that he could not}} be studied, and recognised in his greatness. He withdrew to the country and died. There was no <b>enthusiastic</b> curiosity <b>about</b> him; nobody Boswellised any playwright of his time. The Folio of 1623 gave the first opportunity of studying him as alone he can be studied. The Civil Wars and the Reign of the Saints distracted men's minds and depressed or destroyed the Stage.|$|R
