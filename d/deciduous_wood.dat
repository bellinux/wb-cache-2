500|$|Mycena adonis, {{commonly}} known as the scarlet bonnet, is a species of fungus in the Mycenaceae family. Found in Asia, Europe, and North America, it produces small orangish to reddish inedible mushrooms with caps up to [...] in diameter, held by thin pinkish-white stems reaching [...] long. The fungus prefers to grow in conifer woods and peat bogs, suggesting a preference for acidic environments. The appearance of several atypical fruitings of Mycena adonis on <b>deciduous</b> <b>wood</b> in the Netherlands in the late 1970s was attributed to increases in atmospheric pollution that raised the acidity of the wood substrate. Mushrooms resembling M.adonis include M.acicula, M.aurantiidisca, and M.rosella.|$|E
500|$|Bisporella citrina, {{commonly}} known as yellow fairy cups or lemon discos, is a species of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The fungus produces tiny yellow cups up to [...] in diameter, often without stalks, that fruit in groups or dense clusters on decaying <b>deciduous</b> <b>wood</b> that has lost its bark. The widely distributed species is found in North Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and Central and South America. Found in late summer and autumn, the fungus is fairly common, but is easily overlooked owing to its small size. There are several similar species that can in most cases be distinguished by differences in color, morphology, or substrate. Microscopically, B.citrina can be distinguished from these lookalikes by its elliptical spores, which have a central partition, and an oil drop at each end.|$|E

500|$|Mycena arcangeliana {{grows on}} dead <b>deciduous</b> <b>wood,</b> favouring beech and ash, where it grows in [...] "small troops". It {{has also been}} {{recorded}} less frequently on conifers, bracken and Japanese knotweed. There have been reports from grassland, but these are probably a misidentification of M. flavescens. It is infrequently to commonly found in late summer to autumn months in the British Isles, though it is more commonly encountered in the south. Its distribution is fairly widespread elsewhere in Europe, though it is less common. It has been listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Fungi in Norway. [...] "Mycena oortiana", which was rarely found in mycological literature, {{was described as a}} predominantly west-European species; however, M. arcangeliana has also been recorded in Scandinavia, Greenland, and Italy, from where it was first described.|$|E
60|$|But especially, in the winter, {{the extent}} to which this {{transportation}} and planting of nuts is carried on is made apparent by the snow. In almost every wood, you will see where the red or gray squirrels have pawed down through the snow in a hundred places, sometimes two feet deep, and almost always directly to a nut or a pine-cone, as directly as if they had started from it and bored upward,--which you and I could not have done. It would be difficult for us to find one before the snow falls. Commonly, no doubt, they had deposited them there in the fall. You wonder if they remember the localities, or discover them by the scent. The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the earth under a thicket of evergreens, frequently under a small clump of evergreens {{in the midst of a}} <b>deciduous</b> <b>wood.</b> If there are any nut-trees, which still retain their nuts, standing at a distance without the wood, their paths often lead directly to and from them. We, therefore, need not suppose an oak standing here and there in the wood in order to seed it, but if a few stand within twenty or thirty rods of it, it is sufficient.|$|E

50|$|Their {{habitat is}} {{coniferous}} forests, sometimes mixed or <b>deciduous</b> <b>woods,</b> across North America. Most birds nest in coniferous type {{forests of the}} North but winter in mixed or <b>deciduous</b> <b>woods.</b> They also love riparian areas because of the abundance of prey there. They live in tree cavities and old nests made by other small raptors. Some are permanent residents, while others may migrate south in winter or move down from higher elevations. Their range covers most of North America including southeastern Alaska, southern Canada, most of the United States and the central mountains in Mexico.|$|R
