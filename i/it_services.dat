40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} the research question: How to describe, understand, and explain <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery? Based {{on the research}} question, the following research questions were derived:  How to analyse <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery based on ITIL {{in order to determine}} its current situation? How to formalize elements of <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery in maturity level {{that can be used to}} assess its current status? These research questions are answered by two IT artefacts: an analysis method and a maturity model for <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery. Both of them are constructed by design-science research guidelines. The analysis method is focused on understanding the <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery in organizations; it is founded on the <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery processes of Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) version 2. The method proposed has been applied through three case studies of Nicaraguan Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The maturity model is oriented to formalize and assess the maturity level of <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery; <b>it</b> is supported by <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery elements that are considered significant for managing <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> delivery by the Nicaraguan ISP sector, by <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> concepts, and by maturity model properties, and complemented by the <b>IT</b> <b>Service</b> Capability Maturity Model.

40|$|AbstractMany <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> {{platforms}} (e. g., {{cloud computing}} platforms) are built as closed systems. They {{do not allow}} their customers to interoperate with other platforms or port their data to other platforms. As switching to a different system is costly, customers of a closed IT system can be considered locked in. Consequently, potential customers, who are aware of this lock-in issue, do not adopt cloud services. Opening up an <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> platform, however, reduces users’ concerns about lock-in and its associated switching cost. It is even predicted that an <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> platform gets more attractive, if it opens up. This paper validates this prediction by analyzing the level of openness (i. e., interoperability, portability, and usability) of cloud computing platforms on their adoption. For the validation, we develop a value creation model for <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> platforms. Based on this value creation model and a specification of requirements of open cloud computing platforms, {{the relationship between the}} openness of <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> platforms and the adoption of <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> platforms (i. e., attractiveness) is analyzed in detail. In particular, our results show that the level of openness {{plays a major role in}} the adoption of <b>IT</b> <b>service</b> platforms of emerging service providers...|$|R
