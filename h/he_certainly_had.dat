5|$|Of Thomas Quiney's fate {{the records}} show little. It is speculated {{that he may}} have died in 1662 or 1663 when the parish burial records are incomplete. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> a nephew in London, who by this time held the lease to The Cage.|$|E
5|$|Richard and Gloucester's {{campaign}} of 1392 never happened, but Richard did leave for Ireland in 1394 {{with a large}} army, accompanied by John Othelake, who had succeeded Chandos as Ireland King of Arms in 1393. No details are given of Othelake's career as Ireland King of Arms, although <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> a connection with Ireland as an officer of arms to the Earl of March in 1381. The historical evidence does not even make clear how long Othelake served in the position.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E

25|$|Raphaël {{embarked}} on a policy of trying to convince Jacques {{of the need to}} win more races as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> the ability to do so... Anquetil had a very strong personality so he was not easily dominated but Géminiani had an even stronger one. He never gave up the task of trying to convince Jacques of the need for more panache, how a man of his talent should have an even bigger list of important wins.|$|E
25|$|Bernard's {{name was}} {{certainly}} on the Declaration of Arbroath, and as chancellor <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> some role. He held this administrative office throughout {{his time as}} Abbot of Arbroath, until his election as Bishop of the Isles by 1328. He {{would have had a}} significant role in royal government and the issue of charters, and many royal acts are dated by Bernard's whereabouts. His role as chancellor appears to have been used for the benefit of his abbey with nine of the sixteen royal charters extant from the period 13123 having the abbey as the beneficiary.|$|E
500|$|Although compromises to the hits-only formula {{had been}} {{permitted}} on the Lennon and Starr albums, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{comments on the}} controversial choice of tracks: [...] "But all this is down to a matter of timing and circumstance: Harrison needed to have a hits collection out in 1976, he didn't have enough big hits to fill out 13 tracks (even if <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> enough great album tracks to do so), and so the Fabs were brought in {{to fill in the}} cracks." [...] Erelwine adds that [...] "The result might be a little underwhelming in retrospect, but it's undeniably entertaining." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. I {{had never}} heard of him as a boxer. Still, he seems very anxious to go down, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> one {{remarkable}} testimonial, and as there's no one else--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gee, but I {{certainly}} {{am sorry}} for him!" [...] whispered Andy to his twin. [...] "He isn't a fellow that I would cotton to, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> got {{himself into a}} pickle." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> an {{enormous}} influence on me [...] I {{remember that when}} I was Generalmusikdirektor in Aachen, a friend invited me to a concert that Furtwängler gave in Cologne [...] Furtwängler's performance of the Schumann's Fourth, which I didn't know at the time, opened up a new world for me. I was deeply impressed. I didn't want to forget this concert, so I immediately returned to Aachen.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Oxford National Dictionary of Biography [...] "He {{may have}} been the 'William Chaloner' who on 31 March 1684 married Katharine Atkinson at St Katharine's by the Tower, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> several children. However, this {{relatively}} respectable period of Chaloner's life ended when he was suspected of robbery and forced to flee his lodgings." [...] His [...] "trick" [...] for recovering stolen property was [...] "to steal it in the first place". As a result, he made his first appearance in the public record in 1690, as a suspect in a burglary case. But the [...] "tongue-pudding" [...] and the knack for playing two sides against each other were established as hallmarks of his increasingly large-scale criminal enterprises.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{guide to}} Abdisho’s support the letter must be treated with caution. [...] His claim to the western districts (Amid, Mardin and Seert had Catholic bishops, and he also {{controlled}} the monasteries of Mar Pethion in the Mardin district and Mar Yaqob the Recluse in the Seert district) was perfectly reasonable, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> two metropolitans in India. [...] His claim to the Erbil, Urmi and Salmas districts {{may also have been}} justified, in view of the support for Sulaqa from their bishops. [...] Alqosh, however, was the stronghold of his rival Shemon VII Ishoyahb, who also controlled Telkepe and Karamlish. [...] Abdisho perhaps felt obliged, as 'patriarch of Mosul', to assert a claim to the Mosul district, and may have had a bishop nominally responsible for the villages of the Mosul plain.|$|E
60|$|We may see by {{remembering what}} sort of a Spirit Christ had when on earth; for <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> the same Spirit now--the Spirit which proceedeth everlastingly from the Father and from the Son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Catherine de Bourgh," [...] she replied, [...] "has very lately {{given him}} a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first {{introduced}} to her notice, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not known her long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> {{had a close}} call. We {{must get}} him ashore and work over {{him as soon as}} possible. You light the way; I think I can carry him alone." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mayne {{answered}} all counts. On {{the first}} and second counts, he said that the supposed [...] "faculty" [...] was merely a copy printed at Douai of an announcement of the Jubilee of 1575, and that its application having expired {{with the end of the}} jubilee, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not published it either at Golden (the manor house of Francis Tregian) or elsewhere. On the third count, he said that he had asserted nothing definite on the subject to the three illiterate witnesses who swore to the contrary. On the fourth count, he said that the fact he was wearing an Agnus Dei at the time of his arrest did not establish that he had brought it into the kingdom or delivered it to Tregian. On the fifth count, he said that the presence of a Missal, a chalice, and vestments in his room did not establish that he had said Mass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour was}} a great {{disappointment}} for Australian cricket. The team won only nine of its 39 matches and were soundly beaten in the Test series, but the real difficulty was the indiscipline of some players. According to Wisden, quarrels began among the players during the opening match at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and Scott had [...] "neither the strength of character nor the experience as a leader that the difficulties of his position demanded". Scott and the team manager Ben Wardill {{spent a lot of}} time adjudicating quarrels and the stress of the captaincy impacted Scott's performances as a batsman. The 1887 edition of Wisden bemoaned the absence of Murdoch, saying: [...] "W. L. Murdoch, who was chief in the field of the three teams of 1880, 1882, and 1884, may not have exhibited all the qualities which go to make up that rare and valuable being, an ideal captain – but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> a larger experience and a stronger will than the gentleman who, with the best of intentions, and the greatest sincerity of purpose, led the team of 1886".|$|E
2500|$|Genco Russo {{never was}} the [...] "boss of all bosses" [...] {{as the media}} {{depicted}} him. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> leverage providing voters for the DC at a local level, but it is hardly imaginable that the Mafia was ruled from a small and isolated town {{in the interior of}} Sicily, and not by the powerful Mafia families in Palermo. The fact that Salvatore Greco [...] "Ciaschiteddu" [...] – a representative of the Palermo based Mafia – was made 'secretary' of the first Sicilian Mafia Commission and not Genco Russo was a clear sign that his influence was limited. Genco Russo probably only was present at the Grand Hotel des Palmes Mafia meeting in 1957 because one of his relatives from the US, Santo Sorge, was there as well. Genco Russo apparently irritated other Mafia bosses because he was too much in the media spotlight. [...] "Did you see Gina Lollobrigida in the newspaper today," [...] a mafioso once said, referring to the notoriously ugly appearance of Genco Russo. The new generation of mafiosi did not share the style of openly exercised power. Instead they preferred to operate clandestinely and detested publicity.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> {{not much}} respect for it. He {{seems to go}} out of his way almost to openly insult it. He calls half-past two thirty-eight o'clock, and in twenty minutes from then he says it is one! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They do {{say about}} the country," [...] whispered Mrs. Townsend, [...] "that he refuses to be the heir at all. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not had any cards printed with the title on them--I know that as a fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and Oswald {{were away}} {{together}} {{when she told}} me that she had made up her mind. Oswald has hardly spoken to her since you have been in the house. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not spoken to her about you since you came to us." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> got it, in his lap--where neither cup, saucer, nor tea should be.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened his}} mouth most {{unnecessarily}} wide; <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not a tooth in his head.|$|E

60|$|Miss Clapperclaw {{says she}} {{believes}} Adams to be Mrs. Champignon's father, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> {{a look of}} that lady; as Miss C. {{pointed out to me}} at dinner one night, whilst old Adams was blundering about amongst the hired men from Gunter's, and falling over the silver dishes.|$|R

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Joslyn Layne awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "Maybe Zorn's genius isn't that he creates entirely unique music, but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> an ear for great musical ideas, gleaned from {{his years of}} deep listening. And so, while these {{compositions}} may not be landmarks among string quartet works, they are exceedingly well done".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Jake {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "At first, I thought Kenwardine great, and I {{like him}} now. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> charm and you can't believe much against him when he's with you; but it's somehow different at a distance. Still, {{he knew nothing}} about the attacks on you. I saw that when I told him about them." ...|$|R
