5|$|As was {{the case}} with his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained relations with the Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E
5|$|Maredudd ap Rhys (died 1239) {{was also}} given as a hostage, but was less {{fortunate}} than Hywel. He was blinded by King Henry after {{the failure of}} the invasion of Wales in 1165, and became known as Maredudd Ddall (Maredudd the Blind). He ended <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a monk at Whitland Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar also {{fostered a}} fairly close {{relationship}} with the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, particularly during <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong. In 2006, they were again seen together in public, after Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah made a state visit to Johor to express his interest in Iskandar Development Region.|$|E

5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> the Agong, Sultan Iskandar {{was often}} seen in public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Living out {{the rest}} of <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a farmer, Jonathan Alder died on January 30, 1849, in Canaan Township, Madison County, Ohio, at the age of 75. He had become a {{well-known}} figure in the region, and is still remembered today with a school district, high school, and middle school named after him. A historical marker was erected by Ohio in front of Foster Chapel Cemetery at , near West Jefferson, where he is buried. The cabin Alder built in 1806 is now located at the Madison County Historical Society Museum in London.|$|E

5|$|Middleton {{stayed at}} LSU until 1942, {{describing}} <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> the comptroller of LSU as long days {{that he would}} not want to relive, but after the first year he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to him in the past.|$|E

On February 24, 2016, Nakajima picked up the biggest win of his career by defeating Minoru Suzuki in the main event of Noah's show in Korakuen Hall. As a result, Nakajima was granted a shot at the GHC Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by Takashi Sugiura on March 19.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe and the Liberals were {{deflated}} by {{the outcome}} of the October 1974 election. Wilson's majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals without a clear role; as Dutton observes, apart from being neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to the public. A further problem for the party was the divergence between its activists, who were radicals well {{to the left of the}} official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives. Thorpe, whose personal majority in North Devon had fallen to under 7,000 in October, confided to an associate that, unless the party were soon to make a significant impact, <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> leader might be numbered.|$|E

5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Light (foaled February 13, 1996) is {{a retired}} Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire. He was foaled in the United States but was trained in England and Dubai during his racing career, which ran from August 1998 to his {{retirement}} following the Breeders' Cup Turf on October 2001. He raced in six countries, winning Group One/Grade I races in five of them and was a dual winner of the Emirates World Series Racing Championship. He was named United States Champion Male Turf Horse, European Horse of the Year and European Champion Older Horse in 2001. He was also well known for his two races against the 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo. In August 2012 {{it was announced that}} he had been pensioned from stallion duty while in Japan and would return to Dalham Hall in England to live out <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a pensioner.|$|E
5|$|Klotter {{wrote that}} Breckinridge's {{sale of a}} female slave and her six-week-old child in November 1857 {{probably}} ended <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a slaveholder. Slaves were not listed among his assets in the 1860 Census, but Heck noted that he had little need for slaves at that time, since {{he was living in}} Lexington's Phoenix Hotel after returning to Kentucky from his term as vice president. Some slavery advocates refused to support him in the 1860 presidential race because he was not a slaveholder. Klotter noted that Breckinridge fared better in rural areas of the South, where there were fewer slaveholders; in urban areas where the slave population was higher, he lost to Constitutional Unionist candidate John Bell, who owned 166 slaves. William C. Davis recorded that, in most of the South, the combined votes for Bell and Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas exceeded those cast for Breckinridge.|$|E
50|$|A {{traveller}} and collector, he {{had some}} celebrity in <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> a virtuoso and man of science, which gained him admission in 1735 to the Society of Antiquaries, and in 1742 to the Royal Society.|$|R
25|$|Druce was {{a rather}} unorthodox batsman focused chiefly on hitting, and for <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>his</b> hitting on the leg-side was {{exceptional}} in quality. Although {{he was not a}} pure slogger, his defence on sticky wickets was not the equal of the best batsmen of <b>his</b> <b>day,</b> <b>as</b> shown in August 1895.|$|R
50|$|Orologio won fame in <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> an {{instrumental}} musician {{able to perform}} and compose {{in a variety of}} genres. He was an adept composer for voices, and his works are marked by closely spaced imitation. He made little use of chromaticism, which was in fashion in <b>his</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
5|$|After Arthur Harris' {{appointment}} as GOC Bomber Command, the situation declined. Harris, since <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a group captain at the Air Ministry's strategic planning division, had attacked {{the use of}} resources in maritime aviation, suggesting that bombing enemy shipyards and port facilities would solve the threat to trade defence. By November 1942, 259 Hudsons were available, but were shared by other services. The Whitley and Hampden were too vulnerable to operate near enemy coastlines without heavy fighter escort. Beaufort squadrons {{were sent to the}} Middle East to operate over the Balkans and North Africa. The highly successful de Havilland Mosquito was sought-after, but priority was given to the other two air commands. By February 1943, GOC Coastal Command John Slessor, had some 850 aircraft. But in respect of quality he was not impressed. Slessor continually wrote to the Air Ministry, complaining that Mosquitoes were being used as reconnaissance machines, while over 200 were being used by the RAF tactical air forces supporting the army, and merchant shipping was suffering high losses in the Atlantic. His successor Sholto Douglas' written records indicate the desire to upgrade, rather than produce new aircraft. By his tenure, January 1944, ten squadrons of Consolidated Liberators, five Vickers Wellingtons squadrons equipped with the Leigh light, and two Handley Page Halifax, Hudson, and Boeing Fortress squadrons were available. Among other technological developments, these long-range aircraft helped defeat the U-boats in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|The people {{involved}} in the Oregon track and field program have led changes that benefited professional athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time as a head coach at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles from <b>his</b> <b>days</b> <b>as</b> a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for recovery time. This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing the weight of his athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered himself more of a teacher than a coach and stressed schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's track and field program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series of hearings regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E
