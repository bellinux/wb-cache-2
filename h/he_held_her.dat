25|$|Following her husband's death, Elizabeth made solemn vows to Konrad {{similar to}} those of a nun. These vows {{included}} celibacy, as well as complete obedience to Konrad as her confessor and spiritual director. Konrad's treatment of Elizabeth was extremely harsh, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> to standards of behavior which were almost impossible to meet. Among the punishments he is alleged to have ordered were physical beatings; he also ordered her to send away her three children. Her pledge to celibacy proved a hindrance to her family's political ambitions. Elizabeth was more or less held hostage at Pottenstein, the castle of her uncle, Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, in an effort to force her to remarry. Elizabeth, however, held fast to her vow, even threatening to cut off her own nose so that no man would find her attractive enough to marry.|$|E
500|$|Mary was not {{beheaded}} with {{a single}} strike. The first blow missed her neck and struck {{the back of her}} head. The second blow severed the neck, except for a small bit of sinew, which the executioner cut through using the axe. Afterward, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> head aloft and declared, [...] "God save the Queen." [...] At that moment, the auburn tresses in his hand {{turned out to be a}} wig and the head fell to the ground, revealing that Mary had very short, grey hair. A small dog owned by the queen, a Skye Terrier, is said to have been hiding among her skirts, unseen by the spectators. Following the beheading, it refused to be parted from its owner's body and was covered in her blood, until it was forcibly taken away and washed. Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance; contemporary accounts state that all her clothing, the block, and everything touched by her blood was burnt in the fireplace of the Great Hall to obstruct relic-hunters.|$|E
2500|$|In the documentary, [...] "Natascha Kampusch: 3096 days in captivity", Kampusch {{sympathized with}} her captor. She said [...] "I feel {{more and more}} sorry for him—he's a poor soul", {{in spite of the}} fact that <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> captive for eight years. According to police she [...] "cried inconsolably" [...] when she was told he was dead, and lit a candle for him at the morgue. She has, however, {{referred}} to her captor as a [...] "criminal".|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hands, {{standing}} {{close to}} her, {{as though he}} had some special right to comfort her.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} a strange, hoarse whisper just above <b>her</b> face, <b>he</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in his throbbing, heavy embrace.|$|R
60|$|When she had kissed him, and <b>he</b> had <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand a minute, his {{thoughts}} {{went back to}} the money.|$|R
2500|$|After her marriage, Lennox {{turned her}} {{attention}} to acting, but without much success. Horace Walpole described a performance at Richmond in 1748 as [...] "deplorable". She did, though, receive a benefit night at the Haymarket Theatre in a production of The Mourning Bride in 1750. That year she also published her most successful poem, [...] "The Art of Coquetry" [...] in Gentleman's Magazine. She met Samuel Johnson around this time, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in very high regard. When her first novel, The Life of Harriot Stuart, Written by Herself, appeared, Johnson threw a lavish party for Lennox, with a laurel wreath and an apple pie that contained bay leaf. Johnson thought her superior to his other female literary friends, Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, and Frances Burney. He ensured that Lennox was introduced to important members of the London literary scene.|$|E
2500|$|James Smith was an {{unemployed}} divorcé {{living in the}} Gorton area of Manchester. Described by acquaintances as [...] "house-proud and well-groomed", he was a teetotaller and non-smoker. His marriage had ended after ten years in 1980 due to his violence towards his wife. He had then commenced an affair between 19801982 with 20-year-old Tina Watson, whom he [...] "used as a punch-bag", even subjecting her to severe beatings while {{she was pregnant with}} his child. She said: [...] "At first it was now and again; just a little tap. But {{in the end it was}} every day. He would smack me in the face or hit me over the head with an ashtray. He would kick me in the legs or between the legs." [...] Watson managed to escape from the relationship, during which Smith had also attempted to drown her while she was bathing. In 1982 Smith then began a relationship with 15-year-old Wendy Mottershead, who was also a victim of his violence. In one attack <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> head under water in the kitchen sink in an attempt to drown her.|$|E
60|$|He {{then came}} close to her, and spoke into her ear. Whilst he spoke <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> head to his mouth with both his hands. Strange {{expressions}} came over her face; the workings of her mouth were painful to observe. Still <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> and whispered on.|$|E
60|$|But <b>he</b> only <b>held</b> <b>her</b> closer, {{and laughed}} such a happy laugh that Sylvia felt the truth before he uttered it.|$|R
60|$|She stood, {{staring in}} his face, while <b>he</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> arms, {{gripping}} into her soft flesh through the velvety sleeves.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> {{a little}} {{away from him}} as he gave {{a quick glance at}} the refined and artistic {{appointments}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> unresisting hand, but {{her face}} was hidden from him.|$|E
60|$|He seemed again {{unaware of}} her, though <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand close.|$|E
60|$|The {{last words}} were {{said in an}} undertone, as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{suddenly}} <b>held</b> <b>her</b> to him, and she met {{his lips}} unresistingly. It {{was the first}} time he had even attempted anything of the sort for months.|$|R
60|$|She paused, {{struggling}} for breath. He {{did not answer}} <b>her.</b> <b>He</b> only <b>held</b> <b>her</b> tighter, and whispered her name lovingly. In a moment she re-opened her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{into the}} house," [...] he said, [...] "and give me food." [...] And <b>he</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> {{with his hand}} as though he would compel her to follow him.|$|R
60|$|Virginia gave {{a little}} cry and started forward. But <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|Her father's {{face was}} ashy white, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in both his arms.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him fondly as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> a moment in his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may believe}} it; indeed you may." [...] <b>He</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand. [...] "You will write {{to your mother}} I daresay to-night. Tell her I was here. Good-by now." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> {{hand and}} waist. 'Very well, then,' she said. 'Thus far you shall persuade me. I will meet you to-morrow night or the night after. Now, let me go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, however, {{you shall}} begrudge it, or else make me very welcome." [...] <b>He</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> by the wrist, {{which he had}} caught as he {{prevented}} her from summoning the servant.|$|R
60|$|She still sobbed, {{ignoring}} him, ignoring that <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her.</b> His {{lips were}} dry.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked down}} {{at her for a moment}} as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> close to him.|$|E
60|$|She {{was in his}} arms. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> now. His {{strength}} was like a giant’s.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] she replied; and he {{felt her}} hand tremble in his, and dropped it. He had {{forgotten}} that <b>he</b> thus <b>held</b> <b>her</b> as all these thoughts pressed upon his brain.|$|R
60|$|So he bade her to arise--though <b>he</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> by {{the hair}} (all warm, it was, and as soft as silk and very fragrant) and the lady stood up, {{trembling}} before him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> stood up, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> {{face for}} a moment between his hands, and kissed her forehead.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> {{close and}} kissed her. There was only room for their four feet.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> fingers so firmly that {{he could}} feel the pulse beat in them.|$|E
60|$|He had summarily placed {{himself before}} her, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> wrist {{in a tight}} grip.|$|E
6000|$|He {{laid his}} great soft fingers on her pulse. She shrank from his touch; <b>he</b> {{deliberately}} <b>held</b> <b>her</b> by the arm. [...] "You're getting excited," [...] he said. [...] "Never mind what I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-by." [...] <b>He</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand. Presently <b>he</b> {{drew her}} back into the room, closing the door carefully, and glancing around. There was a look of {{profound}} cunning in his eye as he said slowly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{hands were}} {{suddenly}} locked in his. She felt herself being drawn into his arms. With a desperate effort she avoided his embrace. <b>He</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> left wrist, {{and his face}} was dark with passion.|$|R
