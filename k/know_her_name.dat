5|$|Sitric {{married an}} unnamed sister of Æthelstan in 926. Historians {{generally}} describe her as Æthelstan's only full sister, but Maggie Bailey {{points out that}} this rests on the late testimony of William of Malmesbury, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no such distinction when recording her marriage to Sitric. William did not <b>know</b> <b>her</b> <b>name,</b> but traditions first recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century identify her as Saint Edith of Polesworth. The truth of his identification is debated, but regardless of her name {{it is likely that}} she entered a nunnery in widowhood. According to some late sources, such as the chronicler John of Wallingford, Amlaíb Cuarán was the son of Sitric and this West Saxon princess.|$|E

Rove told Gregory [...] "I acted in an appropriate manner, made all the appropriate individuals aware of my contact. I met with the FBI right at the beginning of this, told them everything.

2500|$|Durante's {{radio show}} was {{bracketed}} with two trademarks: [...] "Inka Dinka Doo" [...] as his opening theme, and the invariable signoff that became another familiar national catchphrase: [...] "Good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are." [...] For years Durante preferred {{to keep the}} mystery alive. One theory was that it referred to {{the owner of a}} restaurant in Calabash, North Carolina, where Durante and his troupe had stopped to eat. He was so taken by the food, the service, and the chitchat he told the owner that he would make her famous. Since he did not <b>know</b> <b>her</b> <b>name,</b> he referred to her as [...] "Mrs. Calabash". Another idea was that it was a personal salute to his deceased first wife, Jeanne (Olsen) Durante, who died in 1943. [...] "Calabash" [...] might be a mangle of Calabasas, the California city where they made their home during the last years of her life. His friend and co-star, Candy Candido, (in an interview with Chuck Shaden's [...] "Speaking of Radio" [...] in 1988), [...] reported that he met the actual woman in Chicago when traveling with Durante, but was sworn to keep the secret. Alternatively, Jimmy's [...] friend and radio producer, Phil Cohan revealed to Chuck Shaden's Speaking of Radio interview in 1988 that it was a fabrication. Needing a closing to his show, the writers tossed around several names settling on Cohan's calabash pipe as the best-sounding moniker.|$|E
