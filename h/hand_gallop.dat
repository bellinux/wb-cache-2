2500|$|A {{controlled}} gallop used {{to show a}} horse's ground-covering stride in {{horse show}} competition is called a [...] "gallop in hand" [...] or a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Western {{pleasure}} - {{the rider}} must show the horse {{together with other}} horses in an arena at a walk, jog (a slow, controlled trot), and lope (a slow, controlled canter). In some breed competitions, a judge may ask for an extended canter and/or a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> and, less often, {{an extension of the}} jog. [...] The horse must remain under control on a loose rein, with low head carriage, the rider directing the horse with nearly invisible aids and minimal interference.|$|E
2500|$|Western {{horses are}} asked to have a brisk, ground-covering walk, but a slow, relaxed jog trot that allows the rider to sit the saddle and not post. The Western version of the canter is called a lope and while {{collected}} and balanced, {{is expected to be}} slow and relaxed. Working western horses seldom use a sustained <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> but must be able to accelerate quickly to high speed when chasing cattle or competing in rodeo speed events, must be able to stop quickly from a dead run and [...] "turn on a dime." ...|$|E
60|$|As he expected, the volley was {{answered}} by a general fire from their hidden foes. Then the party leapt into their saddles, and, pistol in <b>hand,</b> <b>galloped</b> up the road.

50|$|Evans, Hill, Morton (and {{probably}} Frank Baker) rode ahead after Tunstall. Evans, Morton, and Hill caught Tunstall {{and his men}} a {{few miles}} from Lincoln, in an area covered with scrub timber. Tunstall, the nine horses, and his hands were spread out along the narrow trail. Bonney, who was riding drag, alerted the others. The deputies began firing without warning. Tunstall's <b>hands</b> <b>galloped</b> off through the brush to a hilltop overlooking the trail. Tunstall first stayed with his horses, then rode away, but was pursued by the three deputies.|$|R

60|$|The Spaniard {{appeared}} {{inclined to}} follow them, but distrusting his powers, he paused, gave a long, shrill whistle, twice repeated, and then mounted his donkey and driving the mules before him, {{he followed the}} boys at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Flog the horses!" [...] I cried to Anscombe, and off we went at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop</b> {{along the}} native track, the cart swaying and bumping upon the rough veld. The {{sun was setting}} now, {{in half an hour}} it would be quite dark.|$|E
6000|$|At length Mr. Dacre {{rose and}} looked at his watch with a shaking head. 'I have a most {{important}} appointment,' said he, <b>'and</b> I must <b>gallop</b> to keep it.

60|$|The Forest of Paris was {{so large}} that it was useless to think of going round it, and so I took my courage in both <b>hands</b> and <b>galloped</b> on {{down the road in}} the track of the Prussian army. It was not hard to trace it, for it was rutted two feet deep by the gun-wheels and the caissons. Soon I found a fringe of wounded men, Prussians and French, on each side of it, where Bulow's advance had come into touch with Marbot's Hussars. One old man with a long white beard, a surgeon, I suppose, shouted at me, and ran after me still shouting, but I never turned my head and took no notice of him save to spur on faster. I heard his shouts long after I had lost sight of him among the trees.|$|R
6000|$|One morning early, the soothsaying Delaware {{appeared}} with a gloomy countenance. His mind {{was full of}} dismal presentiments, whether from mysterious dreams, or the intimations of the medicine wolf, does not appear. [...] "Danger," [...] he said, [...] "was lurking in their path, {{and there would be}} some fighting before sunset." [...] He was bantered for his prophecy, which was attributed to his having supped too heartily, and been visited by bad dreams. In the course of the morning a party of hunters set out in pursuit of buffaloes, taking with them a mule, to bring home the meat they should procure. They had been some few hours absent, when they came clattering at full speed into camp, giving the war cry of Blackfeet! Blackfeet! Every one seized his weapon and ran to learn the cause of the alarm. It appeared that the hunters, as they were returning leisurely, leading their mule well laden with prime pieces of buffalo meat, passed close by a small stream overhung with trees, about two miles from the camp. Suddenly a party of Blackfeet, who lay in ambush along the thickets, sprang up with a fearful yell, and discharged a volley at the hunters. The latter immediately threw themselves flat on their horses, put them to their speed, and never paused to look behind, until they found themselves in camp. Fortunately they had escaped without a wound; but the mule, with all the [...] "provant," [...] had fallen {{into the hands of the}} enemy This was a loss, as well as an insult, not to be borne. Every man sprang to horse, and with rifle in <b>hand,</b> <b>galloped</b> off to punish the Blackfeet, and rescue the buffalo beef. They came too late; the marauders were off, and all that they found of their mule was the dents of his hoofs, as he had been conveyed off at a round trot, bearing his savory cargo to the hills, to furnish the scampering savages with a banquet of roast meat at the expense of the white men.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{from the}} shadow {{in front of}} the red house emerged a rider, mounted on a {{powerful}} black horse. The horseman--a stern, handsome, bearded man--put his hand above his eyes to shade them from the sun, and gazed up the road. Then he seemed suddenly to strike his spurs into the horse, for the animal bounded forward swiftly, and came sweeping towards Hans at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop.</b>|$|E
60|$|Proceeding at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop</b> along a {{road that}} was one of the spokes {{radiating}} from the Big House hub, Forrest overtook Crellin, his hog manager, and, in a five-minute conference, outlined the next few months of destiny of Burgess Premier, and learned that the brood sow, Lady Isleton, the matron of all matrons of the O. I. C.'s and blue- ribboner in all shows from Seattle to San Diego, was safely farrowed of eleven. Crellin explained that he had sat up half the night with her and was then bound home for bath and breakfast.|$|E
60|$|Jim {{had been}} running by his master's stirrup, while this {{conversation}} had been going on; and he now dropped into his usual place {{at the rear of}} the party. For some miles the trail was followed at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> for the grass was several inches in height, and the trail could be followed as easily as a road. The country then began to change. The ground was poorer and more arid, and clumps of low brush grew here and there. Still, there was no check in the speed. The marks made by the frightened flock were plain enough, even to the horsemen; and bits of wool, left behind on the bushes, afforded an unmistakable testimony to their passage.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the vortex-induced oscillation and galloping of bluff bodies. For some basic cross sections the mechanisms of vortex-induced oscillations was classifiedto three different types by the characteristics of velocity fluctuations in wake in relation tothe occurrence of vortex-induced oscillations. Furthermore the effect of mass-damping para-meter and some attachments like deflector on the responsive amplitude of vortex-inducedoscillations was investigated for cable-stayed bridge deck sections. On the othet <b>hand</b> theproperties of <b>galloping</b> oscillation were examined for some bluff sections and some commentsof applicability of quasi-steady theory to galloping oscillation were briefly shown...|$|R
50|$|Viewed from {{overhead}} {{with north}} upward, the Galloping Horse appeared upside down, with Hills 54 and 55 forming the horse's rear legs and Hill 57 forming the front legs. From east to west, Hills 50, 51, and 52 formed the horse's {{body with the}} 900 ft high Hill 53 at the head. Colonel William A. McCulloch—commander of the 27th Regiment—ordered his 1st Battalion to attack Hill 57 and his 3rd Battalion to assault Hills 51 and 52 from Hill 54, which was already in American <b>hands.</b> Defending the <b>Galloping</b> Horse and the nearby fork of the Matanikau were 600 Japanese soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 228th Infantry Regiment under Major Haruka (or Haruja) Nishiyama.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hunt and his fellow-travellers had {{not been}} many days at the Arickara village, when rumors began to {{circulate}} that the Sioux had followed them up, and that a war party, four or five hundred in number, were lurking somewhere in the neighborhood. These rumors produced much embarrassment in the camp. The white hunters were deterred from venturing forth in quest of game, neither did the leaders think it proper to expose them to such a risk. The Arickaras, too, who had suffered greatly in their wars with this cruel and ferocious tribe, were roused to increased vigilance, and stationed mounted scouts upon the neighboring hills. This, however, is a general precaution among the tribes of the prairies. Those immense plains present a horizon like the ocean, so that any object of importance can be descried afar, and information communicated to a great distance. The scouts are stationed on the hills, therefore, to look out both for game and for enemies, and are, in a manner, living telegraphs conveying their intelligence by concerted signs. If they wish to give notice of a herd of buffalo in the plain beyond, they gallop backwards and forwards abreast, on {{the summit of the}} hill. If they perceive an enemy at <b>hand,</b> they <b>gallop</b> to and fro, crossing each other; at sight of which the whole village flies to arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you, dearest," [...] he said simply, {{kissing her}} in answer; [...] "good-bye, Mr. Croft. I {{hope to see}} you again in a week," [...] and he was in the cart and had {{gathered}} up the long and intricate-looking reins. Jantje let go the horses' heads and uttered a whoop. Mouti, giving up star-gazing, suddenly became an animated being and scrambled into the cart with surprising alacrity; the horses sprang forward at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> and were soon hidden from Bessie's dim sight in a cloud of dust. Poor Bessie, it was a hard trial, and now that John had gone and her tears could not distress him, she went into her room and gave way to them freely enough.|$|E
60|$|In another {{quarter of}} an hour, the boys were issuing {{from the streets of}} Orleans; and were soon going along, at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> by the road {{along the banks of the}} Loire; while to the north {{stretched}} the flat and densely-wooded country known as the Forest of Orleans. As far as Chateauneuf they kept near the river. Here they halted half an hour, to give breathing time to their horses; then started again, and rode fast to Bellegarde. Here was the last post of regular troops, but Cathlineau's franc tireurs were scattered throughout the country, as far as Montargis; and it would have been more difficult for the Barclays to have passed through them than through the regular troops, as they had less respect for passes.|$|E
60|$|After this we {{had quite}} an {{interesting}} time. I scrambled {{on to the}} horse behind Anscombe, whereon that intelligent animal, feeling the double weight, reduced its pace proportionately, to a slow tripple, indeed, out of which {{it could not be}} persuaded to move. So I slipped off again over its tail and we went on as before. Meanwhile the Basutos, very active fellows, were coming up. By this time the yellow-wood grove in the swamp, of which I have already written, was close to us, and it became quite a question which of us would get there first (I may mention that Footsack & Co. had already attained its friendly shelter). Anscombe kicked the horse with his sound heel and I thumped it with my fist, thereby persuading it to a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While {{nearing the}} river on July 15, {{a force of}} about fifty Comanches {{suddenly}} appeared in front of Hood and his seventeen remaining men, one of them carrying a white flag in their <b>hand.</b> Hood immediately <b>galloped</b> {{in the direction of}} the flag but after only thirty paces the Comanches opened fire and the flag was thrown to the ground. At the same time Comanches hidden among the brush also opened up shooting both arrows and rifles. Some of the natives charged and got so close to Hood and his men that they grabbed the reins of the cavalry horses and pulled down the soldiers. Lieutenant Hood fired his shotgun a few times before an arrow pinned his left hand to his horse's bridle. The enlisted men fired revolvers as they withdrew fifty yards back and prepared to defend the position. Later Hood said the [...] "We were nigh meeting a similar fate to that of the gallant Custer and his noble band", referring to the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.|$|R
60|$|In the keen {{stimulus}} of {{the hour}} and the air Key felt the mountaineer's longing for action, and scarcely noticed that Collinson had pathetically brought out his pork barrel to scrape together a few remnants for his last meal. It was not until he had finished his coffee, and Collinson had brought up his horse, that a slight sense of shame at his own and his comrades' selfishness embarrassed his parting with his patient host. He himself was going to Skinner's to plead for him; he knew that Parker had left the draft,--he had seen it lying in the bar,--but {{a new sense of}} delicacy kept him from alluding to it now. It was better to leave Collinson with his own peculiar ideas of the responsibilities of hospitality unchanged. Key shook his <b>hand</b> warmly, and <b>galloped</b> up the rocky slope. But when he had finally reached the higher level, and fancied he could even now see the dust raised by his departing comrades on their two diverging paths, although he knew that they had already gone their different ways,--perhaps never to meet again,--his thoughts and his eyes reverted only to the ruined mill below him and its lonely occupant.|$|R
50|$|In April 2010, in the {{greatest}} sporting scandal in NRL history, he announced the stripping of two premierships and three minor premierships from the Melbourne Storm team. He further announced they would play out {{the remainder of the}} 2010 season for no points. Gallop was widely criticised by many for these heavy penalties with much of the criticism directed at the apparent conflict of interest. Gallop's employer - News Limited - was also the owner of the Melbourne Storm. Gallop was also close friends with John Hartigan - the then Chairman of News Limited Australia. Hartigan identified Storm's ex-CEO Brian Waldron as the 'chief rat'. All penalties were <b>handed</b> down despite <b>Gallop</b> not seeking board approval prior to doing so, and were handed down before any investigation was conducted. In order to diffuse some of this criticism, the NRL Board finally came out a month later and backed Gallop's stance. This was the second major salary cap scandal under Gallop's leadership. In 2002, the then table-topping Canterbury Bulldogs were stripped of all competition points and finished wooden spooners after being found cheating the salary cap. However, just two years later they won the premiership with largely the same playing roster. Gallop also {{had to deal with the}} mid-season defection of Bulldogs star Sonny Bill Williams to French rugby union.|$|R
6000|$|All {{our history}} shows {{us to be}} a {{practical}} people with short views. [...] "Tiens! Une montagne!" [...] Never was a better summing up of British character than those words of the French cartoonist during the Boer War, beneath his picture of a certain British General of those days, riding at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop</b> till his head was butting a cliff. Without seeing a hand's breadth before our noses we have built our Empire, our towns, our law. We are born empiricists, and must have our faces ground by hard facts, before we attempt to wriggle past them. We have thriven so far, but the ruin of England {{is likely to be}} the work of practical men who burn the house down to roast the pig, because they cannot see beyond the next meal. Visions are airy; but I propose to see visions for a moment, and Britain as she might be in 1948.|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{the elder}} men engaged in talk Tom {{did not return}} to them, but endeavoured to keep up a {{conversation}} with the young Indian, whom he found to be willing enough to talk now they were alone, and who knew much more English than he had given him credit for. As soon as the sun set the fire was extinguished, and they lay down to sleep shortly afterwards. An hour before daylight they were in the saddle. Hunting Dog rode ahead on the line he had followed the day before. As soon as it became light Tom kept his eyes fixed upon the ground, but it was only now and then, when the Indian pointed to the print of a horse's hoof in the sand between the rocks, that he could make them out. The two Indians followed the track, however, without the slightest difficulty, the horses going at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Dick, {{hearing that}} he was not pursued, pulled up in a half a mile, and gave a loud, shrill [...] "cooey," [...] the Australian call. He knew that this would be heard by his father, sitting {{listening}} {{at the top of the}} dome, and that he would learn that so far he had succeeded. Then he set the horses off again in a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop</b> and rode steadily down the road. Every hour or so he changed from horse to horse, thus giving them a comparative rest by turns. Occasionally he allowed them to walk for a bit to get their wind, and then again rode on at a gallop. It was about eleven o'clock when he started on his ride. By four in the morning he was at the spot where the party had separated from the column, having thus made forty miles. After that he went more slowly; but it was a little past nine when, with his two exhausted horses, he rode into the camp at Lucknow, where his appearance created quite an excitement.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were in a}} wild country, {{not exactly}} on a {{mountain}} side, but among hills which not far off grew into mountains, where cultivation of the rudest kind {{was just beginning to}} effect its domination over human nature. There was a long spinney rather than a wood stretching down a bottom, through which a brook ran. It would now cease, and then renew itself, so that the trees, though not absolutely continuous, were nearly so for the distance of half a mile. The ground on each side was rough with big stones, and steep in some places as they went down the hill. But still it was such that horsemen could gallop on it. The fox made his way along the whole length, and then traversing, so as to avoid the hounds, ran a ring up the hillside, and back into the spinney again. Among the horsemen many declared that the brute must be killed unless he would make up his mind for a fair start. Mr. Amblethwaite was very busy, hunting the hounds himself, and intent rather on killing the fox fairly than on the hopes of a run. Perhaps he was not desirous of sleeping out another night {{on the far side of}} Helvellyn. In this way the sportsmen galloped up and down the side of the wood till the feeling arose, as it does on such occasions, that it might be well for a man to stand still awhile and spare his horse, in regard to the future necessities of the day. Lord Hampstead did as others were doing, and in a moment Crocker was by his side. Crocker was riding an animal which his father was wont to drive about the country, but one well known in the annals of the Braeside Harriers. It was asserted of him that the fence was not made which he did not know how to creep over. Of jumping, such as jumping is supposed to be in the shires, he knew nothing. He was, too, a bad <b>hand</b> at <b>galloping,</b> but with a shambling, half cantering trot, which he had invented for himself, he could go along all day, not very quickly, but in such fashion as never to be left altogether behind. He was a flea-bitten horse, if my readers know what that is,--a flea-bitten roan, or white covered with small red spots. Horses of this colour are ugly to look at, but are very seldom bad animals. Such as he was, Crocker, who did not ride much when up in London, was very proud of him. Crocker was dressed in a green coat, which in a moment of extravagance he had had made for hunting, and in brown breeches, in which he delighted to display himself on all possible occasions. [...] "My lord," [...] he said, [...] "you'd hardly think it, but I believe this horse to be the best hunter in Cumberland." ...|$|R
6000|$|That is in fairy tales, you understand--where {{the blessed}} hour and youth always arrive, the ivory horn is blown at the castle gate; and far off in her {{beauteous}} bower the princess hears it, and starts up, and knows {{that there is}} the right champion. He is always ready. Look! how the giants' heads tumble off as, falchion in <b>hand,</b> he <b>gallops</b> over the bridge on his white charger! How should that virgin, locked up in that inaccessible fortress, where she has never seen any man that was not eighty, or humpbacked, or her father, {{know that there were}} such beings in the world as young men? I suppose there's an instinct. I suppose there's a season. I never spoke for my part to a fairy princess, or heard as much from any unenchanted or enchanting maiden. Ne'er a one of them has ever whispered her pretty little secrets to me, or perhaps confessed them to herself, her mamma, or her nearest and dearest confidante. But they will fall in love. Their little hearts are constantly throbbing at the window of expectancy on the lookout for the champion. They are always hearing his horn. They are for ever on the tower looking out for the hero. Sister Ann, Sister Ann, do you see him? Surely 'tis a knight with curling mustachios, a flashing scimitar, and a suit of silver armour. Oh no! it is only a costermonger with his donkey and a pannier of cabbage! Sister Ann, Sister Ann, what is that cloud of dust? Oh, it is only a farmer's man driving a flock of pigs from market. Sister Ann, Sister Ann, who is that splendid warrior advancing in scarlet and gold? He nears the castle, he clears the drawbridge, he lifts the ponderous hammer at the gate. Ah me, he knocks twice! 'Tis only the postman with a double letter from Northamptonshire! So it is we make false starts in life. I don't believe there is any such thing known as first love--not within man's or woman's memory. No male or female remembers his or her first inclination any more than his or her own christening. What? You fancy that your sweet mistress, your spotless spinster, your blank maiden just out of the schoolroom, never cared for any but you? And she tells you so? Oh, you idiot! When she was four years old she had a tender feeling towards the Buttons who brought the coals up to the nursery, or the little sweep at the crossing, or the music-master, or never mind whom. She had a secret longing towards her brother's schoolfellow, or the third charity boy at church, and if occasion had served, the comedy enacted with you had been performed along with another. I do not mean to say that she confessed this amatory sentiment, but that she had it. Lay down this page, and think how many and many and many a time you were in love before you selected the present Mrs. Jones as the partner of your name and affections! ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, at half-past eight on a {{beautiful}} morning up came the tented cart, with its two massive wheels, stout stinkwood disselboom, and four spirited young horses; to the heads of which the Hottentot Jantje, assisted by the Zulu Mouti, clad in the sweet simplicity of a moocha, a few feathers in his wool, and a horn snuffbox stuck through the fleshy part of the ear, hung on grimly. In they got--John first, then Bessie next to him, then Jess. Next Jantje scrambled up behind; and after some preliminary backing and plunging, and showing a disposition to twine themselves affectionately round the orange-trees, off went the horses at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> and away swung the cart after them, in a fashion that would have frightened anybody, not accustomed to that mode of progression, pretty well out of his wits. As it was, John had {{as much as he}} could do to keep the four horses together, and to prevent them from bolting, and this alone, to say nothing of the rattling and jolting of the vehicle over the uneven track, was sufficient to put a stop to any attempt at conversation.|$|E

But Mr Bailey, not at all disturbed, had still a shower of pleasantries to bestow on any one who crossed his path; as, calling to a full-grown coal-heaver in a wagon, who for a moment blocked the way, 'Now, young 'un, who trusted YOU with a cart?' inquiring of elderly ladies who wanted to cross, and ran back again, 'Why they didn't go to the workhouse and get an order to be buried?' tempting boys, with friendly words, to get up behind, and immediately afterwards cutting them down; and the like flashes of a cheerful humour, which he would occasionally relieve by going round St. James's Square at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> and coming slowly into Pall Mall by another entry, as if, in the interval, his pace had been a perfect crawl.|$|E
60|$|But at Paris, so {{agitated}} and divided, fancy how it went, {{when the}} continually vibrating Orderlies vibrated thither at <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> with such questionable news! High is the gratulation; and also deep the indignation. An august Assembly, by overwhelming majorities, passionately thanks Bouille; a King's autograph, {{the voices of}} all Loyal, all Constitutional men run to the same tenor. A solemn National funeral-service, for the Law-defenders slain at Nanci; is said and sung in the Champ de Mars; Bailly, Lafayette and National Guards, all except the few that protested, assist. With pomp and circumstance, with episcopal Calicoes in tricolor girdles, Altar of Fatherland smoking with cassolettes, or incense-kettles; the vast Champ-de-Mars wholly hung round with black mortcloth,--which mortcloth and expenditure Marat thinks had better have been laid out in bread, in these dear days, and given to the hungry living Patriot. (Ami du Peuple in Hist. Parl., ubi supra.) On the other hand, living Patriotism, and Saint-Antoine, which we have seen noisily closing its shops and such like, assembles now 'to the number of forty thousand;' and, with loud cries, under the very windows of the thanking National Assembly, demands revenge for murdered Brothers, judgment on Bouille, and instant dismissal of War-Minister Latour du Pin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Follow me," [...] said Lord Evandale to his servants, [...] "and {{if we are}} {{forcibly}} opposed, do as I do."

He reeled in the saddle, advanced his hand to the holster, and drew a pistol, but, unable to discharge it, fell from his horse mortally wounded. His servants had presented their carabines. Hunter fired at random; but Halliday, who was an intrepid fellow, took aim at Inglis, and shot him dead on the spot. At the same instant a shot from behind the hedge still more effectually avenged Lord Evandale, for the ball took place in the very midst of Basil Olifant's forehead, and stretched him lifeless on the ground. His followers, astonished at the execution done in so short a time, seemed rather disposed to stand inactive, when Burley, whose blood was up with the contest, exclaimed, [...] "Down with the Midianites!" [...] and attacked Halliday sword in hand. At this instant the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard, and a party of horse, rapidly advancing on the road from Glasgow, appeared on the fatal field. They were foreign dragoons, led by the Dutch commandant Wittenbold, accompanied by Morton and a civil magistrate.|$|E
60|$|Off {{went the}} five {{thousand}} horsemen, drawn up in a wedge-like form, and I {{must say that}} the general in command handled them very ably. Starting at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop,</b> {{for the first three}} hundred yards he rode straight {{at the tip of the}} tongue-shaped mass of cavalry which, numbering, so far as I could judge, about eight thousand sabres, was advancing to charge us. Then he suddenly swerved to the right and put on the pace, and I saw the great wedge curl round, and before the foe could check himself and turn to meet it, strike him about halfway down his length, with a crashing rending sound, like that of the breaking-up of vast sheets of ice. In sank the great wedge, into his heart, and as it cut its way hundreds of horsemen were thrown up on either side of it, just as the earth is thrown up by a ploughshare, or more like still, as the foaming water curls over beneath the bows of a rushing ship. In, yet in, vainly does the tongue twist its ends round in agony, like an injured snake, and strive to protect its centre; still farther in, by Heaven! right through, and so, amid cheer after cheer from our watching thousands, back again upon the severed ends, beating them down, driving them as a gale drives spray, till at last, amidst the rushing of hundreds of riderless horses, the flashing of swords, and the victorious clamour of their pursuers, the great force crumples up like an empty glove, then turns and gallops pell-mell for safety back to its own lines.|$|E

Now it had occurred to Wayland that, by attaching themselves in some sort to this group as soon as they should overtake them on the road, they {{would be less likely to}} attract notice than if they continued to travel entirely by themselves. He communicated his idea to the Countess, who, only anxious to arrive at Kenilworth without interruption, left him free to choose the manner in which this was to be accomplished. They pressed forward their horses, therefore, with the purpose of overtaking the party of intended revellers, and making the journey in their company; and had just seen the little party, consisting partly of riders, partly of people on foot, crossing the summit of a gentle hill, at about half a mile's distance, and disappearing on the other side, when Wayland, who maintained the most circumspect observation of all that met his eye in every direction, was aware that a rider was coming up behind them on a horse of uncommon action, accompanied by a serving-man, whose utmost efforts were unable to keep up with his master's trotting hackney, and who, therefore, was fain to follow him at a <b>hand</b> <b>gallop.</b> Wayland looked anxiously back at these horsemen, became considerably disturbed in his manner, looked back again, and became pale, as he said to the lady, [...] "That is Richard Varney's trotting gelding; I would know him among a thousand nags.
