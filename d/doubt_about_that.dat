5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had {{the biggest}} impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. If I were {{to look back and}} see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
500|$|The {{legacy of}} Rosewood {{remained}} in Levy County. For decades no black residents lived in Cedar Key or Sumner. Robin Raftis, the white {{editor of the}} Cedar Key Beacon, tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore's story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, [...] "Things happened {{out there in the}} woods. There's no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> How bad? We don't know... So I said, 'Okay guys, I'm opening the closet with the skeletons, because if we don't learn from mistakes, we're doomed to repeat them'." [...] Raftis received notes reading, [...] "We know how to get you and your kids. All it takes is a match".|$|E
500|$|Busch also commented, [...] "When Jeff Gordon {{has a good}} car and he's got the {{opportunity}} to beat you, he's going to beat you, there's no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> He's my hero and I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years, so it's no surprise that he beat us." [...] The race result left Kyle Busch leading the Driver's Championship with 80 points. Kurt Busch, who finished eighth, was second with 77, eight points ahead of Stewart and Allmendinger. Gordon was fifth with 65 points. Ford maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 12 points. Toyota and Chevrolet placed second and third with {{the same amount of}} points, four ahead of Dodge in fourth. 10.36 million people watched the race on television. The race took three hours, one minute and forty-nine seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.137 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{high level}} of {{awareness}} and organized political lobbying {{has resulted in a}} disproportionate level of funding and resources given to breast cancer research and care. Favoring breast cancer with disproportionate research may have the unintended consequence of costing lives elsewhere. In 2001 UK MP Ian Gibson said, [...] "The treatment has been skewed by the lobbying, there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Breast cancer sufferers get better treatment in terms of bed spaces, facilities and doctors and nurses".|$|E
2500|$|Judge Willis {{opened his}} {{judgment}} {{by stating that}} [...] "I do not consider myself bound by the opinion of either Mr. Chief Justice Forbes, Mr. Justice Burton, or Mr. Chief Justice Dowling in the present case." [...] He then noted {{that it was not}} disputed that the colonial courts had jurisdiction over crimes committed by Aboriginal people against the colonists, or vice versa, giving several examples of such cases. He also emphasised the duty of a judge, not only to fully exercise their jurisdiction, but also to refrain from doing so where there is reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|Faulkner and Randall {{explained}} {{the game was}} still utilizing the Omen Engine, with Faulkner saying of programming for the PlayStation 2 [...] "The PS2 is certainly good at pushing polys, no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> And the two vector processors can handle the physics and geometry we have with room to spare. The trick is the video memory, mainly. All of the cool visual features, like a high-res framebuffer, FSAA and high-res textures all {{take a lot of}} video memory. It's a real juggling act trying to get it to do all that at once." [...] Faulkner explained [...] "the PS2 math capabilities are like Intel's SSE, but on steroids. The math processors can be used to optimize any kind of math operations, which, in a 3D game, means a lot. So they will basically be used to speed up a lot of the 3D transformations and lighting." ...|$|E
50|$|The cowherd {{has his own}} <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{particular}} cow and {{he decided}} to have an eye on it. He allowed the other cows to graze and pursued that particular cow secretly. It went alone near a Vengai tree and stood beneath it. Milk began to flow from its udder automatically. He wondered at such a strangle sight and told about it to the other cowherds.|$|R
25|$|Elaine Paige was {{originally}} told she would re-create {{her role in}} the Broadway production, however, the Actors' Equity Association refused permission for a non-American. Prince attempted to persuade the organisation for a second time when LuPone was suffering vocal problems before the production reached New York. Lupone stated in her memoir that this {{was nothing more than a}} rumour started by Prince himself to build publicity. She however had her own <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> being true.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne Shirley," [...] {{interrupted}} Marilla firmly, [...] "I {{never want}} to hear you talking in this fashion again. I've had my <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> imagination of yours right along, {{and if this is}} going to be the outcome of it, I won't countenance any such doings. You'll go right over to Barry's, and you'll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to you. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again." ...|$|R
2500|$|Compared {{to other}} {{diseases}} or other cancers, breast cancer receives a proportionately {{greater share of}} resources and attention. In 2001 MP Ian Gibson, chairman of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom all party group on cancer stated [...] "The treatment has been skewed by the lobbying, there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Breast cancer sufferers get better treatment in terms of bed spaces, facilities and doctors and nurses." [...] Breast cancer also receives significantly more media coverage than other, equally prevalent cancers, with a study by Prostate Coalition showing 2.6 breast cancer stories for each one covering cancer of the prostate. Ultimately there is a concern that favoring sufferers of breast cancer with disproportionate funding and research on their behalf may well be costing lives elsewhere. [...] Partly because of its relatively high prevalence and long-term survival rates, research is biased towards breast cancer. [...] Some subjects, such as cancer-related fatigue, have been studied little except in women with breast cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Beethoven was in Teplitz when {{he wrote}} this on Tuesday the 7th (no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that),</b> and Antonie Brentano was (as Beethoven knew very well) {{at the same time}} (for several weeks) in [...] "K" [...] (Karlsbad). From Teplitz to Karlsbad (ca. 100km), the post coach took just one day. Therefore, if it had been {{intended}} for Antonie, she would have received the Letter on Friday morning, the latest. If, however, Beethoven expected the addressee to receive the Letter not before Saturday (and [...] "probably") then she must have been two days away from Teplitz, or one more day from Karlsbad – in a westerly direction: the next bigger township is Eger , ca. 50km from Karlsbad (and Franzensbad another 10km away). Now it is established that Antonie is definitely ruled out, it helps to know that the Austrian Emperor was briefly in Franzensbad on 5 July 1812, and given the known fact that Josephine's first husband was a personal friend of the Emperor (to whom she went to ask for help, after becoming a widow), it makes sense to assume that she tried to meet him there (after her encounter with Beethoven on 3–4 July).|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before West Indies {{embarked}} {{on a tour of}} Australia in November to December 2009; senior players such as Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul returned to the squad, but Roach had sufficiently impressed selectors during the dispute that he retained his place. The West Indies lost the first Test in three days; Adrian Barath's century on debut and Roach's bowling performance were the main positives for the West Indies; in the opinion of former Australia captain Ian Chappell, Roach's bowling was [...] "exceptionally good" [...] but he lacked support from more senior bowlers. Although the West Indies drew the second Test, Roach (who was regularly bowling over [...] ) and Dwayne Bravo took the West Indies close to levelling the series {{on the final day of}} the match. Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, commended Roach for his control and accuracy and said [...] "Someone who is pretty short at that pace can get the ball to skid onto you pretty quickly off the wicket with not much bounce. We've played him pretty well here [...] The ball reverse-swung for them in both innings. He's a handful, there's no <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> He's someone who could play a fair bit of Test cricket for them in the future." [...] It was the opinion of Tony Cozier that in the absence of experienced fast bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards, Roach was the leader of the bowling attack in Australia. Roach, who was fastest of the West Indies' bowling line-up, troubled the Australian batsmen with his pace through the series, and a rivalry emerged between Roach and Ponting. In the first innings of the third and final Test, Roach struck Ponting on the elbow, who was forced to retire hurt. However, he was forced to bowl into the wind, which surprised Australian batsmen Shane Watson as it reduced Roach's pace.|$|E
6000|$|Ben had his <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> but {{resolved}} {{to do his}} best for her sake; so, when Master Thorny presently appeared, with a careless [...] "How are you, Ben?" [...] that young person answered respectfully,--"Very well, thank you," [...] though his nod was as condescending as his new master's; because he felt that a boy who could ride bareback and turn a double somersault in the air ought not to [...] "knuckle under" [...] to a fellow who had not {{the strength of a}} pussy-cat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] {{the little}} old gentleman continued. [...] "Now I knew Dr. Transome intimately, and he was, without the {{slightest}} doubt, a rare judge of old furniture. I wouldn't mind following him anywhere, or accepting his judgment about anything. He was very set upon not having anything in his house that was not genuine. Now under any other circumstances, mind you, I should have had my <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> suite, {{but if you can}} assure me that it came from Dr. Transome's house, why, there's no more to be said about it. I'm a bidder." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1967 Sodder {{went to the}} Houston area to {{investigate}} another tip. A woman there had written to the family, saying that Louis Sodder had revealed his true identity to her one night after having too much to drink. She believed that he and Maurice were both living in Texas somewhere. But Sodder and his son-in-law, Grover Paxton, were unable to speak with her. Police there were able to help them find the two men she had indicated, but they denied being the missing sons. Paxton said years later <b>that</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> denial lingered in Sodder's mind {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|R

50|$|In {{the season}} 4 premiere it is {{revealed}} that Ron Deutsch, the bald security {{officer at the}} mall, was a Red John operative who removed crucial evidence from the scene. Jane comes to believe the man he shot was not Red John, but Timothy Carter, a twisted business man who, with his equally twisted wife, Sally, had kidnapped a young woman Debbie Lupin, in whose search the couple cynically pretended to join. Jane tricks Sally into revealing the girl's location. Sally is arrested by Lisbon and taken into custody, not to be heard from again, as she commits suicide in jail. Jane convinces a jury that Carter was Red John and is acquitted, although Jane is already beginning to have <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
