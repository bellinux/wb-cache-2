5|$|In 756, Emperor Xuanzong {{was forced}} to flee the capital and abdicate. Du Fu, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> from the city, took his family {{to a place of}} safety and {{attempted}} to join the court of the new emperor (Suzong), but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang'an. In the autumn, his youngest son, Du Zongwu (Baby Bear), was born. Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria.|$|E
5|$|Laliberté {{sought out}} Gilles Ste-Croix as {{replacement}} for the artistic director position. Ste-Croix, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> from the company since 1985, agreed to return. The company went through more internal troubles, including a failed attempt to add Normand Latourelle as a third man to the partnership. This triumvirate lasted only six months before internal disagreements prompted Gauthier and Laliberté to buy out Latourelle. By the end of 1989, Cirque du Soleil was once again in a deficit.|$|E
5|$|Coexist is the 2012 second studio album by English indie pop {{band the}} xx. After {{a break from}} touring for their 2009 self-titled first album, the band members began to write songs {{individually}} before they recorded Coexist from November 2011 to May 2012. For the album, the xx drew on personal experiences for their songwriting, while their music {{was influenced by the}} electronic dance scene that occurred when they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> on tour. The album was produced by the band's Jamie Smith, who had pursued electronic dance on other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album.|$|E

5|$|In his campaign, McCarthy {{attacked}} La Follette for not enlisting {{during the}} war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> {{fighting for his}} country. In fact, McCarthy had invested {{in the stock market}} himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.|$|E
5|$|The new Chief of Staff, General Malin Craig offered Eichelberger {{command of}} the 29th Infantry, the {{demonstration}} regiment based at Fort Benning, Georgia. Eichelberger turned this down, as he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> from the infantry for many years, and some infantry officers might be jealous. Instead, he accepted {{command of the}} 30th Infantry, a less prestigious unit stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, but there were still officers who resented someone attaining command of a regiment {{at the age of}} 52. Before departing, he took a brief course at the Infantry School at Fort Benning to reacquaint himself with the infantry. As part of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry took part in a series of major training exercises over the next two years.|$|E
5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted Henry. Waiting until the {{rebellion}} against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King {{but was unable to}} persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away,</b> however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E

5|$|His first post upon {{returning}} to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted {{for only a few}} months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s. In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from {{the fact that he did}} not speak French, at a time when the NFB's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> from the NFB for too long, while the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.|$|E
5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{employing}} {{a system that}} returned men by units, or by employment categories, {{it was decided to}} utilise an egalitarian system that saw men who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away</b> for the longest period of time being returned first. Due {{to the size of the}} forces deployed overseas—roughly 167, 000 personnel in France, Britain and Egypt—and the logistical requirements of bringing them home the process was nevertheless a lengthy one and as such it became important to occupy the troops while they waited. In order to achieve this and to prepare the men for a return to civilian employment, a vocational education scheme was set up by George Long and troops in Britain were offered educational courses and civilian work placement opportunities and although these programs were not as successful as hoped, several thousand soldiers took advantage of them.|$|E

5|$|Takanohana finally {{returned}} to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12–3, the 16th time {{he had been a}} tournament runner-up. Considering how long he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away,</b> it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence of the knee injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father spoke of his relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle through so many injuries. Takanohana's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taihō, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era.|$|E
5|$|While Skanderbeg <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>away,</b> a large Ottoman {{assault was}} made on Krujë from the Tirana side, but {{inadvertent}} friendly fire from the Turks forced them to call off the assault. The Ottomans then attempted to mine the fortress, but could not succeed, since the fortress had been built on rock. Since the food supplies were beginning to run out, the Turks received provisions from Venice, as did the Albanians. The Turkish attacks had made no headway and the Ottoman army had lost many dead or wounded, whereas Skanderbeg's force had lost 1,000 men thus far. Moisi Golemi and Tanush Thopia raised a couple thousand more and the force was split between the three, making attacks on the Turkish camp easier. Skanderbeg began to move towards the camp as the Turks had assembled 8,000 men which began to move towards him. Skanderbeg slowly retired, while Moisi and Tanush broke into the camp. The Turkish force sent against Skanderbeg was lured towards the foothills {{and the next morning}} (July 25) they were surrounded and completely destroyed. The next day, Skanderbeg was seen above the rocks of Krujë, in conference with Vrana Konti, surprising Murad.|$|E
