25|$|Development {{continued}} in the US as well during the 1930s and mid-1930, the first inverting image intensifier was developed at RCA. This tube used an electrostatic inverter to focus an image from a spherical cathode onto a spherical screen. (The choice of spheres was to reduce off-axial aberrations.) Subsequent development of this technology led directly to the first Generation 0 image intensifiers which were used by the military during World War II to allow vision at night with <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting</b> for both shooting and personal night vision. The first military night vision device were introduced by the German army as early as 1939, developed since 1935. Early night vision devices based on these technologies were used by both sides in World War II. However, the downside of active night vision (when infrared light is used) {{is that it is}} quite obvious to anyone else using the technology.|$|E

50|$|There {{are mainly}} three methods to melt the solder: hot air, <b>infrared</b> <b>light,</b> and steam-phasing. The <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> {{technology}} {{works with a}} focused <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> beam onto a specific integrated circuit and is used for small chips.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an optical}} imaging modality introduced in 1991 [1] that performs high-resolution, cross-sectional, subsurface tomographic imaging {{of the internal}} microstructure in materials and biologic systems by measuring backscattered or backreflected <b>infrared</b> <b>light.</b> The physical principle of OCT {{is similar to that}} of B-mode ultrasound imaging, except that the intensity of <b>infrared</b> <b>light,</b> rather than sound waves, is measured. Wavelenghts of the <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> used in OCT are one to two orders of magnitude higher than ultrasound wavelenght, so OCT technology can yield a lateral and axial spatial resolution of about 1...|$|R

In these studies, an <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> is projected on the theater screen to contaminate the video content of the recaptured videos. Furthermore, the real-time warning system is provided using reflected <b>infrared</b> <b>light.</b> However, a significant installation cost is required and the <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> is blocked by IR-cut or IR-absorb filters inside digital camcorders. Furthermore, the real-time warning system suffered from poor detection results when the pirate was positioned in a diagonal (5 °) seat.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{heart rate}} {{monitors}} usually comprise two elements: a chest strap transmitter [...] and a wrist receiver (which usually {{doubles as a}} watch) or mobile phone. In early plastic straps, water or liquid was required to get good performance. Later units have used conductive smart fabric with built-in microprocessors that analyze the EKG signal to determine heart rate. More recent devices utilise optics to measure heart rate using <b>Infrared</b> <b>light.</b> This is achieved by production of <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> by an internal bulb, as <b>Infrared</b> <b>light</b> is absorbed by the blood, a sensor measures the amount that the <b>infrared</b> <b>light</b> is darkened by. If it is significantly darker, due the pulse causing a temporary increase {{in the amount of}} blood that is travelling through the measured area, that is counted as a heart pulse.|$|R

The Raptor Resource Project installed and runs the live stream for research purposes.-Filmed in real time, the parents can be seen delivering a variety of freshly caught prey, feeding the eaglets, and protecting them from predators and harsh weather.

While our research is still in the preliminary stages, it shows promise of being able to detect several different activities and in the future might prevent several falls from taking place. I...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} fractoluminescence in scintillating crystals {{used for}} particle detection, {{we have developed}} a multi-channel setup built around samples of double-cleavage drilled compression (DCDC) geometry in a controllable atmosphere. The setup allows the continuous digitization over hours of various parameters, including the applied load, and the compressive strain of the sample, {{as well as the}} acoustic emission. Emitted visible light is recorded with nanosecond resolution, and crack propagation is monitored using <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting</b> and camera.

40|$|We {{present a}} system that {{visually}} monitors {{the face of a}} driver and finds the location of the driver's eyes in real time. Eye detection and tracking has mostly been implemented for laboratory or simulator settings and often with special <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting.</b> Our system in- stead addresses the actual environment within the in- terior of a moving car and uses a consumer CCD camera mounted on the dashboard in front of the driver. We developed an eye detection method that is based on segmenting the head space from the image and then using edge detection, template matching, for which eye templates are created online, and brightness filters to obtain the location of the eyes within the head space...|$|E
40|$|There are {{few options}} for obtaining {{information}} on intra- and inter-species behavioural interactions between marine animals other than direct observation. Underwater video and <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting</b> {{can be used}} to overcome some of the biases and limitations associated with diver observations. We outline the assembly and application of a multi-camera underwater video system consisting largely of moderately priced components produced for the security surveillance industry. Signals from up to eight cameras on the seafloor are processed on a floating pontoon into a single video stream and transmitted to a remote monitoring station for viewing or recording. High-red and infrared lights are used for night viewing to minimise disturbance. Experiments incorporating this system have provided high-quality data on predation and behaviour of lobsters...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for developers of new human-computer interfaces {{is to provide a}} more natural way of interacting with computer systems, avoiding excessive use of hand and finger movements. In this way, also a valuable alternative communication pathway is provided to people suffering from motor disabilities. This paper describes the construction of a low cost eye tracker using a fixed head setup. Therefore a webcam, laptop and an <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting</b> source were used together with a simple frame to fix the head of the user. Furthermore, detailed information on the various image processing techniques used for filtering the centre of the pupil and different methods to calculate the point of gaze are discussed. An overall accuracy of 1. 5 degrees was obtained while keeping the hardware cost of the device below 100 euros...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for activity state recognition implemented on {{data collected from}} various sensors-standard web cameras under normal illumination, web cameras using <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting,</b> and the inexpensive Microsoft Kinect camera system. Sensors such as the Kinect ensure that activity segmentation is possible during the daytime as well as night. This is especially useful for activity monitoring of older adults since falls are more prevalent at night than during the day. This paper is an application of fuzzy set techniques to a new domain. The approach described herein is capable of accurately detecting several different activity states related to fall detection and fall risk assessment including sitting, being upright, and being {{on the floor to}} ensure that elderly residents get the help they need quickly in case of emergencies and ultimately to help prevent such emergencies...|$|E
40|$|The auto-focusing {{method is}} {{described}} in this article based on image processing technology, and of an automatic iris image acquisition system is designed by the application of the principles. By using <b>infrared</b> <b>lighting,</b> the camera lens moving is control by computer, and in the human eye images are constantly collected in the process. First, the iris region is positioned in each image, and on the contrast of the area, we determines whether the iris image is a clear. By auto-focus, the captured image is used finally for identifying. Experiments proved that auto-focus is more accurate, iris images are captured with high contrast, and its texture features are rich significantly, and the requirements of subsequent processing and use are meet. Focusing mechanism is relatively simple, easy to implement the control system. It is applied to medical diagnostics to good effect...|$|E
