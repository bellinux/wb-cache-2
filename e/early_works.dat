5|$|All of Godwin's {{books written}} from 1970 to 1990 are fictional stories based on themes taken from Godwin's life. Her <b>early</b> <b>works</b> focus on women {{hoping for a}} {{relationship}} with a male companion, {{but at the same time}} wanting independence and freedom. The main protagonist is often restricted by family, tradition and patriarchy. Most of Godwin's <b>early</b> <b>works</b> include a prominent mother-daughter relationship as well.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His <b>early</b> <b>works</b> are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his <b>early</b> <b>works,</b> to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Delaroche's <b>early</b> <b>works</b> {{had been}} based on topics from the Bible's Old Testament, but {{gradually}} his interests switched to painting scenes from English and French history. He 'combined colouristic skill {{with an interest in}} detailed scenes from history'.Bonaparte Crossing the Alps, which was painted roughly eight years before Delaroche's death, exemplifies this phase in Delaroche's career.|$|E

40|$|Recently, state {{agencies}} have been successfully implementing construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) delivery on highway projects. While <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging is frequently cited in the literature as a primary benefit of CM/GC, there is limited to substantiate or refute these benefits. Additionally, agencies need {{a better understanding of}} the current state-of-practice of <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packing in CM/GC to help with effective implementation. In an ongoing Federal Highway Agency research project, 12 of 34 completed CM/GC projects reported the use <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging, and will be the focus of this study. Research methods used within this paper include: literature review, content review of agency manuals/instructions, project surveys, agency interviews, and case studies. Triangulated findings suggest that <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging can contribute to expediting project completion, mitigating project risks, reducing project cost, and minimizing public impacts. To achieve these outcomes, agencies must perform detailed planning to generate severable/independent packages that take into account all potential impacts to the project. Trends in data indicate that <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packages can lead to cost savings, yet the sample size does not provide statistical significance. Future research should explore the performance of a larger data set of CM/GC projects with and without <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packaging along with a cost/benefit analysis of <b>early</b> <b>work</b> packages...|$|R

5|$|Johnson {{began his}} {{literary}} {{career as a}} minor Grub Street hack writer, but {{he went on to}} make lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, novelist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer. His <b>early</b> <b>works,</b> especially London and Life of Mr Richard Savage, contain Johnson's emerging views on biography, morality, and literature in general.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, Amir's <b>early</b> <b>works</b> {{are quite}} {{different}} from his later ones. The works compiled in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different rhythm. Though these <b>early</b> <b>works</b> were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (tears), as well as words such as cinta (love), asmara (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E

5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} these <b>early</b> <b>works</b> is Monteverdi's use of {{the technique}} of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the first}} {{gramophone}} disc recordings of The Rite were issued in 1929, Stravinsky {{had helped to}} produce a pianola version of the work for the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his <b>early</b> <b>works</b> were reproduced on this medium. The Pleyel version of The Rite of Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, Johnson {{attended}} Pembroke College, Oxford, {{for just}} over a year, but a lack of funds forced him to leave. After working as a teacher, he moved to London, where he began to write for The Gentleman's Magazine. His <b>early</b> <b>works</b> include the biography Life of Mr Richard Savage, the poems London and The Vanity of Human Wishes, and the play Irene.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's <b>early</b> <b>works</b> display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Lutosławski studied {{piano and}} {{composition}} in Warsaw. His <b>early</b> <b>works</b> {{were influenced by}} Polish folk music. His style demonstrates {{a wide range of}} rich atmospheric textures. He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s. His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building harmonies from small groups of musical intervals. It also uses aleatoric processes, in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance.|$|E
5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean {{literature}} was to be pivotal. Cho's <b>early</b> <b>works</b> Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) would point out the direction that North Korean literature was about to take. These works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's <b>early</b> <b>works</b> {{and early}} life have been {{neglected}} topics within Johnson scholarship. As a result, he is primarily {{known for the}} events surrounding his later life and later works like A Dictionary of the English Language. This imbalance originates in the failure of James Boswell, Johnson's friend and companion, to discuss in great detail Johnson's childhood {{and the beginning of}} his career within the Life of Samuel Johnson, the most famous biography on Johnson. In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's early politics and political writings which show a concern with Sir Robert Walpole's political administration.|$|E

It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's <b>early</b> <b>works,</b> it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
