5000|$|John Peter McAllister (Lee Van Cleef): Veteran of World War II and the Korean War {{who stayed}} in Japan {{and became the}} first Occidental ninja. Trained Okasa in the ninja arts. Took on Max Keller as his student upon {{arriving}} in America. A self-described [...] "cantankerous old man who's lived alone a lot of years." [...] He is a stern but fair teacher, and a skilled fighter, though his age is catching up with him. Often grumpy and sarcastic towards other men, both friend and foe, but somewhat more mellow around Max, and politely flirtatious or self-consciously [...] "charming" [...] towards women. Several pieces of his colorful history come out during the series: he flew P-40s during WWII ("Hostages", [...] "Juggernaut"), visited New York in 1938 ("The Good, the Bad and the Priceless"), and attended a sort of conference of secret assassin organizations in the Far East in 1972, where he gave a martial arts demonstration ("The Good, the Bad, and the Priceless"). He met Brian <b>Elkwood</b> in Washington DC in 1948, and the two men were subsequently imprisoned together in North Korea, but escaped by using a motorcycle ("Kunoichi"). He has apparently visited Hawaii about twenty years ago: a friend who lives there has a daughter Max's age, whom McAllister remembers seeing when she was a baby ("Java Tiger"). He denies having filmed westerns in Almeria, Spain with actor Saul Robbins c. 1969 ("Rogues"), but his reactions to Robbins's claim to remember him seem to suggest otherwise-he was perhaps on some kind of secret mission for which the movie project(s) made a good cover. He [...] "always wanted to be a cowboy" [...] ("High Rollers"), but makes not wanting to dress up as one an excuse to turn down an ad exec who wants McAllister to shill for him ("The Good, the Bad, and the Priceless"). There are several recurring trains of thought that show up in his conversation, e.g. Eastern mysticism, but the closest thing he has to a catchphrase is probably [...] "no kidding", said in an exasperated tone to people's more obvious statements.|$|E
