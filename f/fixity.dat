5|$|In the 1850s, some tenant farmers formed {{associations}} {{to demand}} the three Fs: fair rent, <b>fixity</b> of tenure, and free sale. In the 1870s, the Fenians tried to organise the tenant farmers in County Mayo to resist eviction.

5|$|In 1880, {{as part of}} its {{campaign}} for the Three Fs (fair rent, <b>fixity</b> of tenure, and free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on LordErne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the <b>fixity</b> of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E

In particular, the distinction between place {{as the source of}} the centre's power and space as the scene of operation of various tactics of resistance to that power is deployed to demonstrate that place and space are actually mobile concepts that highlight the relational and situated character of such supposedly fixed binaries as mobile and permanently resident {{on the one hand and}} rural and urban on the other. This conceptual fluidity and mobility are both useful and crucial in understanding the life-worlds of migratory workers such as circus performers and show people and more broadly in engaging with rural mobilities, <b>fixities</b> and inequalities, in Australia and elsewhere. ...|$|R

5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers. The Taoist tradition of Chinese alchemy, for example, can be {{considered part of the}} life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the elixir of life). The system of classical Chinese medicine usually revolved around the theory of yin and yang, and the five phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the <b>fixity</b> of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E

5|$|The biogeographical {{patterns}} Charles Darwin {{observed in}} places such as the Galápagos Islands during the second voyage of HMS Beagle caused him to doubt the <b>fixity</b> of species, and in 1837 Darwin started {{the first of a series}} of secret notebooks on transmutation. Darwin's observations led him to view transmutation as a process of divergence and branching, rather than the ladder-like progression envisioned by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and others. In 1838 he read the new 6th edition of An Essay on the Principle of Population, written in the late 18th century by Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus' idea of population growth leading to a struggle for survival combined with Darwin's knowledge on how breeders selected traits, led to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin did not publish his ideas on evolution for 20 years. However, he did share them with certain other naturalists and friends, starting with Joseph Dalton Hooker, with whom he discussed his unpublished 1844 essay on natural selection. During this period he used the time he could spare from his other scientific work to slowly refine his ideas and, aware of the intense controversy around transmutation, amass evidence to support them. In September 1854 he began full-time work on writing his book on natural selection.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent {{work within}} mobilities studies has {{pointed to the}} ways in which {{mobility}} shapes people's identities and everyday lives. Mobility is also inherently geographical in nature, not only in the sense that movements of people and objects transcend space but that the ubiquity of mobility within society raises important questions about the <b>fixities</b> of place. Much of the recent geographical scholarship on mobilities has focused on the city, with ‘the urban’ constructed as the archetypal space of hyper-mobility. Less attention has been given to mobilities in the context of rural spaces and places. In this paper, we suggest that mobility represents an equally important constituent of rural lifestyles and rural places. Our contention is that the stabilities of rurality, associated with senses of belonging, tradition and stasis, are both reliant on and undermined by rather complex forms of mobility. We draw on empirical materials from a recent community study in rural Wales to reveal the nature of these mobilities, including the diverse range of movements of people to, from and through rural places, the difficulties associated with practising everyday mobilities in rural settings, the increasing significance of virtual forms of mobility associated with the roll-out of digital technologies across rural spaces, and the complicated relationship between rural mobilities, immobilities and <b>fixities...</b>|$|R

The claim that phallometry on men was the reason for decriminalization of homosexual behavior in Czechoslovakia is contradicted by the fact that it applied to women as well, as the notion of a male-specific <b>fixity</b> of sexual orientation as an argument for gay rights combined with the notion of female sexual plasticity is adverse to lesbian rights.|$|E

500|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{regards the}} trio {{as the three}} eyes of Shiva. Devasena and Valli are representations of kriya shakti (the power of action) and Iccha-shakti (will-power) respectively; while their Lord Kartikeya is the third eye, {{the symbol of the}} transcendental jnana-shakti (the power of knowledge). In Tamil literature, two kinds of love are mentioned: karpu ("chastity"), love bound in the traditional marriage, represented by Devasena and kalavu, love before marriage, conveyed by Valli. Devasena represents [...] "the conventional, control, ritualized approach to worship" [...] God, while Valli is worship through [...] "ecstasy and self-abandonment". Devasena is the epitome of chastity and purity. In trinity of gunas, she is the middle guna – Rajas, symbolizing [...] "rulership, <b>fixity,</b> and stability". Kartikeya is the most superior Sattva (pure), while Valli is the inferior tamas (dark).|$|E
500|$|His {{work with}} {{electronic}} music and its utter <b>fixity</b> {{led him to}} explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers' individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance (e.g., hall acoustics) may determine certain aspects of a composition.

40|$|Territory {{has to be}} interpreted. It is {{not enough}} {{to use it as a}} {{variable}} in descriptions of differences in economic structures. The major question regarding territory concerns the attempt to understand the origins of economic processes, namely why they started in one particular place and not elsewhere. The answer implies an epistemology of territory. Proximity – and the relational behaviours and cognitive practices that this creates – has an ontological nature. Contrary to other visions, this paper does not claim that the link between fluxes and <b>fixities</b> is sufficient to provide an understanding of spatial structures. Certain structural tensions exist and territories are part of them. Territories are not derivations or byproducts of an imminent order. Societies are polymorphic. The relational orders represented by territories are important in capturing the morphology of power in contemporary societies...|$|R

Making meaningful reference within constative discourse is a thoroughly historical skill. What we predicate - about what is thus referred to - is likewise historical. Margolis argues that the struggle to entrench changelessness either in human thought or human nature or physical nature has, in large part, been a futile struggle against acknowledging the lack of any fixed-kind nature of the human being. It is futile, Margolis claims, in that we have no natures but are histories. Nevertheless, Margolis admits that there are enough man-made would-be stabilities and <b>fixities</b> to go round. There is the habituating weight of the customary, the slow change in human languages, the inertia of institutions.|$|R
500|$|The unequal {{concentration}} of land ownership remained an emotional subject and {{eventually became a}} cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The politically powerless poor crofters embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian revival after 1800 and the breakaway [...] "Free Church" [...] after 1843. This evangelical movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. The religious change energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords; it helped prepare them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the Highland Land League. Violence began on the Isle of Skye when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks. It was quieted when the government stepped in passing the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 to reduce rents, guarantee <b>fixity</b> of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless. In 1885 three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, which listened to their pleas. The results included explicit security for the Scottish smallholders; {{the legal right to}} bequeath tenancies to descendants; and creating a Crofting Commission. The Crofters as a political movement faded away by 1892, and the Liberal Party gained most of their votes.|$|E
500|$|Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer {{note how}} Cordelia {{is also a}} subversive {{representation}} of feminine stereotypes, describing [...] "Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to {{the stereotype of the}} insensitive bitch", what she actually does is [...] "offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion". One of Cordelia's strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in [...] "Earshot", where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, [...] "her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical" [...] and because of this she embodies an [...] "antithesis of female self-sacrifice" [...] in these years but also [...] "the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women". Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia's [...] "lack of depth" [...] becoming [...] "her strength". She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid however, pointing out [...] "Cordy's solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a <b>fixity</b> of purpose that makes her almost invincible."

500|$|Later in the 18th century, the French philosopher Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of {{the leading}} naturalists of the time, {{suggested}} that what most people referred to as species were really just well-marked varieties, modified from an original form by environmental factors. For example, he believed that lions, tigers, leopards and house cats might all have a common ancestor. He further speculated that the 200 or so species of mammals then known might have descended from as few as 38 original animal forms. Buffon's evolutionary ideas were limited; he believed each of the original forms had arisen through spontaneous generation and that each was shaped by [...] "internal moulds" [...] that limited the amount of change. Buffon's works, Histoire naturelle (1749–1789) and Époques de la nature (1778), containing well-developed theories about a completely materialistic origin for the Earth and his ideas questioning the <b>fixity</b> of species, were extremely influential. Another French philosopher, Denis Diderot, also wrote that living things might have first arisen through spontaneous generation, and that species were always changing through a constant process of experiment where new forms arose and survived or not based on trial and error; an idea that can be considered a partial anticipation of natural selection. Between 1767 and 1792, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, included in his writings not only the concept that man had descended from primates, but also that, in response to the environment, creatures had found methods of transforming their characteristics over long time intervals. Charles Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, published Zoonomia (1794–1796) which suggested that [...] "all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament." [...] In his poem Temple of Nature (1803), he described the rise of life from minute organisms living in mud to all of its modern diversity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the problematic of embodied resistance to biometric surveillance practices. After establishing that surveillance {{is becoming more}} widespread, the paper draws on the multidisciplinary areas of organization theory, surveillance theory, and body and feminist sociology. It is argued that current theoretical resources available to organization theorists are inadequate for analysing resistance to these technologies. After an investigation of recent developments in the sociology {{of the body and}} in surveillance theory, resistance is conceptualized at the interface of bodies and technologies, and is antagonistic towards categorizations and <b>fixities</b> produced by biometrics. A number of resistance strategies are distilled, using feminist and post-structuralist sociology. Although it is acknowledged that the paper’s arguments do not address questions of agency and an ethics of the self, resistance arguments that challenge the totalizing impulse of surveillance practice are welcome in the face of government and private sector rhetoric about its desirability...|$|R
40|$|The {{classification}} of flag-transitive generalised quadrangles is a long-standing open {{problem at the}} interface of finite geometry and permutation group theory. Given that all known flag-transitive generalised quadrangles are also point-primitive (up to point-line duality), it is likewise natural to seek a {{classification of}} the point-primitive examples. Working towards this aim, we are led to investigate generalised quadrangles that admit a collineation group $G$ preserving a Cartesian product decomposition of the set of points. It is shown that, under a generic assumption on $G$, the number of factors of such a Cartesian product can be at most four. This result is then used to treat various types of primitive and quasiprimitive point actions. In particular, it is shown that $G$ cannot have holomorph compound O'Nan-Scott type. Our arguments also pose purely group-theoretic questions about conjugacy classes in non-Abelian finite simple groups, and about <b>fixities</b> of primitive permutation groups...|$|R
