Some of them share post-conflict experience and lack {{economic and political}} resources. The main challenge is faced on {{the enforcement of the}} rule of law which has a direct influence on the enhancement of the civil liberties within each country. Insofar taking into consideration the EU engagement in the region I will ask how does the Enlargement process, through political conditionality, influence the enhancing of democratization in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo? I answer the following question through this argument that, although EU strength coercive pressure through Conditionality regarding the enforcement of Rule of Law and enhance of civil liberties, democratization in post-conflict countries of SEE, stagnate. In this paper, first I analyze a background of democratization, from the EU <b>enlargement</b> <b>perspective.</b> Than on the second part I analyze the EU conditionality toward the enforcement {{of the rule of law}} and enhance of civil liberties on the two case studies. In the third part, a comparative analysis between the cases will prove the above assumption that this paper argue...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the process of {{establishment}} of a new Regional Electricity Market in South East Europe. This is an example of an intra-regional cooperation between the countries from the Western Balkans. In addition, the differences between this regional energy market and other Electricity Regional Initiatives in Europe up to date will be underlined, having in mind that the ultimate objective is that SEE REM shall be integrated into the internal energy market of the EU. So far, the regional initiatives covering the SEE countries in other fields have been characterized with a limited success {{due to the fact that}} most of these regional initiatives were initiated by external actors and a genuine will for cooperation between the SEE countries was missing in cases when an external incentive was lacking behind. Nevertheless, as it could be incurred from the existing successful REMs in other parts of Europe, the political will and dedication of the market players is essential for an effective integration of the national electricity markets. Even though the SEE REM was initiated as an idea of the EU and the Stability Pact, the development of the SEE REM in the framework of the Energy Community has been impressive in the short period of its existence. Despite the many remaining open issues before its effective functioning and integration with the other REMs in Europe, many steps and great reforms have been undertaken in electricity markets of the SEE countries at national but also at cross-border level. The clear <b>enlargement</b> <b>perspective</b> of the countries involved was the main incentive for reforms of the national electricity markets in SEE and for the establishment of the Energy Community. Therefore, this regional initiative is being transformed into regional cooperation seen more as an 'open regionalism' achieved from within the region and with regionally owned institutions and solutions for solving the regional problems. That is where the positive expectations for a success of the regional initiative between the SEE countries in the energy field, come from and that is why this article argues that the Energy Community is a positive example of a regional initiative for the SEE countries.

40|$|The European {{integration}} {{process has been}} characterized by a growing interest for the territorial dimension of community policies. During the last 20 years, the EU elaborated several attempts to correct the growing territorial disequilibria caused by its achievements {{in terms of economic}} integration. The discourse underlying EU territorial interventions and the set of tools and actions explicitly or implicitly focusing on territorial goals is usually referred at as European spatial planning. At the same time, the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 produced a radical change in the perspective of future European integration. The European Council held in Copenhagen in 1993 officially opened a process that in some ten years would have granted the EU membership to ten post-socialist Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia Bulgaria e Romania). Whereas the simultaneous accession of such an heterogeneous group of nations represents a new chance in terms of widening and deepening of European integration, it also represent the hardest challenge faced by the EU throughout its history. The territorial impact of the enlargement appears particularly relevant, with 92 % {{of the population of the}} new member states leaving in regions with a GDP per capita lower than the 75 % of EU average. The described emergencies represented as many potential threat for the process of European integration, leading the European Commission to produce a set of document analyzing the territorial impact of the future enlargement, and to introduce specific tools to support candidate countries' road towards EU membership. For similar reasons, also the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP), by the most defined the proudest achievement of European spatial planning, highlighted the importance to consider CEECs' peculiar reality within the future cohesion policy. The same is true for EU's latest document of territorial guidance, the Territorial Agenda. While at the supranational level the described confrontation was going on, the candidate countries were busy with the complex transition from central economic planning to market economy, having at the same time to deal with the completion of accession requirements and the transposition of the acquis communautaire. Within such a highly fluid institutional environment, new spatial planning systems had to be built, in order to deal with the challenges of the new market-friendly reality. This PhD thesis elaborates on the above considerations, building on the assumptions that the process of European integration under way has led to the development of peculiar institutions and functioning mechanism that involve the different territorial layers within a complex framework of multi-level governance, generating processes of reciprocal contamination and adaptation going under the label Europeanization. Said that, the work explores the characteristic of European territorial governance in the eastward enlargement of the EU. The scientific community is still looking for a shared definition of European territorial governance, mainly due to the different impact of the European dimension on member states' spatial planning systems. In this light, the present dissertation contributes to the debate analyzing, on the one hand, the role of the EU in the evolution of spatial planning systems in the four candidate country of the Visegrad group, on the other hand, the influence of the new challenges of the enlarged European Union on the redefinition of European spatial planning. Looking at European territorial governance from the eastwards enlargement led to interesting findings on the mechanism that stands behind Europeanization. It suggests how the process of reciprocal contamination between European and domestic context were shaped, on the one hand, by CEECs' specific starting conditions, on the other hand, by the highly asymmetric power relations between the different actors attending the accession negotiations. As the candidate countries undertook a radical process of internal restructuring in order to satisfy accession requirements, at the same time the EU had to face its future enlarged configuration and the important territorial challenges coming along with it. The different dimensions of European spatial planning were challenged by the <b>enlargement</b> <b>perspective,</b> and revisited through a process of combined economic rationality and political decision-making. The findings of the research shows how the enlargement influenced the evolution of European territorial policy, leading to the introduction of specific pre-accession instruments directly tackling territorial challenges in candidate countries and to the extension of existing structural programming to Central and eastern Europe. The evolution of European spatial planning tools notwithstanding, several studies shows how, whereas EU interventions produced economic convergence between the different member states, at the same time they led to a widening of internal disparities, especially within the new member states, that may eventually lead to the consolidation of a two-speeds European scenario. This may be explained if one considers that present European spatial policy is still underpinned by approached and metaphors developed during the 1980 s and 1990 s by a north-western rooted epistemic community, that have become outdated and require to be revised taking account the new European reality. Within the scarcely institutionalized scenario of European spatial planning, an important role in developing new spatial ideas and planning approaches is played by the European spatial planning epistemic community. In this concern, EU eastward enlargement constitute an un-precedent opportunity towards the integration of western- and eastern-European actors, whose successful seizing is a crucial step in the perspective of integrating both old and new member states' challenges and priorities within a coherent framework for future action. The above considerations suggest how European territorial governance has been strongly embedded in the characteristics of the enlargement. This outstanding political event opened several windows of opportunity, leading to the evolution of several policy fields at both EU and domestic levels as a result of the interaction between member states, candidate countries and European institutions. Whereas this appears immediate for those policy fields where the EU detains legitimate competences, the present thesis shows that also spatial planning hasn't been immune to the described Europeanization process. Hence, one can say that the enlargement process led to specific mechanism of Europeanization of spatial planning, on the one hand, laying down the pace of the reforms through a tight sequence of deadline and, on the other hand, embedding the interaction of the different actors in a complex network of power relations. Within the described framework, European territorial governance in the eastwards enlargement appears as a highly asymmetric field, reflecting the roles and power of member states, candidate countries and European institutions in the accession negotiation. The EU could count on candidates' will to obtain EU membership and to benefit from financial incentives in order to apply a "systematic pressure" on domestic reforms, promoting the adoption of specific rules and priorities through conditionality mechanisms. On the other hand the candidate countries exercised almost no influence on European spatial planning, the evolution of the latter being the result of a process occurred within decision-making arenas where they had few or no contractual power vis-à-vis existing member state...|$|E

Restoring parallelism to verticals (for instance) is easily done by tilting one plane, but if the focal length of the enlarger is not suitably chosen, the resulting image will have vertical distortion (compression or stretching). For correct perspective correction, the proper focal length (specifically, angle of view) must be chosen so that the <b>enlargement</b> replicates the <b>perspective</b> of the camera.|$|R

The analysis is embedded in a constructivist theoretical perspective. I will therefore examine the distinct identities of the West (for purposes of this work represented by the EU and NATO) and Russia.

Its main objectives are to define the politics in theory, to introduce {{it in the context of}} the Western Balkans and apply it to the three selected cases - Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia. The work considers the historical development since 1990 's as an important factor with a huge influence on current negotiation, and therefore the thesis pays high attention to that. Besides the historical excursion, the thesis deals with topics of political development, introduces the status of current negotiations and the relationship between the European Union and certain countries since the establishment of the first official contact. Through the comparative case study, despite differing positions of states within the framework of negotiations, it is highlighted that all countries share common problems. The method of compliance and non-compliance generates common problems as well as underlines the particular specifics. An important contribution is also the comparison of individual countries based on fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria in the context of current affairs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the economics}} of EU <b>enlargement</b> from three <b>perspectives.</b> First, we provide an institutional background and point out the importance of Agenda 2000. Second, we analyse the implications for EU trade with Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) and in particular we discuss the EU Antidumping legislation {{and its implications for}} trade integration between the EU and CEECs. Third, we engage in an analysis of the implications of economic integration for the EU labour market. To this end, we use a unique firm level survey of 281 Belgian firms. Our findings suggest that: (i) the EU follows a too restrictive approach to trade integration; (ii) economic integration with CEECs leads to a reduction in the demand for low-skilled labour in small firms; however, this effect is reversed for large firms...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the induction of collective time perceptions by EU institutional actors to implement politically and economically motivated long-term projects through internal and external communicative actions. Within the different cases and periods analysed, I will specifically explore the perspective of the European Commission in EU’s Eastward enlargement internal and external communication narratives from 1989 to 2004, the year of the actual enlargement project implementation. I have chosen to examine the question of the induction of forced transitional time perceptions in the process of <b>enlargement</b> from the <b>perspective</b> of European Commission actors because they assumed they were the self-appointed motor of the EU’s Eastward enlargement process. In sum, this paper aims at opening the debate on the issue of the relationship of change in history with the opposition between the determinism of rules presented as timeless in a constantly extended present and the consideration of new principles once the perspective of a different future is suddenly open...|$|R
40|$|The essays {{making up}} this thesis combine two {{important}} milestones in Turkey’s bid for global integration: Turkey’s prospective accession to the European Union (EU) and capital account liberalization. The first essay deals with possible economic consequences of Turkish accession to the EU, focusing on transfers {{as the cause}} of EU’s objection to admit Turkey and investigating whether the transfer may be a price worth paying for the European households. The idea presented here is that adherence to the Copenhagen criteria leads to an improvement in Turkish institutions, which in turn increases Turkish total factor productivity (TFP) in the model. We find that a TFP increase in Turkey enhances the utility of the households in the EU and therefore may compensate for the negative effect of the transfers. The second essay deals with the same issue in a dynamic general equilibrium setting. This time, we assess quantitatively whether, from the European <b>perspective,</b> <b>enlargement</b> of the EU to include Turkey is welfare enhancing. Finally, the third essay concerns the capital account liberalization experience of Turkey in order to account for the changes in the Turkish economy after the country’s opening to capital flows and analyses whether Turkish households are better off because of this opening up.

40|$|One of {{the most}} debated {{problems}} of the EU enlargement to the Central and Eastern European countries is the financing of the candidate countries. As they are much poorer and much more agricultural than the present EU members, they will be entitled to major financial transfers from the EU budget. Given the limited size of the EU budget, this will imply to redesign the current EU policies and financial transfers. The paper examines the framework (Agenda 2000 and the Berlin European Council) within which the present pre-accession and accession appropriations have been determined. Remarkable differences {{can be observed in}} the financial transfers to the current and future member States: however, given the Agenda 2000 accession hypothesis (first and second wave accessions), the estimated cost of eliminating this unequal treatment would be affordable under the current financial provisions. The recent change in the EU accession negotiation strategy opens the possibility that nearly all the candidate countries join the EU before 2006 : the additional financial burden could be sustained without changing the present Own Resources ceiling, provided a difference in treatment could be accepted between the EU incumbents and the new members. The paper finally presents the estimated costs of enlarging the EU to eight or ten new members, while granting them, under the current policy regime, a level of transfers comparable to what is granted to the poorer EU incumbents. budgetary costs of EU Eastern <b>enlargement,</b> EU financial <b>perspectives</b> 2000 - 2006. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the present paper is to {{consider}} the needs of <b>perspectives</b> <b>enlargement</b> of  the social paradigm of information by recognizing the information as a social construction with a dynamic and an argumentative nature. One of the main points of the discussion is {{the important role of}} information in the individual’s act of acquiring knowledge and in the development of citizenship by considering the access of information as a right of the citizen. In this direction, questions related to the possible contributions of the professional of information in the process of social and digital inclusion in Brazil are raised. So that, three challenges are pointed out for the professional performance {{in the context of an}} inclusive society: Distance Education, Social Networks and Cultural Actions. It is believed that the development of these challenges is essential in the contemporary society due to the following reasons, the constant use of technologies in providing  educational services, the appearance of a new concept for an understanding of complex systems of social organization and the importance culture has taken towards the structure and organization of the current society.  Objetiva refletir sobre a necessidade de ampliação das perspectivas do paradigma social da informação, reconhecendo a informação como uma construção social de natureza dinâmica e recontextualizável. Um dos pontos centrais da discussão é o importante papel da informação na conscientização do indivíduo e na construção da cidadania, sendo o acesso à informação um direito do cidadão. Nesse sentido, levantam-se questões referentes às possíveis contribuições do profissional da informação nos processos de inclusão social e digital do país. Para tanto, apontam-se três desafios na atuação deste profissional no contexto de uma sociedade inclusiva: educação a distância, redes sociais e ação cultural.
