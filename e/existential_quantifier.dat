Moreover, there {{is but one}} <b>existential</b> <b>quantifier,</b> in axiom 3. Axioms 1 and 2, together with an axiom schema of induction make up the usual Peano-Dedekind definition of N.

25|$|Any monadic Boolean algebra can be {{considered}} to be an interior algebra where the interior operator is the universal quantifier and the closure operator is the <b>existential</b> <b>quantifier.</b> The monadic Boolean algebras are then precisely the variety of interior algebras satisfying the identity xIC = xI. In other words, they are precisely the interior algebras in which every open element is closed or equivalently, in which every closed element is open. Moreover, such interior algebras are precisely the semisimple interior algebras. They are also the interior algebras corresponding to the modal logic S5, and so have also been called S5 algebras.|$|E
25|$|The set of free {{variables}} in a formula of Lκω can have any cardinality strictly less than κ, yet only finitely {{many of them}} can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another., and more generally only formulas with <nbsp&λ free {{variables in}} Lκλ. In other infinitary logics, a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers. For example, in Lκ∞, a single universal or <b>existential</b> <b>quantifier</b> may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously. Similarly, the logic Lκλ permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than λ variables, as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than κ.|$|E
25|$|Tableaux are {{extended}} to first order predicate logic by two rules {{for dealing with}} universal and <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers,</b> respectively.

25|$|Semantics is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that examines the meaning of natural language, the notion of reference and denotation, {{and the concept of}} possible worlds. One concept used in the study of semantics is predicate logic, which is a system that uses symbols and alphabet letters to represent the overall meaning of a sentence. Quantifiers in semantics – such as the quantifier in the antecedent of a bound variable pronoun – can be expressed in two ways. There is an <b>existential</b> <b>quantifier,</b> ∃, meaning some. There is also a universal quantifier, ∀, meaning every, each, or all. Ambiguity arises when there are multiple quantifiers in one sentence.|$|E

One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. Division by zero is, by definition, excluded. In order to avoid <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers,</b> fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two nullary operations (the constants [...] and [...] ).

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{quantified}} Horn formulas (QHORN) are investigated. We {{prove that}} {{the behavior of the}} <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers</b> depends only on the cases where at most one of the universally quantified variables is zero. Accordingly, we give a detailed characterization of QHORN satisfiability models which describe the set of satisfying truth assignments to the existential variables. We also consider quantified Horn formulas with free variables (QHORN*) and show that they have monotone equivalence models. The main application of these findings is that any quantified Horn formula Φ of length |Φ| with free variables, |∀| universal quantifiers and an arbitrary number of <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers</b> can be transformed into an equivalent quantified Horn formula of length O(|∀|·|Φ|) which contains only <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers.</b> We also obtain a new algorithm for solving the satisfiability problem for quantified Horn formulas with or without free variables in time O(|∀|·|Φ|) by transforming the input formula into a satisfiability-equivalent propositional formula. Moreover, we show that QHORN satisfiability models can be found with the same complexity...|$|R

40|$|First-order model {{counting}} emerged {{recently as}} a novel reasoning task, {{at the core of}} efficient algorithms for probabilistic logics. We present a Skolemization algorithm for model counting problems that eliminates <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers</b> from a first-order logic theory without changing its weighted model count. For certain subsets of first-order logic, lifted model counters were shown to run in time polynomial in the number of objects in the domain of discourse, where propositional model counters require exponential time. However, these guarantees apply only to Skolem normal form theories (i. e., no <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers)</b> as the presence of <b>existential</b> <b>quantifiers</b> reduces lifted model counters to propositional ones. Since textbook Skolemization is not sound for model counting, these restrictions precluded efficient model counting for directed models, such as probabilistic logic programs, which rely on existential quantification. Our Skolemization procedure extends the applicability of first-order model counters to these representations. Moreover, it simplifies the design of lifted model counting algorithms.
