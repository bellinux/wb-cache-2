The {{remarkable}} stoppage of electrolytic conduction by solidification (380. 1358.), {{is quite}} consistent with these {{views of the}} dependence of that process on the polarity which is common to all insulating matter when under induction, though attended by such peculiar electro-chemical results {{in the case of}} electrolytes. Thus it may be expected that the first effect of induction is so to polarize and arrange the particles of water that the positive or hydrogen pole of each shall be from the positive electrode and towards the negative electrode, whilst the negative or oxygen pole of each shall be in the contrary direction; and thus when the oxygen and hydrogen of a particle of water have separated, passing to and combining with other hydrogen and oxygen particles, unless these new particles of water could turn round they could not take up that position necessary for their successful <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polarization.</b> Now solidification, by fixing the water particles and preventing them from assuming that essential preliminary position, prevents also their electrolysis (413.); and so the transfer of forces in that manner being prevented (1347. 1703.), the substance acts as an ordinary insulating dielectric (for it is evident by former experiments (419. 1704.) that the insulating tension is higher than the electrolytic tension), induction through it rises to a higher degree, and the polar condition of the molecules as wholes, though greatly exalted, is still securely maintained.|$|E
40|$|The {{dielectric}} constants of some aliphatic and aromatic alcohols {{have been}} {{measured with a}} parallel resistance impedance bridge at temperatures from 5 ° to 60 ° over the frequency range of 0. 5 to 50 kilocycles/sec. The dielectric constants for all the alcohols used, except for methanol, were independ-ent of frequency within the present range, and agreed fairly well with the values by other investigators. Only methanol showed a frequency dependence of dielectric constant below the fre-quency of about 10 kilocycles/sec. This dependence {{may be attributed to}} the electrode surface `phenomena to be due to the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polarization</b> of proton which takes part in the electrical conduction...|$|E
40|$|Chitosan (CS) is a {{versatile}} biopolymer whose morphological and chemico-physical properties {{can be designed}} {{for a variety of}} biomedical applications. Taking advantage of its <b>electrolytic</b> nature, cathodic <b>polarization</b> allows CS deposition on electrically conductive substrates, resulting in thin porous structures with tunable morphology. Here we propose an easy method to obtain CS membranes with highly oriented micro-channels for tissue engineering applications, relying on simple control of process parameters and cathodic substrate geometry. Cathodic deposition was performed on two different aluminum grids in galvanostatic conditions at 6. 25 mA cm(- 2) from CS solution [1 g L(- 1) ] in acetic acid (pH 3. 5). Self-standing thin scaffolds were cross linked either with genipin or epichlorohydrin, weighted, and observed by optical and electron microscopy. Swelling properties at pH 5 and pH 7. 4 have been also investigated and tensile tests performed on swollen samples at room temperature. Finally, direct and indirect assays have been performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity at 24 and 72 h. Thin scaffolds with two different oriented porosities (1000 m and 500 m) have been successfully fabricated by electrochemical techniques. Both cross-linking agents did not affected the mechanical properties and cytocompatibility of the resulting structures. Depending on the pH, these structures show interesting swelling properties that can be exploited for drug delivery systems. Moreover, thanks to the possibility of controlling the porosity and the micro-channel orientation, they should be used for the regeneration of tissues requiring a preferential cells orientation, e. g., cardiac patches or ligament regeneration...|$|R
