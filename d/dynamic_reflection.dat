50|$|The {{somatosensory}} cortex {{representation of the}} hand is a <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflection</b> of the fingers on the external hand: in syndactyly people have a clubhand of webbed, shortened fingers. However, {{not only are the}} fingers of their hands fused, but the cortical maps of their individual fingers also form a club hand. The fingers can be surgically divided to make a more useful hand. Surgeons did this at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery in New York to a 32-year-old man with the initials O. G.. They touched O. G.’s fingers before and after surgery while using MRI brain scans. Before the surgery, the fingers mapped onto his brain were fused close together; afterward, the maps of his individual fingers did indeed separate and take the layout corresponding to a normal hand.|$|E

Early virtual modelling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space, mainly to produce technical drawings.

50|$|Basic {{environment}} mapping uses {{a static}} cube map - although the object {{can be moved}} and distorted, the reflected environment stays consistent. However, a cube map texture can be consistently updated to represent a dynamically changing environment (for example, trees swaying in the wind). A simple yet costly way to generate <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflections,</b> involves building the cube maps at runtime for every frame. Although this is far less efficient than static mapping because of additional rendering steps, it can still be performed at interactive rates.|$|R

But I can create a place by bringing about a passage between the photograph and the mirror: this place is whole time.”The previous quote enlightens the reader on Pistoletto's attempt to, in 1964 at the Galleria Sperone, work on bringing {{the meaning of the}} mirror out into the inhabited space surrounding it. The simultaneous representation of traditional dimensions and of reality in motion reveal the new dimensions of the mirror-paintings. [...] Sometimes the paintings on the mirrors are portraits of Pistoletto's friends, patrons and/or self-portraits: this is true for the artist's recent entirely mirrored-hall at the Ristorante del Cambio, Piazza Carignano, Turin.|$|E
5000|$|In Marxism, the dialectical {{method of}} {{historical}} study became intertwined with historical materialism, {{the school of}} thought exemplified by the works of Marx, Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. In the USSR, under Joseph Stalin, Marxist dialectics became [...] "diamat" [...] (short for dialectical materialism), a theory emphasizing {{the primacy of the}} material way of life; social [...] "praxis" [...] over all forms of social consciousness; and the secondary, dependent character of the [...] "ideal". The term [...] "dialectical materialism" [...] was coined by the 19th-century social theorist Joseph Dietzgen who used the theory to explain the nature of socialism and social development. The original populariser of Marxism in Russia, Georgi Plekhanov used the terms [...] "dialectical materialism" [...] and [...] "historical materialism" [...] interchangeably. For Lenin, the primary feature of Marx's [...] "dialectical materialism" [...] (Lenin's term) was its application of materialist philosophy to history and social sciences. Lenin's main input in the philosophy of dialectical materialism was his theory of reflection, which presented human consciousness as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflection</b> of the objective material world that fully shapes its contents and structure. Later, Stalin's works on the subject established a rigid and formalistic division of Marxist-Leninist theory in the dialectical materialism and historical materialism parts. While the first {{was supposed to be the}} key method and theory of the philosophy of nature, the second was the Soviet version of the philosophy of history.|$|E

In our previous study [1], we have shown simulation results for the separation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflections.</b> Here we further discuss this problem and show results of experimental data for separation of dynamic images. We also illustrate an application concerned with recovery of images acquired through a semi-transparent cloudy medium. This is a more complex problem in that the mixtures are not stationary in space, the mixing coefficients vary {{in the presence of}} clouds, and the mixtures involve also multiplicative and convolutive components. We apply the three-dimensional spatio-temporal Sparse ICA (SPICA) method on simulations of linearly mixed moving landscape, contaminated by the interference of clouds. We then incorporate a nonlinear multiplicative interaction and examine its effects on the SNR of the recovered image. We illustrate preliminary promising results. 1...|$|R

An immediate consequence is that these reflection probabilities are in fact the same, thus providing a short and transparent proof of the main result of Breuer, J., E. Ryckman, and B. Simon (2010).

40|$|A {{dominating}} {{paradigm in}} neuroscience attributes components of perception and behavior to synchronous spatio-temporal activities of subsets of neurons within neural networks – the so-called Synfire chains. Synfire chains cohere to generate neural cliques within the simultaneously active Synfires. The {{present study is}} concerned with blind separation of Synfire activities and identification of neural cliques. Assuming stationarity and, to a first approximation, linearity, we extend the Blind Source Separation (BSS) technique to the spatio-temporal domain, to deal with dynamic signals, and apply it on our analysis of neural networks. To demonstrate the concept of dynamic BSS, we first apply it in a relatively simple physical example of separation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflections.</b> In the latter case, the physics {{of the problem is}} well understood and the assumptions of linearity and stationarity are valid. In the case of neural networks, the problem is much more involved, and the assumptions of linearity and stationarity are not fully justified. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the basic approach yields interesting insight into the function of complex neural activity. To better approximate the function of neural activity, we also investigate the effect of non-linearities on blind separation of neural activity...|$|R
40|$|Object-oriented {{programming}} {{languages are}} excellent for expressing abstractions in many application domains. The object-oriented programming methodology allows real-world concepts to modelled {{in an easy}} and direct fashion and it supports refinement of concepts. However, many object-oriented languages and their implementations fall short in two areas: <b>dynamic</b> extensibility and <b>reflection.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> extensibility {{is the ability to}} incorporate new classes into an application at runtime. Reflection makes it possible for a language to extend its own domain, e. g., to built type-orthogonal functionality.

40|$|Since {{incorporating}} interindustry analysis into econometric framework was pioneered some 40 {{years ago}} (Glickman, 1977), {{there has been}} a growing number of studies in the literature on application of the integrated framework at the subnational level. The integrated models in the literature have appeared in different forms with respect to the strategy and the structure, through which input-output (IO) and econometric are merged. The objective of the integrated framework is to capitalize on the merits of both component models, namely, an exhaustive interindustry analysis and a <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflection</b> of economic variables. This paper presents an attempt to extend and apply the interindustry demand variable (IDV) technique to embed an IO analysis into a time-series model to investigate the Illawarra economy. The result is a dynamic intersectoral model that not only represents structural changes in the regional economy, but also provides high accuracy, in forecasting total employment and output...|$|E

40|$|Situation Awareness {{can offer}} the {{potential}} for conscious <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflection.</b> In an era of online health data sharing, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important that users of health social networks (HSNs) have the information necessary to make informed decisions as part of the registration process and in the provision of eConsent. This research aims to leverage an adapted Situation Awareness (SA) model to explore users’ decision making processes in the provision of eConsent. PatientsLikeMe - HSN platform was used to investigate these behaviours. A mixed methods approach was taken. This involved the observation of registration behaviours followed by a questionnaire and focus group/s. Early results suggest that users are apt to automatically accept eConsent, and only later consider the long-term implications of sharing their personal health information. Further steps are required to continue developing knowledge and understanding of this important eConsent process. The next step in this research will be to develop a set of guidelines for the improved presentation of eConsent on the HSN platform...|$|E

High-speed schlieren images from tests with gradual, but dynamic wedge pitch are included. Flow field images are captured with a Photron Ultima APX-RS high-speed camera at 250 fps. Tests were conducted at Mach 1. 9 and Mach 3. 0 free stream conditions in a supersonic wind tunnel. The high-speed imaging enabled the accurate determination of the point of transition between regular and Mach reflection. The wedge incidence for which the shock system is swallowed and disgorged was also measured during these tests...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the phase diagram of branching annihilating random walks with {{one and two}} offsprings in one dimension. A walker can hop to a nearest neighbor site or branch {{with one or two}} offsprings with relative ratio. Two walkers annihilate immediately when they meet. In general, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition from an active state into the absorbing state (vacuum) at a finite hopping probability. We map out the phase diagram by Monte Carlo simulations which shows a reentrant phase transition from vacuum to an active state and finally into vacuum again as the relative rate of the two-offspring branching process increases. This reentrant property apparently contradicts the conventional wisdom that increasing the number of offsprings will tend to make the system more active. We show that the reentrant property is due to the static reflection symmetry of two-offspring branching processes and the conventional wisdom is recovered when the <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflection</b> symmetry is introduced instead of the static one.

40|$|Abstract: Various time- and space-resolved spectroscopies {{have been}} {{developed}} and applied to thin films and nanoparticles. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>reflection</b> spectroscopies of total internal, diffuse, and regular reflection modes analyze photophysical and photochemical processes at the interface/surface layers with thicknesses of a few tens to a few hundreds of nm and of optically scattering materials. The excited singlet, triplet, and ionic states are identified, and intersystem crossing, isomerization, electron transfer and recombination, and photothermal conversion due to excited-state annihilation are analyzed, just as by transmittance mode spectroscopy. Fluorescence and Rayleigh light-scattering spectroscopies are developed for elucidating excited-state dynamics of single nanoparticles. The optical properties are related to their size, shape, internal structure, and environmental conditions. We prove that organic molecular materials show novel nanometer-size effects due to structural confinement. The high-intensity laser excitation induces ablation whose dynamics and mechanism are considered {{on the basis of}} time-resolved spectroscopy and imaging. For nanosecond and femtosecond ablation, we propose cyclic multiphotonic absorption and photomechanical mechanisms, respectively, while purely photochemical ablation was confirmed. Ablation studies have opened a new research approach toward expansion and contraction dynamics of polymer films, nanoparticle preparation, crystal growth control, crystallization in saturated solution, and others...|$|E
40|$|In the {{literature}} on meta-level architectures and reflection two separate streams can be distinguished: a logical stream (e. g., [Bowen and Kowalski, 1982], [Giunchiglia et al., 1993], [Weyhrauch, 1980]) and a procedural stream (e. g., [Clancey and Bock, 1988], [Davis, 1980]). Unfortunately {{there is a serious}} gap between the two streams. In the logical stream one restricts oneself often to static reflections; i. e., of facts the truth of which does not change during the reasoning: e. g., provable(A) (with A an object-level formula). In the procedural stream usually facts are reflected the truth of which changes during the whole reasoning pattern; e. g. control statements like currentgoal(A) with A an object-level formula, that are sometimes true and sometimes false during the reasoning. If applications to dynamic control of complex reasoning tasks are concerned these <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflections</b> are much more powerful (for applications see, e. g. [Davis, 1980], [Clancey and Bock, 1988], or [Brumsen et al., 1992], [Geelen and Kowalczyk, 1992], [Tan and Treur, 1992 a 1, [Tan and Treur, 1992 b], [Treur, 1991 a], [Treur and Veerkamp, 1992]). However, a logical basis for this is still lacking. The current paper provides a logical foundation (based on temporal logic) of meta-level architectures for dynamic control. Our logical framework enables one to study these dynamic meta-level architectures by logical means. It {{can be viewed as a}} contribution to bridge the gap between the logical stream and the procedural stream...|$|R

40|$|Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a {{paradigm}} that aims at improving software modularization. Indeed, aspects are yet another dimension for structuring applications. The notion of aspect refers to any crosscutting property. Such crosscutting {{can be either}} dynamic or static. Dynamic crosscutting refers to applications execution flow. While, static crosscutting refers to applications structure. Although many AOP approaches does enable these two kinds of crosscutting, this support is not always satisfactory. Aspects code is complex and often requires different constructs for expressing static and dynamic crosscutting. We present in this paper the foundation for an AOP platform that unifies the description of both kinds of crosscuttings. This solution relies on reflection and mixin-based inheritance.

40|$|The {{frequency}} response of an implantable antenna {{is key to}} the performance of a wireless implantable sensor. If the antenna detunes significantly, there are substantial power losses resulting in loss of accuracy. One reason for detuning is because of a change in the surrounding environment of an antenna. The pulsating anatomy of the human heart constitutes such a changing environment, so detuning is expected but this has not been quantified dynamically before. Four miniature implantable antennas are presented (two different geometries) along with which are placed within the heart of living swine the <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflection</b> coefficients. These antennas are designed to operate in the short range devices frequency band (863 - 870 MHz) and are compatible with a deeply implanted cardiovascular pressure sensor. The measurements recorded over 27 seconds capture the effects of the beating heart on the frequency tuning of the implantable antennas. When looked at in the time domain, these effects are clearly physiological and a combination of numerical study and posthumous autopsy proves this to be the case, while retrospective simulation confirms this hypothesis. The impact of pulsating anatomy on antenna design and the need for wideband implantable antennas is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} and {{articulate}} an historical perspective on the relationships between exhibition design, academic endeavour in the humanities and professional development. It reflects on design culture and educational philosophy and traces {{the recent history of}} curriculum development in exhibition design. The exhibition design course at University of Lincoln has a sixty-year history. Reviewing the way its philosophy has evolved reveals a consistently <b>dynamic</b> <b>reflection</b> of real-world interests. This has involved a pragmatic and somewhat eclectic appropriation of theory, particularly from the expanding field of museology, and its integration into an increasingly critical mode of creative practice. When the course became an undergraduate honours degree in 1991 the ï¿½project rationaleï¿½ was introduced {{as an alternative to the}} traditional undergraduate dissertation. The principle of integrating theory and practice proved enormously successful and now applies throughout the curriculum. Discourse analysis is applied to articles and course documents from the period 1970 to 1999. Bibliographical survey is also used to analyse the range and type of literature used to support studentsï¿½ studies. This is set against a background of influences on the exhibition design curriculum. These include contemporary changes in design practice, the growth of research into and for design, and changes in the national and institutional frameworks for course development. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the role of the humanities in exhibition design creativity and highlights outstanding issues in the discipline...|$|E
