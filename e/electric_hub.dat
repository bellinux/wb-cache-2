25|$|Ferdinand Porsche {{designed}} and built a four-wheel-driven electric vehicle for the k. u. k. Hofwagenfabrik Ludwig Lohner & Co. in Vienna in 1899, presented to the public during the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris. The vehicle was a series hybrid car, that used an <b>electric</b> <b>hub</b> motor at each wheel, powered by batteries, which were in turn charged by a gasoline-engine generator. It was clumsily heavy and due to its unusual status the so-called Lohner-Porsche is not frequently given its credit as the first four-wheel-driven automobile.|$|E

The Institute of Vehicle Concepts has designed and built a prototype of an <b>electric</b> wheel <b>hub</b> motor to use it in the research aircraft Airbus A 320 of the German Aerospace Centre. Special requirements to the motor are the torque for break away operation, the static load and the possibility to switch two gear ratios. The project was a part of an overall research project for the integration of fuel cells in aircrafts to reduce fuel consumption and air pollution.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an overall simulation approach {{to control the}} noise emission of car engines {{at a very early}} stage of the design process where no real prototypes are available. The suggested approach combines different physical models and couples different software tools such as multi-body analysis, fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, magneto-electrodynamics, thermodynamics, acoustics and control as well. The general overall simulation methodology is presented first. Then, this methodology is applied to a combustion engine in order to improve its acoustical behavior by passive means, such as changing the stiffness and the use of damping materials to build acoustic and thermal encapsulations. The active control by applying piezoelectric patch actuators at the oil sump as the noisiest part of the engine is discussed as well. The sound emission is evaluated by hearing tests and a mathematical prediction model of the human perception. Finally, it is shown that the presented approach can be extended to electric engines, which is demonstrated at a newly developed <b>electric</b> wheel <b>hub</b> motor...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{called an}} “auto-rickshaw”, with a four-stroke petrol, LPG or CNG engine {{is one of}} the most common and affordable means of transportation (for hire) in Indian cities. It is a small, highly manoeuvrable vehicle and ideally suited for the narrow and traffic clogged streets of urban India. Electric and hybrid vehicles are particularly suited for use in urban areas since city transportation is mainly characterized by relatively short driving distances, low continuous power requirements, long idling times and high availability of regenerative braking energy. These characteristics, when carefully incorporated into the design process, create valuable opportunities for developing clean, efficient and cost effective urban vehicle propulsion systems. A novel, low cost, test-bed for experimenting with hybrid propulsion systems for urban areas is developed and presented in this work. The main objective of this work is to study the performance of a parallel hybrid configuration with a DC hub motor and an IC engine. The hybrid configuration in this case adds speed at the wheel output unlike the normal power split configuration which adds torque. The addition of speed is done by connecting the output of engine and CVT to the stator of an <b>electric</b> <b>hub</b> motor. This novel setup is compared with torque addition where the output of the engine is coupled with the output of the DC motor using a gear transmission arrangement...|$|E

40|$|The need to {{decrease}} pollution in urban zones has pushed toward severe regulations {{in term of}} low-emission limits. The effect of this “environmental awareness” is an increased interest in electric vehicles (EV). The construction of a EV {{is presented in the}} paper.

According to the European technical regulations, the vehicle has been designed for a city use.

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the automobile's history, two main competing approaches to engine-driven vehicles existed: one with internal combustion engine (ICE) and another one with an electric drivetrain. Already in 1834, the American inventor Thomas Davenport built the first electric car. The first ICEV was developed in 1886 by Benz and Daimler in Germany. Around the year 1900, electric cars had a significant share of all engine-driven cars. At the same time, F. Porsche already invented a hybrid electric car equipped with an ICE range extender and wheel <b>hub</b> <b>electric</b> engines. The two different drive trains were competing until Henry Ford, in 1908, chose an ICEV for the first mass production of a car in history (summarized in [5]). This way, ICEV won the race early in the twentieth century and displaced the battery electric vehicles (BEV). From an environmental perspective, this may {{have been one of the}} biggest mistakes in the history of technology.|$|R
50|$|In 1887 Jacob Lohner's son Ludwig Lohner (1858-1925) {{took over}} the company. He decided that {{self-powered}} cars were the future, initially working with Béla Egger, and in 1898 hiring Ferdinand Porsche (from Béla Egger's electricity company). During his employment Porsche designed a number of vehicles. The Lohner Porsche chaise was powered by batteries, with two front wheel electric motors mounted in the wheel hubs. One of his electric vehicles was a popular exhibit at the Exposition Universelle (Paris world fair, 1900). Porsche later developed petrol-engined cars with electric transmissions, some versions of which had additional batteries—and {{are considered to be}} an early version of the hybrid car. Vehicles using the petrol <b>electric</b> transmission with <b>hub</b> motors were sold to the German army and to the Viennese fire brigade. Porsche left the Lohner company in 1905, and joined Daimler affiliate company Österreichische Daimler Motoren Commanditgesellschaft Bierenz Fischer & Co.; vehicles were later built using the Lohner Porsche system under the Mercedes brand of Daimler.|$|R
40|$|The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center {{initiated}} baseline {{testing of}} the EV Global E-Bike {{as a way to}} reduce pollution in urban areas, reduce fossil fuel consumption and reduce Operating costs for transportation systems. The work was done Linder the Hybrid Power Management (HPM) Program, which includes the Hybrid Electric Transit Bus (HETB). The E-Bike is a state of the art, ground up, hybrid electric bicycle. Unique features of the vehicle's power system include the use of an efficient, 400 W. <b>electric</b> <b>hub</b> motor and a 7 -speed derailleur system that permits operation as fully electric, fully pedal, or a combination of the two. Other innovative features, such as regenerative braking through ultracapacitor energy storage are planned. Regenerative braking recovers much of the kinetic energy of the vehicle during deceleration. The E-Bike is an inexpensive approach to advance {{the state of the art}} in hybrid technology in a practical application. The project transfers space technology to terrestrial use via nontraditional partners, and provides power system data valuable for future space applications. A description of the E-bike, the results of performance testing, and future vehicle development plans is the subject of this report.

40|$|The present thesis work {{is part of}} the {{feasibility}} study of a lightweight fuel-cell urban vehicle named Hyrban. The vehicle mounts four wheel <b>hub</b> <b>electric</b> motors instead of a traditional single motor on the chassis. This causes a sensible increase of the unsprung-to-sprung mass ratio of the car. The aim of the thesis then, has been to investigate the effects of this imbalance, in particular pointing out the attention on the comfort behaviour. Through a frequency analysis of simple models it has been possible to define and evaluate the variation of the comfort index to the mass ratio increase and for various damping coefficients. It yielded not only that the comfort index gets worse as the mass ratio increases, but also that it is less sensitive to its change when the damping coefficient is lower than the optimal value. The last one is variable relatively to the mass ratio, while the total mass and the bounce frequency are assumed to be constant. Other two performance indices have been evaluate about the mass ratio: the suspension working space and the dynamic tyre load. Representing physical limits to the suspension design, {{as a matter of fact}} they influence the comfort, even if indirectly. Finally, among various suspension solutions aimed to improve the comfort, only switchable dampers are regarded to be a feasible solution for a vehicle with limited amount of space and power...|$|R
40|$|In {{vehicles}} with electric transmission and independent wheel stations, {{it is possible}} to have a possibility to control propulsion, steering and suspension individually for each wheel. This makes it possible to improve mobility, performance and driving safety. The long term goal of this work is to develop a methodt hat can evaluate and improve the mobility of such vehicles in terrain. This contribution concerns how a six wheeled electric transmission vehicle should be modelled to enable evaluation of the dynamic behaviour in different type of terrain. This is made by combining modelling of vehicle, transmission and tire-terrain behaviour. For wheeled vehicles an <b>electric</b> transmission with <b>hub</b> motors provides the ability to accurately control the torque on every wheel independently, giving a great ability to improve both mobility in terrain and vehicle behaviour on road. In this work the components of a diesel-electric powertrain for off-road vehicles are modelled and a control layout with the possibility to include functions for improved performance both while driving off- and on-road is proposed. To handle driving on soft ground, a tire/terrain model is needed. The model should include lateral deformation {{in order to be able}} to steer. A tire/terrain model is derived based on the ideas of Wong and Reece. The terrain characteristics are chosen to be described by parameters according to the Bekker model, since this data are widely available in literature. The developed tire/terrain model has been implemented together with a vehicle model. This terrain vehicle model is shown to be able to estimate sinkage, rolling resistance, traction force and steering characteristics, of a six wheeledterrain vehicle using electric transmission. To conclude, models of a six-wheeled vehicle with electric transmission and tire models both for soft and rigid ground have been developed. These models form a simulation platform, which makes it possible to evaluate control strategies for the electric transmission with the purpose to improve mobility. QC 2010111...|$|R
