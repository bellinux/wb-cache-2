5|$|In 2007, Murray {{suggested}} that tennis had a match-fixing problem, stating that {{everyone knows it}} goes on, {{in the wake of}} the investigation surrounding Nikolay Davydenko. Both Davydenko and Rafael Nadal questioned his comments, but Murray responded that his words <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> out of context.|$|E

How came I to be so deceived? Had I quite misread their faces? ...|$|R

5|$|After his {{interview}} with the police, Farrar immediately filed for divorce from Green and for custody of Kate, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> in by his parents while Green and Farrar dealt with the police. A court later awarded temporary custody of Kate to Farrar's parents, due to Green's instability and Kate's professed anger with her father. Green was allowed supervised access during this period, while Farrar's visits {{were not required to}} be supervised.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} Alder {{developed}} {{interest in his}} original family in Virginia. A companion, John Moore, learned that Alder <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner near Greenbrier, and traveled to Wythe County to search for Alder's family. Initial inquiries were unsuccessful, but {{one of a series}} of advertisements Moore placed in the district was seen by Alder's surviving brother Paul. Paul then wrote Jonathan to inform him that the family was still alive.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Ukraine {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.|$|E

50|$|Relatively few actions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> in the {{conservation}} of the dama gazelle. The few measures that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>are</b> reserves so the animal can live in peaceful environment and captive breeding to help rebuild the populations.|$|R
5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On {{the recommendation of}} John Lindley, Darwin wrote to Lady Dorothy Nevill, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.|$|E
5|$|As the Royalist {{situation}} deteriorated, the south-west {{became one}} of the few remaining Royalist strongholds. Lingen, with 200men and 90horses at Goodrich Castle, conducted raids on Parliamentary forces in the region, representing a continuing challenge. No action <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken,</b> however, to strengthen the castle's defences with more modern 17th-century earthworks, and the castle remained essentially in its medieval condition.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{dealing with}} the army {{formations}} which South Vietnam might have deployed, {{the question of where}} and when to strike was the main problem that concerned the North Vietnamese. After the strength of both armies <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> into account, the Central Highlands High Command came up with two offensive options.|$|E
50|$|The name Kokernag <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{derived from}} the two words namely, koker and nag.

Kokernag is {{situated}} in the Anantnag District, whose name means abundant springs.|$|R

5|$|Aspirin can induce {{swelling}} of skin tissues in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one {{to six hours}} after ingesting aspirin {{in some of the}} people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} each 20 minute meal in {{the dining}} hall, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and {{carefully}} counted to ensure that nothing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> as a potential weapon. In the earlier years as a prison, prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, but this was later relaxed, provided that the prisoners communicated quietly.|$|E
5|$|Camera crews spent 10 {{days from}} November 5–18, 2005 to film {{sequences}} that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin {{work on the}} shots early in the project. The same steps <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> for Spider-Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.|$|E

Clennell had three children with her partner; all <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> into care and adopted due to her drug addiction. Clennell herself had spent some of her childhood in a referral unit, and it was shortly after being placed there that she started taking drugs.|$|E
5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a single station, by which time all the companies <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> over by {{one or both of}} just two companies.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Martin Pakula of the Labor Party, newly {{appointed}} State Minister for Public Transport {{announced that the}} rail link <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> off the agenda with new freeway options being explored instead, however a change of government at the 2010 Victorian State Election to Liberals, saw policy for {{the introduction of the}} rail link return to the agenda, with a promise by the incoming Coalition government to undertake planning for its construction.|$|E

5|$|In 985, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury {{to come to}} Ramsey to help {{found the}} monastic school there. Abbo was at Ramsey from 985 to 987, where he taught computus, or the methods for calculating Easter. It was also often used in trying to {{calculate}} {{the date of the}} Last Judgment. A surviving manuscript gives a list compiled by Oswald, setting forth estates that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> from the diocese of York.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, the Crusade {{was seen}} as a huge debacle with many monks writing that it could only have been the work of the Devil. The {{anonymous}} monk who wrote the Annales Herbipolenses chronicle in Würzburg mentioned that for decades afterwards, noble families in Germany were ransoming back knights who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner in Anatolia using Armenian middle-men. The camp followers who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner and sold into slavery by the Turks were not so lucky. Of the 113 individuals known by name to {{have been involved in the}} Crusade, 22 died, 42 returned home while the fate of the last 49 is a mystery. Despite the distaste for the memory of the Second Crusade, the experience of the crusade had notable impact on German literature, with many epic poems of the late 12th century featuring battle scenes clearly inspired by the fighting in the crusade.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the party}} {{maintained}} excellent health. The exception was the ship's engineer, Allan Ramsay, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> ill {{with a heart}} condition in the Falklands during the outward voyage. He chose to remain with the expedition, but he grew steadily weaker as winter progressed. He died on 6 August, and was buried on the island.|$|E
