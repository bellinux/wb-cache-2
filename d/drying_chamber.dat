50|$|A {{wallboard}} panel {{consists of}} a layer of gypsum plaster sandwiched between two layers of paper. The raw gypsum, CaSO4·2 H2O, is heated to drive off the water then slightly rehydrated to produce the hemihydrate of calcium sulfate (CaSO4·½ H2O). The plaster is mixed with fibre (typically paper and/or fibreglass), plasticizer, foaming agent, finely ground gypsum crystal as an accelerator, EDTA, starch or other chelate as a retarder, various additives that may decrease mildew and increase fire resistance, and wax emulsion or silanes for lower water absorption. The board is then formed by sandwiching a core of the wet mixture between two sheets of heavy paper or fibreglass mats.

Nevertheless, seeds withhigh water content can be damaged at drying time, so requiring the adoption of drying methods which ensure seedquality during storage. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the quality of sorghum seeds, cultivar BR 310,harvested with different moisture contents (19 and 27 %), submitted to drying under three temperatures (35, 45 and 35 / 45 °C).
