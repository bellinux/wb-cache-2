2500|$|... "Autolock" [...] {{collet chucks}} (Osbourn [...] "Pozi-Lock" [...] {{is a similar}} system) were {{designed}} to provide secure clamping of milling cutters with only <b>hand</b> <b>tightening.</b> They were developed in the 1940s by a now defunct UK company, Clarkson (Engineers) Limited, and {{are commonly known as}} Clarkson chucks. Autolock collets require cutters with threaded shank ends to screw into the collet itself. Any rotation of the cutter forces the collet against the collet cap taper which tightly clamps the cutter, the screw fitting also prevents any tendency of the cutter to pull out. Collets are only available in fixed sizes, imperial or metric, and the cutter shank must be an exact match.|$|E

60|$|She {{put her arm}} {{again into}} mine, and walked on with me slowly. I felt her <b>hand</b> <b>tightening</b> its grasp {{mechanically}} on my arm, and I saw her getting paler and paler as I went on--but, not a word passed her lips while I was speaking. When I had done, she still kept silence. Her head drooped a little, and she walked by my side, unconscious of my presence, unconscious of everything about her; lost--buried, I might almost say--in her own thoughts.|$|E

50|$|Cleco-type {{fasteners}} {{are also}} available with a threaded mechanism to draw the spreader bar up. Clecos of this type take more time to install and remove, but can be made much tighter than the spring-type clecos. They are commonly available with a wingnut for <b>hand</b> <b>tightening,</b> or with a simple hex nut {{so that they may}} be spaced more closely together. In either case they will usually have a hexagonal body that may be better gripped to tighten or release the spreader bar.|$|E

5000|$|A {{porthole}} {{consists of}} at least two structural components and is, in its simplest form, similar to any other type of window in design and purpose. The porthole is primarily a circular glass disk, known as a 'portlight', encased in a metal frame that is bolted securely into the side of a ship's hull. Sometimes the glass disk of a porthole is encased in a separate frame which is hinged onto the base frame {{so that it can be}} opened and closed. In addition, many portholes also have metal storm covers that can be securely fastened against the window when necessary. The main purpose of the storm cover is, as its name implies, to protect the window from heavy seas. It is also used to block light from entering lower berths when darkness is preferred. The storm cover is referred to as a deadlight in maritime parlance. Storm covers are also used on Navy and merchant marine ships to prevent interior light from escaping the ship's lower berths, and to provide protection from hostile fire. Hinged porthole windows and storm covers are accessible from inside the ship's hull, and are typically fastened to their closed positions by <b>hand</b> <b>tightening</b> several pivoting, threaded devices, commonly referred to as [...] "dogs." [...] Older portholes can be identified by the protruding collar of their base plate which may be up to several inches deep, thus accommodating the thickness of a wooden hull.|$|E

30|$|The focal dome {{osteotomy}} is an osteotomy {{created with}} {{the centre of}} the dome coincident to the CORA (centre of rotation angulation) derived from deformity calculations. The concavity of the dome faces proximally and the osteotomy creates a large bone interface. Incisions can be performed midline longitudinal or percutaneously. The division is through a percutaneous osteotomy or with a Gigli saw. A fibular osteotomy and fixation of the tibia with an external fixator is usually done. In order to tighten the lateral collateral ligament, a distal transport of the fibula can be performed with the focal dome osteotomy. If, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>tightening</b> of the medial collateral ligament is needed, the focal dome, open wedge, neutral wedge, open wedge-focal dome or neutral focal dome osteotomies all serve to achieve this [29]. A circular external fixator can be used for fixation in this osteotomy [30]. In the circular fixator technique, the fibular osteotomy is made at the start through a posterolateral incision 10  cm distal to the fibular head. The bone is cut in an oblique fashion in order to enable the translation in the coronal plane. Two tensioned wires and a half pin are used for the proximal ring; two tensioned wires and a half pin are applied to the distal upper ring which is positioned perpendicularly to the tibial axis. Two tensioned wires are used for the most distal ring. All wires should not engage the fibula. The tibia is osteotomized just distal to the tibial tubercle with an osteotome or a Gigli saw. The lateral and anteromedial cortex are cut with precision with the osteotome. The cutting is completed in the posterior cortex with a turning movement of the osteotome (osteoclasis). The correction is achieved under fluoroscopy with alignment of the two rings [31].|$|E
40|$|In the Global South {{automobile}} production evolved behind protectionist {{walls and}} was promoted by infant industry policies and outright national automotive projects from the 1950 s. In recent decades, {{many developing countries}} have liberalized their automotive markets and allowed automobile TNCs to take majority control over joint ventures, transforming domestic automotive industries into foreign controlled sectors while leaving a few national automakers in India, Malaysia and China. Decomposing and reorganizing the national value chain into regional and global automobile value chains OEMs and TNC original equipment suppliers (OESs) have off-shored and outsourced component and parts production to developing countries. Again, local auto suppliers have been acquired or relegated to lower 'tier' positions if not {{forced out of the}} market. However, with economic growth and development in the Global South during the 1990 s and 2000 s automobile sales have boomed, and the automobile sectors in Latin America and Asia have become „brown sunrise‟ industries generating investment, technological upgrading and employment. The present global financial and economic crisis has not profoundly changed this trajectory. The global crisis did not impact automotive markets in developing countries severely, except for automotive exporting countries like Mexico, Thailand and South Africa. Only in 2009 automotive sales and production declined across the board in the Global South, but key markets turned around in the end of the year. Thus, the automobile crisis is a downward business cycle, not a structural crisis of the industry. Companies in the automotive industry responded with traditional crisis management (temporary downsizing, cost reductions, retraining, consolidation, innovation), and governments launched traditional stimuli packages (cash-for-clunkers, tax reductions on smaller and/or cleaner cars etc). Strategic initiatives were taken to improve the competitiveness of the domestic industry (consolidation, liberalization) {{on the one hand and}} to transform it from a brown industry to a „greener‟ industry on the other <b>hand</b> (<b>tightening</b> environmental regulations, fuel efficiency and emission standards, subsidizing purchases of smaller and „greener‟ cars, investing in appropriate infrastructure and green technology R&D). Thereby, some developing countries and their surviving local automakers and parts makers are leapfrogging into „clean‟ technology frontiers competing head-to-head with global automakers or partnering with foreign firms in their common endeavor to manufacture green automobiles...|$|E
