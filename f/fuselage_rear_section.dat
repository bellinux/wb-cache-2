40|$|Trade studies {{during the}} {{preliminary}} design phase {{play an important}} role in the design process of a new aircraft. However, the generation and adaption of appropriate finite element (FE) models still takes a lot of time which in turn may prevent comprehensive trade studies and, therefore, lead to time- and cost-intensive redesign during the detailed design phase. Based on a standardised aircraft description, a fuselage modelling tool was developed to automatically generate global FE models for preliminary sizing purposes using beam elements for the fuselage stiffening structure. To be also used in crash simulations these models can be extended in a way that certain regions - where high plastic deformations or failure is expected - may be modelled much finer by the use of extruded profiles and shell elements. Nevertheless, this fine representation is still based on the same standardised aircraft description. In this paper the crash analysis tool AC-CRASH is presented introducing various modelling options and applications. They range from standard section drops with a pure vertical velocity up to full fuselage models under realistic crash and ditching conditions. As an exemplary application of AC-CRASH a vertical drop of a generic <b>fuselage</b> <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> is evaluated in detail...|$|E

25|$|From the outset, each Meteor was {{constructed}} from several modular sections or separately produced units, a deliberate design choice {{to allow for}} production to be dispersed and for easy disassembly for transport. Each aircraft comprised five main sections: nose, forward <b>fuselage,</b> central <b>section,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> and tail units; the wings were also built out of lengthwise sections. The forward section contained the pressure cabin, gun compartments, and forward undercarriage. The center section incorporated much of the structural elements, including the inner wing, engine nacelles, fuel tank, ammunition drums, and main undercarriage. The <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> was of a conventional semi-monocoque structure. Various aluminium alloys were the primary materials used throughout {{the structure of the}} Meteor, such as the stressed duralumin skin.|$|R
50|$|Preserved {{parts from}} a Hornet {{can be found}} in the UK and Canada. The UK-based project has a forward {{fuselage}} reconstruction for a Hornet F.1. This includes many original parts, with the new-build items being made to original drawings. The same collection has a sizeable piece of wing, main and tail wheels and two canopies. Two <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> (VX250 and VW957) are also in store, as well as the belly door, a main undercarriage leg and one rear engine/undercarriage fairing. In the province of Alberta, Canada a fragmented wing section from TT193 is in store.|$|R
2500|$|The Bernard 80 was a {{monoplane}} with a {{cantilever wing}} of high aspect ratio (8.6). The wing planform was straight tapered with elliptical tips. Five fuel tanks {{on each side}} provided a total capacity of 7,000L (1,540Impgal, 1,850USgal). Differential ailerons were fitted. The wing was a single piece wooden structure with two spars and plywood ribs, plywood skinned with canvas covering. It thickened continuously towards the centre where its depth increased rapidly to form part of the fuselage. [...] This centre section contained four parallel steel tubes which joined the front and <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> to it. An oval internal opening, 0.7m (28in) high and 0.45m (17in) wide, gave access from the nose to the rear.|$|R
50|$|In March 1943, {{with the}} {{creation}} of the liaison category of light observation aircraft (previous examples came from Taylorcraft Aircraft as the L-2, and from Aeronca as their L-3, along with the numerous Piper L-4) the designation for Stinson's new purpose-built military design was changed to the L-5. The primary purpose as a liaison aircraft was courier and communication work, artillery spotting and casualty evacuation. The fuselage of later models was redesigned so the aircraft could also be used as an air ambulance, or for cargo work. With a wider and deeper <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> and a large rear door that folded downward, a litter patient or 250 pounds of cargo could be quickly loaded aboard.|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} four major restorations in progress, including {{a pair of}} Sikorsky S-52 helicopters, one that is a Korean War (H05S) veteran and another Civilian model (S-52). The S-52, owned by the USMC, is currently being reassembled for display at the National Museum of the Marine Corps. The museum's own H05S, while still missing several major components, has progressed {{to a point that}} it can sit on its own landing gear. The unique one-of-a-kind Sikorsky S-60 prototype has been undergoing a major restoration since 2010 when she was acquired from the New England Air Museum. The cockpit section is expected to be completed by 2018. Simultaneously the center section, wing spar, and <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> are all progressing as well with most of the torn wreckage removed and replaced with new metal.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{variant of}} the Lancer {{was to be the}} CL-1200-1, powered by a single J79-GE-19 {{turbojet}} which was an uprated version of the engine used in the F-104. The second, more advanced variant, the CL-1200-2, was to have redesigned center and <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> that could accommodate a modern turbofan engine as an improvement on the J79 turbojet. This turbofan engine was to be the Pratt & Whitney TF30-P-100 as used in the F-111F. The TF-30-P-100 would have provided a 60 percent increase in thrust at maximum power. The air intakes were located in the same position as on the F-104, but they were to employ variable shock cones with four-inch movement in place of the F-104's fixed cones to optimize engine performance over a wide speed range.|$|R
25|$|Early {{production}} aircraft were built at Hatfield, which {{had originally been}} a de Havilland factory. The Avro RJ family of aircraft was assembled at the Avro International, later BAE Systems Regional Aircraft Centre, at Woodford Aerodrome in Greater Manchester, England. Production of various sections of the aircraft was carried out at different BAE plants. The <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> was manufactured at BAE Systems' former Avro site at Chadderton, Greater Manchester. The centre fuselage section was manufactured at the Filton BAE site. The vertical stabilizer came from Brough and the engine pylons were made at Prestwick. The nose section was manufactured at Hatfield, where the assembly line for the early aircraft was located. Some manufacturing was subcontracted outside the UK; the wings were made by Textron in the United States and the tailplane and control surfaces were made by Saab-Scania in Sweden.|$|R
50|$|The {{rest of the}} {{fuselage}} of the DB-20 came in two parts, each joined to the central section. The foreword section was a conventional flat-sided fuselage with an open nose-gunner's position, equipped with a machine gun on a flexible mounting. Like the centre section it was heavily armoured, with 3 mm thick walls and a 4-5 mm floor providing protection from ground fire at altitudes above 250 m The other three crew positions were in the central section, pilot and mechanic sitting side-by-side in an open cockpit {{at the leading edge}} and with a mid-upper gunner or observer, who could also drop bombs, close behind them. The <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> was a large, flat sided duralumin beam with frames and riveted skin. It carried a blunted triangular fin and deep balanced rudder. The DB-20's rectangular, high aspect ratio tailplane was mounted on the fin just above {{the fuselage}}, braced to it with V-struts and carrying overhung (balanced) elevators.|$|R
50|$|The first {{specifications}} of the TA9 and TA11 {{were released}} in 1982. While the TA9 had {{a range of}} 3300 nmi km, the TA11 range was up to 6830 nmi km. At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a 2000 nmi km lesser range. By {{the time of the}} Paris Air Show in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 flight deck, fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system and side-stick control. Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training. The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> of the A310. Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.|$|R
50|$|R. Blaser was {{assigned}} to detail design. In order to improve performance compared to the Bf 110, the fuselage was made as small as possible, so small {{that there was no}} room on the instrument panel for the complete set of engine instruments, some of which were instead moved to the inside faces of the engine nacelles, as would also be done for the Henschel Hs 129 ground attack aircraft and some versions of the Bf 110. The engine nacelles were relatively normal, including both the engine and the main landing gear storage, but the front-mounted radiators for the engines were retractable for high speed when less frontal area would be needed to get the same airflow (an idea which was in some vogue at the time, and also used in the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406). The mainwheels were fully retractable and faired and the design of the wing and tailplane required no struts or supports (unlike some late 1930s designs, such as early Bf 109s), in order to further reduce drag. The wing's two spars passed under the pilot's seat. As was common on pre-war designs, the line of the <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> flowed straight into the line of the canopy, which created less drag than a bubble canopy, but also blocked direct viewing to the rear, although there were cutouts in the <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> and the <b>rear</b> <b>section</b> of the canopy, which opened rearward and upward at an angle of about 15°, extended some ways to the rear to provide a degree of vision over the pilot's shoulder, if not directly rearward (the forward section of the canopy, over the pilot himself, hinged forwards in an unusual fashion). Although the cockpit was located well forward, a small window panel was fitted in the underside of the nose by the pilot's feet to improve the view for landing.|$|R
50|$|To keep {{construction}} costs low, the Mü31 {{will be built}} using components from the Schleicher ASW 27, such as the forward <b>fuselage,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> and tail and outer wings.|$|R
50|$|The Jet Provost has an {{uncomplicated}} structure, the airframe being {{based on}} the Percival Provost, albeit being strengthened in key {{areas such as the}} main wing spar and featuring a substantially different undercarriage arrangement. It possesses an all-metal stressed-skin fuselage built in two sections, the forward section stretching {{from the rear of the}} engine bay to the nose comprises a double-frame to absorb the wing and engine loads, while the <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> uses an orthodox semi-monocoque structure. Major loads across the fuselage are supported by a combination of four longerons and a single longitudinal beam across the upper-center line. The ailerons, elevators, and rudder are all attached to the airframe via two inset hinges each. The nose contains a hinged metal assembly, housing the radio, batteries, and other electronic equipment, and is easily serviceable by ground crew. All fuel tankage is housed within the wings. Where possible, all components used were designed to maximized interchangeability and to conform with international standardisation; a total of 49 service panels across the aircraft's exterior provides access for maintenance and servicing.|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{responsibility}} for production, Fokker designed and built the nose section, centre fuselage and inner wing; MBB/Fokker-VFW constructed the forward <b>fuselage,</b> <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> and tail assembly; and Shorts designed and built the outer wings.|$|R
5|$|Partly as a {{means of}} guaranteeing {{employment}} in the British aerospace industry, agreement was reached that major portions of the UK's Phantoms would be built domestically. The F-4J variant, which was then the primary version in service with the US Navy, was taken {{as the basis for the}} UK aircraft, subject to major redesign. The most significant change was the substitution of the larger and more powerful Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan for the GE J79 turbojet to allow operations from the Royal Navy's carriers. Although several had received major upgrades, all of the UK carriers were smaller than the US carriers from which the J79-GE-8 and −10 powered Phantoms operated. To accommodate the larger engines, BAC redesigned and built the entire <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section.</b> The Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 radar carried by the F-4J was to be procured and built under licence by Ferranti as the AN/AWG-11 for FAA aircraft and AN/AWG-12 for those of the RAF.

2500|$|The Airbus A300 {{was to be}} {{the first}} {{aircraft}} to be developed, manufactured and marketed by Airbus. By early 1967 the [...] "A300" [...] label began to be applied to a proposed 320 seat, twin engined airliner. Following the 1967 tri-government agreement, Roger Béteille was appointed technical director of the A300 development project. Béteille developed a division of labour that would be the basis of Airbus' production for years to come: France would manufacture the cockpit, flight control and the lower centre section of the fuselage; Hawker Siddeley, whose Trident technology had impressed him, was to manufacture the wings; West Germany should make the forward and <b>rear</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections,</b> as well as the upper centre section; the Dutch would make the flaps and spoilers; finally Spain (yet to become a full partner) would make the horizontal tailplane. On 26 September 1967 the West German, French and British governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding in London which allowed continued development studies. This also confirmed Sud Aviation as the [...] "lead company", that France and the UK would each have a 37.5% work share with West Germany taking 25%, and that Rolls-Royce would manufacture the engines.|$|R
