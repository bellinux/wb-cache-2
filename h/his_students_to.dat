5|$|In 1816 Balzac {{entered the}} Sorbonne, {{where he studied}} under three famous professors: François Guizot, who later became Prime Minister, was Professor of Modern History; Abel-François Villemain, a recent arrival from the Collège Charlemagne, lectured on French and {{classical}} literature; and, most influential of all, Victor Cousin's courses on philosophy encouraged <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> think independently.|$|E
5|$|As {{a teacher}} he urged <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> read {{extensively}} and be original in their work. The {{students did not}} have access to the newspapers he had read as a student, so Achebe made his own available in the classroom. He taught in Oba for four months, but when an opportunity arose in 1954 to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS), he left the school and moved to Lagos.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Luang Pu Sodh made an {{announcement}} {{that he would}} die soon, and instructed <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> continue their duties without him, especially to propagate Dhammakaya meditation. Two years later, {{he was diagnosed with}} hypertension. Luang Pu Sodh died in 1959. His body was not cremated, but embalmed, so that after his death people would still come and support Wat Paknam. In Wat Phra Dhammakaya a memorial hall was built in honor of Luang Pu Sodh, and in Wat Paknam, a charity foundation was started in his name.|$|E
50|$|Rabbi Blumenkrantz {{became a}} confidant of Rabbi Feinstein, {{screening}} his calls and filtering the {{constant stream of}} halakhic questions posed to the posek. At age 25 Rabbi Feinstein asked <b>his</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> teach a semicha class in Yoreh De'ah at MTJ. Afterwards, Rabbi Feinstein directed <b>his</b> <b>student</b> <b>to</b> prominent teaching positions in Staten Island and then Brooklyn, at which Rabbi Blumenkrantz excelled.|$|R

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1885, the twelve-year-old Rachmaninoff entered the home of Nikolai Zverev to receive private piano {{instruction}} {{and at the end}} of May 1886, Zverev took <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> Crimea, where Rachmaninoff continued his studies, hoping to gain entrance to Anton Arensky's harmony class at the Moscow Conservatory. It was during this time that Rachmaninoff created his first composition, a two-page Étude in F-sharp major (the manuscript is now lost). After admission to the class, he produced more exercises, the earliest of which is a Lento in D minor; it is the only surviving piece of ten he is said to have composed.|$|E
5|$|Kanō {{believed}} {{this to be}} unacceptable. He refused to play such a subservient role when teaching <b>his</b> <b>students.</b> <b>To</b> Kanō, a teacher must command respect. At the same time, he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods. The theories of the American educator John Dewey especially influenced him. Kanō's manner had the desired effect upon the students, but the administration was slower to warm to his methods {{and it was not}} until the arrival of a new principal that Kanō's ideas found acceptance.|$|E
5|$|While a {{graduate}} student and member of TMRC, Dennis introduced <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> the TX-0 on loan to MIT indefinitely from Lincoln Laboratory. In the spring of 1959, McCarthy taught the first course in programming that MIT offered to freshmen. Outside classes, Kotok, David Gross, Peter Samson, Robert A. Saunders and Robert A. Wagner, all friends from TMRC, reserved time on the TX-0. They {{were able to use}} the TX-0 as a personal, single-user tool rather than a batch processing system, thanks to Dennis, faculty advisors and John McKenzie, the operations manager.|$|E

5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> take sides.|$|E
5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on that memory use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM, and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's Easter egg), with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> {{learn the}} melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his {{students learn to}} sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E

5|$|A {{year has}} past since the {{encounter}} with Beerus. Goku and Vegeta had been training under Whis who had taken them as <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> master on controlling their flow of energy, maintaining it from within themselves. During this time, the remaining remnant of Frieza's army had went to earth to use the dragon balls to revive the long dead galactic ruler. Being revived and regenerated from the army's latest technology of regeneration, Frieza had began to plot his revenge on Goku who had defeated him on planet Namek. Learning that he had defeated Majin Buu, one of two beings warned not to fight with from his father; the other being Beerus, Frieza decided to begin intense training to reach new heights of power to face Goku. Frieza's army had arrived on Earth while Goku and Vegeta still training with Whis. Tien, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and Master Roshi had fought the remnant until their return. Once arriving on Earth, Frieza and Goku had fought showing their latest forms and power. Goku achieved a form beyond the Super Saiyan God form being the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Sayian Blue). Frieza revealed his new form achieved after training stating he has not done before, calling it his Golden form.|$|E
5|$|Lihau {{traveled}} to the secessionist State of Katanga in November {{to negotiate with the}} rebellious province's leaders. He assisted in organising and subsequently took part in the Léopoldville Conference in January 1961 to discuss political compromise and reform. He also participated in the Tananarive Conference in March and the following Coquilhatville Conference in April on behalf of Iléo to try and bring about a reconciliation among the dissident factions in the Congo. As result of the latter conference, Iléo created a commission to prepare a new constitution for the Congo and appointed Lihau to chair it. Lihau {{played a key role in}} the drafting process from that point forward. In June he joined Cyrille Adoula and Jean Bolikango in negotiating with the representatives of the Stanleyville government. Their meetings continued into July and resulted in the reconvening of Parliament and the Stanleyville government agreeing to disband. In January 1963 Lihau was hired to be professor and dean of the faculty of law at the University of Lovanium (later the National University of Zaire). He encouraged <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> adopt a constitutionalist approach to law.|$|E
5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E

25|$|Instead, Cioculescu {{made his}} living {{teaching}} French language at Bucharest's Saint Sava National College. He had among his students G. Brătescu, the future physician and medical historian, {{also known as a}} Communist Party militant after the war (before being marginalized and excluded by the group in the late 1950s). In his 2003 autobiography, Brătescu recalled that Cioculescu's method went beyond the Romanian curriculum and parallel to the National Legionary requirements, introducing <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> innovative French 19th- and 20th-century authors, from Arthur Rimbaud to Marcel Proust. Also according to Brătescu, Cioculescu introduced <b>his</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> the banned or unpublished works of Arghezi, and openly praised the poet's political stance. In late 1940, Cioculescu also reacted to the Iron Guard's mass murders of politicians affiliated with previous regimes—the Jilava Massacre and the killings of Iorga and economist Virgil Madgearu. His Saint Sava student Brătescu, who frequented Iorga's circles in Vălenii de Munte, presented him with some of Iorga's final texts for Cuget Clar.|$|E
