Obama called upon communities everywhere to observe the King Day of Service, a day of citizen volunteer service honoring the human rights leader. More than 13,000community service events took place across the nation on the day, the largest participation in the 14 years since Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act and {{more than double the}} previous year's events.|$|E
5|$|William Seward {{was sworn}} in as senator from New York on March 5, 1849, during the brief special session called to confirm President Taylor's cabinet nominees. Seward was seen as having {{influence}} over Taylor: taking advantage of an acquaintance with Taylor's brother. Seward met with the former general several times before <b>Inauguration</b> <b>Day</b> (March 4), and was friendly with Cabinet officers. Taylor hoped to gain the admission of California to the Union, and Seward worked to advance his agenda in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Now Vice President-elect, Johnson {{was anxious}} to {{complete}} the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for {{the election of a}} new governor did not allow it to take place until after <b>Inauguration</b> <b>Day,</b> March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.|$|E
5|$|Once elected, a {{governor}} serves a four-year term beginning {{on the date}} he is sworn into office; <b>inauguration</b> <b>day</b> is the second Monday in January. He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is no limit to how many terms {{a governor}} may serve; however, the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms {{at a time and}} may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve-year period. To be eligible to run for a third term, the governor would have to sit out for one election period.|$|E
5|$|As Wilson {{adjusted}} his lineup of potential Cabinet appointees, he and House considered Lane for {{the positions of}} Attorney General and Secretary of War. Finally, Wilson wrote to him on February 24, 1913, offering him the Interior position, and, although the two had never met, he accepted the post. According to The New York Times, Chairman Lane was selected since {{he was one of}} the few California Democrats who had fought the railroads and who was not beholden to Hearst. At the time, it was customary not to make an official announcement of Cabinet appointments until the new President formally submitted the names to the Senate on the afternoon of <b>Inauguration</b> <b>Day,</b> March 4; however, The New York Times obtained the list of Wilson's appointees a day early. The Senate met in special session on March 5, and approved all of President Wilson's Cabinet appointees.|$|E

50|$|While {{organizers}} {{had originally}} expected over 200,000 people, the march ended up drawing between 440,000 to 500,000 in Washington D.C. The Washington Metro system had its second-busiest day ever with {{over a million}} trips taken, considerably larger than the <b>inauguration</b> <b>day's</b> ridership and {{second only to the}} first inauguration of Barack Obama. The New York Times reported that crowd-scientists estimate that the Women's March was {{three times the size of}} the Trump inauguration, which they estimate at 160,000 attendees. However, The Washington Post and The New York Times have stated that it is difficult to accurately calculate crowd size and other estimates of the Trump inauguration range from 250,000 to 600,000 people.|$|R

5|$|The Convention met from February 3 – December 6, 1861, {{and elected}} John Janney its {{presiding}} officer. The majority at first voted {{to remain in}} the Union, but stayed in session awaiting events. At first, the speeches were mixed between Secessionists advocating leaving the Union, Conditional Unionists holding onto the patriotism of earlier times, and Unconditional Unionists insisting that secession was bad policy and unlawful. On March 4, Abraham Lincoln’s <b>inauguration</b> <b>day,</b> Jefferson Davis called up 100,000 militia to serve a year and sent besieging troops to surround Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pickens in Florida. That same day Waitman T. Willey from trans-Alleghany Monongalia County answered secessionists with a Unionist speech. He defended Virginia's institutions from Northern attacks against slavery, but “there is no constitutional right of secession...” He warned that secession would bring about war, taxes and the abolition of slavery in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The police {{presence}} in the District of Columbia temporarily doubled, augmented {{by the addition of}} 8,000police officers from around the United States. The police force was assisted by 1,000FBI agents to provide security for the event, and the Secret Service Countersniper team was assigned to hidden locations throughout the area. The Transportation Security Administration had over 300 officers from its National Deployment Force on hand to assist the Secret Service with security inspections of attendees entering the National Mall. Ten thousand National Guard troops were on site, with 5,000troops providing security duty in a ceremonial capacity and 1,300unarmed troops aiding Park Police in crowd control at the National Mall. CCompany of the 1–175Infantry provided security {{between the first and second}} public viewing areas of the National Mall at the 7thStreet,N.W. intersection, while the remaining members performed other security functions. The Federal Aviation Administration implemented additional airspace restrictions over Washington,D.C. between 10:00am and 6:00pm on January 20, 2009. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was chosen as the designated survivor to ensure continuity of government in case of catastrophe, and he spent <b>Inauguration</b> <b>Day</b> at a U.S.military installation outside of the Washington,D.C. area.|$|E

5000|$|The {{election}} of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was not followed by {{his death in}} office, despite being seriously wounded in an assassination attempt within months of his 1981 <b>inauguration.</b> <b>Days</b> after Reagan survived the shooting, columnist Jack Anderson wrote [...] "Reagan and the Eerie Zero Factor" [...] and noted that the 40th president had either disproved the superstition, or had nine lives. [...] Reagan, the oldest man to be elected President at that time, also survived treatment for colon cancer while in office. First Lady Nancy Reagan {{was reported to have}} hired psychics and astrologers to try to protect her husband from the effects of the curse. Reagan left office on January 20, 1989, and ultimately died of pneumonia complicated by Alzheimer's disease on June 5, 2004, at the age of 93 — coincidentally, during the presidency of George W. Bush, the only other survivor of the [...] "curse".|$|R

In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.|$|E
25|$|As more {{settlers}} {{came to the}} prairies on the railway, {{the population}} grew. On September 1, 1905, Saskatchewan became a province, with <b>inauguration</b> <b>day</b> held September 4. The Dominion Lands Act permitted settlers to acquire one quarter of a square mile of land to homestead and offered an additional quarter upon establishing a homestead. Immigration peaked in 1910, {{and in spite of}} the initial difficulties of frontier life – distance from towns, sod homes, and backbreaking labour – new settlers established a European-Canadian style of prosperous agrarian society.|$|E

5000|$|After the American Revolutionary War, both Maryland and Virginia donated land to {{form the}} new federal District of Columbia. Additional congregations which {{ultimately}} became parishes formed much nearer the Potomac River at this time, including Christ Church, Washington Parish (a/k/a Navy Yard; 1794) and St. John's Episcopal Church, Georgetown Parish (1796). After {{the destruction of the}} War of 1812, with the Burning of Washington in August 1814, St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square (1815) was built facing historic Lafayette Square across from the rebuilt [...] "President's House", at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., (in the historic Lafayette Square Historic District) which later became known as the [...] "Executive Mansion" [...] and later the White House. St. John's has been long known as the [...] "Church of the Presidents", visited frequently by neighboring chief executives and is the traditional site for an early morning prayer service and mass during <b>inauguration</b> <b>days</b> on March 4 and later January 20. Another historic episcopal church formed in the capital city, and which hosted nearby Maryland diocesan conventions, is the Church of the Epiphany (Washington, D.C.). Parishes formed during the 19th Century's [...] "Oxford Movement" [...] included St. Paul's Church on K Street, and St. James' Church on Capitol Hill.

25|$|On March 9, 1987, LaMarche's {{father was}} murdered, {{shot to death}} by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby, in front of dozens of witnesses. This sent LaMarche into {{depression}} and alcoholism for the next two years, effectively stalling his stand-up career. After getting sober on <b>Inauguration</b> <b>Day</b> in 1989, LaMarche embarked again into the world of his first love, standup comedy, {{in the early part of}} 1990. However, just as he was regaining lost momentum, tragedy struck once more, as his 18-year-old sister was killed in a car accident in September of that year. At this point, though he remained sober, LaMarche decided he just could not do standup comedy anymore.|$|E

The U.S. Air Force provided four T-37 aircraft from nearby Mather Air Force Base (Sacramento, CA) and its 455th Flying Training Squadron for the fly-over. At $255 per hour of flying time for each aircraft, this T-37 flyover ranks as the most economical in the history of Super Bowls. In addition, all the pilots were young officers symbolizing California as the land of opportunity and youth.|$|E
