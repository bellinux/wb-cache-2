5000|$|In the Minas Basin area of Nova Scotia, {{digging for}} soft-shelled clams is usually {{done with a}} clam hack, a spading fork with its short handle bent perpendicularly away from the fork's head. A digger {{typically}} uses the hack by grasping {{the spine of the}} prongs in one hand and the handle of the fork in the other to push the hack down into the mud, clay, or sand and then pull it up and towards him/herself. This <b>digging</b> <b>action</b> opens up the substrate to expose the clams. Those clams legally long enough (44 mm in Nova Scotia) are then taken by hand and put into a peck-size (9 litre) bucket that is used to measure the volume of clams collected.|$|E

50|$|After a mole is {{born and}} begins to develop it will begin to crawl around and dig. As {{a result of the}} {{constant}} <b>digging</b> <b>action,</b> elements of the forelimb that are associated with those movements will begin to ossify. Some elements {{in the hands of the}} Talpa, formally described as distal phalanges, are actually the first to ossify. These elements build up a groove for the distal phalanges but ultimately do not fuse with them. These bony elements develop directly, meaning they do not have any cartilaginous precursors. The extra-calcified elements are created from small, calcified particles that are found in the fibrous part of the flexor digitorum profundus. The particles then fuse later in life to form the solid element of the hand. Additionally, the sesamoid bone in the mole, sensu strictu, is a bone that develops within a tendon. It does have a chondrified precursor and it assists the tendon in transmitting force.|$|E

40|$|So-called 2 ̆ 7 gogi 2 ̆ 7 (Fig. 1), Salvelinus leucomaenis (Pallas), is a {{non-migratory}} char attaining {{a length}} of 30 cm or less and occurs in the most upper reaches in the rivers in San-in and Sanyo districts of western Honshu. Because gogi-char has many pale spots on the head unlike other members of this genus and has slightly fewer gill rakers, this fish was described at first {{under the name of}} S. imbrius by Jordan and McGregor (1925). The present author, however, is considering it as one of the local races of S. leucomaenis, for the differences of meristic counts between gogi-char and S. leucomaenis from other districts are not so conspicuous (Table 2). Field o bservations on the spawning behavior and early life history of this char were made in Misaka-dani of Takatsu River system and Haza River of Sufu River system (Fig. 2 A, B, C) both in Shimane Prefecture, mainly in 1962, 1971 and 1974. Spawning season of gogi-char extends from late October to middle November, when the water temperature goes down to 11 ～ 8 °C. The spawning acts by a single female and several males are usually seen in the pool-side (Fig. 5 A, B, C), where the current is very slow or slight counter flow is noticed. In the male group, the hierarchy is recognized according to their body sizes and the largest one succeeds in mating with the female. This male usually darts and drives subordinate males away if they attempt to approach his partner,however, in early period of prespawning he is occasionally turned out from the spawning redd by counterattacks of a smaller male (Fig. 8 B). The female defends her spawning site from other females and digs the bottom. As the female repeats <b>digging</b> <b>action</b> (Fig. 9 A) at the same point at an interval of 1 to 3 minutes, a saucer-shaped depression is gradually formed, in which she takes a feeling or crouch posture (Fig. 10 A, B) after each <b>digging</b> <b>action.</b> These postures cause courtship by attended males (Fig. 10 C, D), especially by the largest one. The prespawning acts by a pair used to continue for half a day or more. The oviposition (Fig. 11 A, B, C) occurs in the center of finished depression and 20 to 100 eggs are shed into the crevices of gravel in it (Fig. 12 A, Table 3). Immeadiately after this, the mated male attacks his partner suddenly (Fig. 11 D). The female not only remains on her redd withstanding his attacks, but she makes violent counterattacks against him (Fig. 11 E). Thus, a series of fierce fight follows about 15 minutes. Soon after, the female starts undulating by swinging her body laterally (Fig. 12 B, C). After a quarter hour of this undulating, the males leave the redd and the female begins to dig the bottom at an area of about 20 cm upstream the eggs. The eggs in the depression are thus filled up gradually with the fine sand and gravel which are stirred up with postspawning digging actions of the female. Such postspawning acts generally continue for 2 to 5 hours. But sometimes, in several hours after the first oviposition the males appear again near the female who is making another depression slightly upstream site from the previous one and they repeat the same acts {{as they did in the}} first prespawning period. The next oviposition is usually seen in 20 to 30 hours after the first. Two or 3 days are necessary for 2 times of oviposition. The eyed eggs of gogi-char we r e obtained on December 15, 1962 from a spawning redd in Inkyo-no-tani, a tributary of Haza River (Fig. 2 C). These eggs were measured 5. 1 to 5. 4 mm in diameter and began to hatch on December 19. The newly hatched alevins (Fig, 13 A) preserving in 70...|$|E

The female lays clusters of eggs in cracks in the bark and the larvae feed on the inner bark and outermost layer of wood. They produce long, zig-zag galleries in the tissues of the tree as they <b>dig.</b> This <b>action</b> causes girdling of the tree, preventing the circulation of nutrients through its tissues.

50|$|The Glo Friends {{peaceful}} {{existence is}} threatened constantly by the Moligans, {{a group of}} mole-like creatures led by Starnose. The Moligans were banished from the kingdom of Moleslavia by King Mole for various crimes including unlawful <b>digging,</b> mob <b>action,</b> robbery, looting and cheating. Since their banishment, the Moligans have been living underground and planning revenge against King Mole. Since the Moligans are short-sighted, they were unsuccessful in harvesting gold from the nearby mines. As such, the Moligans have attempted to enslave the Glo Friends to power their lanterns, which {{would enable them to}} see in the mines, harvest the gold and buy out the kingdom of Moleslavia.|$|R
40|$|Animals that forage {{for food}} or dig burrows by biopedturbation {{can alter the}} biotic and abiotic {{characteristics}} of their habitat. The digging activities of such ecosystem engineers, although small at a local scale, may be important for broader scale landscape processes by influencing soil and litter properties, trapping organic matter and seeds, and subsequently altering seedling recruitment. We examined environmental characteristics (soil moisture content, hydrophobicity and litter composition) of foraging pits created by the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus; Peramelidae), a digging Australian marsupial, over a 6 -month period. Fresh diggings typically contained a higher moisture content and lower hydrophobicity than undisturbed soil. A month later, foraging pits contained greater amounts of fine litter and lower amounts of coarse litter than adjacent undug surfaces, indicating that foraging pits may provide a conducive microhabitat for litter decomposition, potentially reducing litter loads and enhancing nutrient decomposition. We tested whether diggings might affect seedling recruitment (seed removal by seed harvesters and seed germination rates) by artificially mimicking diggings. Although {{there were no differences}} in the removal of seeds, seedling recruitment for three native plant species (Acacia saligna, Kennedia prostrata and Eucalyptus gomphocephala) was higher in plots containing artificial diggings compared with undug sites. The <b>digging</b> <b>actions</b> of bandicoots influenced soil moisture and hydrophobicity, the size distribution of litter and seedling recruitment at a local scale. The majority of Australian digging mammals are threatened, with many suffering substantial population and range contraction. However, their persistence in landscapes {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the health and function of ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|A presente pesquisa intitulada: Negro Intelectual, Intelectual Negro ou Negro-Intelectual: considerações do processo de constituir-se negro-intelectual, objetivou compreender processos em que negros e negras têm se constituído intelectuais e identificar no que suas experiências de homens e mulheres negros ao formarem-se intelectuais podem contribuir para a educação das relações étnico-raciais. Para tanto, valho-me da questão da pesquisa: Que processos estão presentes no constituir-se negro(a) intelectual? A construção metodológica do presente trabalho se apoia em princípios da Fenomenológica, que inspira a postura do pesquisador em relação ao objeto da investigação, aos participantes da pesquisa, aos processos de coleta, análise e interpretação dos dados. Realizaram-se conversas aprofundadas com três profissionais, autodeclarados negros, reconhecidos como intelectuais, com o objetivo de compreender significados de processos vividos por negros e negras ao se constituírem intelectuais. A pesquisa permitiu compreender que ao ir se constituir negro/a e intelectual, há um mutuo fortalecimento tanto da pessoa negra como da comunidade da qual faz parte. Permitiu também identificar não só os estudos escolares e universitários como lugares de formação, mas também influências familiares, sensibilidade para perceber e estudar realidades sociais que atingem os negros e notadamente a convivência e lutas junto ao Movimento Negro. Os negros intelectuais buscam agir na coletividade, em dialogo com a comunidade negra, com outros intelectuais e a sociedade em geral. Sua formação procede nas seguintes dimensões: Tornar-se negro: um testemunho de negritude; Cavando espaços: ações, reações e articulações; Definições e ideias de quem seja negro(a) intelectual; Persistência e Militância: como se estivesse malhando em ferro frio; A luta continua: esperança e perseverança. This {{research}} entitled "Black Intellectual, Intellectual Black or Black-Intellectual: {{notes of}} the process of becoming Black-intellectual", aimed at understanding processes in which Black men and women have made himself / herself in intellectual and identify their experiences of men and women Blacks to form up and intellectuals can contribute to the education of ethnic-racial relations. For this purpose, I make the use of the research question: What processes are present in the form themselves as Black intellectuals? The methodology of the present research is based on principles of Phenomenological that inspires the researcher's stance in relation to the object of research, the research participants, the processes of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data. There were three in-depth conversations with professionals, self-identified Blacks, recognized as intellectuals, with the goal of understanding the meanings of processes experienced by Black men and women as they constitute intellectual. The research allowed an understanding that to constitute themselves as Black and as intellectual, there is a mutual strengthening of both: the Black person and the community to which they belong. Also identified not only studies schools and universities as places of education but also family influences, sensitivity to perceive and study social realities that affect Blacks and especially coexistence and fights with the Black Movement. The Black intellectuals seek to act in the community, in dialogue with the Black community, with other intellectuals and society in general. Its education proceeds in the following dimensions: Becoming Black: a testimony of Blackness; <b>Digging</b> spaces: <b>actions,</b> reactions and joints; Definitions and ide as of who is Black intellectual; Persistence and Militancy: as if youre working out in cold iron...|$|R
