5|$|Beonna (also {{known as}} Beorna) was King of East Anglia from 749. He is notable {{for being the}} first East Anglian king whose coinage {{included}} both the ruler's name and his title. The end-date of Beonna's reign is not known, but may have been around 760. It is thought that he shared the kingdom with another ruler called Alberht and possibly with a third man, named Hun. Not all <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> with these regnal dates, or {{the nature of his}} kingship: {{it has been suggested that}} he may have ruled alone (and free of Mercian domination) from around 758.|$|E

5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} is controversial, {{and not all}} <b>experts</b> <b>agree,</b> {{particularly with}} the recent {{increase in the number}} of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, there are nearly 100recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related to living lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17species can be included in the total. In contrast, other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial, although most <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> {{on the same}} phylogenetic tree. In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (lorisids and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the aye-aye was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, {{while the rest of}} the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.|$|E

Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{the current}} {{clinical}} guideline of diagnostic {{criteria for the}} complex regional pain syndrome I (CRPS I) is a landmark endeavour to define this complex condition it does not prioritise its most important clinical manifestations. AIM: We set out to obtain an <b>expert</b> <b>agreed</b> priority list of diagnostic and follow-up parameters in the diagnosis and management of CRPS I. METHODS: A two round Delphi survey: We asked international experts to list (first round) and weight (second round) parameters (scale 1 - 10) they believed to be relevant in diagnosis and follow-up. Median ratings and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated. Rates 7 and IQR 3 depicted important and <b>expert</b> <b>agreed</b> parameters. RESULTS: Thirty-two diagnostic and 23 follow-up listings and ratings of 13 experts were available for analysis. In three domains (clinical presentation, further examinations and follow-up) <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> on the following parameters, pain (10; 9 - 10) with its subcategories hyperesthesia (7; 5 - 8) hyperalgesia (8; 8 - 8) and allodynia (8; 7 - 10), signs with oedema (9; 8 - 10) and colour change (8; 5 - 8) and mobility with its categories motor change (7; 5 - 8) and decreased range of motion (8; 8 - 8). The <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> that no further examinations were necessary for diagnosis (10; 8 - 10). The agreed important follow-up parameter was clinical course (10; 8 - 10) with its categories decrease in pain (8; 8 - 9) and hyperalgesia (8; 6 - 8), decreased oedema (8; 7 - 10) and improvements in motor function (10; 8 - 10) and strength (8; 6 - 9). CONCLUSION: This expert survey conveys an agreed set of relevant diagnostic parameters of CRPS I and proposes that in follow-up examinations treatment success {{should be based on}} restoration of those manifestations...|$|R

5000|$|Under high elaboration, a given {{variable}} (e.g., expertise) {{can serve}} as an argument (e.g., [...] "If Einstein agrees with the theory of relativity, then this is a strong {{reason for me to}} as well") or a biasing factor (e.g., [...] "If an <b>expert</b> <b>agrees</b> with this position it is probably good, so let me see who else agrees with this conclusion"), at the expense of contradicting information. Under low-elaboration conditions, a variable may act as a peripheral cue (e.g., the belief that [...] "experts are always right"). While this is similar to the Einstein example above, this is a shortcut which (unlike the Einstein example) does not require thought.

25|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>agree</b> hand-washing {{can help}} prevent viral infections, {{including}} ordinary and the swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu.

Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers work well to destroy viruses and bacteria. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, such as a sudden fever, cough or muscle aches, should stay away from work or public transportation, and should contact a doctor for advice.|$|E

There is an international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep underground repositories, but no country in the world has yet opened such a site.
