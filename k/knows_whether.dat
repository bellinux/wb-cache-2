5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus <b>knows</b> <b>whether</b> {{its arms}} are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one <b>knows</b> <b>whether</b> a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1906 election, Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership, and saw this {{in the form of}} his fellow-writer H. G. Wells, who had joined the society in February 1903. Wells's ideas for reform—particularly his {{proposals}} for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party—placed him at odds with the society's [...] "Old Gang", led by Shaw. According to Cole, Wells [...] "had minimal capacity for putting [...] across in public meetings against Shaw's trained and practised virtuosity". In Shaw's view, [...] "the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells, he annihilated himself". Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member, but left the executive in April 1911. He later wondered whether the Old Gang should have given way to Wells some years earlier: [...] "God only <b>knows</b> <b>whether</b> the Society had not better have done it". Although less active—he blamed his advancing years—Shaw remained a Fabian.|$|E

500|$|According to Rowson, White's first {{advantage}} is that, [...] "The {{advantage of the}} first move has some similarities with the serve in tennis in that White can score an 'ace' (for instance with a powerful opening novelty), he has {{more control over the}} pace and direction of the game, and he has a 'second serve' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing." [...] Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, [...] "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." [...] Third, some players are able to use the initiative to [...] "play a kind of powerful 'serve and volley' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess." [...] Fourth, [...] "If White wants to draw, it is often not so easy for Black to prevent this. This {{advantage is}} particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he <b>knows</b> <b>whether</b> White is bluffing." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{controversy}} over authorship of Frankenstein, as both Shelley {{and her husband}} collaborated on the story. The extent to which Percy Shelley contributed to the novel is unknown. Since Frankenstein was published anonymously in 1818, readers and critics argued over its origins and {{the contributions of the}} two Shelleys to the book. [...] There are differences in the 1818, 1823, and 1831 editions, and Mary Shelley wrote, [...] "I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband, and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world." [...] She wrote that the preface to the first edition was Percy's work [...] "as far as I can recollect." [...] James Rieger concluded Percy's [...] "assistance at every point in the book's manufacture was so extensive that one hardly <b>knows</b> <b>whether</b> to regard him as editor or minor collaborator", while Anne K. Mellor later argued Percy only [...] "made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text." [...] Charles E. Robinson, editor of a facsimile edition of the Frankenstein manuscripts, concluded that Percy's contributions to the book [...] "were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors or, in fact, what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other's works in progress." ...|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{fought in}} the wars against Denmark, Austria and France. Although he had opposed {{military}} action in each case, once war had started he supported the Prussian military wholeheartedly and took positions of command. Since he had no political influence at all, these were opportunities to prove himself. Frederick experienced his first combat in the Second Schleswig War. Appointed to supervise the supreme German Confederation commander Field Marshal Wrangel and his staff, the Crown Prince tactfully managed disputes between Wrangel and the other officers. The Prussians and their Austrian allies defeated the Danes and conquered {{the southern part of}} Jutland, but after the war they spent two years politicking to assume leadership of the German states. This culminated in the Austro-Prussian War. Frederick [...] "was {{the only member of the}} Prussian Crown Council to uphold the rights of the Duke of Augustenberg and oppose the idea of a war with Austria which he described as fratricide." [...] Although he supported unification and the restoration of the medieval empire, [...] "Fritz could not accept that war was the right way to unite Germany.". However, when war with Austria broke out, he accepted command of one of Prussia's three armies, with General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal as his chief of staff. The timely arrival of his II Army was crucial to the Prussian victory in 1866 at the decisive Battle of Königgrätz, which won the war for Prussia. After the battle, William presented Frederick with the Order Pour le Mérite for his personal gallantry on the field and leadership of the II Army. Nevertheless, the bloodshed caused him great dismay. A few days before Königgrätz, Frederick had written to his wife, expressing his hope that this would be the last war he would have to fight. On the third day of the battle he wrote to her again: [...] "Who <b>knows</b> <b>whether</b> we may not have to wage a third war in order to keep what we have now won?" ...|$|E

[...] In describing the merits of the poem and its fragmentary state, he claimed, [...] "The poem stands for itself: beautiful, sensuous and enigmatic." [...] During the same year, Jack Stillinger claimed that [...] "Coleridge wrote only a few poems of the first rank – perhaps no more than a dozen, all told – and he seems to have taken a very casual attitude toward them ... he kept 'Kubla Khan' in manuscript for nearly twenty years before offering it to the public 'rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the grounds of any supposed poetic merits'". Harold Bloom, in 2010, argued that Coleridge wrote two kinds of poems and that [...] "The daemonic group, necessarily more famous, is the triad of The Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and 'Kubla Khan.'" [...] He goes on to explain the [...] "daemonic": [...] "Opium was the avenging daemon or alastor of Coleridge's life, his dark or fallen angel, his experiential acquaintance with Milton's Satan. Opium was for him what wandering and moral tale-telling became for the Mariner – the personal shape of repetition compulsion. The lust for paradise in 'Kubla Khan,' Geraldine's lust for Christabel – these are manifestations of Coleridge's revisionary daemonization of Milton, these are Coleridge's countersublime. Poetic genius, the genial spirit itself, Coleridge must see as daemonic when it is his own rather than when it is Milton's." ...|$|E
