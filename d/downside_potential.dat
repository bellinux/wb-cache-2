5000|$|Sex {{differences}} in financial decision making are relevant and significant. Numerous {{studies have found}} that women tend to be financially more risk-averse than men and hold safer portfolios. A May 3, 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal by Georgette Jasen reported that [...] "when it comes to investing, men sometimes have their way of doing things, and women have different ways." [...] Scholarly research has documented systematic {{differences in}} financial decisions such as buying investments versus insurance, donating to ingroups versus outgroups (such as terrorism victims in Iraq versus USA), spending in stores, and the endowment effect-or asking price for goods people have. The majority of these studies are based on the theory of agency-communion developed by David Bakan in 1966; according to this theory, due to factors such as socialization, males are typically more agentic (focus on self, upside potential, aggressiveness) and females typically more communal (focus on others, <b>downside</b> <b>potential,</b> and nurturing). This framework robustly explains many financial decision making outcomes.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of “risk ” {{is a critical}} component of enterprise risk management, insurance pricing and reserving, and strategic and operational decision-making. Some commonly used measures attempt to quantify risk by considering volatility or downside “potential. ” Other measures examine ratios of upside versus <b>downside</b> <b>potential,</b> or upside potential versus volatility. A general characteristic of such measures is that they describe risk in a single dimension – placing risk along a number line and providing a single quantitative value. In this paper, we suggest that risk is too complex to quantify with a single number. We suggest a two-dimensional risk measure, and introduce the concept of iso-risk curves...|$|E

40|$|Last Years have {{witnessed}} increasing interest in stochastic claims reserving method. Probably {{the lack of}} need for this methods and the major complexity produced a low diffusion.

40|$|Arguing that a {{relatively}} high cost of deposit insurance indicates that a bank takes excessive risks, this article estimates the cost of deposit insurance for a large sample of banks in 14 economies to assess {{the relationship between the}} risk-taking behavior of banks and their corporate governance structure. The results suggest that banks with concentrated ownership tend to take the greatest risks, and those with dispersed own-ership engage in {{a relatively}} low level of risk taking. Moreover, as a proxy for bank risk, the cost of deposit insurance has some power in predicting bank distress. Banking crises have shown not only that banks often take excessive risks but that risk taking differs across banks. Some banks engage in more risks than their capital could bear if the <b>downside</b> <b>potential</b> of the risks fully materialized; oth-ers are more prudent and would be able to weather a banking crisis. Whether different types of banks take different risks is not well known.

40|$|This study investigates to {{what extent}} extreme {{confidence}} of either management or security analysts may impact financial or operating performance. We construct a multidimensional degree of company confidence measure {{from a wide range}} of corporate decisions. We empirically test this measure for large US companies from 1980 - 2008 and find significantly different company and performance characteristics between confidence extremes. Diffident firms tend to be smaller, more distressed, less conservatively financed and, except for the new millennium, yield a lower return on invested capital with higher variability. When adjusting stock returns for risk, the performance differences prior to moving to extreme confidence become even more pronounced. Extreme confidence could also distort earnings forecasts as analyst may overly rely on an anchor or make insufficient adjustments. Innate bias, anchoring to prior year earnings, risk attitude and responses to recent news are conditional on the level of analysis. Innate optimism prevails on the industry and analyst level. We find no support for anchoring by analysts with a long track record or across industries, which suggests a bottom-up approach. Long-term risk is considered as upside and short-term risk as <b>downside</b> <b>potential.</b> There is also a tendency to underreact to news, the extent of which seems conditional on the direction...|$|E

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) Financial {{institutions}} and regulatory {{bodies of the}} financial services industry have, {{in the last decade}} of the 20 th century, woken up to the realisation that the risk management procedures adopted and promoted by them did not take into account all the risks to which financial institutions were exposed. The one risk category, made up by an array of risks, that has been acknowledged by financial {{institutions and}} regulatory bodies for some time, but that has not received much recognition in the risk management procedures is operational risk. This is quite ironic, as operational risk is the only 'pure" risk, i. e. the only risk with only a <b>downside</b> <b>potential.</b> Credit, market and underwriting risk, on the other hand, could result in profits if managed properly. But the losses to which operational risk exposes a financial institution can be minimised through effective risk management. Purpose The greatest obstacle in the process of operational risk management is the fact that there is no universally accepted definition of operational risk. The main purpose of this study is to perform an empirical study of the discipline of operational risk management. This includes research on the subject of operational risk management, assessing the problems experienced in the operational risk management field, considering the different operational risk strategies that exist and evaluating qualitative operational risk methodologies as well as the problems experienced in quantifying operational risk. In conclusion, a definition for operational risk is suggested, based on the research conducted...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{depleting}} an oil reservoir can be poured into an optimal control {{problem with the}} objective to maximize economic performance {{over the life of}} the ?eld. Despite its large potential, life-cycle optimization has not yet found its way into operational environments. The objective of this thesis is to improve operational applicability of model-based optimization of oil recovery. The reluctance of oil and gas companies to adopt this technology in their operational environments can mainly be contributed to the large uncertainties that come into play when optimizing production over the entire life of a ?eld and - in effect - the lack of faith that exists in the available methods and models. These uncertainties are of varying nature and originate from different sources. This leads to the main research question of this thesis: Can the performance of model-based life-cycle optimization of oil and gas production in realistic circumstances be improved by addressing un-certainty in the optimization problem? In this thesis, two approaches to address this research question are presented, related to the choice for a ?xed or adaptive operational strategy. For a ?xed strategy, three methods are described: hierarchical optimization, robust optimization, and integrated dynamic optimization and feedback control. For adaptive operational strategies, two aspects are investigated in a more exploratory setting: the combination of different data sources and the frequency of sequential model updating and re-optimization. The methods laid out in this thesis provide improved economic life-cycle performance under uncertainty in a number of examples. While presented as separate methods, they are not mutually exclusive and could be combined into a single work?ow. Although all the examples involve water?ooding as recovery mechanism, the scope for life-cycle optimization may be larger for enhanced (tertiary) oil recovery methods because of the generally higher up- and <b>downside</b> <b>potential</b> of these techniques. Application of the methods on a real petroleum reservoir is still required to evaluate their merit in a truly realistic environment. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic decline curve {{analysis}} (PDCA) {{methods have}} been developed to quantify uncertainty in production forecasts and reserves estimates. However, the application of PDCA in shale gas reservoirs is relatively new. Limited work has been done on the performance of PDCA methods when the available production data are limited. In addition, PDCA methods have often been coupled with Arp?s equations, which might not be the optimum decline curve analysis model (DCA) to use, as new DCA models for shale reservoirs have been developed. Also, decline curve methods are based on production data only and do not by themselves incorporate other types of information, such as volumetric data. My research objective was to integrate volumetric information with PDCA methods and DCA models to reliably quantify the uncertainty in production forecasts from hydraulically fractured horizontal shale gas wells, regardless of the stage of depletion. In this work, hindcasts of multiple DCA models coupled to different probabilistic methods were performed to determine the reliability of the probabilistic DCA methods. In a hindcast, only a portion of the historical data is matched; predictions are made {{for the remainder of the}} historical period and compared to the actual historical production. Most of the DCA models were well calibrated visually when used with an appropriate probabilistic method, regardless of the amount of production data available to match. Volumetric assessments, used as prior information, were incorporated to further enhance the calibration of production forecasts and reserves estimates when using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as the PDCA method and the logistic growth DCA model. The proposed combination of the MCMC PDCA method, the logistic growth DCA model, and use of volumetric data provides an integrated procedure to reliably quantify the uncertainty in production forecasts and reserves estimates in shale gas reservoirs. Reliable quantification of uncertainty should yield more reliable expected values of reserves estimates, as well as more reliable assessment of upside and <b>downside</b> <b>potential.</b> This can be particularly valuable early in the development of a play, because decisions regarding continued development are based to a large degree on production forecasts and reserves estimates for early wells in the play...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the value of {{long-term}} follow-up for localised cutaneous melanoma from the patients' perspective. This study aimed to explore the benefits and <b>potential</b> <b>downsides</b> of follow-up; feelings about changes to frequency of follow-up, and patient-centred recommendations for improving follow-up care. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of 29 in-depth interviews conducted with Australian patients undergoing long-term follow-up after surgical treatment of stage I/II melanoma. RESULTS: Patient-perceived benefits of follow-up included reassurance, early detection of new melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancers, education about skin self-examination, the opportunity to ask questions, and reinforcement of 'sunsafe' behaviours. Downsides included anxiety leading up to and during follow-up visits; inconvenience of travel to attend visits; and lost work time. Patients varied in their engagement with skin self-examination, and their views on multiple skin excisions, but highly valued access to specialists for unscheduled visits. Most patients felt their follow-up intervals could be extended to 12 months if recommended by their clinician. CONCLUSION: The benefits and <b>potential</b> <b>downsides</b> of follow-up should be discussed with patients when deciding on a melanoma follow-up plan to achieve a balance between inducing additional patient anxiety and providing reassurance. Follow-up intervals of 12 months appear to be acceptable to patients. Research papers and publications, NHMRC CT...|$|R
