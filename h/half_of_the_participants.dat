25|$|Third culture individuals, {{with their}} {{international}} experience, generally continue to value the international {{aspect of their}} lives. In a survey given to TCKs in 2001, {{there was a strong}} interest among TCK participants to continue to travel as they move into adulthood and their future careers, and many continued to maintain their internationally acquired languages. It was also found in these surveys that approximately <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> continue to travel {{at least once a year}} and that just a little under 15 percent travel for business. TCKs have also been found to report selecting to study majors while in college that could have the options of having international careers. Some of these fields of study include business, nursing, and teaching English as a foreign language.|$|E

25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (<b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
500|$|Jones, Pelham, Carvallo and Mirenberg {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} number preference on interpersonal attraction. In a lab study they showed US participants text profiles of people. The profiles came with a prominently displayed, seemingly arbitrary code that was explained as merely to help the researchers {{keep track of the}} profiles. One <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were shown a code that matched their birthday (e.g. someone born on 8 September saw a partner profile with the code [...] "09-08"); the other half a non-matching code (e.g. [...] "03-23"). All participants were shown exactly the same profile. They had to rate how much they thought they would like the person in the profile. The results showed that participants liked the profiles significantly more when the code matched their own birthday numbers. Relative to participants in the control condition, participants in the birthday-association condition could {{at the end of the}} test more accurately recall the code, but only 5 of 110 participants mentioned the matching code as a potential influence. Jones et al. concluded that people’s preferences for their own birthday numbers are potent enough to influence people’s attraction to other people. Pelham and Carvallo subsequently looked at interpersonal attraction using field data. They used statewide marriage records to conclude that people disproportionately marry people who share their birthday numbers. They also found that brides disproportionately chose their own birthday numbers and birth months as wedding dates.|$|E

In addition to manipulating the perceived effort invested by the artist, researchers also varied the ambiguity of the stimulus to examine its potential as a moderator {{in the use of the}} effort heuristic.

50|$|This {{mechanism}} {{was tested}} by Pinter {{and his colleagues}} experimentally. <b>Half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were prompted to incorporate the information they were given into their self-concept. They were instructed to find similarities between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information described them. This process was termed integration. The other <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were prompted to separate the information from their self-concept. They {{were asked to identify}} differences between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information did not describe them. This process was termed separation. The first finding of the experiment was that recall for both positive and negative information was poorer for separation than for integration. However, recognition was the same between the two groups. The second finding was that self-protection is more important that self-enhancement. A greater effect was seen for attempting to integrate central negative information than for attempting to separate central positive information.|$|E
5000|$|Gable and Harmon-Jones [...] have {{manipulated}} motivational intensity using {{a delayed}} monetary incentive paradigm. Gable and Harmon-Jones {{asked participants to}} respond to shapes that were presented on a computer screen. <b>Half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were told that participants could gain money when circles, but not squares {{appeared on the screen}} (pre-goal; high motivational intensity). <b>Half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were not given this instruction. Next, neutral words were presented either centrally or peripherally on the screen. Participants then completed a goal-related flanker task, where they were told that if they were faster than average on each trial, they could gain money on that trial (post-goal; low motivational intensity). Finally, participants’ memory for the words was tested. Results suggested that compared to the neutral condition, high motivational intensity (i.e., pre-goal) lead to better memory for centrally presented information and low motivational intensity (i.e., post-goal) lead to better memory for peripherally presented information. In Experiment 2, these effects were replicated using desirable (e.g., desserts) and neutral pictures.|$|E
