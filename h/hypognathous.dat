5|$|The head is {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a <b>hypognathous</b> and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E
25|$|The mouthparts, {{along with}} the rest of the head, can be {{articulated}} in at least three different positions: prognathous, opisthognathous, and <b>hypognathous.</b> In species with prognathous articulation, the head is positioned vertically aligned with the body, such as species of Formicidae; while in a <b>hypognathous</b> type, the head is aligned horizontally adjacent to the body. An opisthognathous head is positioned diagonally, such as species of Blattodea and some Coleoptera. The mouthparts vary greatly between insects of different orders, but the two main functional groups are mandibulate and haustellate. Haustellate mouthparts are used for sucking liquids and can be further classified by the presence of stylets, which include piercing-sucking, sponging, and siphoning. The stylets are needle-like projections used to penetrate plant and animal tissues. The stylets and the feeding tube form the modified mandibles, maxilla, and hypopharynx.|$|E

25|$|On the {{posterior}} {{aspect of the}} head are the occiput, postgena, occipital foramen, posterior tentorial pit, gula, postgenal bridge, hypostomal suture and bridge, and the mandibles, labium, and maxilla. The occipital suture is well founded in species of Orthoptera, {{but not so much}} in other orders. Where found, the occipital suture is the arched, horseshoe-shaped groove {{on the back of the}} head, ending at {{the posterior}} of each mandible. The postoccipital suture is a landmark on the posterior surface of the head, and is typically near the occipital foremen. In pterygotes, the postocciput forms the extreme posterior, often U-shaped, which forms the rim of the head extending to the postoccipital suture. In pterygotes, such as those of Orthoptera, the occipital foramen and the mouth are not separated. The three types of occipital closures, or points under the occipital foramen that separate the two lower halves of the postgena, are: the hypostomal bridge, the postgenal bridge, and the gula. The hypostomal bridge is usually found in insects with <b>hypognathous</b> orientation. The postgenal bridge is found in the adults of species of higher Diptera and aculeate Hymenoptera, while the gula is found on some Coleoptera, Neuroptera, and Isoptera, which typically display prognathous-oriented mouthparts.|$|E

50|$|The larva is apodous, {{cylindrical}} and elongated, {{more or less}} flattened dorso-ventrally and tapered at the cephalic and caudal ends. The colour {{is white}} or yellowish. The head is small, rugged, dark pigmented and <b>hypognathous,</b> the abdomen is composed of 8 apparent urites, with the last two often fused and more or less reduced. The respiratory system is amphineustic, with two pairs of spiracles, one thoracic and one abdominal. There are also rudimentary and nonfunctional stigmas in other abdominal segments.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{the larvae}} of apocritan Hymenoptera, larvae of Orussidae have reduced some {{morphological}} features {{as a result}} of their parasitic life style inside the tunnels of wood-boring insects. They are white, subcylindrical, weakly sclerotized with a distinct head capsule. The mouthparts are <b>hypognathous.</b> Eyes and legs are reduced or completely absent. The mandibles are well developed and strongly sclerotized. Palps of maxilla and labium lack. The surface of the body is subdivided into distinct segments, each bearing a transverse row of 8−10 backward pointing spines.|$|E
5000|$|The head is {{distinct}} from the thorax, with a marked narrowing at the neck. In [...] "lower flies" [...] (Nematocera), it is prognathous (head horizontally oriented with the mouth anterior), in [...] "higher flies" [...] (Brachycera) it is <b>hypognathous</b> (head vertically oriented with the mouth ventrad).The shape of the cranial capsule also varies. In the Nematocera, the dorsal-ventral part of the head extends forward from the eyes due to the development in length of the clypeus and subgenal area (subgena), the distal end of the extension is the 'mouthparts'.|$|E

5000|$|The {{black and}} white pattern of adults is {{believed}} to have evolved to mimic the pattern of the aggressive ground beetle Anthia sexguttata that has strong defenses, including the ability to spray chemical irritants. The upperside of the abdomen is orange-yellow, but is hidden by the tegmina. The spots on the asymmetrical tegmina are placed so that when closed, the spots appear symmetrical. The right tegmen lobe is bright orange-yellow. The species has been said {{to be one of the}} few cockroaches with [...] "grace and beauty". The head is bent back underneath the pronotal shield (<b>hypognathous)</b> and the ocelli (simple eyes) face forward, helping sense light and thereby time foraging activity during early morning and late evening.|$|E

5000|$|Heads of sawflies vary in size, {{shape and}} sturdiness, {{as well as}} the {{positions}} of the eyes and antennae. They are characterised in four head types: open head, maxapontal head, closed head and genapontal head. The open head is simplistic, whereas all the other heads are derived. The head is also <b>hypognathous,</b> meaning that the lower mouthparts are directed downwards. When in use, the mouthparts may be directed forwards, but this is only caused when the sawfly swings its entire head forward in a pendulum motion. Unlike most primitive insects, the sutures (rigid joints between two or more hard elements on an organism) and sclerites (hardened body parts) are obsolescent or absent. The clypeus (a sclerite that makes up an insects [...] "face") is not divided into a pre- and postclypeus, but rather separated from the front. The antennal sclerites are fused with the surrounding head capsule, but these are sometimes separated by a suture. The number of segments in the antennae vary from six in the Accorduleceridae to 30 or more in the Pamphiliidae. The compound eyes are large with a number of facets, and there are three ocelli between the dorsal portions of the compound eyes. The tentorium comprises the whole inner skeleton of the head.|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Taylor & Francis {{and can be found}} at: [URL] new genus and species of bostrichid, Discoclavata dominicana n. gen., n. sp., (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and a new genus and species of eucnemid, Lissantauga epicrana n. gen., n. sp. (Coleoptera: Eucnemidae) are described from Dominican amber. Diagnostic characters of Discoclavata dominicana include an extended body, strongly <b>hypognathous</b> head, asparate dorsal surfaces of pronotum and elytra, 10 antennomeres with a large, oval two-articled club, flattened and grooved metafemora that receive the flatted metatibia, 5 -segmented, slender tarsi with the first tarsomere miniscule, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th tarsomeres small, subequal and fifth tarsomere longer than the others combined. Diagnostic characters of Lissantauga epicrana include a glabrous, silvery metallic body, pectinate antennae with the antennal insertions positioned below the eyes, a helmet-shaped pronotum with the anterior angles nearly reaching the antennal insertions, the antennae close to the eyes, angled apical margins of the elytra and a long first tarsomere.

40|$|The ongoing {{exploration}} of biodiversity and {{the implementation of}} new molecular tools continue to unveil hitherto unknown lineages. Here, we report the discovery of three species of neotenic beetles for which we propose the new family Iberobaeniidae. Complete mitochondrial genomes and rRNA genes recovered Iberobaeniidae as a deep branch in Elateroidea, as sister to Lycidae (net-winged beetles). Two species of the new genus Iberobaenia, Iberobaenia minuta sp. nov. and Iberobaenia lencinai sp. nov. {{were found in the}} adult stage. In a separate incidence, a related sequence was identified in bulk samples of soil invertebrates subjected to shotgun sequencing and mitogenome assembly, which was traced to a larval voucher specimen of a third species of Iberobaenia. Iberobaenia shows characters shared with other elateroid neotenic lineages, including soft-bodiedness, the <b>hypognathous</b> head, reduced mouthparts with reduced labial palpomeres, and extremely small-bodied males without strengthening structures due to miniaturization. Molecular dating shows that Iberobaeniidae represents an ancient relict lineage originating in the Lower Jurassic, which possibly indicates a long history of neoteny, usually considered to be evolutionarily short-lived. The apparent endemism of Iberobaeniidae in the Mediterranean region highlights the importance of this biodiversity hotspot and the need for further species exploration even in the well-studied European continent...|$|E
40|$|Odonates are ecologically {{important}} as both predators and prey. Their larvae constitute a natural biological control over mosquito larvae and thus help to control several epidemic diseases like malaria, dengue, filaria etc. In this study; the Dragonfly, Anax parthenope (♂:♀) {{has been identified}} {{for the first time}} at region Sukkur, Sindh - Pakistan. The study was mainly emphasized on morphological differences between male and female specimen. Both male and female specimens were having some same but mostly different characteristics. Like both male and female had large green compound eyes touching dorsally, head was found <b>hypognathous,</b> thorax dark green with visible thoraxic segments, male had slightly larger than female wings, bigger in size and more colorful. Which was very rare in insects, fore and hind wings were not similar, forewing narrow and elongated whereas; the hind wings were broad basally, distal part of the wing was yellowish, abdomen was black dorsally and ventrally but found greenish from lateral side. It was concluded that there was a lot of potential to explore Odonata fauna of this region. The climate and topography of this area along with lot of natural pastures and aquatic bodies support dragonflies’ life and biology. However, due to rapid increase in urbanization, suitable habitats of odonata were disappearing at an alarming rate. Thus, only single specie was found. Further surveys and necessary conservation measures were also adopted, therefore, suggested as need of the day to utilize it, in right direction after knowing its species complex...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{order to}} study the biology of Mylabris impressa stillata, which little is known about, a {{laboratory}} colony was established. Methods: In this descriptive study, the laboratory colony was collected from Toyserkan County in Hamedan Province, Iran. To feed the larval instars, a parallel colony of the grasshopper, Schistocerca gregaria was set-up. Meloid females lived for several months and laid egg masses with the intervals of about 2 weeks. The first instar larvae, named triungulin, were heav-ily sclerotized, campodiform, prognathous, and highly mobile. They were fed with fresh eggs of Schistocerca gregaria and the pollen paste. This stage was followed by five FG instars which are weakly sclerotized and <b>hypognathous.</b> After a week of being fed, FG 5 started digging the soil and subsequently was changed to a coarctate larva which characterized by diapause. Results: We succeeded to break such a diapause in laboratory by chilling at 5 º C for four months. Thereafter, the larvae moulted {{to the next step}} which is called the Second Grub larvae. SG did not feed and was moulted to pupa in the same moist soil. New adults generally rested for three or four days following emergence, their feeding began at the adult age of a week and sexual behaviour normally appeared at a mean age of about 10 days. The complete life cycle of Mylabris impressa took about nine months. Conclusion: Laboratory rearing of blister beetles remains the best tool for ecological and chemical research as well as nup-tial gift studies, but very labour intensive and time consuming with low yield...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMacedonethes stankoi n. sp. is described, a truly aquatic {{species with}} special {{morphological}} adaptations {{to life in}} running water. Diagnosis of Macedonethes stankoi n. sp. (Fig. 1) : Species with the characters diagnostic for Macedonethes Buturović, 1955 (see also Tabacaru 1993). Blind. Body large (up to 15. 7 mm long), rather convex. Defined mostly by characters interpreted as adaptations to life in rhithral habitats: cephalon <b>hypognathous,</b> antennular article 3 and aesthetascs reduced to varying degree (from slightly developed with two aesthetascs to almost totally reduced); pereopods 1 – 4 subchelate, i. e. with elongate carpus opposed to propodus and dactylus (enabling the animal to attach tightly to the substrate); sternum of pereonite 5 with unique clasping structures (presumably facilitating copulation); exopod of male pleopod 1 remarkably dilated mediodistally; endopod of male pleopod 2 with arched apical article; exopods of pleopods 2 – 5 with long plumose setae on posterior margins; epimera of pleonites 3 – 5 well developed. Types and locality: Holotype male (Macedonian Museum of Natural History, Skopje; Inv. No. 2783); Macedonia, Jakupica Mt., slopes of Solunska glava peak, from a spring in the cave at {{the source of the}} Babuna River, 1500 m asl (UTM-EM 31), 18. 08. 2000, leg. G. Poliić. Paratypes: 4 males and 2 females as holotype (Inv. No. 2784); 2 males and 1 female as holotype, except in author's collection; 1 male and 1 female as holotype, except in Museo Zoologico “La Specola”, University of Florence, Italy. Spelaeonethes castellonensis Cruz & Dalens, 1989 clearly differs from the characteristics of Spelaeonethes species, particularly in structures of the male merus 7 and the endopods of male pleopods 2. Published descriptions and illustrations demonstrate obvious close relations with the type species of Macedonethes, M. skopjensis Buturovic, 1955, especially regarding all characters considered diagnostic for that genus. Therefore, the new combination Macedonethes castellonensis (Cruz & Dalens) is proposed. A detailed description (including color plates), further discussion of adaptations, and data on other aquatic oniscids are presented in an Electronic Supplement...|$|E
