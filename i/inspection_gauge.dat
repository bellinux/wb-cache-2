40|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} (MFL) as an {{efficient}} method for pipeline flaw detection plays {{important role in}} pipeline safety. This nondestructive test technique assesses {{the health of the}} buried pipeline. The signal is gathered by an array of hall-effect sensors disposed at the magnetic neutral plane of a pair of permanent magnet in the pipeline <b>inspection</b> <b>gauge</b> (PIG) clinging to the inner surface of the pipe wall. The magnetic flux measured by the sensors reflects the health condition of the pipe. The signal is influenced by not only the condition of the pipe, but also by the lift-off value of the sensors and various properties of electronic component. The consistency of the position of the sensors is almost never satisfied and each sensor measures differently. In this paper, a new scheme of channel equalization is proposed for MFL signal in order to correct sensor misalignments, which eventually improves accuracy of defect characterization. The algorithm proposed in this paper is adaptive to the effects of error on the disposition of the sensor due to manufacturing imperfections and movements of the sensors. The algorithm is tested by data acquired from an experimental pipeline. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{bending strain}} of long {{distance}} {{oil and gas}} pipelines may lead to instability of the pipeline and failure of materials, which seriously deteriorates the transportation security of oil and gas. To locate {{the position of the}} bending strain for maintenance, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is usually adopted in a Pipeline <b>Inspection</b> <b>Gauge</b> (PIG). The attitude data of the IMU is usually acquired to calculate the bending strain in the pipe. However, because of the vibrations in the pipeline and other system noises, the resulting bending strain calculations may be incorrect. To improve the measurement precision, a method, based on wavelet neural network, was proposed. To test the proposed method experimentally, a PIG with the proposed method is used to detect a straight pipeline. It can be obtained that the proposed method has a better repeatability and convergence than the original method. Furthermore, the new method is more accurate than the original method and the accuracy of bending strain is raised by about 23 % compared to original method. This paper provides a novel method for precisely inspecting bending strain of long distance oil and gas pipelines and lays a foundation for improving the precision of inspection of bending strain of long distance oil and gas pipelines...|$|E

Commonly, the in-line inspection tool known as Pipeline <b>Inspection</b> <b>Gauge</b> (PIG) is applied to perform the corrosion inspection of the pipeline. This paper describes an ultrasonic instrumentation system for PIG to monitor internal corrosion of pipeline. The system consists of ultrasonic transceiver sensor, ultrasonic driving circuitry and data acquisition system. The hardware is equipped with a sensor carrier which is propelled along the test pipeline. The time of flight (TOF) of the ultrasonic wave is measured and was used to evaluate the internal corrosion of pipeline. An initial experimental instrument was set up to perform the distance measurement test at a frequency of 390 kHz, to simulate the changes of pipe wall thickness due to corrosion effect. Surface anomalies were created at different positions to simulate the changes of pipe wall thickness due to the corrosion effect. Variation in measured distances implied the existence of the surface anomalies. The results of the simulated surface anomalies showed that the percentage error was less than + 5 %. The large value of average DC voltage gave indication of distance increment due to the depth of the surface anomalies.

40|$|Pipeline <b>inspection</b> <b>gauges</b> (pigs) {{have been}} used for many years to perform various {{maintenance}} operations in oil and gas pipelines. Different pipeline parameters can be inspected during the pig journey. Although pigs use many sensors to detect the required pipeline parameters, matching these data with the corresponding pipeline location is considered a very important parameter. High-end, tactical-grade inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used in pigging applications to locate the detected problems of pipeline using other sensors, and to reconstruct the trajectories of the pig. These IMUs are accurate; however, their high cost and large sizes limit their use in small diameter pipelines (8 ″ or less). This paper describes a new methodology for the use of MEMS-based IMUs using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the pipeline junctions to increase the position parameters’ accuracy and to reduce the total RMS errors even during the unavailability of above ground markers (AGMs). The results of this new proposed method using a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) -based IMU revealed that the position RMS errors were reduced by approximately 85 % compared to the standard EKF solution. Therefore, this approach will enable the mapping of small diameter pipelines, which was not possible before...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the wavelet-based analysis of electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) signals for in-line inspection of flaws in a 30 -inch-diameter natural gas pipeline. The sensor {{is capable of}} detecting physical flaws (e. g., stress corrosion cracks, circumferential and axial flaws, and corrosion) in the walls of gas pipelines. Using an in-line non-contact EMAT transmitter–receiver pair, flaws can be detected in {{the walls of a}} pipe that the more commonly used magnetic flux leakage technology has problems detecting. One EMAT is used as a transmitter, exciting an ultrasonic impulse into the pipe wall, while the second EMAT, located a few inches away from the first, is used as a receiving transducer. Using the 58 -coefficient Symlet wavelet with 4 -level (scale) wavelet decomposition, the EMAT data were analyzed. The first-level detail was not used in any of the algorithms, but the other resulting wavelet levels were used in different combinations to calculate a vectorized feature set for comparing “flaw ” and “no-flaw ” signals. “Entropy, ” “energy,” and a “difference measure ” were the various attributes evaluated to differentiate the “flaw ” and “no-flaw ” signals. The results using this approach have shown promise for EMAT measurements obtained from a translating pipe <b>inspection</b> <b>gauge.</b> There are still issues that need further research: establishing the ability to differentiate flaw types and quantifying the sensitivity of the EMAT measurements...|$|E
40|$|Pipeline <b>inspection</b> <b>gauge</b> or {{known from}} its acronym as PIG was {{basically}} a tool or a device that was inserted into a pipeline {{with the purpose of}} cleaning or pipeline inspection. There were different types of pigs for different use in pipeline. The most basic form and most frequently used of pig is for cleaning purpose of pipeline. There are other types of pig that was known as smart pig. Smart pig can do more than just cleaning. They can inspect the physical condition of the pipe. The main objectives of this research are to study the flow of natural gas through different types of pigs of different worn out percentage ranging from 20 %, 15 % and 10 % from initial diameter and varied gas flow velocity from lowest to highest allowable to find the most effective types of pigs for cleaning purpose. Other than that the purpose of this research paper was to analyzed hydrates effect on natural gas flow in pipeline by studying the complex behavior of gas flow through pipeline (Velocity, Pressure, and Turbulent) using CFD modeling.

Most of the available studies are mechanical designs or have a commercial basis. Tveit and Aleksandersen (2000) introduced a PSI Smart Plug to isolate high pressure in pipelines and risers. Selden (2009) showed a successful application case of a PSI Smart Plug. The isolation tool is developed from a smart Pipeline <b>Inspection</b> <b>Gauge</b> (PIG) and in-pipe robot in engineering.

40|$|Several {{limitations}} and difficulties {{exist in the}} inspection and maintenance of underground pipelines that cannot use pigs (pipeline <b>inspection</b> <b>gauges).</b> Leaking is unavoidable in such bur-ied pipelines and poses serious problem to the environment {{as well as the}} pipeline owners. Pipe-line leakages are usually apparent either when the pressure is dropping for no other obvious rea-son or when valuable product is lost. However, even in the best-case scenario, where the opera-tors can isolate specific pipeline sections suspected to leak, it is often the case that the operators cannot reliably locate the exact position of the leak so as to take corrective measures. Acoustic emission (AE) is an excellent tool for detecting and locating leaks in buried pipelines. Access to the pipeline is required only locally for mounting AE sensors. Pipeline is pressurized and AE tested in 600 -to- 1000 -m-long sections at a time. The AE sensors detect the turbulent flow at the leak orifice, and with the use of digital AE systems and specialized software, the position of the leak is provided. The present paper deals with the technical description and the physics of the AE leak detection technique, presents the advantages, {{limitations and}} requirements of the method, describes the necessary functions of AE equipment for performing such a task, and, finally, re-ports on several case-studies of successful leak detection and location of buried pipelines.

40|$|Pipelines are {{valuable}} and essential components {{in oil and}} gas industry as means of transport. However, as corrosion attack cannot be avoided there is a high risk to have accidents due to the operating conditions. Wall thinning mainly caused as a result of corrosion can provoke fatal disasters, especially for gas pipes where the corrosion effects are superimposed by high-cycle fatigue loading due to the cyclic pumping of the compressor stations. For this reason in pipeline inspection {{it is not enough to}} know where defective areas are located, the defects should be sized as accurate as possible in order to evaluate the risk for failure by fracture mechanical approaches. Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) is a widely used technique by intelligent pigs (Pipeline <b>Inspection</b> <b>Gauges).</b> However, the accuracy of defect sizing is still questionable and needs optimization. Furthermore, a limited knowledge about the amount of operating parameters, i. e. mainly the inner pressure and its changes, temperature variations and the use of an inaccurate analytical model for sizing influence the risk for failure and do not allow the MFL technique to be more effective. In order to reconstruct the shape and dimensions of corrosion defects from MFL signals, it is helpful to use a 2 D approximation to save expensive computational costs of simulation in 3 D. In the here proposed work we demonstrate that 2 D simulation can be accurate enough to interpret MFL signals obtained from corrosion defects and subsequently allow the defect reconstruction. The selection of an ideal mesh resolution and the boundary conditions are two essential parameters to guarantee accurate numerical results. MFL signals are simulated in 3 D- and 2 D-approximations in a steel plate with three different half-spherical artificial defects.

Most-probable number (MPN) {{analysis showed that}} thiosulfate-reducing bacteria were the most numerous sulfidogenic microorganisms in pipeline <b>inspection</b> <b>gauge</b> (PIG) scrapings. Thiosulfate-reducing and methanogenic enrichments {{were obtained from the}} MPN cultures that were able to use yeast extract as the electron donor. Molecular analysis revealed that both enrichments harbored the same dominant bacterium, which belonged to the genus Anaerobaculum. The dominant archaeon in the methanogenic enrichment was affiliated with the genus Methanothermobacter. With yeast extract as the electron donor, the general corrosion rate by the thiosulfate-reducing enrichment (8. 43 ± 1. 40 milli-inch per year, abbreviated as mpy) was about 5. 5 times greater than the abiotic control (1. 49 ± 0. 15 mpy), while the comparable measures for the methanogenic culture were 2. 03 ± 0. 49 mpy and 0. 62 ± 0. 07 mpy, respectively. Total iron analysis in the cultures largely accounted for the mass loss of iron measured in the weight loss determinations. Profilometry analysis of polished steel coupons incubated {{in the presence of the}} thiosulfate-reducing enrichment revealed 59 pits over an area of 71. 16 mm 2, while only 6 pits were evident in the corresponding methanogenic incubations.

The {{provision}} of a reliable railway system is necessary since the railway {{system is a}} transportation mode that communities depend on for freight and passenger purposes. Cost-effective maintenance methods {{are one of the}} traits of a reliable railway system. One of the major causes of accidents in the US railroad system is derailment. Derailment is the incident where the train wheels leave the rails and wheel climb is one of the common wheel climb reasons. Turnouts notably are one of the track areas where a significant number of derailments occurs. ☐ This research focuses on the evaluation of newly developed <b>inspection</b> <b>gauges</b> to reduce derailments at turnouts. As part of the review of the evaluated gauges, IDEA S- 23 project, which is a Transportation Research Board project and a master thesis, was reviewed. Four gauges that were developed in this project are considered in this thesis. The four gauges are as follows: 1. Chipped point gauge 2. AAR 1 B wheel contact gauge 3. Severely worn wheel profile gauge 4. Gage-face wear angle gauge. ☐ In this study, a discussion of the causes of derailments in general and wheel climb specifically is presented. This study used a methodology that has been proposed by a previous study 1, where data taken from an Automated Switch Inspection Vehicle (ASIV) were utilized to overlay switch point profiles with wheels to determine critical points at turnouts. This method is used in this thesis to overlay the evaluated gauges with the switch point profile and then compare the results in terms of Lateral force (L) /Vertical force (V). ☐ As part of the evaluation, four gauges were {{selected on the basis of}} the results of IDEA S- 23 as grounds for the field validation process.

40|$|Pigs (pipeline <b>inspection</b> <b>gauges)</b> {{are free}} moving piston-like devices, {{that are used}} for {{inspecting}} or cleaning pipelines in for example {{the oil and gas}} industry. Here they are used for onshore and offshore pipelines, where they are propelled by the production fluids. A better control of the velocity of the pig in the pipeline can be achieved by using so-called bypass pigs, which have an opening (bypass) that allows that some fluid passes by which reduces the pig velocity. A new development is a by-pass pig with speed control, in which the bypass area is adjusted when the pig moves through the pipeline to obtain a constant preset pig velocity. The goal of this research was to accurately describe the forces on a pig, with special emphasis on the friction between the pig and the pipe wall. Such a wall friction model can be used in pipeline simulation tools, that are used to prepare a pigging operation. The friction force is divided into two parts: (1) the normal force that the pig imposes on the pipeline wall (F_wall), and (2) the coefficient of friction (?) which converts F_wall to a friction force. F_wall is calculated by a non-linear finite element model for a 12 " sealing disk for a range of oversizes. A uniaxial tensile lab test was performed to fit the material coefficients used in the non-linear Mooney-Rivlin material model. It was shown that the results could be matched by a linear elastic analytical model with a correction factor Cor = 1. 45. An experiment was designed to measure both ? and F_wall for a range of pig disk oversizes. These values were measured for sealing disks with different thicknesses and made of different materials. The models were able to accurately describe the experiment results. Due to lubrication the coefficient of friction can drop by orders of magnitude. Lubrication can be described by the Reynolds equation for the fluid pressure of thin fluid films. The material of a pig that makes contact with the pipeline wall is deformed by this fluid pressure which can be described by soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory. To couple the linear elastic material of the sealing disk to the non-linear Reynolds equation, two numerical approaches were followed. Firstly, the linear elastic contact was described by a row of closely spaced linear springs. Secondly a lubrication model was made in which the linear elastic contact was described by the boundary element method. It was shown that these models give a good qualitative description of the lubrication behaviour. The model validation is left for future work. In addition, pressure drop measurements were performed in a flow loop for a model of the bypass pig. These measurements were compared with correlations from the literature.

This paper reports {{the results of}} a statistical quality improvement programme when applied to a low volume, high gauge frequency machining process. The resultant capability indices (Cp and Cpk) are calculated from acquired data both before and after process modification, and are discussed in relation to the specific process. Box Cox data transformations are utilised in order to centralise data and the applicability of the capability improvements are determined. Historically SPC and capability analysis are performed on high volume processes with data being gathered on a sample basis. This investigation applies the high volume theory to a low volume 100 % data gathering process. The validity of capability analysis of this nature is discussed due to long cycle times and large <b>gauge</b> <b>inspection</b> frequenc...|$|R
