50|$|Common sorrel or <b>garden</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Rumex acetosa), often simply called sorrel, is a {{perennial}} herb {{in the family}} Polygonaceae. Other names for sorrel include spinach dock and narrow-leaved dock. It is a common plant in grassland habitats and is cultivated as a garden herb or salad vegetable (pot herb).|$|E

5000|$|Grüne Soße or Grüne Sosse is a {{specialty}} of the German state of Hesse. Centres of popularity are {{the cities of}} Frankfurt am Main (where it is sometimes called [...] "Grie Soß" [...] or [...] "Grie Soss") and Kassel, which lay claim to its origins. The Frankfurt-style is made exclusively from seven fresh herbs, namely parsley, chives, chervil, borage, <b>sorrel,</b> <b>garden</b> cress, and salad burnet together with sour cream, oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and added hard boiled eggs. (City of Frankfurt official page)Variants of other local areas, often due to seasonal availability, include dill, shallots, lovage, lemon balm, and even spinach. In more frugal times, daisy leaves, broad plantain leaves, and dandelion leaves were also used.|$|R
50|$|As {{a culinary}} herb, {{it is used}} mainly in salads. The flavour of French sorrel is {{slightly}} bitter or tangy, spiced {{with a hint of}} lemon; the sharp flavour is due to oxalic acid. French sorrel is hardy in most regions, tolerating frost, full sun and short dry spells. It grows quickly to a clump up to 1 m in diameter, with long leaves up to 10 cm in width. It is sometimes preferred for culinary uses to Rumex acetosa, <b>garden</b> <b>sorrel.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{market for}} {{dehydrated}} vegetables {{it is important}} for most countries worldwide. Many conventional thermal methods, including airflow, vacuum, and freeze-drying, result in the falling rate period of drying. Minimal processing of vegetables includes methods for preserving of products while minimizing changes of freshness characteristics. A digital microwave oven (Samsung M 9 G 45) and IR digital moisture balance model AD- 4714 at 185 W were used for drying of parsley, pig weed and <b>garden</b> <b>sorrel</b> at 2, 4 and 6 minutes. The vitamin C content in the fresh and dried samples was determined by 2. 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol method. Microbiological investigations were carried out by plate counting method. In infrared drying, for the <b>garden</b> <b>sorrel</b> leaves, the moisture content (in db) was highest with 71. 63 % after 2 minutes and with 54. 81 % after 6 minutes comparative with microwave drying. Ascorbic acid values gave the lowest results (7. 98 mg⋅ 100 - 1 ⋅g- 1 db, respectively 3. 01 mg⋅ 100 - 1 ⋅g- 1 db for infrared and microwave dried <b>garden</b> <b>sorrel)</b> after 6 minutes. For MW, the contamination reduction (4 log) was obtained in the case of pig weed after 6 minutes of drying. The results showed that {{in a short period of}} time the leaf’s can be dried in rapidly conditions...|$|E

40|$|As soil metal {{contamination}} {{is rapidly}} increasing worldwide, {{mainly because of}} human activities, phytomanagement of polluted land is becoming an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective option that can also produce biomass and energy as secondary utilities. Some Asteraceae and Polygonaceae species growing spontaneously as invasive weeds on natural and farmed land, which are considered medical or edible alimurgic species, have been identified to accumulate high above-ground levels of toxic elements, thanks to efficient root-to-shoot translocation. Most of them combine high adaptability to marginal soils with good shoot biomass, and many are metal indicator or hyperaccumulator species. In this study were investigated the shoot and root growth potential, metal uptake and translocation at the flowering stage of wild chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), common sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.), salsify (Tragopogon porrifolius L.), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Web.) and <b>garden</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Rumex acetosa L.) in artificially highly Cd-Co-Cu-Pb-Zn-contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|During {{past decades}} {{a lot of}} {{experimental}} studies shown that polyphenols have anti-carcinogenic properties have been published. Their antioxidant and tumour arresting effects have been demonstrated using both in vitro and in vivo studies many times. Aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the content of polyphenols in edible flowers of Ag yoncha, Wild chive, Meadow salsify and <b>Garden</b> <b>sorrel</b> and their effect on proliferation activity of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells which has not been studied yet. Anti-proliferative effect was evaluated in vitro using following concentrations of polyphenols 100, 75, 50 and 25 Ķg/ml. Also, phenolic composition was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography. The present results indicate that even low concentrations of edible flowers’ polyphenols inhibited cell proliferation significantly. This effect was observed at all studied edible flowers extracts and was independent on the compositions of individual polyphenols. Results indicate possible employment of studied edible flowers for prevention as well as for treatment of cancers...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of {{the lung}} {{function}} of horses with heaves by treatment with a botanical preparation for 14 days R. Anour, S. Leinker, R. van den Hoven The {{effects of an}} oral preparation containing a mixture of extracts from yellow gentian, <b>garden</b> <b>sorrel,</b> cowslip, verbena and common elder on the lung function of nine horses suffering from heaves were determined in a longitudinal crossover study. The horses were divided at random into a group of five (group 1) {{and a group of}} four (group 2). The horses in group 1 were each given 15 tablets of the preparation twice daily, while the horses in group 2 were left untreated. Fourteen days later, the horses in group 2 were given the same course of treatment while the horses in group 1 were left untreated. On being subjected to a histamine inhalation provocation test, five of eight horses tested appeared to be hyperresponsive to histamine. The treatment decreased the histamine sensitivity of three of them; it also caused a significant decrease in maximal intrapleural pressure difference of all the horses. The treatment had no significant effects on the clinical signs, the mucociliary activity or the cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the horses...|$|E
