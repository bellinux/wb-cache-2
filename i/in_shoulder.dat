5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result <b>in</b> <b>shoulder</b> girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{shoulder}} injuries to cricketers is a result of fielding. Overuse of the shoulder when throwing repeatedly during fielding in a cricket game can lead to problems such as tendinitis in the biceps, a tear of the supraspinatus tendon or even degenerative changes to the rotator cuff which could result in a surgery to fix the tear. Impingement, a syndrome that occurs when the rotator cuff muscles are inflamed or irritated, is a major injury risk that can develop amongst bowlers. A 2001–2002 study focused on identifying a workload threshold that would avoid an increased risk <b>in</b> <b>shoulder</b> injuries. The study found that bowlers who produced an average of 123–188 deliveries per week were less likely to face injury whereas bowlers who averaged below 123 deliveries or above 188 deliveries per week were at a greater risk of causing injury.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{initiated}} in 1996 to investigate N dynamics in a chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) -wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) versus a wheat-wheat rotation, as influenced by landscape position, in Saskatchewan, Canada. Symbiotic N 2 fixation, decomposition of crop residue, and the N and non-N effects of chickpea were investigated. Percentage of N {{derived from the}} atmosphere (%Ndfa) ranged from 29 to 97 % <b>in</b> <b>shoulders</b> and from 38 to 95 % in footslopes. According {{to an analysis of}} semivariance, only 28 % of the variance in %Ndfa, measured at 0. 3 m intervals, could be accounted for by spatial correlation. Wheat grown in the second year recovered 2. 2 % and 3. 3 % of the chickpea residue N, and 2. 1 % and 1. 7 % of the wheat residue N <b>in</b> <b>shoulders</b> and footslopes, respectively. Landscape position significantly influenced N recovery from chickpea residue but not wheat residue. <b>In</b> <b>shoulders,</b> approximately 35 % of the chickpea residue N was recovered in the soil microbial biomass (SMB), whereas 13 % and 30 % was recovered in light (LF) and heavy fraction soil organic matter (HF), respectively. In footslopes, approximately 11 % of the chickpea residue N was recovered in the SMB, whereas 29 % and 44 % was recovered in LF and HF, respectively. In contrast, approximately 13 %, 22 %, and 38 % of wheat residue N <b>in</b> <b>shoulders</b> was recovered <b>in</b> the SMB, LF and HF, respectively. Approximately 15 %, 25 %, 33 % of wheat residue N was recovered in the SMB, LF and HF, respectively, in footslopes. The influence of chickpea and wheat residue on the added N interaction (ANI) generally was low. The ANI of chickpea residue (1. 1 kg ha- 1 N) was higher than wheat residue (- 0. 8 kg ha- 1 N) in footslopes, whereas there was no detectable difference between chickpea (- 1. 2 kg ha- 1 N) and wheat residue (1. 3 kg ha- 1 N) <b>in</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The grain yield of wheat grown on chickpea stubble was 8 % greater than that of wheat grown on wheat stubble <b>in</b> <b>shoulders</b> and 43 % greater in footslopes.

25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} <b>in</b> <b>shoulder</b> movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E

It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and sedges. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{at least}} twelve {{distinct}} hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans, and also some debate as to when. Bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools. Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago. Nonetheless, the evolution of bipedalism was accompanied by significant evolutions in the spine including the forward movement in position of the foramen magnum, where the spinal cord leaves the cranium. Recent evidence regarding modern human sexual dimorphism (physical differences between male and female) in the lumbar spine has been seen in pre-modern primates such as Australopithecus africanus. [...] This dimorphism {{has been seen as}} an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during pregnancy, an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make. Adapting bipedalism would have required less shoulder stability, which allowed the shoulder and other limbs to become more independent of each other and adapt for specific suspensory behaviors. [...] In addition to the change <b>in</b> <b>shoulder</b> stability, changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility, which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward. The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still.|$|E
