5|$|Because of the ship's <b>high</b> <b>profile,</b> {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E

5|$|Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He {{was the son}} of an Anglican clergyman, {{intended}} for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting and vivid plots, as well as his <b>high</b> <b>profile</b> as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier {{served in}} the Falklands War, and the Balkans conflicts; on all {{occasions}} it mainly operated from aircraft carriers positioned within the conflict zone. Its usage in the Falklands War was its most <b>high</b> <b>profile</b> and important success, where {{it was the only}} fixed-wing fighter available to protect the British Task Force. The Sea Harriers shot down 20 enemy aircraft during the conflict with two lost to enemy ground fire.

Aircraft of (then) national airline Lufthansa or its Israeli counterpart El Al were identified as likely targets.

5|$|The {{historian}} John Hale {{considered the}} original castle {{to form a}} transitional design between older medieval English designs and the newer Italian styles of defence. The design of Deal, like its sister castles along the Downs, suffered from design problems: it needed too many guns to ever be fully equipped; its curved surfaces were vulnerable to attack; and despite attempts to keep the walls low and thick, its relatively <b>high</b> <b>profile,</b> driven by the requirement to support several tiers of defences, made it exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and <b>high</b> <b>profile</b> of the committees are the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members.

5|$|The screenplay's early drafts {{suggested}} a {{four and a}} half-hour film with a potential budget of $40 million – double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros.

Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put up the money for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The <b>high</b> <b>profile</b> of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 Long unsuccessfully {{challenged}} the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice {{announced his retirement}} the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a <b>high</b> <b>profile</b> despite his post's relative unimportance. He was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, {{despite a lack of}} support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.|$|E
