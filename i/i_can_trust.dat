6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Thanks! I don’t {{know what}} to do, Arthur, I don’t {{know what to}} do, and you are my only friend. But what a friend you are—the one friend <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> you absolutely, can’t I? ...|$|E
60|$|He. I suppose I {{ought to}} say that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> you. I've ample reason.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{surprised}} a secret," [...] she said, [...] "which I had confided {{to my sister}} Mrs. Ablewhite, and to my lawyer Mr. Bruff, and to no one else. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> in their discretion; and I am sure, when I tell you the circumstances, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> in yours. Have you any pressing engagement, Drusilla? or is your time your own this afternoon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you, Captain, but I've got so {{many things}} on hand to do afore they come home, I don't really think <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> I'll <b>trust</b> Mara to you any day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Misfortunes are {{the master}} of man, not man of his misfortunes, Metem," [...] said Aziel quietly, [...] "and in them is no true disgrace. Even if I had the means to kill myself, {{it would be a}} sin; moreover, it might bring another to her death. Therefore, I await my doom, {{whatever}} it may be, with such patience as <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> <b>trusting</b> that my sufferings and ignominy may expiate my crimes in the sight of Him whom I renounced. But how come you here, Metem?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can, at any rate, {{thank you}} for not dismissing me from your mind as a weak, {{emotional}} girl. No doubt I want sustaining. I am very ignorant. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be <b>trusted.</b> Indeed <b>I</b> can!" ...|$|R
60|$|You are too willing. I don't want volunteers. I {{doubt that}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> {{you any more}} than your sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank'ee, an' I'd foller yer advice, but I {{happens to}} know this land-shark. He's an old acquaintance, an' <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cyril," [...] she said, boldly {{calling him}} by his Christian name, because she could call him only as she always thought of him, [...] "I knew from the first you didn't do it. And just because I know you didn't, I know Guy didn't either, though {{everything}} looks now so very black against him. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> YOU, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> HIM. All through, I've never had a doubt one moment of either of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, I {{will trust}} you. If I trust you {{sufficiently}} {{to take you}} as my servant, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> surely <b>trust</b> you in a matter like this. Do you know of anyone who has a stout nag for sale?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it does, Mr. Playmore. When I am an older woman, I {{may be a}} wiser woman. In the meantime, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>trust</b> to your indulgence if I still blindly blunder on in my own way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After what I have said, {{it is for}} you {{to decide}} whether you think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be <b>trusted</b> with your secret, for I am sure it is for no slight reason that you have come to this accursed city." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to {{get down}} the river, yes. Perhaps I'll tell you more,--after I am certain <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> you," [...] added Baxter, significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, capting, I doesn't want one. Surely <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> ye, an' I've had {{my heart}} nigh broke with bits o' paper this good day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stover, supposing you and Dilberry {{go ahead}} and reconnoitre," [...] {{suggested}} the lieutenant. [...] "I know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> you {{to keep out of}} trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|She made {{a sign of}} acquiescence. [...] "You {{would if}} it were {{possible}} and I won't press you, but you know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be <b>trusted</b> if you need me. I was afraid of that woman; I felt she threatened you." ...|$|R
50|$|It dupes {{people without}} honour and {{can no longer}} rely on the trust of subordinates, without which command is impossible. For my side <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not <b>trust</b> any of my chiefs {{who have been working}} on falsehoods, I ask for my retirement.|$|R
6000|$|BROADBENT [suddenly betraying a {{condition}} of extreme sentimentality]. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>trust</b> myself {{to say how much}} I like it. The magic of this Irish scene, and--I really don't want to be personal, Miss Reilly; but the charm of your Irish voice-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, ay! Very good trade, I should think? You must send me your paper, Felix; I {{want one}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> {{to lie about}} the house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cure deafness!" [...] she exclaimed, {{with a faint}} laugh, [...] "nothin' {{will ever}} cure my deafness. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> you, dearie, so do what you please." ...|$|E
60|$|GREGORY. I implore {{you to run}} away. I believe <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> {{myself to}} let you go for your own sake. But it will break my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Miss Rose," [...] {{said the}} miller; [...] "you {{can give me}} your confidence. I do not {{question}} you, but <b>I</b> think you <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cartwright nodded. Barbara was not extravagant. [...] "Very well. <b>I</b> expect we <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> you, and {{the money}} is yours. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{probably}} arrange for a business house to meet your drafts. I'll see about it when I'm in the town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not like}} to deceive my friends," [...] replied the Tin Woodman; [...] "still, my kind heart urges me to save Eureka's life, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> usually <b>trust</b> my heart to do the right thing. So I will do as you say, friend Wizard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed?" [...] {{said the}} woman. [...] "And verily there is {{something}} in your voice <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust.</b> Ye speak prompt and readily, and like an honest man." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR HOWARD (pluming {{himself a}} little). Ah! that {{explains}} it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> my memory still, Mr. Rankin; though {{some people do}} complain that I am growing old.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe it. There's one as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> {{has told}} me he's hard up enough sometimes. Why, we've had twelve hundred {{in the last eight}} months." ...|$|E
60|$|BENNET. I am. With the {{assistance}} of your aunt and such other members of your family as <b>I</b> consider <b>can</b> be <b>trusted.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not to me? If {{the thing}} {{has to be}} done at once, of course you and I must trust each other. <b>I</b> suppose you <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> me?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have now}} {{informed}} {{you of all}} that I want to know. Whatever the information may be, it is most important that it shall be information which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> implicitly <b>trust.</b> Please address to me, when you write, under cover to the friend whose letter I inclose.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "I have liked your {{face from the}} moment you came on board, and feel that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> your word." ...|$|E
6000|$|If--ah, you listen!--I see <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> you; [...] Then, on {{your word}} as a gentleman--follow. [...] Under that {{sycamore}} stands the old cabin; [...] There sits his comrade.|$|E
60|$|LOUIS. Well, thats about all; {{except that}} you are to hang my {{pictures}} at the one-man show. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> your eye. You wont let anyone else touch them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> {{believe you}} <b>can</b> <b>trust</b> your feelings. Gomez can't {{be a nice}} man if all one hears is true. But what turned you against him--the dash of dark blood?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I make no reservations," [...] she said, mournfully. [...] "How could I? I {{found myself}} out {{and came back}} to [...] ." [...] her eyes flashed scornfully for an instant [...] ". [...] . to what--to what you propose. You see [...] . <b>I</b> [...] . <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be <b>trusted</b> [...] . now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} wishful to ask thy advice. But why should not I tell thee {{outright}} that which troubles me? I am not used, {{at least for}} these many years, to dissemble. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> but <b>trust</b> thee in all; and lean on thy man's mercy to understand, and to aid me!' ...|$|R
